This film delivers on the promise that director Robert Rodriguez suggested in previous endeavors.  Though assisted by Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino I was trying to spot the efforts from these contributors, particularly Tarantino, but was hard pressed.  If this was a case where the stunning visuals surpassed the story then this film would be easy to dismiss but that's not the case here.  The story here is primary and the three connecting vignettes flow smoothly.  The acting here is also not overwhelmed by the visuals.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke both give their best performances in years and Clive Owen's star continues to rise.  The women here  offer strong performances here in particularly Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino.  The real find here is newcomer Devon Aoki as the lethal Meho.  This film may not be to everybody's taste but it cannot be faulted for lack of originality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>i love Sin City. its now one of my favorite movies, its true what people are saying it is the next Pulp Fiction. the story like Pulp fiction has three storys that very briefly interlock. the first story is about Marv, a thug who awakes to find the hooker Goldie whom he slept with is dead. taking justice into his own hands he finds out her killer is a canibalistic maniac named Kevin. the second is about Dwight who after defending a bartender from a crooked man named Jackie boy follows him to Old Town, a red light distrivt area. after a grave misunderstanding he kills Jackie boy and finds out he's a cop and now the truce of Old Town is gone. now Dwight must get rid of the body and its evidence. the final story is about Hartigen who in the begining of the story saves a girl name Nancy Callihan from a raving raper named Junior. finding iut its the senators son he is sent to jail and charged for all of his sons crimes. Nancy thanks him and writes under an alias but after eight years the letters stop and he fears she was found. confessing to everything he tracks down and finds she is now a stripper at a club and realizes...he was set up. now he must protect Nancy from the same lunatic who tried to kill her. i recomand this to any one because it is a great movie, great cast, and is set in the great times of black and white.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed watching Sin City. It is just like the Graphic Novels came to life. The special effects are wonderful.<br /><br />This movie surely stands out in the crowd. No other movie that I can think of has looked this way.<br /><br />The movie is made for the comic book crowd, and stays true to form.<br /><br />Some of the blood and guts got to me alittle, and I had to shut my eyes. But still a good flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>To understand and appreciate this movie you'll need a little background information.  First of all, it's not one story, but a combination of three stories from the graphic novels of the same name, with a short clip from another story as an introduction.<br /><br />The introductory skit, starring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, is from "The Customer is Always Right", the others being "The Hard Goodbye," "The Big Fat Kill" and "That Yellow Bastard".<br /><br />Shot in a way that is as close to the original comics as possible, the movie is in black and white, except for certain highlighted objects in the frames that are vividly colored in stark contrast.  Without significant amounts of nudity, it earns its rating because of the violence which is central to the plots, and boy, does that white blood flow and fly.<br /><br />The movie smells of Tarantino, but he only directs one small, and of course totally weird, bit, the majority being done by Robert Rodriguez, and Frank Miller, author of the novels.<br /><br />Each segment is illuminated by star power such as Jessica Alba (Nancy), Rosario Dawson (great as Gail), Benicio Del Toro (outstanding as Jackie Boy), Michael Clark Duncan (Manute), Carla Gugino (Lucille), Rutger Hauer (Cardinal Roark), Jaime King (Goldie/Wendy), Michael Madsen (brilliant as Bob), Brittany Murphy (Shellie), Clive Owen (Dwight), Mickey Rourke (brilliant as Marv), Elijah Wood (creepy as Kevin) and not forgetting Bruce Willis (Hartigan), in one of his best performances ever.  I also liked Devon Aoki as "Miho" whose role brought back memories of Kill Bill and the Crazy 88.<br /><br />Without knowing the source, the movie would be a bit confusing, as characters can be seen appearing in all three stories, and after a while, some of the female stars start looking alike.  There's nothing light about this movie, and it may not be for everybody, but the action keeps coming and the blood keeps pumping, and it's hard to look away.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 24, 2005</p></br><a href="../users/A1KD8NJPZ01R37.html">A1KD8NJPZ01R37</a><br/><p>It's not for everyone. Different, and those over 50 would probably think you were nuts for watching such a weird movie. But's it's not to be missed by anyone who appreciates a good and strange flick.<br /><br />Almost entirely CGI, it's actually beautiful and extremely well crafted. It's like one of those movies that looks like a cartoon, but with real actors. I can't get over the detail given to certain scenes. Someone really loved it into a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQI2CW6UKF1ES.html">AQI2CW6UKF1ES</a><br/><p>I never ever read of or herd of Sin City, until I saw the comercial.  My friend tho', he wouldn't stop whinning about how much this movie was gonna suck because the men who directed Once upon a time in mexico, and Kill Bill were gonna screw it up, and that Frank Miller was nuts even considering to work with them.  But when the movie shut him up, he wouldn't shut up about, you gotta see this movie.  So I checked it out.<br /><br />Hartigan(Bruce Willis), a man sworn to protect the law, and a little girl, Marv(Mickey Rourke), a man who want's the one responsible for his only true love, and Dwight(Clive Owen)a man who has a reason for going to Old Town, are all the 3 main focuses on Sin City.  When things go wrong for the situations that happened for these 3 guys, they a;ways have that matality to prove that they're still worth a d@mn, but will it be enough to get them out of the situations they are deeply into?<br /><br />I love the movie's feel for bringing the comic book to life.  I only saw pages of the comic on the movie, but it just feels so much like a comic book.  I mean, this is nearly true comic brought to life.  The black and white CGI fast paced cartoon feel is definitly a upside to this film.  It also contains comic humor, like Jackie Boy's(Benicio Del Toro) slow yet utterly rediculas death, when Marv dragged a guy on the street by his car while driving, and Miho(Devon Aoki) throwing a shrukien that looks like something that will upset a certain group of people.  And the cool dialouge is also another factor that makes it stylish, and my personal favorite cones from Marv:"The hell I send him too must seem like heaven after I'm through with him."<br /><br />Sin City is definitly a comic book brought to life.  My whining friend instantly fell in love with it.  He ownes all covers, and s trying to grab every poster made.  Me, I'm just glad I got the oppertunity to see such a fine crime-drama action comic style movie like this, and have enough money at the time to buy it.  I like this more than Spider-Man 2, The Crow, but it's hard to choose between this and Batman Begins.  But anyone interested in the Crime/Drama action or Frank Miller's Graphic Novels should definitly check this out.  Whenever Sin City 2 comes out, I'll definitly be anticipating it.<br /><br />Peace</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>This is one of the best comic book inspired films released to date.No doubt,film making is changed forever.The entire film was done via green screen photography filmed on a sound stage with partial/limited sets and props,everything was digital added later.Unlike other films that try so hard with special effects that actually destroy their integrity,the ways and means that it is done in this format only enhances it.Next to its technical atributes,the film was done without a script,or a screenplay.Everything was taken directly from the graphic novels which not only served as the script and screen play,but all the storyboarding as well.<br /><br /> Now that I am done praising all the technical things,the film itself was way cool.Dark,gritty,interesting characters all intertwined in one way or another with the main story.I dare not give away any of it.For those of you who did not see this movie on the big screen,you are in for a real treat.I need not mention the very sexy and beautiful Jessica Alba.Not only does she sport the looks and attitude,but the girl can act as well.Not your typical damsel in distres that screams at the top of her lungs thoughout the entire film.My other favorites of course were Mickey Rourke(who you can barely recognize) as the man on a mission Marv,but don't forget Pretty Boy played by the excellent actor Benicio Del Toro.This film is an awsome site not only does it hit all the senses of looks,texture,gritty interesting characters,but you can almost smell&taste it as well.This film ROCKS!.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's "Sin City" graphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co-director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard-boiled, crime-infested world of Basin City and its cynical inhabitants.  It takes a visual cue from last year's "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" by green-screening the backdrops and using digitally-produced images as the landscape, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and white "Schindler's List"). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as "Special Guest Director" though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis' "Death Becomes Her" (which coincidentally also starred Bruce Willis).<br /><br />The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esque Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's "9 1/2 Weeks", Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall,  a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona)  and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character. The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career before "Traffic". Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch.<br /><br />Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer. All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over its two-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow.  But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I became a fan of Frank Miller's work the day I opened the pages of "The Dark Knight Returns."  Miller took the comic world by storm with his writing style.  His characters narrated panels instead of using thought bubbles. They were old, tired adults, not perky superheroes.  In Miller's hands, Batman became a weary war veteran desperately looking for a way to end his career without killing himself, Commissioner Gordon worried about his wife, and bad guys were Neo-Nazi naked monstrosities, all teeth and fangs.  It was a turning point for comics, transforming them into entertainment for adults, and the medium has never looked back since.  It was a turning point for my own writing as well; my stories from that point on took on a completely different feel, all inspired by Miller.<br /><br />Sin City is what happens when Miller is free to do what he wants.  He's a film noir fan at heart and Sin City is every bit an anachronistic blend of comic book action and pulpy dialogue. Fan of film noir will find all the iconic characters in Sin City: the weary integrity of a private eye, the pathos of a gangster past his prime, the desperation of a man wrongly accused of murder, the rage of a psychopath, and of course the femme fatale.<br /><br />Film noir is also about narration.  We hear the characters' thoughts and understand just how desperate and lonely they are.  By knowing our protagonists' minds, we can appreciate their paranoia and hopelessness.  And in film noir, the world is out to get everybody.  There are no good guys; indeed, often the authority figures that would be considered "good" (police officers, priests) are evil and the people deemed least ethical (prostitutes, murderers) are the heroes. Ultimately, whatever innocence any of the characters has is lost.  Sin City (short for Basin City, the very bottom of civilization) covers the entire spectrum.<br /><br />Sin City is actually three mini-movies combined, all taking place at approximately the same time.  The plots are from the graphic novels: The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, and The Big Fat Kill, with the short story threads The Customer is Always Right and Babe Wore Red thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The first and last scenes of the movie perfectly capture the tone of film noir: a beautiful girl and a mysterious dark-haired man meet somewhere.  We don't know the circumstances that brought them together but can feel the tension between them.  They act like lovers even though they've only just met.  But it can only end in blood.<br /><br />In The Hard Goodbye thread, Marv (Mickey Rourke), a giant monster of a man sleeps with the woman of his dreams, Goldie (Jaime King).  He awakens only to find her dead.  Marv's not good for much, but he's good at killing, so he gets revenge the only way he knows how: by punching people until they squeal. Eventually, Marv discovers a serial killer who has a taste for ladies of the night.  When the two finally meet, we learn that Marv can be just as depraved when he's out for revenge.<br /><br />No, seriously, it's probably one of the grossest things I've seen in movies in awhile.<br /><br />In The Big Fat Kill, Dwight (Clive Owen) is the new boyfriend of strip club waitress Shelley (Brittany Murphy).  Unfortunately, Shelley has an old boyfriend named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro), a bad guy who likes to beat up women.  Dwight is determined to stop Jackie Boy from killing anyone else, only to trail him to Dwight's own ex-girlfriend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Towne Girls.  The Old Towne Girls are prostitutes who run their own part of town.  There are no pimps, no dirty cops, and no mob.  Indeed, their part of town almost seems like some kind of nirvana for ladies of the night.  And of course, they all dress in extremely kinky outfits when they're not brandishing katanas, wicked-looking knives, throwing stars shaped like swastikas, or Uzis.  But Jackie Boy isn't who he seems and it's up to Dwight, Gail, and Miho (Devon Aoki) to keep a head (yes, I said HEAD) safe before a turf war explodes onto the streets.<br /><br />In That Yellow Bastard, another serial rapist (Rourk Jr., played by Nick Stahl) and son of a senator (Powers Boothe) is the one remaining loose end that good cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) can't put behind him.  On his last day of retirement, Hartigan decides to go after the untouchable Rourk Jr. and save Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), only to end up in prison for eight years for a crime he didn't commit.  We catch up with Hartigan later in the movie when he gets out of prison and discovers that the more things change, the more they remain the same.<br /><br />Except for Nancy, who in eight years grows up to be a major hottie, an attribute not unnoticed by poor, tortured Hartigan.<br /><br />There are too many villains to list here, but they are all memorable even in their few moments of screen time.  Three notable examples are the hilarious muttering of a lackey with an arrow sticking out of his chest, the elucidating thug who pronounces his every thought out loud Chandler Bing-style, and the hired mercenary who moved from bullets to explosives because, "you just can't go back to shooting people when you've seen a pub blow up and all the parts fly out."<br /><br />By staying true to the original characters, the director (Robert Rodriguez) creates an entirely new film genre.  It makes better use of digital effects first showcased in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, and yet never forgets its comic roots.  The action pedigree is most evident in Marv, an unstoppable juggernaut who smashes through doors, bounces off of speeding cars, and rips people apart with his bare hands...a few bandages and pills later and he's fine.  Good guys and bad guys alike get shot so full of lead that they should be pencils, only to recover in the next scene. The men are all really nasty lugs and the women are all gorgeous and toned.<br /><br />The movie is filmed in all black and white, with splashes of color for good measure.  This achieves two amazing effects: it nails the feel of film noir and draws the viewer's eyes to important things about characters that might otherwise be missed.  For example, Dwight wears red sneakers, symbolic of having at least one foot dipped in blood from his murderous past.  The use of color, especially Yellow Bastard's...well, yellowishness, makes the character all the more disgusting. Color, when it appears, is as much a character as any actor on screen.<br /><br />The actors are suitably restrained.  If Sin City has a flaw, it's that it's too true to its roots at times, which might alienate modern audiences. Some of the characters have eye-rolling dialogue, but then, that's part of the mood of Sin City.  It's not meant to be realistic or even hip.  Sin City is true to itself, and it's up to the audience if they want to go along for the ride.<br /><br />This is the same kind of uncompromising vision that Peter Jackson brought to the screen with Lord of the Rings.  By deeply respecting the original creator's work, he shattered the preconceived notions of what a movie should be and conjures something we've never seen before.  I was skeptical about a comic book, even Miller's books, being turned into a new format, but Rodriguez did it and he did it with style.<br /><br />Sin City is dark, violent, and even sadistic at times. But most importantly, it has Frodo (Elijah Wood) as a hopping cannibal.  After seeing this film, I will never think of him as a cuddly little hobbit again.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>I found this a very difficult movie to rate. I wanted so badly to give it a five because of the movie itself, but I also wanted to give the Unrated edition a three for the package, as it is very disappointing. So, I settled on a solid four. Here's why.<br /><br />Firstly, Sin City as a movie alone was excellent. It was innovative and almost as good as my absolute favorite movie Pulp Fiction, and this I believe is because the two are so much alike. Sin City doesn't even try to explain itself. The characters ramble on in moments of deep thought, revealing what makes them tick. It's filled to the brim with Arnold-esque one-liners. The surreal style of this film makes all the characters seem like super heroes of sorts (not strange, considering Frank Miller, the god of American comics, created this series). In fact, everything that happens in this movie would make other movies bad. Who wants to listen to the thoughts of a character, something that's usually left in books? Yet in Sin City it words. Who still likes Arnold one-liners, what with all those Arnold impressions going on anymore? Obviously, Frank Miller, and so do his fans. Who wants surrealism in their movies? Anyone who likes super hero movies, which record tells a lot of people. All this comes together to make Sin City the all-time greatest comic-book movie.<br /><br />Now, for the Sin City Uncut edition, the only true bonus here is the graphic novel, which I have yet to read myself (review coming later). It gives you the chance to see just how innovative the movie Sin City is, and how true the directors wanted to keep the movie to the book. After that, there is little to keep my interest. Some of the special features found here should have been included in the first edition of Sin City, which I foolishly wasted my money on not knowing this edition was coming. Plus, unless you watch both versions of the movie back to back, you'll never be able to tell which scenes were added. The breakdown of stories so that you can watch them singularly doesn't add anything. It's jarring, actually, since it breaks the rhythm the original version followed.<br /><br />In the end, I can't recommend this movie to anyone who has the original version. If you don't have that version, however, pick this up quick. It is still a superior version, only not by much.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Once my husband and I purchased this movie, I didn't know what to expect. All I knew about it that it was unique, due to all the hype. I have to admit that it was pretty good no lie. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. This trio made a gritty masterpiece of this underground comic book hit! They have perfected stylist zed violence; they have sniggered and winked and done the secret handshake about guns, and knives, and beating each other to a pulp, and rape, and how all of this adds up to some masculine heroic ideal.<br /><br /> I mean if you've seen the trailers in the past you knew that something new and excitingly was coming. And once you've seen the movie, it is amazingly hard to get the film noir images out of your head. The cast list is incredible: from Josh Hartnett in the opening sequence to Bruce Willis's exposition of the back story, to Mickey Rourke as "Marv", then to the smoking hot Clive Owen as "Dwight", this is a man's movie. Testosterone and adolescent male fantasies drive this convoluted tale of urban corruption. In fact, experiencing this movie is a bit like being inside the adolescent male mind in a dream-like state.<br /><br />I'm naturally bothered by the obvious male fantasy that all women (in the movie, of course) are hookers or strippers, all at least half-naked or wearing thongs and fishnet stockings. "All women", except for an eleven-year old girl-- almost a rape victim--, who grows up to be Jessica Alba the stripper. Most are victims, and even Rosario Dawson, playing strong-- even dominatrix, has to wait for Clive Owen to show up to rescue her. This is one movie that makes me almost thankful for "political correctness" outside the theater. Beside that visually and cinematographically the movie is genius you must own this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>...oh, DID SHE EVER. Truer words have never been spoken. It should be illegal to have curves like that. Someday I will make Jessica Alba mine. Ok, I had to get that off my chest.<br /><br />I'll first say that I have never read a "Sin City" book. I've certainly heard of it, but it has never appealed to me (no disrespect to any long-time fans). But I heard enough about this movie to become interested, especially because of the visuals. After seeing it yesterday, I can safely say that one does NOT have to be familiar with the books in order to like this film. I found myself fascinated throughout the whole movie by the excellent visuals, as I was when watching "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" although it has to be said that "Sky Captain" was mainly for the kiddies in terms of the level of violence, whereas "Sin City" is a far cry from being kid-friendly.<br /><br />Which brings me to the violence in this film. Yes, it is brutal and graphic. However, there are two things which keep the violence level below the in-your-face, sick-to-your-stomach level that it was in movies like "Kill Bill." For one, virtually all of "Sin City" is in black & white. So the blood isn't realistic-looking. In fact it looks like white CGI in most scenes. Even the most graphically violent scenes such as the quadruple amputation and the beheadings have a certain "cartoonish" look to them, which of course is the entire point of this movie. And the second reason why the violence isn't so shocking is because a lot of it is pure tongue-in-cheek. When you have people basically act as if nothing has happened after their hand gets sliced off or after an arrow goes through their torso, you know it isn't supposed to be taken seriously. But again, that's all part of the fun of "Sin City."<br /><br />In terms of acting, I have no complaints. And I certainly have no complaints about the female eye-candy either, especially Rosario Dawson and (you guessed it) Jessica Alba. Although all women are either hookers and/or strippers, they're capable of kicking serious a$$ and using their blades to the serious misfortune of anyone who crosses them.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun with this movie and would recommend it with no reservations. In terms of visuals alone, it is pure brilliance. It is stylish, well-paced, well-directed, and as cliche as it sounds, just plain *cool*. Don't wait for DVD-see this movie on the BIG SCREEN.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>There comes a time when a review of the movie will have no impact on whether or not a person will see the movie in the theatre, or even buy a DVD of the movie. I think Sin City is one of these movies because in general, Sin City is a "love it" or "hate it" movie for critics and fans alike. Strangely, I was in the middle when I saw Sin City in the theatre. I was impressed with the visual style, and I liked the look of the movie, the sound of the movie, the hard bitten over the top language and action of Sin City. I admired what the director, Robert Rodriguez did in bringing Frank Miller's graphic novels to life. But I didn't love the movie. Since that time I've read the graphic novels and I've now watched this special edition extended recut DVD of Sin City and I've changed my mind somewhat. I'm even more impressed and I like the movie a whole lot more.<br /><br />The question is why. I think the first and biggest reason is how this DVD is presented. It offers up the theatrical version of the film, which I feel is essential in any DVD edition which gives us an extended or director's cut. Let us compare. Robert Rodriguez does. The second disc of this set includes the extended and recut edition of the movie, but it's not like your typical extended edition. Since Sin City is based on several Frank Miller books and tells four different stories that slightly overlap, the recut version of the film is now four short films each with its own title card and each one has to be selected separately on the menu. I love it. This works far better for me because we get short films that are self contained and tell a complete story and I don't have to sit through two hours of film just to watch the 40 minute Marv segment "A Hard Goodbye". Even after watching the theatrical version, I'm not sure where the twenty minutes of extended footage came from. It's probably just 15 seconds here and 30 seconds there and not big new scenes. I can completely skip the short Josh Hartnett section if I want. This is the way I want to watch the film.<br /><br />Besides this recut version of the film, there are also some quality bonus features included on the DVD. First up is Robert Rodriguez's "15 Minute Flic School". In this featurette director Rodriguez talks about how he decided to make Sin City after looking through his graphic novels and saw that shooting the film would both be possible and a challenge. He talks about specific ways that he was able to save money in the making of the movie as well as how few of the major actors were actually on set at the same time, even if they have scenes together. This is a very interesting look in how this man makes his movies. Next up is the "All Green Version" of Sin City. This is the Green Screen version of the movie and Rodriguez introduces it, saying that he sped the film up 300 times or so in order that we can watch the entire movie in 10 to 15 minutes, but it gives us the chance to see how little the actors had to work with and how much work went into getting what we see on screen to actually be there. This is a neat feature and it is remarkable how good of a job the actors did with so little on set. We also get to see "The Long Shot" where we see an on set take with some background footage where Rodriguez and guest director Quentin Tarantino just let the cameras roll for 15 to 20 minutes and keep the scene going. We see some of what Tarantino says to the actors, what actually made it into the movie, and how the actors work and figure out how to play a scene. This is another great feature.<br /><br />Another feature is the Sin City concert.  This is actually just a one song clip from Bruce Willis and his band The Accelerators doing a performance for the cast and crew of Sin City as well as Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly which was filming nearby.  Surprisingly enough, Willis is quite good as is his band.  Good stuff here.  The last feature on disc two is a 10 minute cooking lesson from director Robert Rodriguez.  Here we see Rodriguez explain how to make his homemade breakfast tacos.  It looks good and I understand that he does this on his other DVDs as well.<br /><br />The first disc of this set is the theatrical version of the film with other special features.  Besides the commentary track, the other features are the obligatory "the cars of Sin City", "the props of Sin City" and other related informative but not nearly as interesting as the disc two features.  Two that are interesting are the story of how Rodriguez convinced Frank Miller to let him do the film and Quentin Tarantino as guest director for a scene in the movie.  The rest are fairly stock features.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent set that really is worth owning if you are at all a fan of Sin City.  This set does the movie and the books proud.<br /><br />And...did I mention that this set includes a copy of Frank Miller's "A Hard Goodbye", the Marv story in Sin City?</p></br><a href="../users/A7P9LPMSBAAME.html">A7P9LPMSBAAME</a><br/><p>Robert Rodriquez did a brilliant job with this movie and cast. Mixing comic book with real life. Incredible visually. Very impressive. I thought the Mickey Rourke character was so well done by both Rodriquez and  Rourke. I liked it completely. For me, this movie is about cinematic art. But don't be confused, this is not an art movie by as means. ADULT COMIC BOOK. The back story on production and history of original comics is great.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>The people that came up with the idea to make this movie the way it was made are geniuses. Playing with colour, shadow, etc. Totally cool and brings out the awesomeness of the movie, scenes, actors, actions, etc. Bluray is so freaking clear, I finally know what black really looks like.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This film is one of the best translations of a comic book, with great attention paid to the atmospherics, that I have ever seen.  From the moment it starts, the viewer is treated to a succession of characters and their bizarre adventures, which appear disjointed and non-sensical, but vivid with unbelievable violence, sudden death, and what are revealed to be intriguing clues to a bigger picture that is never completely explained.  It is filmed for the most part in black and white, a wonderful evocation of film noir and gotham, with occasional colors thrown in for unusual characters like the yellow man, or simply for splurting blood.<br /><br />The acting is truly excellent, starting with Willis, who once again proves capable of delivering a quirky, funny character for whom you can suspend your disbelief.  He is a sick cop, trying to do some good one last time, leading to an awful adventure.  His ward, a lovely young girl who grows into  Jessica Alba, is a pawn in a larger game that is unclear.  Then there is Micky Rourke, an extremely ugly thug who is out for revenge and crazy but also, the viewer suspects, perhaps redeemable even if he tortures some victims to death.<br /><br />Recommended.  I will definitely watch this again.  There are many nuances and clues that will come together only with multiple viewings, a bigger picture that will emerge through interpretation.  That is far better fun than a single-watch passtime film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>An all-star cast in one of the best films ever made. You have to be high to not like this film. It has 3 or four stories that are not hard to follow at all. The action is hardcore and the ladies of Old Town are capital H-O-T. One thing I love is the black and white of the film and how only certain things are in color. Like a red dress, golden hair, blue eyes, and so forth. Just certain features of people and places are in color, which is really cool. Sin City is one of those films that will never get boring or forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>"Sin city" is one of these films you will never be able to forget due among other things, its original style with smart blinks respect the Noir genre but told, spattered and hovered by those dark, bizarre and tragic atmosphere where no one is safe about nothing and where in every step you take, may lead you to the same entrails of the hell.<br /><br />Based on the famous entries of Robert Miller, the movie turns around two well defined stories intermingled, where the revenge and the implacable thirst of justice works out not as mere legal practice but a natural necessity in order to re-establish some sinister state of things to its place of origin.<br /><br />The first story tells about the horrible kidnapping of Nancy, by a bunch leaded by the sadistic son of a Senator and a sinister web of corruption around it. A cop resists and walks around this nasty marsh and does what the thinks he's right. But a dark complot awaits for him and after eight years in prison he will have to make justice by his own . The other mixed story collides with Nancy in the bar, where Marty tries desperately to seek the murder of Goldie the only woman who loved him although his ugliness (Mickey Rourke is in top form with this underground character who reminds to Johnny the handsome).<br /><br />The third story is about the last frontier, habited by women who live and survive from harassments, abuses, rapes and unthinkable touches of evil.<br /><br />The film is told, through voices in off, another honoured tribute to the Noir genre. There are emblematic scenes, filled of artistic violence in the middle of the endless night.<br /><br />From its immediate release, it became a cult movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>As a teenager I was very fond of comics, later my passion declined but I still pick up some classics as Harold Foster's "Prince Valiant", Hugo Pratt's "Corto Maltes" or the Argentinean Hector Oesterheld "El Eternauta" and enjoy them. So I'm not immune to this kind of products.<br /><br />One thing must be pointed out straightly: "Sin City" it is a violent and dreadful film only apt to be seen by adult audiences.  I suspend ethical judgment and take it as it is: a dark fantasy full of sadomasochist imagery, with all the id monsters running free.<br /><br />I was truly amazed by this movie: it is a Pulp Comic Book thrown UNCHANGED to the screen. There are perfect details: the glasses of the psycho Kevin always shining, the white blood, the silhouettes all black or white, the nude & gorgeous girls, the unbelievable gore, the amazing prowess of Marv & Hartigan, the one-dimensional ethical code of some characters and the list is goes on and on.<br /><br />IMO this is not an adaptation of a comic it IS the comic expressed with another language!<br /><br />The story is a transcription of three Frank Miller's graphic books: "The Hard Goodbye", "The Big Fat Kill" and "The Yellow Bastard" that are loosely related having The City as a common graphic and moody background.<br /><br />The "heroes" are as brutal, bloodthirsty and revengeful as the "bad guys" with the possible exception of Hartigan (nearer to be a Dirty Harry). Nevertheless deep inside them there is a spark of goodness and nobility that make some distinction possible.<br /><br />The dames are a special condiment: almost all of them (un)dressed in sexy exotic lingerie; showing different styles are not less ruthless and dangerous than men.<br /><br />The whole cast seems to enjoy their own performances giving a "plus" hardly seen lately. It is most notably in Mickey Rourke impersonation of Marv. Bruce Willis, Benicio del Toro and Clive Owen are top. Rutger Hauer gives almost a cameo as the Cardinal. Elijah Wood as the cannibalistic psycho is creepy beyond believe.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is very sensual as the teen-striper; Devon Aoki is a wordless icon with her shining sword, Jaime King is Marv's goddess duplicated and a long list continues.<br /><br />I give this product big thumb up! Remember: only for adult audience.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Frank Miller's "Sin City" is a bleak, foreboding cartoonish group of interlocking vignettes depicting the criminal element of corrupt Basin City.  The flick is stylishly filmed in predominantly black and white with occasional splashes of color to enhance the characters festooned against impressive computer generated backgrounds.  The influence of Quentin Tarantino, a guest director of the movie, is seen here, as the plot format is reminiscent of "Pulp Fiction".<br /><br />Pulp drama veteran Bruce Willis plays angina suffering cop Martigan who on the verge of retirement is compelled to rescue a kidnapped young girl from the clutches of Nick Stahl a psychotic rapist and killer.  The trouble is that Stahl is the son of corrupt Senator Roark, Powers Boothe and therefore protected.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke, whose style fits like a glove in ultra violent movies, plays career criminal, the seemingly indestructible Marv.<br />He seeks to avenge the murder of a gorgeous hooker Goldie played by the attractive Jaime King.  Goldie was the only gal to ever pay the fierce looking Rourke, made up with facial and mandibular prostheses, any attention.  He goes on a killing spree that includes Elijah Wood, the cannibalistic murderer of his precious Goldie.<br /><br />Clive Owen and Benicio del Toro star in another of the seemingly relentlessly violent stories.  Owen plays Dwight, the avenging angel of the gorgeous prostitutes of Oldtown.  The automatic weapon toting prostitutes represented by Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, and Alexis Bledel among others are allowed to govern their turf in a deal forged with the cops.  This truce is threatened when dirty cop del Toro and his boys make trouble in Oldtown and wind up getting dispatched.  Owen helps the ladies quash the evidence that could topple the delicate balance that exists.<br /><br />Miller's slick transformation of his graphic novels to the screen using an impressive and formidible cast created a graphic yet highly entertaining movie experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>"Sin City" is a piece of art work. There are no other films of which I'm aware that have taken the comic book (or graphic novel) format to the screen with such ingenuity and aplomb as Robert Rodriguez has done with Sin City.<br /><br />The acting is superb and the action gripping, flowing and beautiful.<br /><br />The story surrounds three different groups of inhabitants of "Sin City". We follow a police man (Bruce Willis) in his quest to catch a child molester/killer (Nich Stahl); a parolee (Mickey Rourke) who is set up for having killed a prostitute(Jame King); a group of prostitutes who run a section of Sin City and are headed by Rosario Dawson. The stories all come together, but not in tight neat little bundles as you many be used to. The outcome of this film noir is not necessarily a happy one.<br /><br />The graphic novel was drawn in black and white with limited usage of color. Rodriguez does the same here. It is absolutely one of the things that makes this film not only unique but gripping.<br /><br />This is an action film that warrants several viewings simply because you are going to be so caught up in how cool the film looks that you'll lose track of the plot.<br /><br />Check this one out.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>This is an outstanding film - one of the best in a so-so year for movies.<br /><br />But I totally agree with a reviewer below - "staged releases" of DVDs in standard, and then later, "deluxe" editions is a blatant attempt to milk the property for every drop of revenue that can be had.<br /><br />Oh, well.  The only thing we DVD consumers who love the special features can do it either wait and not take the bait, or take a complete pass.

I've always been a fan of Rodriguez, if only because of his sheer originality; though a buddy of Tarantino, he can still maintain his individuality and integrity. One reviewer didn't like the voice over; if he'd watched the best of 40's film noir, he'd he'd realize that they all had voice over, and for a reason: Precision. I was totally blown away with the originality of the whole thing; appropriate black & white photography, with splashes of color that intrigue. I agree with the guy who said this DVD is lacking in extras; no doubt. This project must have been so complex, I'm very interested to hear more about background stuff. The acting is excellent throughout. I particularly was impressed with Mickey Rourke, as well as Brittany Murphy. Benicio del Toro played his somewhat carricature part as if nothing could be more fun. This film is indeed a wild roller coaster of a ride, not unlike "Pulp Fiction", but a little more clever and even poetic. I thought the script was wonderful. This is indeed a sort of "parallel universe" kind of ride, and I was continuously entertained.Rodriguez' originality has strengthened my admiration of his talent. Watching this was so much fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Sin City' directed by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller is truly a fantasy cartoon for grown-up men. As this particular release of the film to DVD has virtually no extras, I can devote all my space to considering the movie.<br /><br />As a major fan of some both violent and avant-garde movies such as `Zardoz', `La Femme Nikita', `Kill Bill', and `Straw Dogs', my biggest problem with this movie is reconciling the violence with the art of the film. I suspect this issue is as old as the Greek playwrights and their philosophical critics. The most recent issue on this stage was the controversy over Mel Gibson's `The Passion of the Christ'.<br /><br />I think the issue can be stated as a question on the extent to which visceral reaction to illegal violence, sex, sadism, or whatever can outweigh the negative reaction to this social pathology or actually enhance the artistic experience, as the right amount of salt improves the taste of virtually all food.<br /><br />For starters, I believe there are great masses of viewers who will simply be so repulsed by what they consider inappropriate violence. To them, I give a gentle lecture on the Bill of Rights and a copy of the DVD `Hitch' or `The Wedding Date' as an alternative.<br /><br />The landmark movie for establishing the correct aesthetic for violence in film is `Bonnie and Clyde'. Many argued, correctly I believe, when the movie was first released that the more graphic violence and bloodshed enhanced the movie experience not by being titillating, but by revealing the horror of both the gangsters' actions and their demise. This argument has been successfully played out in hundreds of movies, not the least of which was the recent `Saving Private Ryan'.<br /><br />I believe the problem of relating this argument to `Sin City' is confounded by the comic book fantasy style of this film. It is really hard to make any case for the film as an examination of a gangster's impotence or an American army captain's dedication to duty in war when the main characters are plainly cut from a fantastical cloth. No one short of Rasputin survives strangulation on top of gunshot wounds on top of severe angina and lives to the last reel. The other side of the coin may be that the argument that the aesthetic of `Sin City' is classic 1940's film noir taken to its logical conclusion. This may be seen as `The Maltese Falcon' or `The Long Goodbye' as done by Rodriguez and Tarantino, with the part of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett taken by Frank Miller.<br /><br />All this is a rationalization to the fact that the pathological and unrealistic violence in this movie can put off even people who may be disposed to like this kind of movie. Basically, my sense of implausibility of the events in this film outweighed my sense of guilty pleasure from all the violence. `Kill Bill' may have taken me to the brink of that abyss. `Sin City' may have gone that one step too far.<br /><br />But what then explains the good reviews garnered by this film. Does `two thumbs way up' tell me I'm taking on just a little too much old age prudery and that maybe I have to recalibrate my aesthetic sensibilities?<br /><br />I will say that the cinematic artistry in the production of the movie is excellent. All the effects are done to a level which far exceeds that other recent blue screen epic, `Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' (aside from having a much better story as well). The only annoyance in the graphic artistry was where in most scenes, blood was seen as a bright red in this black and white world, while in one scene with one victim, all blood was white, not red. Very confusing!<br /><br />Another triumph was from the casting director. With Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer and Mickey Rourke and Benicio DelToro, we are just missing Harvey Keitel and Gary Oldman to complete our rogue's gallery of seriously dark heroes and heavies. The appearance of former (`Lord of the Rings') hobbit lead Elijah Wood is a masterstroke of casting against type. I can just imagine Wood's jumping at the chance to play this role.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the sly little graphic Easter eggs such as the makes of the various automobiles, including, I believe, a Chevy Corvair, 1957 Chevy station wagon and the great finned 1959 Cadillac. Also, while the location of `Sin City', named `Basin City' is vague, there is a clear reference to Interstate 287 that runs through some of the most darkly fabled minor cities of New Jersey such as Perth Amboy.<br /><br />The movie is based on three largely unconnected episodes with one of the three serving as a bookend to the other two, opening the movie briefly, to be picked up after running through the other two stories. It is hard to tell where Tarantino's contribution may have come in. My first guess would be as the director of the Bruce Willis bookending story, but I suspect it is more likely he directed and choreographed the scenes in which the female ninja character does her stuff.<br /><br />It is hard to evaluate the acting. There is no question that the male leads, Willis, Rourke, and Clive Owen carry their weight and that the heavies are suitably heavy, but the thin dialogue and the fantastic biology and physics seen in many scenes prevents us from really becoming fully engaged with the characters.<br /><br />The bottom line on this movie is certainly to check your critical baggage at the door and simply fasten your seat belts for an unalloyed thrill ride.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>Walk down the right back alley and you can find anything in Sin City, the tagline of Frank Miller's entertaining B&W/Color action packed triumph. One of the most violent movies I've ever, but a breathtaking amazing experience, I saw it in the theater and I've never seen any movie like it before. It was very different. A thrilling and electrifying story of detectives, hookers, crooks and others in a dark city who get a dose of their medicine. An allstar cast including Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Benico Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and Mickey Rourke. If like action and good comic book story telling, then this one of the best ever made. It's like a dark Dick Tracy. experience the adreline rush and the excitement of this must see and own comic book triumph.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Sin City has all of it: a good story, excellent cast (a cast of who's who) and the best part is the cinematography. Not since Dick Tracy 15 years ago has a comic book looked so good on the big screen. The colors of the comics comes alive in Rodrigues's movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>This is easily the most stylish film to come out since "The Matrix."  The look of the movie uses the same experimental technique I first saw in a Francis Ford Coppola film called "Rumble Fish" where the entire movie is shot in black and white with certain parts of each scene colorized for stark contrast.  This idea was later polished and brought to the mainstream in the film "Pleasantville."  Since this film is based on a Noirish comic book the mixture of extreme black and white lighting with the colorful highlights makes for a fine visual experience.  As for the cast, most of the actors turn in good performances; the most notable being those of Mickey Rourke and a remarkable cameleon-like transformation from Benicio Del Toro.  The female characters are primarily two-dimensional buxom babes with little depth of emotion, but this film is based on a comic book for young men, after all.  There are a couple of forgettable performances given by Clive Owen and Michael Madsen.  Clive Owen's work here is wooden, and Michael Madsen is plain petrified and uninspired.  I kept having the feeling that Michael Madsen joined the project in the hopes of snaring Mickey Rourke's role, and when he didn't get it, severe apathy set in.  He was great in "Resevoir Dogs," but this is by far and away the worst performance in any of his films that I've seen.  The storyline is another "Pulp Fiction"-like yarn with disjointed narrative that jumps back and forth between three violent and seemingly separate stories that cross paths at the end of the film.  The almost constant voice-over narration can be a burden on the generic movie-goer who wants more traditional film-fare, but it fits the style of this film perfectly.  There are some tedious moments, especially since this movie clocks in at over two hours, but the final result is an exciting experience with plenty to rave about and praise.  This film is destined for the Cult Classic section at your local video store.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. "Sin City" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes "Sin City," the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />"Sin City" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />"Sin City" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow," this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike "Sky Captain," it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three "Sin City" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />"Sin City" is not quite a "Kill Bill" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. "Sin City" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />"Sin City" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. Outstanding.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I've never read the Frank Miller novels, but from what I've heard, the film version of "Sin City" is a great adaptation of the comic books. Speaking as someone who isn't familiar with the comics, I thoroughly enjoyed "Sin City" and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in an "alternative moviegoing experience."<br /><br />"Sin City" is actually made up of three different stories. In the first one, Bruce Willis plays a nearly-retired cop who puts his life and career on the line to save a young girl from a child molestor. The second story follows Marv (Mickey Rourke) as he tries to track down the people responsible for the death of a hooker who winds up in his bed. Finally, Clive Owen plays a man who tries to protect his new girlfriend from an abusive ex (Benicio Del Toro) and accidently threatens the balance of power between the police, the mob, and the girls who work the streets in Old Town.<br /><br />The film is shot almost entirely in black and white with little glimmers of color here and there (deep red lipstick, a woman's piercing blue eyes). Almost all of the backgrounds are digitally generated, which gives everything a true comic book/film noir quality. Some people might be turned off by the intense violence that is present in all three stories, but it's my understanding that the graphic novels are exactly the same way, so fans of the "Sin City" series will probably be pleased. I enjoyed the unique filmmaking techniques coupled with entertaining stories and fabulous performances by a large and incredibly talented cast.<br /><br />See this film in the theatre if you can...even thought it's a gritty, violent movie, it's absolutely beautiful to watch. (I also got a real kick out of seeing Elijah Wood play a ninja-style serial killer/cannibal...a far cry from his Frodo Baggins days!)</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Frank Miller's Sin City" is a world where the heroes can take a whole series of punches as well as deliver them, where justice has nothing to do with either mercy or the cops, and the system is crooked from top down to pretty near the bottom of the barrel. The dames are still worth dying for and some of them might even be angels or goddesses, but others can defend themselves quite well without anyone's help.  Still, this is a world where protecting women is hard-wired into the psyches of guys like John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke), and Dwight (Clive Owen). If you fail to protect a dame, then somebody has to pay and in a way that will make the scum bucket think Hell is heaven when you finally let them go straight to there. This movie is rated R for "sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue," but that is most assuredly an R that is a whole lot closer to NC-17 than it is to PG-13.<br /><br />I am not particularly happy that when I bought "Frank Miller's Sin City" on DVD as soon as it came out that it was the stripped down version and that a few months later, in time for Christmas no less, we finally get the "Recut, Extended, Unrated" DVD set.  But studios are making money off of this double-dipping and if I could hold off for years on "Titanic" I should have been able to do the same thing with this one, so shame on me.  But the good news is that (a) I did not have to pay for the upgrade and (b) the difference between the two DVDs, without the discount, is only ten bucks and you will more than get your money's worth here because to ease our collective pain Robert Rodriguez made sure that this 2-disc set goes the extra mile.  That is clear as soon as you open up the box and discover it includes a mini-version of Frank Miller's "The Hard Goodbye" (my "mini" I mean the book is slightly larger than the size of a paperback novel).  This is a good choice not only because it is the first "Sin City" graphic novel, but also because it is about Marv and as Marv Mickey Rourke steals this movie from Bruce Willis and the rest.  So already you have account for a good chuck of the extra ten dollars you are spending and then we get to the super-loaded two DVDs.<br /><br />Disc 1 contains the original theatrical release (uncut, unextended, rated).  Your other "Sin City" DVD is made superfluous because this has three commentary tracks: co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller talking primarily about working with the actors; Rodriguez and special guest director Quentin Tarantino (eventually) talking more about the technical aspects of the film; and an audio track of the reaction of an audience in Austin to a screening of the film.  The featurettes cover how Frank Miller was convinced to make the film, getting Tarantino to play with shooting a film digitally, and then separate looks at the cars, props, special effects and costumes of the film.  There is then a "Sin-Chroni-City" interactive game that looks at how the three novels that make up the first "Sin City" movie cross each other, and the teaser and theatrical trailers.  The two directors having a conversation while screening the film is the best of the extras on this disc, simply because I like the stories of the production a bit more than the details on how the film was made, but both are excellent commentary tracks.<br /><br />Disc 2 offers the recut and extended theatrical release and it is not the deleted scenes being worked back in for the "extended" part that matters here but rather the "recut" part.  That is because Rodriguez has recut the movie into the three graphic novels, "The Hard Goodbye," "The Big Fat Kill," and "That Yellow Bastard," along with the short story "The Customer Is Always Right" from "Babe Wore Red" and the epilogue Rodriguez and Miller came up with for the end of the film.  With the movie broken up this way it is even easier for you to watch a "chapter" with Miller's graphic novel in front of you to see the extent to which they actually did shoot the book on this film.  Of course the special features on this disc include new installments of Rodriguez's 15-Minute Film School and 10-Minute Cooking School (breakfast tacos).  There is also a performance by Bruce Willis with a band at the "'Sin City' Live" cast and crew party at Antones filmed by Rodriguez with the digital camera.  For cinema buffs the two treats are the movie in high-speed green screen, so you can see how they actually shot everything (tip of the hat to Rodriguez for protecting his cast on the brief nudity in this version), and a 14-minute uninterrupted take from Tarantino's segment (Dwight and Jackie Boy in the car on the way to the tar pits) that allows a great look at how actors and directors work when shooting digitally.<br /><br />I already thought "Frank Miller's Sin City" was a five-star movie that not only sets the standard for what film noir will be in the 21st century but also advances the cause of digital filmmaker.  That it brings Miller's characters and story to life while remaining faithful to his artistic style is a bonus for those whose introduction to "Sin City" was the graphic novels, but that was what Miller and wanted and what Rodriguez delivered with his little test run.  If you held out on getting this movie on DVD until the special features version was available it was well worth your wait, and if you have been duped into giving the studio even more of your money for this upgrade you will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that Rodriguez delivered for you as well.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>Very different approach to familiar material.

It needed to be in black and white to show the ruggedness of the film and it really couldn't have been done any other way. Like instead of blood being red it was white and for some reason it looked cooler. The story is self-explanatory the name says it all but the twists in it are exciting and take the movie from good to great to amazing. It's a very violent and raw movie and you come to love it for that. Basically if you're looking for a movie that has a deep story and is in every way different than any other movie out then you need to see Sin City</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>While it's probably a total cliche to say it by now, Sin City really is a wild thrill ride of a movie, and quite possibly the most entertaining thing that will hit theaters all year.  Adapted by director Robert Rodriguez from Frank Miller's graphic-novel series, it's an energetic slab of neo-noir, complete with twisted characters, ambiguous morality, and deadly serious dialogue.  For those who thought the Kill Bill movies weren't bizarre or violent enough, Sin City ought to seem like a stylish, action-packed gift from guy-movie heaven.  It's filled with negativity, outrageously over the-top bloodletting, and some of the blackest humor known to man, but it all works anyway.  I even managed to forgive the incessant voice-over narration, normally a rather lazy device, because it's so oddly poignant and poetic.  It's not really that big a deal anyway, because this movie is so impressive visually that the characters could speak in gibberish and I'd probably still be moved to give it at least three stars.<br /><br />It should be noted right off the bat that Sin City is not a movie for everyone, but if you're the type who would like it you presumably know who you are.  IF you like crime movies, especially those filled with action and atmosphere, you will almost certainly get a kick out of Sin City.  If you prefer lighter, more "socially redeeming" fare, you may still like it, or you may be overcome with bile filling your throat for most of its two-hour running time.  It's all a matter of how willing you are to accept what's going on without asking too many nagging questions like "How exactly did Mickey Rourke just take out ten armed riot cops with nothing more than his fists and a hatchet?" or "is it really possible or even necessary to manually tear off a man's scrotum?".  Everything about this movie is utterly outsized, from the themes to the characters to the action, but in the end it's a rousing success at what it intends to do, which is entertain.  It's precisely because this movie was so utterly entertaining that I found myself unwilling to nitpick; you'll probably be too busy having your senses assaulted to linger on any problems you may have with the movie.  Nothing is more key in movies (or TV, or novels for that matter) than getting the viewer to suspend disbelief, to simply let go and enjoy what's transpiring regardless of the plausibility level.  Some of my favorite movies are wildly unrealistic, but at some point when watching them I just decided to go with it.  Sin City is one such movie: I realized early on that the events unfolding onscreen bore little to no resemblance to reality as presently constituted; I just didn't care.  I went to see this movie with my wife (who is, to put it mildly, not a fan of dark or violent movies), and she may have summed up the experience of watching it the best when she said simply "I was never bored."  That, ultimately, is the secret to Sin City's success: it's so gripping to watch that it's hard to care about anything else.<br /><br />As everyone (and probably their brothers) knows by now, Sin City was filmed using real actors against a black-and-white CGI background with some touches of color added for dramatic effect.  It may seem like a gimmick at first, but Sin City is all about bringing the viewer into a sort of parallel universe, so this unconventional device works perfectly.  Sin City is a movie dealing with lives on the edge, and it conjures up a delightfully dark, grimy, and gritty atmosphere to go match the depravity of its subject matter.  Weighty themes and over-the-top violence abound here, and it's only fitting that the movie's look and feel should be so uniformly haunting.  Consisting of three tangentially related stories occurring out of sequence, Sin City brings the viewer into an underworld populated by thieves, murderers, hookers, and dirty cops, and the morality is viewed entirely in shades of grey.  In the Basin City of the movie, where the good guys are bad and the bad guys are even worse, violence is often a virtue, or at the very least a prerequisite for survival.  If there's one redeeming value to Sin City's cartoonish ultraviolence, it's that it's painfully clear that its recipients generally deserve it.<br /><br />Anyway, if there's one theme running through all of these stories, it's that of redemption.  The protagonist in each tale (Bruce Willis's Hartigan, Rourke's Marv, and Clive Owen's Dwight) is a most unlikely hero (although Hartigan is just a regular cop and therefore not exactly bad, whereas it's clear that Marv and Dwight are murderers), but each finds himself driven to acts of extreme courage and sacrifice in order to see justice done.  Sin City portrays a kind of heroism not typically seen in movies (especially big-budget, sanitized Hollywood productions), one that comes from doing the right thing even when it's nowhere near being the easiest thing.  Rourke's Marv is probably the most memorable character, a hulking thug with a highly overdeveloped sense of vengeance who managed to arouse some of my sympathy even as he cut a swath of unimaginable destruction through his enemies on his way to avenging a murdered prostitute.  Out of the legions of other figures in the movie, the great Benicio Del Toro deserves some special mention as a comically malevolent crooked cop who won't shut up even after he meets his unfortunate end.<br /><br />Now, although I've gone on too long already, I'd feel remiss if I didn't talk about Sin City's staggering violence quotient.  Yes, this an extremely graphic movie, and much of the violence is downright disturbing to watch (Elijah Wood's character being cut up and fed to a wolf is a prominent example, even if much of the violence in that case was implied), but it's just as true that context is an important factor when considering just how offensive such bloodletting is.  Now, for one thing, Sin City is meant to be a piece of escapist cinema, so nothing that takes place onscreen should be taken too seriously anyway.  After all, no one got offended during the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail when King Arthur cut off the Black Knight's arms and legs; that scene was meant to be funny and it was.  Perhaps more to the point, the violence here is so ludicrously over the top from the opening scene that it's hard to imagine any rational person getting too upset.  You have to just go with it; if you're the kind of person who makes it a point to be huffy and offended all the time you shouldn't be seeing this movie anyway.  'Nuff said</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>With any luck Frank Miller's "Sin City" will inspire a new genre of filmmaking - a literal union between filmmaking and the world of comic books/graphic novels.  I know, I know, there have been countless films inspired by the world of comic books which have attempted to recreate the chills and thrills.  Not one of them - even the best (e,g,, Spiderman series, Tales from the Crypt, etc.) has been remotely as successful as the creative team that gives us this brilliant, jarring, vision.<br /><br />Rodriguez, Miller and company obviously put themselves (and the cast) through painstaking paces to assure every frame, every emotion emoted by an astonishing array of live talent is instilled with the gritty, graphic hyperrealism of the world of Frank Miller.  It is a breathtaking achievement which, alas, will go unnoticed and be underappreciated by many who don't "get" this world.<br /><br />The cast is nothing short of remarkable:  Mickey Rourke gives his finest performance since Barfly - maybe ever.  Bruce Willis has never given a better performance than the retiring cop, Hartigan.  Everyone involved is obviously relishing having the time of their lives.  Outside of Shakespeare I can't imagine anything currently more theatrically over-the-top and satisfying than being associated with Sin City.<br /><br />For many the violence will be of too gory and graphic in nature (gorygraphic?).  Others will enjoy the rough ride but also be appreciative of the often stunning beauty of so many of this film's images.  The final tale in the trilogy of stories that make up the movie is shot with the cool and chill of winter bathed in a snow storm of such exquisite beauty that I don't find it difficult to say it is among the most beautiful images I've seen in any film.  Ever.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I had been waiting to see this movie for months now, and I was afraid that it would disappoint me like some other movies that I have really looked forward to lately (namely The Phantom Menace and Matrix: Reloaded).  So myself and three friends went to see it earlier, and when it ended, I thought one thing: WOW!  This was such an amazing movie, with amazing visual effects, a perfect cast, and tons and tons of testosterone-induced action.<br /><br />WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez co-directs (along with Sin City creator Frank Miller, and with Quentin Tarantino as a "Special Guest Director") what is, without a doubt, the most faithful comic book adaptation ever.  In fact, Rodriguez sees this film as a translation rather than an adaptation.<br /><br />There really isn't a central plot; rather, the movie is about 3 seperate stories that share certain characters and all take place in Basin City, the most morally bankrupt town ever, which rightfully earns the nickname Sin City.  To call this an all-star cast would be an understatement.  Some of the many actors included in this film are: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benecio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Britanny Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Jamie King, Marley Shelton, and Rosario Dawson (yeah, I know that's a lot), and while some of them have very small roles (Wood and Aoki have no dialogue, although neither of them have a small part), all of them are pitch-perfect in their roles.<br /><br />The movie begins with a short segment entitled "The Customer is Always Right", with Harnett as The Salesman and Shelton as The Customer.  Up next, is the set-up for "That Yellow Bastard", a story about Jim Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a bad heart who is trying to bust the son (Stahl) of a powerful Senator (Boothe) who likes to rape little girls.  Next is "A Hard Goodbye", a tale about a huge brute named Marv (Rourke) who falls hard for a beauty named Goldie (King).  They share a passionate night together, but Marv awakes to find Goldie dead in their bed.  A search for "justice" ensues, with Marv beating the life out of anyone who has information on the hit.  The story also has Gugino as Lucille, Marv's parole officer, Wood as Kevin, an amazingly gifted killer, Hauer as Cardinal Roarke (the brother of the Senator from "Yellow Bastard"), and Sin City creator Frank Miller as a priest.  The second story is called "The Big Fat Kill".  It deals with Dwight (Owen), an ex-photographer (this isn't explained in the film, but there is a graphic novel that sets up the Dwight character prior to the events of this story) and now a sort of mercenary who goes to Olde Towne to help defend Gail (Dawson) and her fellow prostitutes from Jackie Boy (del Toro), a deranged maniac with a penchant for violence against women.  This segment also has Murphy as Dwight's girlfriend Shellie, Bledel and Aoki as fellow hookers Becky and Miho (deadly little Miho), and Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, a hired goon for an unnamed mobster.  Finally, "That Yellow Bastard" is the last major story.  It picks up after the events of the previous part of the segment.  Hartigan has been sent to prison, because Senator Roarke spun things to make it appear as if he raped little Nancy (played by Alba in her adult incarnation).  Believing Nancy to be caught by Roarke's men, Hartigan gets out and seeks her out to protect her again from people who want revenge upon him for killing (?) Roarke's son.<br /><br />These stories are extremely gritty, violent, and even a little depressing.  (SPOILER)The only one with an ending that could be considered happy is "The Big Fat Kill".  There are scenes involving shootings, stabbings, decapitation (or almost so), even cannibalism.  One guy even gets his genitals ripped off.  Also, there is a lot of full frontal nudity (although, from what I understand, nowhere near as much as there was in the books).  So if you feel in any way uncomfortable with any of the above-mentioned things, avoid this movie.  If not, then I highly suggest seeing this film.<br /><br />As I said, the choice of actors for this film was perfect.  I can hardly think of anyone else who could fill the roles of any characters in this movie.  Although, I must say that Willis, Wood, Aoki, Dawson, and Rourke were the big standouts in my mind (even though, as I stated earlier, Wood and Aoki have no dialogue).  Speaking of dialogue, under any other circumstances, the dialogue in this film would be terrible.  However, the actors and situations make it awesome.  Even though many lines are extremely cliched, and I hate cliches, the delivery is amazing.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning.  The film is shot almost completely in black and white.  Although, every now and then, there are splashes of color (certain cars, Dwight's shoes, women's eyes and hair, one of the villains).  Also, many of the shots mirror the panels from the comics.<br /><br />With all that going for this movie, it all adds up to a great 2-hour thrill ride.  Once again, if you don't mind excessive violence, I would highly suggest seeing this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Frank Miller's "SIN CITY" graphic novels released back in 1991 and 1992 wowed readers when it first was released from Dark Horse Comics.  The stories were collected in trade paperbacks with seven graphic novel that revolve around the people of Basin City aka "Sin City".  Known for it's use of primary colors of black, white and red, the graphic novel would win many fans over for its dark and violent tone but storytelling crafted by Frank Miller known for his awesome work on the "Batman" and "Daredevil: The Man Without Fear" comic books.<br /><br />In 2005, Robert Rodriguez, a fan of the graphic novels wanted to make a film based on "SIN CITY" but if only Frank Miller jumped on aboard.  After seeing test footage by Frank Miller, it was enough to entice the creator to become co-director of the film and in the end, earned over $158 million worldwide in theater receipts.<br /><br />In 2005, two DVD versions were released and now, a special 2-disc Blu-ray version which includes the original theatrical and the "recut, extended, unrated" version is set for an April 21, 2009 and all I can say is that this release blows away the DVD versions and easily among the top 10, if not, the top 5 Blu-ray's produced thus far.<br /><br />So, does "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" achieve perfection on Blu-ray?  Read on.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Frank Miller's SIN CITY" is a film that is shot entirely digital via green screen.  The digital recreations of Sin City just look dark, grimy but in a technical sense, quite magnificent in capturing Frank Miller's dark and corrupted city with its blacks, whites and reds.<br /><br />The video which is presented in 1080p (with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1) is just absolutely beautiful as you can see skin pores to absolute detail on the talent but what is more impressive is how digital and realism comes together in harmony.  What was more shocking (which you learn from the special features), in certain scenes which you thought talent were acting with other talent, they weren't.  Footage of an actor may have been shot eight months ago and then the character that is interacting with another character is shot much later and all work done in post-production.<br /><br />A perfect example is in "That Yellow Bastard (Part 2)" in which Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis) are interacting but in reality, the two individual scenes were shot months from each other.  It's just amazing how everything seems so fluid.<br /><br />The picture quality is just magnificent.  It's one thing to watch this on DVD and say how beautiful the film looks but when you watch it and see it on High Definition, it just blows away the picture quality of the DVD.  Granted, this film doesn't have as many colors as top tier Blu-ray films such as "Transformers" or even "Quantum of Solace" but using the dark grays and blacks with the whites and reds, this film looks great.<br /><br />As for audio, again this Blu-ray release meets perfection.  The English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48kHz/24-bit) is just incredible.  From the action scenes to the engines of the cars, you literally feel the noise around you.  And at the end with Alba and Willis's character, nice touch of the low level bass as your subwoofer just beats.  The audio is just great to listen to and the clarity of the dialogue, music and special effects were well done.<br /><br />If you think the theatrical and even the unrated, recut edition sound good, there is also an audio track to listen to a live recording of the audience at the Texas premiere which sounds great too (I can only hope more Blu-ray releases include that feature).<br /><br />Overall, "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" achieves perfection for picture and audio quality.  Just magnificent!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />With Audio and Video reaching perfection, this Blu-ray release does not slouch in special features at all.  You are definitely getting your money's worth with so many features included.  Features such as:<br /><br />DISC 1: Disc One (Theatrical Cut) Features: This disc gives you five different reasons to re-watch the original theatrical version of the film and all are worth it!<br /><br />  * All new Cine-Explore - Innovative Blu-ray technology allows viewers to experience a uniquely interactive visual commentary that pushes the envelope. When selected, see picture-in-picture green screen footage and original art synced with the filmmakers' commentary.  This is optional and a nice touch.<br />  * 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller - The commentary between Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is pretty cool. Miller has lived "SIN CITY", he knows the ins and outs to the city and its characters, so it was great to have this commentary with both men.  But mostly for Miller's perspective and knowledge.  Very cool commentary.<br />  * 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino - Tarentino shot the burial/driving scene for "The BIG FAT KILL", so he's pretty much in and out for the commentary.  Most of the commentary is Robert Rodriguez.  Where the first commentary, it was Miller driven, this one is Rodriguez driven and when the the time comes, you hear Tarentino chime in.  But it's an interesting commentary as Tarantino doesn't like shooting in digital but because it's a Frank Miller film based on a popular Frank Miller story, he gave it a chance and enjoyed the experience.<br />  * 5.1 Audio Track Featuring a Recording of the Austin Audience Reaction - Definitely a fun addition as you watch the film with the actual audience track with people cheering, laughing and just reactions during the entire film.  Sounds great and really gave me another reason to watch the film again and enjoy it.  Great addition to this release!<br /><br />DISC TWO:  This disc includes the "Unrated, Recut Extended Version" which has 23 extra minutes and the bulk of the special features.<br /><br />  * All new "Kill `em Good" Interactive Comic Book - Dive into a visually stunning interactive game that puts you in the driver's seat. Exploiting the Blu-ray format in ways never before seen, you finish the story - with guns blazing!  For a game, I was quite impressed by the audio quality.  Very well done game and using the graphic novels and artwork for an interactive comic book.  Very nice addition to this Blu-ray release!<br />  * Four Chapters: The unrated, recut version are viewed as separate films.  There are no chapter stops, so you can watch these separate chapters with new, additional footage.<br /><br />o Chapter One- That Yellow Bastard<br /><br />o Chapter Two- The Customer Is Always Right<br /><br />o Chapter Three- The Hard Goodbye<br /><br />o Chapter Four- The Big Fat Kill<br /><br />  * Rodriguez Special Features:<br /><br />o 15-Minute Film School - (15 min.) Robert Rodriguez is known for his past DVD releases of teaching the filmmaker of tips of how he accomplished scenes on a budget.  This time around, Rodriguez uses "SIN CITY" to show how things are done via green screen but how he did certain things to stay within budget of the film.<br /><br />o All Green Screen Version - (12:33) This is the entire film sped up in 800% but a good way to see how everything was shot via green screen.<br />o The Long Take - (14:42) This scene shows how Quentin Tarentino shot the driving scene between Dwight (Clive Owen) and Jackie Boy (Benicio del Toro).  Very interesting how this take is long and these guys are just sitting in the car for long periods of time. Interesting perspective on filmmaking with these two talented individuals.<br />o Sin City: Live in Concert- (7:15) During a break in Texas, Bruce Willis & The Accelerators perform for charity and cast of "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" and "Scanner Darkly" hook up and enjoy the performance.<br />o 10-Minute Cooking School - (6:21) Director Robert Rodriguez is often working late in the early morning and when he gets the munchies, he loves his breakfast tacos.  So, he shows you how to make them.<br /><br />* How It Went Down: Convincing Frank Miller To Make The Film - (5:40) What it took for Robert Rodriguez to convince Frank Miller to make "SIN CITY" to a movie.  Interviews with both men.<br />* Special Guest Director: Quentin Tarantino - (7:19) Interviews with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.  How Rodriguez was able to convince Tarantino to direct a spot.<br />* A Hard Top With A Decent Engine: The Cars of Sin City - (7:34) Interviews with Cecil D. Evans (Transportation Coordinator) of finding the vehicles from the graphic novels for the film.  Miller owns hundreds of die cast vehicles and used those as reference for his graphic novels.  Thus, Evans would go throughout Texas and asking owners to borrow cars for a few days or weeks such as Nancy's 57 Chevy Nomad, Wendy's `55 Porsche Spyder, Dwight's `55 Cadillac and more.<br />* Booze, Broads, and Guns: The Props of Sin City - (10:57) Interviews with Steve Joyner (Prop Master) and how he followed the "Booze, Broads and Guns" mentality of the film.  How certain props looked as real as the original to finding the right bow from the graphic novel in real life and obtaining it and using it for the film.<br />* Making the Monsters: Special Effects Make-up - (9:04) Interviews with Grig Nicotero (Special Motion Video Effects Supervisor) and creating the makeup for characters such as Marv, Jackie Boy and Yellow Bastard.<br />* Trench Coats & Fishnets: The Costumes of Sin City - (7:34) Interview with Mona Proctor (Costume Supervisor) going through the various costumes especially for the women like Gail (Rosario Dawson) who wore next to nothing.  Very informative.<br />* Teaser & Theatrical Trailer - The Teaser trailer is 2:07 minutes and the official trailer is at 1:49.<br /><br />I've owned the previous two DVD version of "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" but watching this on Blu-ray, I'm just amazed how much  of a difference High Definition really makes this film look and sound so incredible.<br /><br />The picture quality and the vibrancy of the reds and golds, the audio quality of weapons, cars and violence with wonderful DTS-HD audio going all around you.  This film is just right up there for one of the best releases on Blu-ray thus far.<br /><br />Again, I understand that other films such as "TRANSFORMERS" and "Quantum of Solace" which were shot outdoors looked incredible while "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" is digital throughout in terms of the cityscape and the overall atmosphere of the city.<br /><br />And suffice to say, both Blu-ray discs are just packed full of special features and enough to keep fans busy.  The first disc alone gives you five ways to watch the film and each reason is just fantastic (especially if you are a big fan of the film and the graphic novels).  The second disc was a great touch to add an unrated, recut version.<br /><br />It would have been nice to have the full theatrical film with the newer footage added to it but overall, the second disc gives you individual chapters and yet again, another way to enjoy this film.<br /><br />As for parents who wonder if this film based on a comic book is family friendly, despite the fact that blood is seen in various colors, the film is excessively violent and has its share of nudity.  So, despite Miller's work with the "Batman" and "Daredevil" comic books, "SIN CITY" is not a film you want to have your kids watching.<br /><br />In the end, I really enjoyed the film and the Blu-ray release.  Sure, it's over-the-top and both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have had their share of over-the-top films.  But there are few graphic novels that I have wanted to see in film and so, seeing "SIN CITY" as a film and with Miller involved and thus making sure the film is faithful to the graphic novels was awesome.  And just kudos to Robert Rodriguez who allowed Frank Miller to fully be in control of the film and working together with him and coming up with this unique and stylish film, the two work great together and I just hope to see a future collaboration with both men again.<br /><br />Finding a Blu-ray release that is just perfect in all four categories of film, video, audio and special features is quite rare.  Typically you get two out of four but in the case of "Frank Miller's SIN CITY", this release is just perfect.<br /><br />Videophiles and audiophiles are just going to love this release while fans of the film are just going to go nuts over the amount of content included on both Blu-ray discs.<br /><br />"Frank Miller's SIN CITY" is perfect and highly, highly recommended!  A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>"Sin City" is a brutal and violent film.  It's a noirish look at a sprawling Metropolis, rampant with corruption, greed, gore and sex.  Just try and resist it.  Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) fuses the blunt brutality with a bold and breathtaking style, propelling the story through three loosely related subplots, connected mainly through their shared theme of the exploration of the dark and feral side of humanity.  "Sin City" grabs you by the throat and rarely loosens its' grip for the next two hours.  If its' a story about a hulking murderer (a mesmirizing Mikey Rourke) on a rampage to avenge the women who showed him a moment of kindness, you're engrossed.  If its' a story of a loner (Clive Owen) looking to help a gang of violent prostitutes from the mob, you're hooked.  If its' a story of a beaten down cop (Bruce Willis) looking to prtect a young woman (Jessica Alba) from a depraved and deformed sexual deviant, you're glued to the screen.  Rodriguez wisely chose to frame the films' visual style around Millers' original drawings and kept Millers' pulpy dialouge intact, which exposes the stories' wounded heart better than any screenwriter could have done.  And even though the film sometimes gets bogged down in its' own visual inventiveness, you will be floored again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"Sin City" is a comic book on a big screen.  Although played with real actors, the film definitely has a surreal edge where everything is larger than life.<br /><br />A synopsis of "Sin City" would probably be that all the violence, the plots and the characters cannot be believed at the end of the day.  Rather, the viewer is dwelling in the world of comics where heroes can take a terrible beating but still return for more and the characters are nastier, meaner and more unrelenting than could ever be the case in real life.<br /><br />I saw this film with my 18 year old son who believed it to be the most violent movie he had ever seen.  To an extent he was right although this ignores the fact that the characters were part of a modern world comic strip.  Once one adopts this mind set, the movie is more surreal than real.<br /><br />"Sin City" has large ensemble cast and is filmed mainly in monochrome.  Yet for every black and white image, there is always one piece of colour.  It may be a woman's eyes, it may be her dress or it may be the skin colour of a baddie.  On this scale, "Sin City" is a technical marvel than envelopes the viewer.  There can be few films released in the past year that both captivate and repel the viewer at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This animated comic book is a marvellous gem that we should all see, watch and scrutinize several times a day to convince ourselves that the world has reached a no-return point. The black and white pictures are shockingly beautiful with subtle nuances in the greys and in the playing on light, or absence of light. The use of colors in that dark environment fascinates our eyes and mesmerizes our minds. The symbolic values of these colors are kind of simple though. Red as the color of blood or prostituted love is quite banal. Babylon is never very far away when red jumps into the picture. Yellow is funnier since it is the color of the arch-criminal, the senator's son. But yellow is also the color of fearful jaundice and of the cavalry, though the cavalry is not supposed to be afraid of anything and this barbaric torturer of a senator's son is not bouncing onto us to protect women and children, but rather to cut children into slices and transform women's heads into hunting trophies. The plot itself is sort of entangled : one plot in another and one crime in still another like so many russian dolls. Ir is fascinating to see all those super-heroes die and revive periodically. But the film is quite more pessimistic than Spiderman because there is no hope of an escape, no hope of a regeneration, no hope of an end to a neverending cycle of rotting and decaying because crime comes with power and power brings crime, since power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, as is well-known. So do not forget to see that film if you do not want to die in ignorance.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>I'm a huge Frank Miller fan and when I first heard that "Sin City" was being made into a movie, I shuddered.  I could just imagine what Hollywood would do to it: cast it wrong, colorize it, water it down, change crucial plot points, sap it like "Howard the Duck."<br /><br />My spirits lifted when I learned it would be directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, though I wasn't sure what to make of the fact that so much of it would be digitally generated.<br /><br />In the end, it's hard to imagine another filmmaker making as seamless a print-to-screen adaptation as this.  The characters all look right, the panels were obviously used as storyboards, and Rodriguez brings just enough of his own spark to the direction to make it unique.<br /><br />I liked this movie a lot but at the same time, it left me feeling a little strange.  It's like seeing your favorite indie band suddenly catapaulted from obscurity to arena-sized stages, hearing your favorite obscure song become a Top Ten hit.<br /><br />It also made me wish there was a way I could've experienced it without having read the books first, because if you've read the books, you know almost every single thing that's going to happen when and how it's going to happen.  That's more a criticism of myself as a reader/viewer than it is of the artist or filmmakers. On the other hand, as close as the transition is, the material still unavoidably loses something when recreated in live action, just by the nature of the severity of the actions.  Miller's sharp images are paced as precisely as rifle reports and there's a strange difference between, say, seeing a drawing of Marv dragging a man behind his car and seeing several seconds of footage of Marv dragging a man behind his car.  Still, had I been given the choice between seeing an accurate adaptation and a bad adaptation, I definitely would've chosen this one.  This is what you'd call an accurate adaptation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Frank Miller's Sin City is by far the best comic book adapted film in recent years. It's got very well written characters, and the often brutal and stylish actions is very unique and refreshing along with the mostly black and white cinematography. It's a very entertaining movie, but it's not easy to follow for anyone who hasn't read the graphic novels, because it's got three interconnecting stories that isn't neccessarily consistent in it's time frame. Also the over two hour long film is obviously heading for some sequels since the story didn't end when the movie was over.<br /><br />This is probably Mickey Rourke's career revival role since he has the juicest role that require him to looked semi-distorted, very muscular, endure various heavy-duty fight scenes, and he's got some very funny moments as well. With more screen time compared to other leads, it's unfortunate that he didn't even receive top billing like Willis, Alba, and Owen. He played Marv, and he's a street wise guy trying to track down the man who killed his hooker girlfriend Goldie(Jaime King). Kevin(Elijah Wood) is the scary and skillful hooker-eating mute that became Marv's relentless target. Elijah Wood had several scenes that consisted of fights with Marv, and he's so creepy different than his Frodo character.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is Hartigan, and he's the only good cop left when everyone else is corrupted. He was betrayed by his colleque Bob(played by the underused Michael Madsen) when he helped saved a little girl named Nancy Callahan, and ended up in jail for eight years. Nancy(Jessica Alba) grew up to become a pole dancer at a night club, and she eventually fell in love with Hartigan despite the age difference. Jessica Alba is very stunning on stage, and she was pretty convincing when she had to French kiss Willis.<br /><br />Clive Owen played the "Babe Magnet"/Dwight, who had a thing for helping the local prostitutes through hard times. Rosario Dawson is Gail, the leader of a group of highly skilled prostitutes. She was in some serious trouble when Miho(Devon Aoki) mistakenly killed Jackie Boy(Benicio Del Toro) and his men. Jackie Boy is an abusive husband to Shellie(Britanny Murphy), and a corrupted cop. Since Dwight has a thing for Gail, he was willing to do anything to bail her out. Devon Aoki is very striking as the lethal assasin with great martial arts skills and works as Gail's top sidekick.<br /><br />Other secondary characters include Yellow Bastard/Rourk junior(Nick Stahl), Senator Rourk(Powers Boothe),and Lucille(Carla Gugino) are very well played even though they have limited screen time.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: In an interview, Robert Rodriguez stated that instead of bringing the world of graphic novels to film, he wanted to bring film to the world of graphic novels. Boy, did he hit the nail on the head. Rodriguez has all the respect I can give to him because he is a conservative filmmaker who churns out epic products. His first film was made for $7K, and ever since he really tries to make movies for less. Rodriguez recently entered the world of digital filmmaking, his last film, Once Upon A Time In Mexico, was shot entirely in HD using digital cameras, no film. He raves about how easy it is to edit, just plug it into the computer and badabing! Sin City was shot all digital and it aided Rodriguez in accurately capturing Miller's vision.  The movie uses three story lines from three seperate novels by Frank Miller. One is called "The Hard Goodbye", which follows a man's journey for revenge after a cannibal rapist who killed his one true love. The interesting part is that this one true love was a hooker that he spent the night with for the first time.  Marv is played to perfection by Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood is absolutely menacing as the cannibalistic killer. The second story is called "The Big Fat Kill", in where Dwight (Clive Owen) tries to protect the prostitutes of Basin City from a menacing sex starved guy but ends up sparking a war between the cops and the hookers who previously held a truce.  Finally comes my favorite plot, "That Yellow Bastard". This is what noir is all about, the story of a cop coming to the end of his run trying to protect an innocent girl from a pedophile madman, he ends up framed for the crime and after 8 years in prison he sets out to protect the same girl only she's 19 now rather than 11.  Everything was done entirely with chroma key (Green Screen), and since it was in black/white it didn't feel cartoonish like Star Wars did.  Rodriguez uses light to highlight faces and shadows that make an incredible effect.  The only colors in the movie are red, blue, and yellow, which are the primary colors.  Green is used twice, and I'm trying to remember if they incorporated the fact that blue and yellow make green, but I can't remember, so maybe I'm just over analyzing with the green.  The movie has a lot of personal narration from the characters, and it's not narration of what is going on plot-wise but rather their personal thoughts to the action that is happening.  One great line from Bruce Willis is after punching his partner in the face he says to himself, "Hell of a way to end a partnership".  Although the lines are sleazy and obvious at times you have to realize that the kind of dialogue used here is a trademark of the noir style. "That Yellow Bastard" was definately the best story of them all because it had emotion to it, "The Hard Goodbye" was great too mainly because of the character of Marv, and "The Big Fat Kill" had some shining moments too but trailed off the radar a few times.  The only problem I had was that the narration in Marv's storyline dragged a bit, but overall Robert Rodriguez's talent in film combined with Frank Miller's talent in graphic novels makes one hell of a tribute to film noir.  This is pure entertaining filmmaking at its best, it's all style and one hell of an experience.<br /><br />ACTING/DIRECTING: Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke shine in full glory. They couldn't have gotten any better actors for these roles. All the characters in a film noir are hard-boiled and cynical, and these two played it to perfection.  The ensamble cast is endless and everyone was top notch except for Jaime King as Goldie/Wendy, she just can't act. As it goes for the artistic vision, well, does it really need explaining? I mean, brilliant use of shadows and light, using the primary colors only when something needs to be emphasized, and capturing emotion through the setting. One of my favorite scenes was when Bruce Willis' character was framed and in jail for 8 years, he first says that he is alone. The jail cell seems to be floating in an endless darkness, it's all black around the cell.  Then comes Quentin Tarantino, who is really only being used as a marketing technique, but you can sense that disturbing Tarantino style and wit during the movie.  Rodriguez and Tarantino are best buddies, and really I admire their admiration for classic films and film styles. Tarantino's Kill Bill films were tributes to Kurosawa and Leone, while Rodriguez's "El Mariachi" trilogy is a tribute to Leone's "Man with no name" trilogy.  Anyway, Tarantino stopped on the set one day and Rodriguez wanted to show him the digital HD way of film, and let him direct this one scene where Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro are in a car and Owen starts imagining things in his head.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Robert Rodriguez is the man.  He gave up his DGA (Director's Guild of America) membership just so that he could have Frank Miller as a co-director, he really wanted Frank with him at all times so that they could get this one done perfect to Miller's standards.  In his recent films if you pay attention to the credits you'll see Robert Rodriguez's name pop up several times.  He does his own music, his editing, cinematography, writing, and directing. With Sin City he directed, did the music along with John Debney, and did the visual effects. He takes the workload to make it good, and he knows how to make it good, so I'm not gonna argue</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Rest assured, "Sin City" is like no other film you have ever seen.<br /><br />"Sin City", directed by Robert Rodriguez ("From Dusk Till Dawn" and "Spy Kids") and Frank Miller (the creator of the graphic novels the film is based on) tells a number of stories, which share characters and themes. A cop with a bad heart (Bruce Willis) attempts to save an eleven year old girl, Nancy, from the sadistic killer, Junior (Nick Stahl). Marv (Mickey Rourke), a gangster, trawls the streets looking for the person who killed the hooker he slept with last night. Another gangster (Clive Owen) leads the abusive ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) into Old Town, an area run by hookers.<br /><br />Each of these stories pays homage to Film Noir, a type of filmmaking prevalent in the late 40s and early 50s. Every so often a filmmaker will take a stab at recreating the genre, with mixed results. Rodriguez appears to have been inspired by the source material, because this is not only one of his best films, but also one of the best modern takes on Noir. "City" has all of the trademarks of classic Noir; black and white cinematography, heroes and heroines trying to live in a corrupt society, villains trying to maintain control and desperate, desperate people.<br /><br />Like much of the "Spy Kids" films, Rodriguez shot most of "City" in front of a blue screen. Basically, he filmed the actors in front of a blank wall and added the backgrounds and special effects later. Many films use this technique for part of the process, but "City" appears to have been made using primarily this process. Almost all of the film is shot in black and white. This might be problematic for some, but I completely forgot about the lack of color, until he used brief glimpses of color. The backgrounds are richly detailed in shades of black, white and gray. They also appear to be consistent, helping to create a believable world. Because I believed in the setting of the film, I didn't miss the color. Color is used as a punctuation point. In some scenes, the red of blood appears, in others, the gold of a woman's hair. This creates a unique, interesting visual style, which appears to be inspired by the source material. Rodriguez also moves the camera to replicate graphic novel angels, making us believe that we are in a living comic book. Normally, all of these `tricks' would serve to draw the viewer out of the story and universe. In "City", it all serves to draw us in.<br /><br />The unique visual style is only the first element necessary to make us believe. The second, and perhaps most crucial element, are the actors. Frequently, in a movie based on comic books or similar material, all of the work is put into the visual. The actors walk through the story, spouting their lines. In "City", every one of the actors, and there are many, portray their characters in a serious way, as though they were in a run of the mill crime drama. No one lets on to the fact that they are basically in a live action graphic novel. Because they believe, this helps us believe, adding further to the creation of "Sin City" as a `real place'. It is difficult to say there is a lead in the film, but Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba all take on meatier roles in the interconnecting stories. They are joined by Elijah Wood, Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Josh Hartnett, Michael Madsen and a collection of young starlets. In any film with different stories, and this many actors, each person needs to make an impact and make one fast or they get lost in the shuffle. A lot of this has to do with how central the character is to the story; if they have a lot to do, they will be on screen more. Also, in Noir, the stories are usually accompanied by voice over narration from the lead character. In each of the stories, the main characters provide voice over, giving us insight into their thoughts. Hartigan, played by Willis, is steely, determined and effective. Marv, played by Rourke, whose plastic surgery is covered with enough make-up to make him resemble a Dick Tracy character, embarks on a memorable journey. Owen and Del Toro are also effective as they battle each other in Old Town, with the help of a number of very deadly hookers. All of these actors do a great job of helping to make "Sin City" all the more engaging.<br /><br />The interconnecting stories will probably bring "Pulp Fiction" to mind for many. When a major star appears in the first five minutes of the film, you get the feeling that their character will return at another point, probably the finale. The interconnecting stories share timelines and characters, creating a larger more interesting portrait. I find it interesting to watch a filmmaker's career and trace the `ancestry' of their films. In "Sin City", Rodriguez uses the digital technology that he used effectively in the "Spy Kids" trilogy, but takes it to another degree. He combines this with the sort of violent story that he has told well in previous films like "From Dusk Till Dawn" and "Once Upon A Time In Mexico".<br /><br />"City" is hard-boiled Noir. As I mentioned, color is used sporadically throughout. There is a lot of violence and, thankfully, Rodriguez only occasionally shows the blood in color. More often it appears as a milky white. He uses red as a punctuation point, drawing our attention to the actors or action; occasionally, red appears in a pool of blood, or in a person's shoes, or in a hooker's dress. This doesn't diminish the effect of the violence, it enhances it. Nudity also has a place in Sin City and it is the most gratuitous element of the film. Somehow, this is also fitting. You would expect nudity to be fairly common place in a town known for its sin.<br /><br />"Sin City" is one of the most visually interesting and challenging films I have seen in a long time. It has a dazzling visual style all its own, combined with a hard-boiled story and some very good performances, "Sin City" will be remembered for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I doubt there's any movie you will see this year that will be as good as Sin City. it's visually stunning, sexy, full of great lines, unforgettable characters and suspenseful action. The cast is great too. Micky Rourke shows why he should be in more movies as Marv. Marv is a kickass character  who's out for revenge against the people who killed his love Goldie. Micky Rourke is just simply awesome as him and should be even nominated for best supporting actor.<br /><br />  The rest of cast are really good too but not as good. Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer) who I didn't even know existed until last year is also extremely cool as Dwight. He goes after  the dangerous Benicio Del Toro and winds up starting a war between hookers and cops. So he has to set to make things right. The heroes played by Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis all have  soft spots for women. Willis "who's also the best he's been in awhile" has to protect the sexy Jessica Alba from the Yellow Bastard.<br /><br />  The Yellow Bastard is a sleazy pedifile who tried to kill  her when she was little but was stopped by Willis. The cops are crooked though and put Willis in prison because he wouldn't take blame for raping the girl. The Yellow Bastard's father is the mayor and owns the cops so he can get them to do anything he wants. When Willis gets out of prison he finds that he put Alba's life in danger by finding her and leading the Yellow Bastard straight to her. So he has to protect her one more time.<br /><br />  This movie is just great and director Robert Rodriguez's crowning achievement. Since he gets some directing help from Quintin Tarantino and Frank Miller I don't know if he'll get the best director nomination he deserves. Anyway he does here what every director who adapts a book should do, get some insight from the writer to make sure it's done right. This movie isn't just right though...it's done perfect. After seeing this I think  Rodriguez is the only person that could bring Stephen King's Dark Tower books to life as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>That was a strange yet intriguing film. But I have to agree with my husband, it could have been shorter. It became dull after awhile. Maybe I'm just too old to really appreciate such movies. It just seemed to be a violence filled gore fest. I like a little more plot than a live action comic book film noir.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>There is no denying this movie's technical and stylistic excellence, but Sin City is a pretentious film noir wannabe. It takes gratuitous violence to uninspired levels of depravity, and it pretends at a plot by interweaving multiple storylines and characters, all of which is too clever by half and amounts to a house of cards. This is a movie in which every male character is either a killer or a cop (sometimes both), and every female character is a Black Belt prostitute. Almost nothing makes sense, so you must watch the film as a pure sensory experience - albeit a very gruesome one. Some characters possess supernatural powers; we never discover why. I liked Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, but even though Sin City adopted elements of those two films, I absolutely hated it. If viewing two hours of violence and torture is your idea of entertainment, then by all means, see this movie. If it is not, stay away. At best, you will feel bored; at worst, you will feel disgusted. This film creates a new genre: The Sadomasochistic Fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>I am not usually a fan of comic books, but this movie was done so well that it didn't really matter.<br /><br />Very absorbing, fascinating, outrageously twisted over the top graphic violence---but not all that gruesome actually, since the camera usually pulls away from the actual carnage in progress.  It's the mental cruelty of various characters at various moments that lingers, not the physical actions so much.<br /><br />What's striking is just how utterly dark, no "dark" is too weak a word, utterly BLACK of a world this film pulls you into.  Totally amoral sadistic savage anarchy, there are of course good and bad guys but even the good guys are just a few shades less twisted.  And it's saavy, in the socioeconomic and sociopolitical sense---we see a world of vast corruption and cruelty underneath the everyday sucker's illusion of normalcy and respectability.<br /><br />The all-star cast shines, even cinematic lightweights like Jessica Alba are well-directed enough not to screw things up.  Like the "Kill Bill" movies, you have to approach this film as mainly an excercise in style and genre, it is not meant to be judged in any sort of larger real-world context and best of all doesn't try to be more than what it is...a supremely original and entertaining 2 hours!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>SIN CITY is one of those miraculous movies that seems to come along every once in a while. Filled w/ violence, gore, insanity and murder, this is the hideous underbelly of hell on earth! Robert Rodriguez / Frank Miller have fashioned the perfect comic book on film. The overblown characters and impossible action take place in the netherworld of their combined imaginations, leaving us w/ a masterwork of incredible, explosive entertainment. Every evil person is a nightmarish ghoul or demon, embodied so well by the silent, stealthy, cannibalistic Kevin (Elija Wood). Every anti-hero is a darkened, jaded soul w/ one last shot at redemption. Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen are the grand trinity of retribution and cold, hard justice. Their characters dole out the vengeance, and pay dearly for their trouble. Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, and Rosario Dawson are just three of the many idealized, ultra-hot females worth killing and dying for. SIN CITY is a bleak universe soaked in corruption and death. It's police (Benicio Del Toro), it's politicians (Powers Boothe), and it's clergy / church (Rutger Hauer) are all rotting, stinking institutions, held together by greed, perversion, and terror. If you like your stories hard-boiled, bloody, and downright nasty, then SC should be your next destination...</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>This is an uncompromising and equally graphic adaptation (Rodriguez called it a "translation") of Frank Miller's series of vivid graphic novels, filled with thoroughly noir images and over-the-top comic book dialogue (some of which reminded me of HEAVY METAL in the old days), shot mostly in black-and-white with color overlays where they serve a purpose (i.e., Junior and blood in general, except when the blood is white). The story lines used were "The Hard Goodbye," "The Big Fat Kill," and "That Yellow Bastard,"as well as the short piece "The Customer is Always Right" -- and the story titles all appear in the dialogue. Mickey Rourke is almost unrecognizable as the bloody-minded warrior-god Marv, Clive Owen is terrific as the good-guy-bad-guy Dwight, Elijah Wood is downright creepy as the cannibal-ninja Kevin, and Bernicio Del Toro makes a good Jackie Boy, especially as the dead body version. Bruce Willis does a very good job playing a Bruce Willis character, in this case a vengeful cop. Jessica Alba is always extremely watchable, though her acting this time isn't very impressive. (The only one they missed getting for this film, who really belonged in it, was Christopher Walken.) And Rodriguez is obviously a major fan of Miller's work. There's also a lot of Tarantino-esque recursion in the plot line (not to mention that the character of Miho is straight out the Crazy-88 in _Kill Bill_, and so are her weapons), reminiscent of _Pulp Fiction_: The beginning isn't necessarily the beginning, nor is the end the end. Of course, there's a _Sin City 2_ coming, and then _Sin City 3_. I'm pleased to say this is a film your parents (or, in my case, my wife) will hate, with no redeeming social values whatever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>Are Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez comic book geeks?  Yeah.  Bigtime.  Is it any wonder that they were able to talk the hesitant Frank Miller into making his pulp comic dynasty Sin City into a movie?  Porbably not.  They tried awfully hard and Rodriguez first treatment did make a pretty impressive splash with creator Miller.  Hence, a comic book movie is born.<br /><br />Probably the first comic book movie.<br /><br />Sure there's Batman and Superman and X-Men and Spider-Man and blah-de-blah-blah.  But one:  None of these movies were filmed by Tarrantino and Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Two: These movies were adaptions of comics turned into movies.  Sin City is a comic book turned into a comic book movie.  Hard to explain....unless you've seen it.  Miller is a great artist (he worked on the Marvel Limited series of Wolverine in the mid-80's) and he has a certain vision.  Rodriguez did not want this to be Frank Miller's Sin City as portrayed by Robert Rodriguez.  He wanted Frank Miller's Sin City.  Period.<br /><br />I think he got that and a helluva lot more.<br /><br />Do you need to be a Comic Book Geek to love this movie?  No.  It would help.  But it wouldn't be a prerequisite.  In fact, after viewing the movie, on having liked it, you may have a new-found appreciation of comics in general.<br /><br />To cut to the chase.  This is a dark and unseemly movie with dark and unseemly subject matter.  It moves like a hurricane.<br /><br />Dig it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie took place in Sin City, a city so corrupt and violent that a large section of the city was abandoned by the police  and was protected by scantily clad hookers. It was film noir at its finest. The movie consisted of several loosely connected vignettes. The heros were the following: an old, tough, but straight cop; an extremely ugly and extremely tough ex-con, with his own moral code; and a murderer on the lam, he had plastic surgery, but his sense of public duty led him into trouble. The villians were extremely evil and powerful, but there was a cosmic justice in this world, and the bad guys got a type of justice. The movie was extremely violent, but its surreal nature and its graphic novel type character buffered the viewer.<br /><br />The movie was a unique and fun experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>This movie was cool as hell to watch!

It is definitely a masterpiece of direction and photography!!<br /><br />SEE OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Even moreso than usual, I have nothing to tell you about this movie that hasn't been said a million times before.  Still, some things are cool enough that you've gotta take the time to recommend them no matter what.  As I said in my title, this film is pure entertainment, from beginning to end.  It virtually never lets up, and has the visual innovation, technical brilliance and sheer oddness to make feel like it could've gone on for a whole lot longer without getting old.<br /><br />As others have said, this is perhaps the ultimate 'guy film', and it's delightfully violent and perverse without either becoming to grim or seeming like it is solely meant to shock.  Plenty of people are offended by the violence, though it's tough to imagine why considering how over the top most of it is.  Also, others have accused it of being sexist as the majority of the women are in the film are prostitutes and scantily clad. (You'd think the fact that all the men in the movie are killers and criminals and slimebags would offset this and make it merely misanthropic, or perhas *gasp* a sheer piece of absurd fantasy with no real connection to reality, but apparently not)  I find both these causes for offense to be utterly ridiculous, but it is relevant to the certain groups.  So prudes and humorless feminists: Beware! You won't wanna see this movie.  Or, maybe you will, as getting offended seems to be the primary pleasure of those two groups.  But whatever, the people who do wanna see this movie know who they are, and they'll like it.<br /><br />As everyone knows, this movie is divided into 3 major sections.  I like this pattern, as only having a couple relatively brief segments means that things have to get going fast, and that the film has numerous peaks.  Everyone loves to compare this to `Pulp Fiction' though this isn't totally relevant, as though the segments cross over and reference each other, they all stand alone and don't really illuminate each other all that much.  The internal references are just kinda... cool, but they aren't really all that important.  Though there is a slight concern: The segments proceed in decreasing order of quality, so the best parts of the movie are at the beginning.  Still, it's all good enough that this doesn't matter all that much.<br /><br />Most people love to talk about the black and white with occasionally bits of color as the major trait of the film, but I think some of the other stylistic quirks are more unusual and intriguing.  The dialogue and acting are deliberately over the top, a slight caricature of you're stereotypical noir dialogue and mannerisms, which combines with some nearly perpetual voice overs from the primary characters, and lots of sleazy music to complete the noir feel.  The overblown noir stylization is combined with some really bizarre and of the wall characters, such as the scrawny-mute-superhuman-cannibal-serial-killer-farmboy, the misshapen-yellow-pedophile-mancreature and the deadly-asian-ninja-prostitute.  This is all pretty weird, naturally, but it never gets so unusal that it can't be taken seriously.<br /><br />The film also really illustrates the potential of digital filming, as the backgrounds and scenery are combined with the actors seamlessly.  The world doesn't look real, exactly, but, of course, it's not really meant to, and there's never any doubt that the actors are there.<br /><br />Despite the emphasis on style, and over the top violence and action, the film has a certain emotional resonance.  It may all be absurd, but Marv and Hartigan are still genuinely likable, sympathetic characters.  Dwight is less compelling, but he's still pretty, well, cool, and that's pretty good too.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  The core-audience for this film will almost certainly like it, and have doubtless already seen it.  Everyone else... I dunno.  But I sure like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>First and foremost, SIN CITY is a treat for the eyes.  There's never been a movie that looks quite like this one.  It was filmed largely in front of green-screen sets, much like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  Unlike that dreary movie, which tried to make us believe the "sets" were real, SIN CITY tries to make us believe the entire movie is a comic book that's been animated.  It attempts a lot technically, and ACHIEVES it.  There are a few moments in the movie (the shot of Bruce Willis leaving prison, with snow coming down on him, for example) that are beautiful, pure and simple.  Others are whimsical.  Others give us vertiginous angles that wouldn't be possible in "real life."  The movie is worth a look just for the technical aspects.<br /><br />I've never read anything by Frank Miller.  I'm not a graphic novel reader.  But I am a fan of film noir, and what I loved about this movie was the way it melded "old style" film noir narration (a la the books of Dashiel Hammett or Raymond Chandler) with a modern sensibility.  The movie is also ultra-violent, but if you read something like RED HARVEST by Hammett, written in the 1920's, you see that streets running red with blood is hardly a new thing.<br /><br />The movie tells three (OK, four) loosely interweaving stories that are set in this metropolis that is utterly corrupt.  No one "normal" even seems to live there...it's populated entirely by corrupt cops, killers, strippers, hookers and psychopaths.  Some of them have hearts of gold, or at least, hearts that aren't totally black, and these are our heroes.  I don't want to delve into the details of each story, but I found them all fascinating, although the first major story, with Mickey Rourke as the disfigured tough Marv may have been my favorite.  I felt it most cleanly walked the line between humor, pathos and suspense.  His character was an original.<br /><br />Nearly everyone in the movie was terrific.  You can tell they were energized by taking part in Robert Rodriquez's little experiment.  Mickey Rourke was outstanding...too bad no one will recognize him, because this could be his comeback vehicle.  Clive Owen (whom I've always found a bit hard to warm up to) was very good...tough, vulnerable, funny.  Bruce Willis does his patented world-weary cop, but there's a reason he keeps getting parts like that...he's darn good in them.  Benicio Del Toro clearly had fun with his creepy role.  Elijah Wood, while not really called upon to "perform", certainly shatters his "good hobbit" image in this flick!<br /><br />The women don't fare quite so well.  The parts are somewhat underwritten and incidental.  Jessica Alba is the most important female character, and while she looks the part, her acting talents aren't totally up to snuff.  Not enough to make one cringe, but there could have been more depth.  Rosario Dawson really chomps into her role...she fares best among the women.  Alexis Bleidl is OK and Brittany Murphy overacts mightily. I know many will find the movie to be anti-woman.  True, women aren't portrayed in too great a light here...but you know what?  Men aren't either.  These people are all just shades of scum...some scummier than others.  But the women are also strong and can "take care of themselves."  So, if you want to argue the movie glorifies violence...that's one thing.  But hates women?  That's a non-starter for me.<br /><br />But this movie, primarily, is a feast for the senses.  A great overall visual look (Visual Effects supervisor:  Robert Rodriquez), great editing (Rodriquez) and camera work (Rodriquez).  Good musical score (co-composed by Rodriquez) and great sound work.  It's a dizzyingly fast-paced movie that never feels hurried.  There's always something fun to listen to or to see.<br /><br />It is VERY violent.  If you were turned off by KILL BILL,  you might be equally appalled by the violence here.  Absolutely not for little kids.  But if you want a visceral  treat, this is a MUST SEE movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and am ready to see it again!</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>When the movie title appears, the lighting becomes dim and the audience receives its first glimpse of the evil portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />Frank Miller's Sin City is highly stylized and very violent. It is based on a graphic novel, but is also reminiscent of film noir of the 1940s and 50s. This is evident in the use of voice-overs, crime and the personalities of the characters. The extreme loyalty of the film to the novel is refreshing after so many disappointing adaptations such as The Hulk and Daredevil.<br /><br />The film was praised for staying true to its roots. The novel was often superimposed into shots of the film to make the two as identical as possible.<br /><br />The characters are stereotypical representations of what one might expect from a bad neighborhood. All of the men are murderers, even the police. There are good guys and corrupt ones and their clashes result in death most of the time. The women are strippers or prostitutes who use violence to take care of themselves or who utilize their men to do the dirty work for them. The cast is exceptional with stars such as Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro and Nick Stahl. The characters are highly controversial and they hardly depict role models which is cause for some to question why such famous actors would want to be part of such a project. Director Robert Rodriguez said, "Actors want to create memorable characters; they don't want to play themselves in movies over and over again."<br /><br />The story itself is presented in layers. There is a short story with Josh Hartnett that acts as the very beginning and the end of the film. It is based on the short "The Customer is Always Right" and was created as a vehicle to sell the film to producers. The compelling story starring Bruce Willis ends and returns again after the two center stories. It is based on the short "That Yellow Bastard." There are two middle stories that only have one segment each. One called "The Hard Goodbye" stars Mickey Rourke as a Hulk-like do-gooder that constantly faces trouble. A second non-returning segment stars Clive Owen and is based on the short "The Big Fat Kill." Each story revolves around a man's love for a woman.<br /><br />Rodriguez was ejected from the Screen Actor's Guild for breaking one of the rules with Sin City, working with one or more co-directors.<br /><br />Quentin Tarentino appeared as a guest director and was paid only one dollar for his contribution. The style of the film is reminiscent of Tarentino's own work. The chronological structure of the film is similar to that in Pulp Fiction. There is even a homage to Reservoir Dogs when a man's ear is shot clean off. Tarentino's own fame has brought conflicting ideas about which scene he directed. The general consensus seems to be that he probably directed a relatively unimportant scene.<br /><br />This film is not for the weak at heart nor is it for women who easily get offended by films that might seem to degrade them on the surface. This film contains violence and female nudity. The nudity is not excessive and makes the film realistic.<br /><br />Violence is the most obvious element. It is so abundant that the film almost received a harsher rating than the R rating it received. The visual effects aid this dilemma. They make the amount of blood and the severity of the violence less intense. Some might say that the extremity of the violence is used to generate publicity. Male genitals are attacked several times throughout the film and cannibalism is an addressed issue. Each of these adds to the shock value. The film has been scrutinized by some for being too violent, but creator Frank Miller said, "Chuck Jones got criticism for violence!" referring to the creator of Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />The visual effects were so unrealistic, they had to be done on a green screen. The film was shot in color and was later changed to stark black and white through a digital process.<br /><br />USA Today outlined the seven cardinal rules of movie-making that Sin City broke. These rules included never making black and white movies, never using voice-overs, never having blatant sexuality in a comic book movie, never using several directors, never making beautiful actors uglier, never excluding famous actors from having dialogue and never relying on green screens for the bulk of a film.<br /><br />Overall, Sin City seems to be a hit or a flop with people with no one in between. The sexuality, violence, and unusual film-making are certainly refreshing elements even if they shock instead of thrill.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>After extolling his nihilistic tendancies through his magnum opus comic, BATMAN: THE DARK NIGHT RETURNS and the screenplays for ROBOCOP 2 & 3, Frank Miller returned to his comic book roots and modified his pessimistic worldview by writing a series of extremely gritty, largely black & white graphic novels that came to be known as part of the Sin City series. Miller hasn't had very many positive experiences with the Hollywood system and for the longest time swore he would never allow the Sin City books to be transformed into a movie.<br /><br />Then Robert Rodriquez entered the picture. Despite the fact that he shoots most of his films in his studio near his Southwestern home (in Texas I believe) and is a filmmaking maverick who not only directs his films, but usually writes, edits, and scores them as well; Rodriquez has established himself as a powerful Hollywood filmmaker. Rodriquez has been a fan of Miller's Sin City books from their first publication and secretly shot a short based on one of the stories as test to show to Miller. Rodriquez showed the short to Miller, Miller loved it and the short became the opening sequence to SIN CITY.<br /><br />SIN CITY is one of the most brutal crime noir films ever to be made. The movie tells a series of three and a half different tales that are loosely connected that take place in Basin City. Basin City is sort of an overly corrupt, crime-invested version of NYC. Things are so bad that grafitti artists have spray-painted over the "Ba" in the town's sign, thus the name "Sin City."<br /><br />Rodriquez used Miller's comics as the storyboards for the movie. Therefore, SIN CITY is filmed mostly in black and white with only the occasional dash of color: a red dress, a blue hot rod, a yellow deformed man, blond hair. Also, there is a bar in Sin City that virtually all the main characters in the movie have an association with. Sometimes in this bar things seem to lighten up and the cold black & white world outside is allowed to be tainted with a tinge of colors in their softest hues.<br /><br />The casting for SIN CITY is brilliant and all of the actors do a good job for their roles. The most exceptional performance is pulled off by Mickey Rourke who plays Marv. Marv's story is perhaps the most optimistic of the tales, even though it does include a beheading, cannibalism, and an execution.<br /><br />SIN CITY is an incredibly violent film and had it been shot in color would have probably received an NC-17 rating. There's all kinds of shootings and stabbings, several explosions, cannibalism, two beheadings, a castration, an attempted child rape, suicide, and other acts of violence I can't recall. Staying true to the color-style of the film, whenever someone bleeds, their blood is usually yellow or white, but never red.<br /><br />Depressing as the movie is, I have to admit that I did enjoy parts of the film.  I was rooting for Marv and hoping he would at least win the girl, if not the day. I was impressed by the cinematography. I liked the score. However, reflecting upon the movie later on, I was almost sick to my stomach.  Technically and cinematographically, the film is brilliant.  But as far as stories go, SIN CITY is true to its title and wallows in sin & filth; making it one of the bleakest films I have ever seen. It's definitely not a movie that everyone will enjoy, and even some who do (like myself) will discover later that it--like sin-really wasn't that great of an experience after all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. "Sin City" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes "Sin City," the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />"Sin City" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />"Sin City" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow," this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike "Sky Captain," it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three "Sin City" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />"Sin City" is not quite a "Kill Bill" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. "Sin City" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />"Sin City" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. An outstanding piece of work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>I've always been a big fan of Frank Miller ever since I first read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIKZEG">Batman the Dark Knight Returns #1 First Print</a> which I thought then and I still think now is the best comic book about The Batman ever written.  I never read "Sin City" and so I watched this without knowing anything about it prior and after having been jaded with really mediocre film offerings over recent years I really wasn't expecting much and so I was blown away with just how good this film is.  It was like watching a comic book come alive and just like my favourite comic book mentioned earlier I really enjoyed this great piece of writing by Frank Miller.  The film reminded me a lot of another great film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006BSBW">Pulp Fiction</a> and I guess with the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino as "guest director" this shouldn't surprise me but using the same tactic of merging apparently different storylines really works here unlike elsewhere like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V38">Chungking Express</a> where it really didn't work as well.  Although some have tried and doubtless many more will try in the future this almost new genre of graphic novel films has a new standard upon which others will be measured and this film is it.  Great storytelling, great acting and as far as this dvd goes excellent picture and DTS 5.1 surround sound quality makes this just a great film to watch over and over again like any classic film should be.<br /><br />My great wish now is for the same directors to do an even better job if possible on a similar film version of my favourite graphic novel "The Dark Knight Returns".  "Sin City" for now though is one of the best films that I've watched in many many years and this dvd is also among the best both picture and sound quality-wise that I've seen on a non-Blu-ray format.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>You can't but admire Robert Rodriguez for achieving his vision of bringing Frankie Miller's graphic novel Sin City, to the big screen.  The result of his dedication and vision, is a stylistic, visually striking, technically impressive, near perfect homage, to Miller's world of crime, violence, romance, revenge, women, and vice.  Miller had no plans for a Sin City film, but when Rodriguez demonstrated to him what the film could be, Miller got onboard the project as a co-director.  Using the graphic novels as the source, Rodriguez clearly envisioned technically how the film could be made, and transformed that concept into a reality that even exceeded the expectations of Frankie Miller, authentically capturing the look, style and atmosphere of Sin City.<br /><br />Another major contributor to the film's success is its amazing cast.  From top to bottom, Rodriguez enlisted a parade of top flight talent that is quite unique.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Torro, Jaime King, Carla Gugino, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, and Elijah Wood, head what is one of the more remarkable casts in a film of this decade, one that also includes Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Josh Harnett and Marlee Shelton in minor roles.<br /><br />Presented predominantly in black and white, the original version of Sin City cleverly blends several stories together in a fashion that holds together pretty cohesively, although the tonality of The Big Fat Kill incorporates a  bit more humor than the rest.  The performances are all strong, particularly considering the challenges of acting against a sterile green screen.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke, both rise to the top with gritty, powerful, and emotional performances.<br /><br />There are a ton of extras in this edition, including several commentaries, and numerous featurettes covering various facets of the production.  Lots of cool secrets are revealed in 'Fifteen Minute Film School with Robert Rodriguez'.  Shooting against a green screen, enabled scenic elements to be inserted in post production.  The extent to which this cool technique was employed, can be seen in 'The All Green Screen Version'.  There is also a short documentary about how Frankie Miller was convinced to greenlight and join the production.<br /><br />The film has been recut, with some additional footage added, into the four separate stories, The Customer is Always Right, That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye, and The Big Fat Kill.  They appear on Disc 2, and can be viewed in any order.  Also included is a copy of The Hard Goodbye graphic novel.  The recut, extended version (DVD or Blu Ray), costs more, but if you enjoy Sin City, this is certainly the one to get.<br /><br />Amazon should revise their policy of regarding different versions of the same movie as being equivalent.  This two disc recut version, not the same as the regular edition single disc release.  This situation widespread, and leads to confusion for those seeking specific information about what special features and extras may be included in any particular edition.  This policy not realistic, and does not serve the best interest of consumers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>Sin City (2005) After reading several Amazon reviews I saw there was no need to write another except to sign up as an additional uniquely satisfied customer.

Featuring four stories vaguely connected to each other by the setting and some overlapping characters with the main character being the city itself the film co-directed by writer/artist Miller and Robert Rodriguez (and guest director Quentin Tarentino for one segment), "Sin City" has a terrific cast in a modern day film noir classic.<br /><br />Digitally shot, "Sin City" features a terrific cast including cameos from Michael Duncan Clarke, Elija Wood, Britney Murphy, Carla Gugino (who lights up every scene she's in)and other distinguished folks giving the film signficant star power.<br /><br />The first disc features the theatrical cut of the film along with two commentary tracks--the first with co-directors Miller & Rodriguez and the second with Rodriguez and guest director Quentin Tarantino. There is also a third alternate audio track recording of the audience at the Austin premiere of the film.<br /><br />The second disc features the film recut with each segment in chronological order. There are also featurettes on how Rodriguez convinced Miller to make the film, the vintage cars used in the film, the segment that Quentin Tarantino shot,"Booze Borads and Guns: The Props of City City", "Making the Monsters: Special Effects Make Up" "Trench coats and Fishnets: The Costumes of Sin City" as well as the teaser and theatrical trailer for the film (and an annoying Miramax promo at the beginning of the disc). The disc winds up with "15 minute Flic School" , "Sin City: Live in Concert", "10 minute Cooking School", "The Long Take" and an "All Green Screen Version". The last featurette shows how the film looked when they were shooting on the set running at "800 times" the normal speed accompanied by Rodriguez's score. Since almost the entire film was shot without any sets, it makes for a surreal almost theatrical experience. Rodriguez's jazzy score accompanies this version of the film (played at normal speed). It's an odd way to spend eight minutes.<br /><br />The stories--a hit man (Josh Hartnett)carries out his job in the beginning and ending segments of the film getting close to his subjects and then killing them almost and treating them with surprising tenderness.<br /><br />The second story concerns Marv (Mickey Rourke)a bull headed thug who decides he has to find out who set him up as a murderer killing the only girl (Jaime King) tht had really been nice to him.<br /><br />The third story takes us into a bad part of town dominated by hard boiled hookers led by Gail (Rosario Dawson).

Dwight (Clive Owen)who has already had his own run in with Jackie. He wants to take the guy out as well. Gail and Dwight combine forces to take out Jackie unleashing hell on the girl's side of town.<br /><br />The third story focuses on police detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis)as he saves a little girl named Nancy from a pedophile (Nick Stahl).

When Hartigan castrates the senator's son he vows revenge by setting up Hartigan for the rape of Nancy. During his time in prison Nancy (Jessica Alba)stayed in touch with Hartigan secretly writing him letters. Parole comes up and the pedophile wants revenge against Hartigan.

Frank Miller is just such a mind. His morbid fascinations with corrupt authority figures, hypocritical religions, sleazy yet strong-willed women, and violent anti-heroes are thrust into the spotlight in his work. With his comic books and graphic novels, we are given a disturbing glimpse into his worldview. His characters are tainted with cynicism, darkened by madness, haunted by guilt, plagued by lust, and drenched in blood. Naturally his stories have been a commercial success despite their controversial subject matter, so it's no surprise that Hollywood producers, directors, and writers have sought to adapt them into films. This is something Frank Miller has always been reluctant to allow... up until now that is. Filmmakers and friends, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino unite their perverse adolescent minds and together they bring Frank Miller's Sin City to vivid life in a stark and oppressing film, which will leave its viewers desiring a thorough shower in order to wash away the residue of the film's immoral characters.<br /><br />Basin City, better known to its inhabitants as Sin City, is a shady underworld of crime and corruption. It's a place where crooked cops patrol the streets, where serial killers and sex offenders go free, where the church buries its own sins, and the noblest men are psychotic vigilantes. In this dog-eat-dog environment, only the strong survive and the pressures and strain of survival fracture the human psyche. No one is innocent, no one is pure and even Sin City's most charismatic denizens are scum. In this world diversion takes the form of strip bars and brothels, evil hides behind the mask of propriety, and revenge and redemption are the same.<br />The film is divided into three stories. They are:<br />1. Detective Hartigan has been tracking down a powerful senator's son, who kidnaps, rapes, and murders young girls. Hartigan is betrayed by another cop, his partner in fact, who is under the pay of the senator. Hartigan takes the fall for the senator's son only to protect one of the intended victims. Years later he is let out of jail and tries to save that same girl from the senator's wrath, but she has become a stripper and fallen in love with Hartigan, the man who once saved her. Soon Hartigan realizes that he was part of a plan to bring her out into the open where the senator's son can carry out his wicked desires.<br />2. Dwight is an enigmatic criminal with a soft spot for damsels in distress. When his new girlfriend is beaten up by her abusive ex, Dwight plans to teach him a lesson. Dwight chases him into the red light district where a band of vigilante prostitutes kills him, only to discover that he was a cop with a destructive ego. Now Dwight and the prostitutes must fend off corrupt officials and the mob in order to keep their territory to themselves.<br />3. Meanwhile Marv, a deformed schizophrenic brute, seeks bloody retribution after the woman he slept with is killed and he's framed for the murder. In his attempt to solve the mystery of her death and avenge her, he discovers a plot that leads to one of the city's most powerful families, corruption within the government, police force, and the church. He pulls off his brutal revenge but he ultimately pays the price in the end.<br />These three tales interlock like pieces to a sinister puzzle, each piece bringing the audience closer to the story's completion, showing us the seedy underbelly of Basin City from multiple perspectives.<br /><br />Much like Pulp Fiction in its fragmented narrative, Sin City unfolds out of chronological order, which is perhaps the film's greatest flaw. However the film is boosted by the dramatic visual style of Miller, Rodriguez, and Tarantino who imbue it with the atmosphere of a 1940s noir film and the savage violence of 1970s action cinema. Most of the movie was shot against a green screen and then CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) artists created the surrounding environments. This made it possible for the filmmakers to replicate Frank Miller's graphic style; the high contrast black and white metropolis, the inverted shadows cast upon brick walls, the saturated red of blood splatters, and the golden yellow of a vixen's hair.<br />The morally ambivalent characters are brought to life by a talented ensemble cast including Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Carla Gugino, Josh Hartnett, Rutger Hauer, Jaime King, Michael Madsen, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Marley Shelton, Nick Stahl, Bruce Willis, and Elijah Wood.<br />The film won't appeal to everyone. It's gratuitous depictions of violence and sex are proof of that. However, if taken with a grain of salt, Sin City is an entertainingly over-the-top exploitation masterpiece that faithfully recreates Frank Miller's imaginative graphic novels.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593963149">Frank Miller's Complete Sin City Library</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244F2S">Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 1</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHQTE">Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's Edition</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HC2LEY">Reservoir Dogs</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068DBC">Pulp Fiction</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMEW">Kill Bill Vol. 1</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMUA">Kill Bill Vol. 2</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZTY">El Mariachi</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZU1">Desperado</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000WN140">Once Upon a Time in Mexico</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>***1/2 2005.

There is a lot going on and sometimes it gets hard to figure out who is doing what but if you slip into the mode that is `Sin City' is will all put itself together for you.  You just have to want to `get' this movie.  I wanted to `get' this movie, and you know what, I did, and with each and every watch through I `get' it even more.  The fact remains that Sin City is above and beyond brilliant film making.  It's visually stunning and completely captures the imagery that Frank Miller created with his graphic novels.  It's dark, gritty and aggressive; violent and seductive.  `Sin City' is an amalgam of everything that makes `sin' in general so grotesque.  In other words, it's the dark underbelly of a life all too often glamorized.<br /><br />`Sin City' takes three stories from the `Sin City' alumni and interweaves them throughout one another to create the appearance of one long story.  The three stories used (`The Hard Good-Bye', `The Big Fat Kill' & `That Yellow B*****') all feature some strong if not flawed characters that have a habit of making some very poor decisions.  What is strange though is that we form attachments to these characters despite their behavior and we find ourselves rooting for them in the long run.  You see, despite their flaws and transgressions they are victims themselves and warrant our support.<br /><br />The acting is spot on for the type of film that this is.  I've heard some friends talking about the cheesy dialog and the wooden acting but what they fail to realize is that this is a comic book adaptation and it takes that very literally.  Robert Rodriguez brilliantly crafted a world that is so similar to the one Miller created frame for frame it feels like reading a comic, like peering into Miller's graphic novels.  The acting thus corresponds with this vision.  The dialog is at times even word for word from the books, and the way the characters respond and or interact is classic comic exaggeration.  It all comes together to create the perfect backdrop for the film.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and especially Mickey Rourke nail their performances, adding depth to the film as a whole.  Jessica Alba actually pulls out her finest performance to date (who would have guessed it) and made me proud, and I think she's nothing more than a hard body so she took me by surprise.  Elijah Wood is effectively creepy, something I didn't think he had in him, and his character stayed with me long after the credits were rolled.  As a whole the performances are strong and are all memorable, Benicio Del Toro and Rosario Dawson coming to mind as key supporting players who make an impact.<br /><br />Yes, there are flaws to be found within `Sin City' but to me they are few and far in between.  I love what Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino were able to accomplish here and I eagerly await their efforts with `Sin City 2'.  If they are even half as successful with the second act I will be a happy man.  So just sit back and absorb the imagery for even if `Sin City' is not you cup of tea you can't help but admire the art that is set before you with each passing frame.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I just saw this movie last night. I know, how much of a loser am I? I was just positive that I wouldn't "get" it because I hadn't read the graphic novels, and didn't really know much about them. When I put it in, I was shocked. It is an awesome movie!! I can see how some people didn't like it, but I wasn't one of them. The sweet digital backgrounds, the casts, the characters, the colors (and lack of)made me love this movie. It's definitly going on my wish list. Just give it a chance, you might love it like I do.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>Frank Miller's graphic comic-books come to breathtaking life in Robert Rodriguez's dazzling and extraordinarily violent film. "Sin City" centers around 3 engaging stories. The first involves Marv (brilliantly played by an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke), a messed up, ill-faced tough-guy on a quest to bring his lover's killer to justice. The other deals with the slick, Dwight (Clive Owen), an imposing, trench-coated charmer who unwittingly sets off a chain of unfortunate events by defending his smart-mouthed, physically abused girl-friend (Brittany Murphy). The final entry involves the tormented Willis and his love for a beautiful stripper (Jessica Alba) who he once rescued as a young girl from a heinous kidnapper and has to do so again when the monstrous villain returns with vengeance on his mind.<br /><br />This film looks splendid. The sets, costume design, cinematography and art direction are top-notch and I don't understand how this motion picture was not nominated for any "Oscars". The film is so visually breathtaking that the images and characters depicted will stay in your mind long after the closing credits. The entire film is shot in awesome black and white and every once and a while a dash of color is added enhancing the visual impact. There really isn't an action movie in recent memory that was this visually stimulating and artistically creative. Rodriguez successfully captures the essence of the comic-book characters without making them appear one-dimensional (It should be noted that Quentin Tarantino and Frank Miller are also given directing credits).<br /><br />"Sin City" the comic books are not child's play so it's useless to expect the same from the film. The characters are all violent, impulsive and amoral individuals who kill without an ounce of remorse. The violence is graphic but the grisly gore scenes are executed so brilliantly that there really isn't that many moments in this film where the squeamish will be turning away or covering their eyes. They'll be too busy admiring the awesome beauty of the cast, the eye-catching visuals and the skill-fully choreographed fight scenes.<br /><br />Spectacle aside, the star-studded cast also deserves mention because they all give exceptional performances. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke are the stand-outs. Both actors are compelling to watch especially Rourke who commands our attention and makes the most out of his vicious but sympathetic character. And a review cannot be complete without mentioning the luminous Alba. That platinum hair, gorgeous figure and other-worldly presence makes a delightful Nancy Callahan. Other's in the impressive cast include Powers Booth, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Rutger Hauer, Josh Hartnett, Nick Stahl, Michael Madsen and Elijah Wood.<br /><br />"Sin City" is a work of art. The luscious visuals, Miller's colorful characters, the film's bleak, desperate setting and Rodriguez's/Miller's/Tarantino's masterful direction all contribute into making this one of the best feature films of 2005. Set aside 2-plus hours and go along on this joy-ride. Chances are in your favor that you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>As a major fan of Robert Rodriguez and a fan of Frank Miller, I think that I was expecting a bit more from Sin City. It's hard to know exactly WHAT I wanted more of, since the film is suffused with style and violence, cheap broads with hearts of gold and mugs who never got a fair shot.<br /><br />But for all the style the film oozes, its extremely stylized dialogue is sometimes hard for the film's cast to get out and sound plausible doing so -- this is particularly true of some of the lines placed in the mouths of the actresses.<br /><br />Still, the film is ruthlessly true to Miller's vision and is easily the most hard-boiled noir movie ever made. As a result, Sin City has to be strongly recommended to fans of either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>Just one step below great... The visuals are awesome of course<br /><br />and so is the acting. Bruce Willis is a cop that just can't come<br /><br />to terms with the fact that he is aging and is just about out<br /><br />of the game.<br /><br />It's an action packed and gory thrill ride. Yes, it's a comic<br /><br />book thing, but you believe in the characters and they feel<br /><br />real. All three stories manage to keep your interested through<br /><br />out the entire two hours. Out of all the stories I'd say<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is my favorite as the beastly looking man out<br /><br />to get revenge for the men that killed his hooker girlfriend.<br /><br />It's rare to have a movie be really good eye candy and actually<br /><br />good at the sametime. Either a movie has a good story and lacks<br /><br />action, or it has good action and lacks any kind of story.<br /><br />Btw, Rosario Dawson is hot in this one!

Every shot could easily be transferred into a frame of a comic book. It's mostly in black and white but it's beautiful nonetheless. The use of shadows and light is amazing. Each of the stories I found interesting but it did take a little while to develop an interest in each one of them. I think the movie ran a little long but, still, I really enjoyed it.

"That Yellow Bastard part 1" tells us how hard-boiled officer John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) swore to protect a young girl named Nancy (Makenzie Vega) from a child-killer/rapist named Roak Junior (Nick Stahl) but fails then next we have "The Hard Good-Bye" where a big-chinned powerhouse named Marv (Mickey Rouke) was having an affair with a sexy girl named Goldie (Jaime King) until he wakes up to find her dead. He has been set-up as he runs from the law as he interrogates some people including a priest (Frank Miller) for finds out a crazed swifted clawed maniac named Kevin (Elijah Wood) who has a taste to literally eat prostitutes and finds out the rotten cardinal (Rutger Hauer) is all behind this for justice must be served. Following after that "The Big Fat Kill" has Dwight (Clive Owen) taking care of an abusive man named Jackie-Boy (Benico Del Toro) but while he finds the sleaziest part of town run by protective prostitues lead by tough but sexy leader Gail (Rosario Dawson) who wage a war with some mercenaries like Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan). Then we have "That Yellow Bastard part 2" has Hartigan sentenced 9 years to prison then after that he is released to find the young girl Nancy (Jessica Alba) all grown up at 19, unfortunately a deformed yellow man named Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahls) kidnaps her as he must save the girl then finally we end with part 2 of "The Customer is Always Right" where i won't reveal to you the ending.<br /><br />A brilliant, cold-blooded and hard boiled adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking graphic novel series from Dark Horse Comics. Robert Rodriguez who is one of the best action directors joins up with Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino to make a dazzling cocktail of a movie with stunning visual effects. I like how it accurately depicts 4 graphic novels in one movie page-by-page scene-by-scene shot in glorious black-and-white with some color tints in some areas for select objects. The violence is gory and graphic but mainly white colored at times to make it look like out of the comics which is a very nifty and creative idea i should say. The performances are very good as is the direction by 3 directors and i love the surreal nature of the design for the film. Co-starring Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Jason Duoglas and Brittney Murphy i gotta say the casting was spot on especially Mickey Rouke as Marv was absolutely perfect. I saw this movie 4 times in theaters as i knew they would not screw up this adaptation and satisfies action fans including fans of comics/graphic novels.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set has absolutely flawless picture and sound quality like if it was like going to the theaters. Disc one has Cine-Explorer where you hear an audio commentary by the filmmakers plus shots from the graphic novels with green screen test footage along with the movie as you watch plus audience reaction track as well. Disc 2 has the unrated recut extended edition which is longer and violent with cool extras like "Kill em good" which is an interactive comic plus Rodgriguez extras like 16 minute film school, all green screen version, the long take, Sin City: Live in Concert and 10 minute cooking school. Additional extras are featurette on how they put the graphic novels on film, interview with Quentin Taranitno, 3 featurettes and trailers and teasers.<br /><br />A must have for cinema fans and even geeks of comic book/graphic novel films.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>No one, it would seem, has worked as hard or received more satisfaction and dedication out of his work within the movie industry then Robert Rodriguez. Starting off with a seven thousand dollar budget and a camera in hand, El Mariachi sparked the career of one of the most imaginative and sought after directors of our generation. He has not only taken up the responsibility of directing and writing the script for each of his films, but he has also acted as the composer, visual supervisor, editor, producer, production designer, and sound editor for several of them as well. Furthermore, not a single one of his films, including the visually complex and celebrity laden Sin City, was made for more then forty-million dollars, virtually unheard of in the modern Hollywood environment of one-hundred million dollars being the average price for a tent-pole project. Truly, Robert Rodriguez is a rogue of the film industry and his audience would not have it any other way.<br /><br />The story for Sin City not only meticulously blends seemingly individual plotlines together into a single cohesive feature film, but it also resonates the very characteristics that have made the film-noir genre so enticing and appealing to movie-goers over the years. More importantly, the script emphasizes a sad truth of life, which is that certain circumstances require morally corrupt individuals to put a stop to even more morally corrupt individuals from doing harm onto others. Sadly, unlike Superman and Spider-Man, not all comic-book heroes are as ethically heroic as would be believed. The only visible complexities within the script were the transition of one story arch to the next, which should have transferred more smoothly then it did, and the lack of connection in terms of intertwining characters and subplots between the three stories. It could have been more compelling and interesting had Rodriguez and Miller found a way to better blend the three separate storylines together, integrating several of the characters into blended scenes, more then the mere glimpse we receive of Marv in the bar that Hartigan steps into to search for Nancy, but it works fine enough as it stands.<br /><br />In spite of his appearance in numerous television productions since 1989, only in the last few years has British performer Clive Owen received recognition in Hollywood having been offered the leading role in the Jerry Bruckheimer production, King Arthur, and his Academy Award-nominated performance in Closer. Owen truly accentuates the role of Dwight, a rogue out to stop Jack Rafferty, performed by Benicio Del Toro, from harming the hookers of Old Towne, and his somber voice-over narration of the events depicted, typical of the film-noir genre, adds to the entertainment value. Del Toro's Jack Rafferty is the type of character which the audience would care to have a little more background information on in order to firmly grasp the concept of what is taking place in several scenes, but perhaps that is too much involvement then is required for some people.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke, a name of whom few within the current generation of young adult movie-goers would recall hearing before, has been long overdue for a comeback performance, appearing in The Rainmaker and The Thin Red Line, and he more then makes up for the string of commercial failures on his resume in the role of Marv. Observing his magnetic performance onscreen, it was as if Frank Miller, creator of the Sin City graphic comic series, created the figure of Marv specifically for Mickey Rourke, it is that comprehensive and enthralling. Though not the fault of the scriptwriting team, Jaimie King receives the short end of the performance stick in the role of Goldie given as how she dies within the first few minutes we see of her and even when she returns as Wendy, Goldie's twin sister, she doesn't do much beyond a few scenes with Rourke. And who better to fill the role of the silent and deadly cannibalistic assassin, Kevin, a young psychopath enlisted by the corrupt governmental structure of Sin City to kill off Goldie and pin the crime on Marv, then Elijah Wood? Was there honestly no one else within the same height structure as Wood that would have served as effectively in this role as he did? This is not meant to discredit his performance by any means. On the contrary, Wood turns what could have easily been an unintentionally derisive character into one of the most enigmatical and haunting figures in the film. The problem lies in the fact that when the audience sees Wood they automatically recall his performance as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Ring trilogy and the effect his character is suppose to have on them goes down a slight notch or two because of this.<br /><br />Jessica Alba, better known for her involvement in the short-lived James Cameron television series, Dark Angel, on Fox, is stunning to say the least about her in the role of Nancy Callahan, the young potential rape victim who grows up to be a strong-willed exotic dancer. And while it is still a little early to make a judgment call as to whether she will have a longstanding career in the film industry seeing as how her role is limited to the `damsel in distress' caricature familiar to the film-noir genre, her performance holds up quite well opposite veteran actor Bruce Willis. Willis plays up the role of John Hartigan, quite possibly the only honest cop in the Sin City police force, with gusto, as he had done in such other gritty dramas as Pulp Fiction and Twelve Monkeys. It was fascinating to see the relationship which existed between Nancy Callahan and John Hartigan develop into a chivalrous `knight on a white horse riding to the rescue of his fair maiden in distress' love affair onscreen. And though this will certainly receive some negative feed back from some audience members, this in a way represents a double-standard in our society. Headlined prominently in such risqu&eacute; comedies as Sex in the City as well as in those insufferable tabloid newsmagazines, Mr. Willis being one of their more recent targets, is the belief that older women chasing after young men for sexual pleasure is perfectly acceptable while relationships which exist between older men and younger women is repulsive and depraved. Though this type of behavior may not exactly be everyone's cup of tea, there is certainly nothing morally objectionable to it given that it is for a loving relationship and not merely sexual intimacy alone and our society must comes to terms with this fact. Sure, it would have been nice for Rodriguez or Miller to have provided the audience with a bit more information concerning the previous sexual attacks made by Junior against young little girls in order to receive a better idea on the type of character that is being dealt with, but it is understandable enough that it is not required. In any event, Nick Stahl gives a decent, if not limited, performance in the role of the senator's son, eventually evolving into the monster known as the Yellow Bastard. Unfortunately, this thus mentioned character leaves several questions unanswered. Why did he become yellow? What is the cause of this horrible smell emulating from the bastard which is repeatedly mentioned by either Hartigan or others? Yes, these are minor, if not trivial, matters but when it comes to a feature this imaginative, nitpicking is going to be a result.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of its failure to emphasize a canonical point within its script, Sin City is nonetheless nothing short of visually arresting entertainment in the best sense of the word and serves as one of the more innovative feature film projects to crawl out of the works in recent years. Truly stunning in terms of its scope, direction, and graphic style, which is balanced out thanks to the exceptionally amplified performances of its cast members and the pertinent dialogue throughout the two-hour movie. As marveling as this presentation turned out to be, it should be noted that there were some, albeit trivial in respects, minor complaints to be made. Rodriguez and Miller had a captivating concept going when Marv discussed through narration how he was confused within his mind as to whether the actions he was taking were that of a justifiable avenger of his lover's death or merely the aspirations of a psychopathic killer everyone said he would be come to life, but instead is only focused on briefly before being lost in the shuffle. It would have been interesting to see what may have developed had this been expanded on in the script. And though the violence featured in Sin City is meant to be comical in nature, visualize it alone the lines as the fight sequences seen in Kill Bill Vol. 1, and not to be taken seriously, there were particular scenes in which it was too over the top to be taken seriously. For example, the scene in which Benicio Del Toro's Jack Rafferty had not only his hand cut off but also has his gun backfire into his forehead and has his head cut `like a Pez dispenser', went a little too far it seems and should have been cut down more cleanly. There is no problem with violence being featured prominently in live-action adult movies, but should it merely be violence for the sake of being violence, it doesn't make sense for the film to bite off more then it can chew. Still, the black and white visual quality of the film spliced with hints of iridescence, the scintillating reverberation of rain in the dark night of the back alleys, passionate and harrowing tales of chivalrous love affairs, and plenty of vital fluids and savagery to satisfy even the most hardcore of Taratino fanatics, are reasons enough to resurrect the hopes of movie-goers disillusioned over the years by the stale and unoriginal presentations and hoard them back to the local Cineplex in droves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Sin City" is brilliant and beautiful looking!

It reminded me alot of Richard Romanus' Heavy Metal, as Rodriguez tried to piece together several of Frank Miller's stories into one movie.  Still, I liked the look and feel of the movie, a deeply saturated black and white with spot colors.  It was interesting to see such actors as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood transformed beyond all recognition.  Clive Owen proved to be an inspired choice as Dwight, making a good contrast to Benecio del Toro's talking head.  But, in the end, this movie simply didn't add up.  It was more like a promotion for Frank Miller's serial graphic novels, which he continues to put out having gone beyond comic heros such as Batman and the Daredevil.  This isn't kids' stuff, but a series drenched in lurid sex and violence, which seems to be the staple of pulp fiction these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>With the appearance of SIN CITY (I managed to see it at a preview the day before general release), we have what is easily the finest adaptation yet of any graphic novel.  Not merely that, this amazing film replicates the visual excitement, dynamic vitality, and dramatic stylization of the genre.  SIN CITY isn't merely based on Frank Miller's film noir graphic tales, but an astonishingly accurate translation into a new version.  For that reason alone the film would stand out as one of the more remarkable films of recent years.<br /><br />Thankfully, SIN CITY is much more than a mere screen equivalent of some superb graphic tales:  it is by any standard a film of the front rank.  The success can be traced primarily to two individuals:  director Robert Rodriguez and writer Frank Miller.  Most fans will know that Miller has long resisted having his works turned into film, until Rodriguez sent him a brief test piece that would have knocked the hesitation of even the most sceptical author.  Miller's stories pay homage to the entire film noir and hardboiled tradition that began with Dashiell Hammett and BLACK MASK magazine (and its imitators) and has continued all the way until today with contemporary masters like James Ellroy, but he also gives each story a remarkable twist, while embedding all in a mythological setting.  Rodriguez's genius is in finding effective means to reincarnate these stories digitally.  I have been a fan of Rodriguez ever since I saw EL MARIACHI when it first came out, a film that I still consider the best no-budget film ever made, and despite the cost of the film one that will stand comparison with most of the big budget films ever made.  I have followed his subsequent career with both delight and dismay, as he did a shockingly inferior Hollywood remake of EL MARIACHI in DESPERADO that was a pale imitation of the original, and then made a string of movies that were either good (the first two SPY KIDS films), interesting if uneven (FROM DUSK TIL DAWN), or perplexingly unsuccessful (DESPERADO and ONCE UPON A TIME N MEXICO).  None of these seemed to fulfill the enormous promise of EL MARIACHI.  This one does.  This is the kind of film that possibly signals the emergence of a very promising director to the level of a great one.  The movie truly is that good.<br /><br />The film features an impressive cast, but this is not an actor's movie and they add less than one might expect.  That is not to say that they are not used well.  Indeed, Rodriguez uses all of the superbly.  Some are almost unrecognizable under various prostheses, in particular Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro, neither of whom you would know was in the film unless made aware of it.  This film, in fact, represents something of a comeback for Rourke, who started off in the early 1980s as a hardboiled performer who seemed to have stepped off the pages of a Jim Thompson novel.  We've seen Bruce Willis do good things before (in addition to a lot of bad things), so his excellent job as a used up cop almost manically dedicated to preventing a young girl from being raped and murdered is no surprise.  Clive Owen, on the other hand, has been better in the past and will be better in the future.  One brilliant bit of casting was putting Jessica Alba in a key role (I'll skip the name because it would involve a spoiler).  I've always argued with friends that although Alba is without question one of the most stunningly attractive women in movies today, she is oddly not very good at being sexy.  Sure, she is sexy in that she has a face and body that are improbably perfect, but instead of radiating sex, she always manages to radiate sweetness and innocence.  You see her at length and you inevitably end up thinking, "You know, she seems like she has to be a really sweet soul."  That quality comes out here as well, and it tremendously adds to the believability of the story line of which her character is a part.  One actor whose presence is memorable even though it involved little contribution on his part was Elijah Wood as Kevin, who looks like a blend between a nerd and a manikin, but fights like a super ninja while sharing some of Hannibal Lecter's less appealing dietary habits.<br /><br />Each of the three major stories that are intertwined in the film revolves around a primary character acting as knight-errants.  In his foundational series of detective novels and stories, Raymond Chandler conceived of Phillip Marlowe as the modern, cynical embodiment of the medieval knight dedicated to fighting for damsels in distress.  Miller embraces this ideal completely in the three stories found here.  In Bruce Willis's sequence, he sacrifices everything to protect the innocent young Nancy.  In Mickey Rourke's amazing Marv sequence, a thuggish, seemingly indestructible, hideous brute of a man expends everything in order to avenge the death of a woman who has shown him a tiny bit of affectionate attention.  Clive Owen plays a man who struggles not merely for one woman but for a whole group of women.  Who said that chivalry is dead?<br /><br />Notice that I have gotten this far without saying anything about the technical innovations of the film.  Most will know that SIN CITY was primarily filmed by actors in front of green screens, with all of the backgrounds added through CGI.  SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW did this, though Rodriguez went so far as even to use digital cameras for the actors.  Some reviewers without having seen the film (look at a couple of the earliest reviewers here on Amazon, reviewers who clearly haven't seen the film) are so bothered by this that they automatically dismiss the film.  In fact, Rodriguez uses the CGI with great virtuosity, always using it to enhance and devolve the story, never to call attention to itself.  The CGI does give the stories much of the feel that one gets reading a comic, such as when Marv attacks two would-be hit men, shoving one into a brick wall, causing an indentation in it.  Unlike SKY CAPTAIN, however, the focus was always on the story and the characters, and not on the CGI.  The distribution company (Rodriguez is essentially his own studio, he and his wife operating on their own in Austin, Texas) complained about the film being in black and white, but it was a perfect choice.  There is a considerable amount of colorization, most of it to great effect.  For instance, in the opening sequence, a man is talking to a woman and mentions her eyes, and at the word "eyes" they go from black and white to a subtle green.<br /><br />I honestly feel that this film represents a turning point in several ways.  First, it might represent the complete shift from Robert Rodriguez from promising director to a full-fledged master.  Second, it could be the film that provides the model for all that follow in the correct use of CGI.  Third, it could serve as the pattern for future adaptations for the filming of graphic novels.  But all that aside, people need to see this because it is one of the best and most original films of the past couple of years.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>With some 600 reviews extant, I have no idea why I was sent a free copy of this to review, but I have to admit I'm genuinely happy that someone out there likes me.  The subject of this two-disk + graphic novel extravaganza is a film that dramatizes the Sin City graphic novel series written and drawn by Frank Miller.  Miller's storylines are archetypical noir set in a city where it is always night, and the darkest night at that.  People just plain don't come to good ends in Miller's work.<br /><br />The original release weaves four different Miller stores.  The Hard Goodbye is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke), a not-quite-borderline psychotic, who finds a moment of love only to have the woman killed as she sleeps next to him.  Revenge is slow in coming and not the least bit sweet.  Then there is a tale about Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ex-cop who takes on a child killer and goes to prison for it.  Years later he gets to wrap up the grim loose ends.  The Big Fat Kill finds Dwight (Clive Owen) pitted against a crooked cop (Benicio del Toro) who doesn't know how to stay dead.  Next thing you know all the women of Old Town are in a war. And The Customer Is Always Right is a short that offers little explanation but somehow brings the story together.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez's direction is brilliant.  Rather than remake Miller's artwork, he sets out to match it stroke for stroke.  This is one of those rare films where an adaptation of an artist's work is the next best thing.  Deft use of black and white with vivid splashes of color, capture the original's intensity, the framing and scene setting are inspired, and the casting is outstanding.  Even if you are put off by all the violence, sex, and harsh language, you will have to admit that as a piece of film work, Rodriguez has recreated Sin City perfectly.<br /><br />I prefer the original film to the recut and extended version though.  The original interweaves the stories, which gives the view not only a better sense of timing, but also highlights the connections between the stories.  In the newer version you experience the stories one at a time, and while this may make things easier to follow, the common threads in this film about the price of vengeance in a lonely world don't come through as effectively.  The interviews, commentary, and other extras are quite good, though, so this is definitely the version to buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>It's always a thrill to see a movie get the DVD treatment it deserves, and Frank Miller's Sin City: Recut - Extended - Unrated is a really fantastic package loaded to the gills with all kinds of good stuff.  If you're a Sin City fan, you'll want to just take a day off and indulge yourself in this ultimate Sin City experience - and it will take you the better part of a day to watch and go through everything this little box holds.  Even if you bought the regular DVD when it came out, I really think you'll want to upgrade to this special edition.<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with Frank Miller and his series of Sin City graphic novels.  When I first saw trailers for the film, all I knew was that Jessica Alba was in it, and that was reason enough for me to want to see it.  When you don't know Miller's work, the trailers for the film are hard to get your head around.  You're intrigued by the unique look of the film, with all the dark, gritty backgrounds and the selective use of color in certain scenes, but it isn't easy to figure out what the film is about, exactly.  When you do sit down and watch the film, you're just blown away: the whole look of the film is absolutely mesmerizing, unlike anything you've seen before; the cast is just full of one huge star after another turning in dazzling performances; the stories are dark and haunted and just draw you right in; but it's the characters most of all that captivate you.<br /><br />The film is really four stories assembled into one finished product.  The Customer is Always Right is a short introduction for what is to come - and then Marv takes over.  Marv is one of the most fascinating characters to come along in years.  He's a huge, ugly guy, a thug and killer you can't help but like and respect - and Mickey Rourke is simply amazing in the role.  Marv has the night of his life with a gorgeous woman named Goldie (Jaime King), then wakes up to find her dead.  Framed for the crime, Marv swears to find Goldie's killer, and he lets nothing stand in his way.  Even if it means dying, he's not going to back out - just because Goldie was nice to him.  There's plenty of violent action in this story, and Elijah Wood is surprisingly good as Kevin, an almost superhuman killer who eats his victims.  Then we're off to The Big Fat Kill, where Clive Owen and Benecio Del Toro steal the show, along with Devon Aoki as the beautifully lethal Miho.  She dishes out a lot of graphic violence, including a most excellent beheading.  Alexis Bledel lights up the screen with eyes you could dive right in to.  There's a fair bit of dark comedy in this one, including one incredibly funny bit you won't want to miss.  Finally, there's the story of Hardigan and little Nancy Callahan, a girl that good cop Hardigan saved from a brutal rapist/murderer before having the tables turned completely over on him.  Skinny little Nancy grew up strong and drop-dead gorgeous (like I said, I would buy the movie just for Jessica Alba), but she's still in danger - and only Hardigan can save her from That Yellow Bastard (basically a yellow Ferengi thanks to the damage Hardigan did to him eight years earlier -it's not easy regrowing a set of family jewels, you know - those side effects are brutal).  Bruce Willis is masterful as the tough and gritty yet sensitive Hardigan.<br /><br />It's impossible to truly describe these stories - you just have to see them for yourself.  The performances are so darn good that this movie actually gets better every time you watch it - and this special edition DVD gives you plenty of chances to do just that.  Along with the original theatrical release, you get the uncut version of the movie, split up into four separate, independent chapters; there's some 23 minutes of extra footage - including a couple of scenes that really help embellish the storylines.  You get two commentaries (one with co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, the other with Rodriguez, Quentin Tarentino, and Bruce Willis).  My favorite version features a recording of the Austin premier audience reaction; the depth of the dark comedy in these stories didn't really hit me full force until I was able to join in with that live audience atmosphere.  As if all that isn't enough, though, you also get a series of great featurettes.  Herein is where you truly learn to appreciate the film.  The vast majority of the actual filming was done in front of a green screen, and many of the actors who performed in the same scenes never even met.  And it was all filmed very quickly - all those great backdrops and that unique atmosphere made with CGI.  It's incredible to see just how this movie was shot and put together.<br /><br />There's nothing else out there remotely like Sin City.  It truly makes Frank Miller's comic come to life - for the most part, the movie mirrors the graphic novels themselves almost frame by frame.  Director Robert Rodriguez calls this an anti-movie; in a sense, Miller actually drew his comics in such a way that they could never be filmed.  Rather than adapt the graphic novels to film, Rodriguez went the other way - he adapted the film format to the graphic novels.  When you look at the movie in comparison to the books (and you get a copy of The Hard Goodbye with this DVD package), you'll see exactly what he means.  Sin City is truly an unparalleled, 100% complete success.  I just can't get enough of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>Author Frank Miller and director Robert Rodriguez bring to the big screen one of the most explicit, violent and character-driven graphic novels of recent years.  Based on solid performances by a bunch of hot-shot actors (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Rutger Hauer, among others), and with author Frank Miller giving the proper assistance to Rodriguez, "Sin City" is a masterpiece of noir atmosphere, since the very first scene to the apocalyptic and self-destructing ending.<br /><br />Violence fills every scene. The monochromatic, grayish shots are almost claustrophobic, and the violence depicted is so effective that you expect a splat of blood or a loose bullet to strike you in the audience.<br /><br />There are three "Sin City" stories in this movie, that somewhat come togheter at the end. The first one is about Jim Hartigan (Bruce Willis) an aging, close-to-retirement cop that investigates a series of rape-murder-kills, only to discover that the murderer is a very influent person. The second story features an almost irrecognizeable Mickey Rourke - the best actor in the movie -, a sort of unstoppable super-hero-like character, trying to avenge the murder of the only woman that gave herself up to him without charging anything. And the third story is about how Dwight and Johnny-Boy have a curious meeting that may break up the ballance between the hookers, the Mob and the Police in Basin City dark alleys.<br /><br />The direction, the final computer art and the casting is so good that I almost expected to see the text baloons coming out of the character's mouths in the screen. Great effort, great result.<br /><br />Grade 9.0/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>Great movie.  With alot of action, comedy, hot girls, and just such a really great movie.  I just got back from seeing it with my girlfriend she hated it but I dont care cause Ive sat through the crappy movies that she makes me see and I hated them so yea and I liked it.  I didnt really know anything about Sin City because I never read the books, but when I saw the trailer to it I was like Im so seeing it.  Really awesome movie.  Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Marley Shelton, Lisa Marie Newmyer, Patricia Vonne, Chelsea Bulte, Penny Drake, Lauren-Elaine Edleson, Natalie Hess, Ashley Moore, Sherrell Murphy-Ramos, and Katherine Willis are hot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just got back from seeing Sin City in a sold out theater and everyone walking out was talking about the many memorable scenes and performances. Mickey Rourke absolutely stole the show as Marv. Not only was his character the best of an amazing bunch of interesting folk throughout the film, but his story was also the strongest of the three. Other major standouts would have to be Elijah Wood in a silent, yet creepy role as the serial cannibal named Kevin, Bruce Willis as one of the few characters in the movie that proves to be more on the good side of right and wrong, Benicio Del Toro (great casting choice here: 2nd Best Performance Behind Rourke's Marv), Nick Stahl as a less creepy, but still effective version of a Kevin like pyscho, and Devon Aoki as the silent killer for the prostitutes. Now those are just the many standouts to me in a cast with only one semi-weak performance turned in by Brittany Murphy (but by her standards this is a decent one). There are also plenty of lovely ladies for guys like me to drool over, especially Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino who shows off her immaculate body. The visual look of the film is stunning of course and the direction is perfect. The violence might seem a little excessive, but it is so over the top that you will not be able to turn away. Great dialogue that stays true to the source and mananged to get the crowd I saw it with to chuckle at least a dozen times (better than most comedies I have seen of late). All in all, if you are of the male gender and you have not made plans to see this film this weekend, please stop reading this review and get to your local theater pronto. Sin City is a place I will be visting a couple more times before it leaves the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>2005 has not been a banner year for movies, if I have to sit through one more super-hero movie I think I'm gonna puke. Between big Hollywood bombs and remake after remake, you can imagine the joy I received from watching this incredible movie. About as flawless as a movie can be this is film-making at it's best. I am not very familiar with Frank Miller and his 'graphic' novels, but I am very tempted to do some serious catching up with the man!!<br /><br />Have you ever seen a movie with so many a-list actors in your life? and here is what really surprised me, some of these actors generally make crappy movies (Brittany Murphy) but they all shine  here, big time. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke get the most screen time and both excell mightily, I'm sure it won't happen but some oscar consideration for best actor should be considered for either if not both. Willis is at his best as a cop with a bad heart feeling his age trying to do good by his one true love, Jessica Alba, who plays a stripper with a big heart. She also is great in this, and thank god, because she followed this with 'Fantastic 4' why Jessica, why? Mickey Rourke, who I have always enjoyed, even in some of his more poor movies, is just stunning here, he plays this so well, he makes sure you will be thinking of this character weeks after you've seen it. I have now seen this three times and his portrayal of a man fighting all kinds of inner demons, not to mention a serial killer and a corrupt priest  (played very well and very creepy by Rutger Hauer) is something I'll never forget.<br /><br />Clive Owen is 3rd in the depth chart, but what a job he does, and I think he needed this, it makes people forget he did the awful 'King Arthur' he plays a cop trying to save his lady from a real low-life of a man played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro. I mean this man is such a total sleaze-bag, and Del Toro absolutely hams it up, I'm guessing he had a blast playing this role. Brittany Murphy, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, is pretty solid as Owen's girlfriend. This is the same woman who did 'Little Black Book' and 'Uptown Girls' so this was a welcome change, hopefully this will help her pick better roles in the future, cuz' she is very attractive and really not that bad of an actress.<br /><br />Moving on, some of the smaller roles are some of the best. Now this may seem strange to most, but I think Elijah Wood (yes, Frodo) should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He does not say a word, but his performance as the serial killer is down right scary. The facial expressions he uses are sinister and perfectly timed, you watch they way he "meets his maker" and tell me that didn't make the hair on your neck stand right up!!! Devon  Aki is Meho, another who does not say a word, but is enchanting, until she whips out of of her many weapons and does some really not so nice things to alot of bad men. This was followed by D.E.B.S. Devon.......again, why?<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is sexy as hell as Gail, one of Clive Owen's former flings, she too is a bad-ass and Nick Stahl is the son of senator Power's Boothe, both are scum-bags, but Stahl is just nasty, nasty, nasty. His scenes with Willis and Alba towards the end are sensational to say the least. Michael Madsen, Alexis Bledel, and Carla Gugino also co-star, and like I said earlier, all contribute in one way or another.<br /><br />My only tiny, and I mean very tiny, complaint is Michael Clarke Duncan, he is very unbelievable and his role lacked the edge and depth of every other character, so this is two poor showings in a row from him, as he was really bad in 'Daredevil' but no big deal as most of that movie was atrocious.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez, for the most part, is a visually gifted director, he has a special way of showcasing violence in a stylized way that few can compare with.'Desperado' is one of my all time favorites and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one of the better horror vampire movies ever made. Although I have not seen any of the 'Spy Kids' movies, I know from there commercial success and with talking to alot of kids that atleast the first two are very well done. So it's a real shame that I recently heard that his latest kids fare, 'Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl' was such a flop.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this movie, it is hands down the best of the year, and I really hope it is not forgotten around academy awards season. This is expertly acted and directed, and is simply one of the best-looking movie's I can remember. I hear there is a new version coming out, with extended scenes and the infamous "not rated" tag. So you can bet I'll be first in-line when the date is announced.<br /><br />acting.............5 stars, Rourke and Willis amaze, so does the rest<br /><br />directing..........5 stars, Rodriguez is so gifted<br /><br />special effects....5 stars, Not over-done, perfectly timed.<br /><br />action rating......5 stars, Amazing gun-fights, great chase scenes, suspense and a few one-liners thown in as well<br /><br />quality............5 stars, If I could give higher I would, incredible looking movie, no grain, no gliches, flawless!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>So, you watch movies to be entertained and that's what you get with this movie.  You never want to stop watching AND then you want to watch it again.  There is a lot of gore but, it's kind of abstracted by the comic book setting but overall it's a pretty rough movie.  Still, it was good enough we are planning to watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Robert Rodriguez is very clear in the helpful "making of" featurette that accompanies this DVD that he didn't want to bring his own vision of Frank Miller's famous 1990s graphic novels to the screen, but rather reproduce Miller's  vision as exactly as possible. Rodriguez formulates his cinematographic vision so carefully to the stunning black-and-white designs of Miller's stories that the live-action shots at times suggest exceptional animation, particularly in the film's early visual highpoints, a series of physical hand-to-hand battles between the hulking avenger Marv (Mickey Rourke) and the preppy ninja/serial killer Kevin (Elijah Wood) in a rainy midnight farmscape. Miller even advised the actors on their parts and took such a hand in the filming that Rodriguez wanted to give Miller sole directing credit when the Directors' Guild of America refused to list their names together; when Miller refused to take sole credit, Rodriguez resigned from the Directors' Guild so both their names could appear together.<br /><br />Like Zack Snyder's recent popular film version of Miller's THE 300, this is about as faithful a translation of Miller's graphic-novel vision to the screen as could be imagined. Miller's own layouts and storytelling is so cinematic that it translates gorgeously onto the screen. And, as with THE 300, the violence is so over-the-top and cartoonish its almost impossible to be offended by it. The great gushing fluids that come out of the characters here is not only ridiculously copious but at likely to be white or black (or, with one character, yellow) as it is red. More than anything else, this is an extended and gorgeous exercise in style. It takes what was once held as an offshoot of realism -- the Mickey Spillane-style noir detective fiction -- and spins out all its most baroque excesses to show its theatricality and artifice. All the adult women are gorgeous prostitutes or strippers; all the villains want to prey on little girls or innocents (sometimes literally); the heroes' eventual Jacobean punishments for their foes are as imaginatively and grimly excessive as possible. As gorgeous and florid as this all is, though, it's hard at times to see its point. None of the characters are real at all: their two-dimensionality is of course an absolute given of the story's artistic premises. And while the grotesque tortures and killings initially shock, through extended repetition they begin to lose any sort of effect on your senses. After a while all you can do is react to the visual beauty of the compositions, and even that gets a bit dulled after a while. Probably this would have made an extremely effective (and equally gorgeous) short film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>Sin City is definitely not for everyone. If a depressing, violent world with ambigious heroes and crime and corruption isn't your thing, you'll definitely like it even less with Sin City's stylized visuals and heightened gore, sexuality, and skewed morality. For everyone else though, this is definitely one of the more memorable films in recent years, and turns the genre of comic book adaptations into an artform. An all-star ensemble cast is directed by Robert Rodriguez (with Quentin Tarantino!) against a green screen studio set, bringing to life Frank Miller's acclaimed graphic novel series. It's a fantastic mix of the technical and creative, and leaves you wanting more after the film's finished.<br /><br />The recut, extended, unrated, etc. etc. dvd collectors edition is both good and bad. The bad is that recut and extended doesn't really amount to much, and you'll definitely feel cheated if you go in expecting a radically different film (though you can watch all the stories individually now). The good is that like the other Rodriguez dvds, this one's loaded with great bonus features. You know, the kind that's informative, fun to watch, and isn't promotional fluff. Plus the package comes with a digest sized version of "The Hard Goodbye" so you can compare the film to the source material. A great value.<br /><br />Those who enjoy Sin City (and you can pretty much tell right away from the title if it's your kinda flick) will love this dvd set. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>If the aim of the director was to emulate a comic book, then this is a success. There are no nuances here. Everything works like going from picture frame to picture frame. Even the color and dialog mimics the simplistic style and phrasing from a comic book.<br /><br />The movie is very violent but, this work is adapted from a very violent graphic novel. The violence should not surprise anybody. This is hardly for children.<br /><br />The stories are fun and suspensful. You will root for teh hero and wish nothing but pain for the villains.<br /><br />The best performance is from Micky Rourke playing a very violent thug that also has as soft place in his heart for women. He portrays the toughest SOB I have ever seen in film. I love the electric chair scene.<br /><br />This is a very daring, adventerous yet arty movie that worked, It should not be taken seriously.<br /><br />Other movies tried to be like a comic book (Dick Tracey, Batman, Superman) but this actually accomplishes it. The others are comic book inspired flicks butthis is actually a moving visualization of a comic book.<br /><br />This gets an A+ for the artistic effect and a B+ for the movie content.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I bought this on launch day for the UMD and DVD versions!  I bought a copy for my homedawg, DJ Honeybear, and the UMD version for myself!  I could not believe the cinematic brilliance of this movie!  Truely one of the best cinematic features I've ever seen in my life!<br /><br />Somebody else said "jawdropping video presentation" or words to that effect, and I would have to agree with that!  Clearly an award winner in this department!<br /><br />Just writing this review and reading the other reviews, is making me want to rewatch it.  I also will probably get the DVD special edition of this movie by this Holiday.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>Frank Miller's comics don't do much for me, and I generally avoid them. So, Sin City had nothing to actually compare to. It was what it was, as it was. And what there was, was damn cool. I liked the style and the stories. Stark, grim, gritty, desolate. Not the kind of thing I'd watch before going to bed, but reaching down into the viscera and doing some twisting and making you wonder what dark urges and impulses lurk inside yourself. Asking some troubling questions maybe. Very violent, but<br /><br />I'm all for that kind of stuff, and while for others the `comic' connection may be what turns them on, for me it's the revelatory character of it all. That should be sufficient to make it worthwhile for those who, like me, can handle material like the Fables series and Y, but shy back from other graphic stories, like Frank Miller's.<br /><br />My favorite of the stories is `That Yellow Bastard'. To me it's the most poignant and visceral. I'm sure other people have other favorites, but that's cool.  This is one of those flicks that can be a lot of things to a lot of people. Which is all good.<br /><br />Till Noever[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>The film adaptation of Frank Miller's "Sin City" graphic novel is one of the strangest film experiences ever. The visual style is unique, probably one of the first films whose images are similar to those in the books.<br /><br />However, the plotting is weak. The four stories that encompass the movie are too short, and when one ends, we immeadiately jump into another one. For a normal film-goer, this could make it a confusing movie.<br /><br />Another draw-back is that the film is just too graphic. Some of the violent images are needless, and seriously detract from the film.<br /><br />The acting is good, though. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King and Jessica Alba give some of their best performances to date.<br /><br />Overall, this is a strange-but-good film that will mostly appeal to fans of the comic book.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>First of all, this Robert Rodriguez film of Frank Miller's graphic comic books is mostly in B&W, not color as advertised.  This is ideal for the material, but may have accounted for deserted theaters the second week of its release.  It is a brutally violent film noir, co-directed and co-written by Miller and Rodriguez; Rodriguez, who also cut and photographed this baby, wanted a flawless translation of Miller's inky B&W comic book novels.  So, we have a movie that is 90% B&W and incredibly violent.  Let's get that out of the way up front.<br /><br />Basin City at night becomes a nightmare film noir city of awful violence and evil characters, in B&W with dabs of color now and then--a red dress and red bedspread, a woman with gold hair, a zombie with bald gold head, a blue car--in an otherwise B&W landscape.  The art direction and visual effects are stunning and make SIN CITY worth recommending.<br /><br />Rodriguez and Miller basically have three stories to tell that all take place in Basin City at night--(1) Bruce Willis as a retired cop with a bad heart who wants to save exotic dancer Jessica Alba; (2) a heavily made-up Mickey Rourke as a prizefighter out to avenge the death of his beloved girlfriend; and (3) Clive Owen in a very complex tale of Old Town prostitutes and a guy who wants to save one of them from psychopath Benicio Del Toro.<br /><br />You will probably either love or hate SIN CITY, and know which after only five minutes of screen time.  It is exceedingly brutal and nasty, but also has towering production design, stunning visual effects, and unusual characters.  It is the kind of movie that Leonard Maltin can hate, while Ebert & Roeper can give "Two Thumbs Way Up" to.  When it opened, the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE's Mick La Salle gave it ****.  If you like the Frank Miller comic books, you will probably find it a masterpiece.  On a too short behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD, Miller says he is floored by how faithful Rodriguez is to the source.  That is why Rodriguez brought him on board as co-director, which cost Rodriguez his membership in the Directors Guild.  Things must have deteriorated inside the DGA since Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly co-directed ON THE TOWN (1949) and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952).  (Reviewed from widescreen DVD, and rated "R" for sexual material and brutal violence.  It is for adults only.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I just came back from an advance screening Sin City, and I can tell you this is one salient reel of pitch film. Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century. It comes across like most of Frank Miller's writing, modestly fantastic for the comic environment, but steeped long and hard in the tradition of the underground crime writers of the 40's. Visually, the juxtaposition of the rich B & W with digital-hued technicolor makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>Computer graphic images that tell the tales in "Sin City" are not unique, as claimed by other reviewers, or even unusual. They've been used before, most recently in "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow." But they have never been executed with the  sophistication that directors Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarentino (who directed one scene) display in this pastiche of Miller's comic books --- err, excuse me, "graphic novels," in the parlance used today to elevate the stature of cartoonists by those unaware of the stature cartooning long ago achieved. The trilogy of Miller movies that Rodriguez plans must now be measured against this dazzling mosaic.<br /><br />It won't dazzle everyone, not with its dismemberments and disembowelments, castrations, misogyny (women are trashed or trashy), rampant immorality and corruption. But adventurers will sit transfixed by the three linked stories that pay tribute to film noir, the only way to film Miller. Violence, cynicism and outrageous behavior are his forte. All of the action, acting and direction are over the top and below the belt. "Sin City" is as sexual as anything likely to silence you in your seat this year.<br /><br />The stories are of an ailing cop (Bruce Willis) who rescues from a pervert (Nick Stahl) a pubescent girl who grows up to love him, an ugly ruffian (Mickey Rourke) who seeks the killer of a whore who loved him, and the protector (Clive Owen) of a whore (Rosario Dawson) whose gang is under attack by really bad guys. Plot points are resolved in a bath of brutality and bloodshed, exquisitely rendered in black-and-white CG images wed to live actors and accented with bright colors, mostly blood red.<br /><br />Heartthrob Josh Hartnet, a creepy Benecio del Toro and, as a cannibalistic killer, elfin Elijah Wood are in the remarkable cast. This is not an actor's movie. although Willis and Rourke give mature performances and the very British Owen is as hard-boiled as early Burt Lancaster. Rodriquez, who is inventing a genre here, has set casting, thematic and technical standards that heighten our expectations (Peter Jackson met them with his "Rings" cycle.) It is not an overstatement to say that "Sin City" is an amazing motion picture. Bizarre, but amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Simply stated this is the best Comic to Movie adaption ever produced yet.<br /><br />Usually Hollywood tries to re-create something that is already an established and popular media and ruins it in the process by changing the things that made it popular in the first place.<br /><br />Not here.....

I haven't read any of the graphic novels but this movie has made me want to. Beware, as it isn't for the faint of heart, as it contains strong violence but great humor like in Kill Bill. The movie is divided into 3 parts. The first one is concluded at the end. I don't want to give anything away but Bruce Willis plays a cop with a heart problem hunting a pedophile; Mickey Rourke is a BEAST ( he's huge) framed for murder; Clive Owen hunts down crooked cops and tries to save prostitutes from extermination. It's a must see and is original as it is in balck and white with color only appearing at certain moments. Reccomended for anyone that wants to watch a movie that's just absolutely AWESOME!</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Look, I'm going to be honest here. There's nothing I can tell you right now, in this review, that you haven't heard before in other reviews. There's also nothing that can be put in print that will ever do justice to this movie. You just have to see it for yourself. "Sin City" is simply the most entertaining movie I have ever seen in theaters. No one talked during this movie, that's how engrossing and just plain cool it is.<br /><br />"Sin City," inspired by the graphic comics by Frank Miller (who shares directing credits alongside those "troublemakers" Robert Rodirguez and Quentin Tarantino) will likely be unlike anything you have ever seen. First off, the movie is gorgeous, shot in stark black and white, with color making a few choice cameo appearances. It's a very violent movie, very over the top. Not only are people shot in the crotch and beheaded rather liberally, but there are two, count 'em, two swirlies! And there's chunks in that soup, people! Talk about down and dirty! The violence reaches a certain point where it becomes surreal and almost comical (much like the "Evil Dead" movies) and helps push the movie as the ultimate fantasy that it is. The movie itself jumps around a lot in time (a trademark of Tarantino, you can see where he had his hands in this) and plays out through a variety of seemingly unrelated scenes, that don't appear to link together until the very end. The casting choices were also very interesting. More seasoned actors like Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan and Michael Madsen appear alongside unpredictable and riskier choices like Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl (I'll never look at him the same) and Alex Bledel (TV's "Gilmore Girls"). Surprisingly, everyone does a convincing job in their roles, even though they are all just support to the real stars: the sex and the violence. Be warned folks, this is not a movie for your children, or even the faint of heart, to see.<br /><br />"Sin City" is really the ultimate movie-going experience. After you walk away from it, you will find yourself chattering about it endlessly. It leaves a lasting impression, and is destined for mega-cult status. Truly a film you'll need to see over and over again to absorb everything. If over-the-top violence and nudity don't bother you, I promise you will enjoy yourself at this movie. Believe the hype, this is an incredible film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Sin City (Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, 2005)<br /><br />A lot of people are going to hate Sin City. A lot of people already do, actually, judging by the reactions of the crowd coming out of the theater where I saw it Friday. Yet only three days after its release, it sits (as of this writing) at #112 on IMDB's Top 250, and at least a smattering of critics have praised it. So there are at least a few people getting it.<br /><br />Sin City is old-school film noir. If you're not a big fan of sitting in arthouses watching revivals of old Joseph Cotten films that were just discovered in vaults after being undisturbed for sixty years, you're probably not going to get terribly much out of it. Much of what the critics have criticized in the film, especially the shallowness of the characters, is very much in the style of traditional noir, and as such seemed to me to be strengths, and not weaknesses, of the film. Think of Sin City as an homage to Billy Wilder as much as graphic novel adaptations, and it'll make more sense.<br /><br />All that aside, the one thing the critics have agreed on is the style. And what style it has. Sin City is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in the past decade-- certainly since Begotten, back in 1991. Unlike Begotten, which struck the viewer with its continuing unwillingness to give you a complete picture of what was going on, Sin City revels in clarity. While much of the film's violence is rendered in cut-away drawn shots, as opposed to the live-action carnage one expects from Rodriguez, the sketched-out scenes paradoxically heighten, rather than mask, the brutality. (Don't worry, boys, the nudity is all real, even if it doesn't include Jessica Alba.)<br /><br />From the standpoint of the plot, your best bet is probably to think of Sin City as Pulp Fiction on steroids. Rodriguez juggles the plots in roughly the same way Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction, but without as much parallelism. There's really not much to say about the plots; this is noir. Plot is secondary to style. There are plots, however, rest assured.<br /><br />To try and cover all the actors in this film worth mentioning would take a thousand words in itself. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Nick Stahl head the list for the macho component, and Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, James King, Carla Gugino, Brittany Murphy, and Alexis Bledel get the top billing for the ladies. And I've just scratched the surface. There is a huge amount of starpower in this movie. (When Josh Hartnett and Nicky Katt are that far down in the credits, you know most of the film's budget was spent on the actors, right?) For the most part, the actors do their thing with liveliness, though there are a few stumbling blocks in the road. The biggest of these is Michael Madsen, which came as quite a shock given that only a few months ago I was praising him to the heavens for making Kill Bill vol. II such a pleasurable experience. A number of parts are overacted, but once again, it's expected in noir. Mickey Rourke, especially, chews scenery in a way that hasn't been seen much since Charlton Heston stopped being a rugged male lead.<br /><br />Simply put, you'll either love it or hate it. How did you feel about the original version of The Desperate Hours? If, like me, you thought it was both William Wyler and Humphrey Bogart's best work, you're probably going to get a real kick out of Sin City. If you thought it was boring and overacted, well, you get the idea. Me, I'd sit through it again right now, if I weren't sitting here writing reviews. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>One of the best movies of 2005, Sin City has action, horror, and spectacular visuals; all you need is a strong stomach and a twisted sense of humor.  I've never read the graphic novels, so I won't be doing a comparison to those, just a review from a happy moviegoer who loves it when style and substance meld together to form a visual treat like Sin City.<br /><br />The plot is simply mayhem and revenge, cops and criminals, in a dark world of concrete and sin.  There's lots of blood, Tarentino style, but most of it is in black-and-white so it cuts down on the squishiness.  The plot is not what you want to buy this movie for.  Buy it for the absolutely spectacular and stylized photography and visuals, and the stunning performances of the cast.<br /><br />Bruce Willis aptly and perfectly plays Hartigan, with his "Diehard-deadpan" style.  Mickey Rourke is legend in Sin City as Marv, I doubt you will recognize him at first.  The hardest, baddest, meanest, toughest, most vile criminal on the streets, and someone you can root for.<br /><br />Clive Owen (King Arthur) puts his arrogantly serious handsomeness to work as Dwight, a man not to be messed with.  Dwight's Valkyrie, Rosario Dawson (Kids, Alexander) as Gail, gives a stellar (and stimulating) performance in naughty lingerie and a deadly attitude.  Benicio Del Toro (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, Traffic) is excellent as Jackie Boy, a bad cop with a bad heart and a bad attitude.<br /><br />Nick Stahl (Bully, Terminator 3) is awesome.  If you liked him in Bully, you will love him in Sin City as Roark Jr, later to become the golem-like yellow freak.<br />And who can ever get enough of Rutger Hauer? (Blade Runner, Flesh and Blood, Ladyhawke, The Hitcher, etc)  Not me.  I love Rutger, and as Cardinal Roark, those deadly, cold, ice-blue eyes are soulfully used.<br />Elijah Wood (LOTR, Final Destination, The Faculty) is excellent as the psychotic, creepy Kevin; a part that you can just tell Elijah had fun with.  Jessica Alba (Dark Angel) can't act, but doesn't have to in the pretty part of Nancy.  Hats off to Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, The Scorpion King) as Manute and Devon Aoki as Miho.<br /><br />Sin City uses voice-over narration, a third party telling of the action you watch on the screen.  This movie is as good with the sound off as it is with the sound on.  Filmed mostly in black-and-white, the photography is reminiscent of Schindler's List, though 'List' used only one small splash of color and Sin City uses a bit more, the use of color is still limited to such minute and clever spatterings that the impact is still heavily felt.<br /><br />Using over-the-top violence, impossible feats of heroism, strength, agility, and prowess (Watch for Marv's driving scene and Miho's flying archery) and some very black humor, Sin City achieves a horror aficionado's Zen-like state of almost-nirvana.<br /><br />Really, forget the plot.  It's the photography, cast, acting, FX, costumes, stylization, props, and atmosphere that, alone, bring Sin City to five stars and beyond.  Sin City is a must-buy movie.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>I enjoyed Sin City, but I didn't think it was a "great" movie. Yes, the visual style was really innovative. And the dialog was often funny, in a Mickey Spillane kind of way. Mickey Rourke is the standout among the cast.  And I really loved the music. Great, moody jazz!  But the storylines were muddled and the characters were beyond stereotypes. And it didn't really need to be two hours long. So overall, I'll give it a rating of 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE RECUT, EXTENDED, UNRATED VERSION.<br /><br />=========================================================<br /><br />I have never been a follower of the comic book genre, and therefore the name of Frank Miller was new to me when "Sin City" came out as a movie in 2005. The movie left a very strong impression on me, I must admit. If the crazy car chases and hyper-violent scenes are not enough for you, perhaps the incredibly faithful transcription from one medium to another that the story has gone through, in going from print to screen, will leave you as speechless as it left me.<br /><br />This reissue of the original theatrical version comes with a slightly alternate (unrated) version of the movie, which was recut and slightly extended in an attempt to make it even more like the original book. If you doubt that a movie can be faithful to a comic book (perhaps disappointed by earlier attempts in some Hollywood blockbusters), you will have a chance to follow the entire "The Hard Goodbye" story on the screen simultaneously with the included graphic novel... you will be amazed, I promise.<br /><br />As for extra material, there's plenty to wet the appetites of most fans of the genre, Rodriguez and Miller. From cuisine lessons (how to cook Breakfast Burritos) by Rodriguez; to an accelerated green screen version of the movie, where you can fully grasp the technical complexities in its shooting -not too far from how Episodes I, II and II were shot, mostly in the digital world-; there's something for everyone. So sit back, relax (if the movie lets you) and enjoy the Recut, Extended, Unrated version of Frank Miller's "Sin City".</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>Stunning.  Simply stunning.  SIN CITY is, by far, one of the coolest action thrillers I have ever seen.  Watching it was like being thrown into the dark graphic novels that comprise Frank Miller's world: gritty, dark, bleak, and hostile.  It must have been a monumental task to film, judging from the featurettes included with the DVD.  The actors had to film almost entirely in front of a green screen, allowing the visual effects team to create the most intricate of backgrounds for each shot.  For my eyes, it is the ultimate noir piece.  Due to the computer backgrounds, there is perfect control over the lighting, black & white textures, etc.  Everything is controlled in this film (visually) right down to the smallest detail.  In turn, I think it is safe to say that Director Robert Rodriguez has done the best job of any director at bringing a comic book to the big screen.  This is not a corny adaptation with little men running around in costumes.  Rather than force the comic book world into the theater, the audience is dropped into that world.  The effect is stunning.<br /><br />Yet, despite the fact that the film is visually stunning, it does not rely solely on its effects to make the film.  The acting is quite good.  The entire group is perfectly cast: they seem ripped right out of the graphic novels.  In particular, Bruce Willis seems particularly suited to his role.  He belongs in this world.  But more so than any other actor, Mickey Rourke takes the cake.  He is a great character to open the movie with given that his performance and makeup job instantly set the tone for the entire film.  I hope to see more films working in this style and you'd better believe that Rourke should be at the top of the casting list next time.<br /><br />Even if you've never heard of Frank Miller or are not a fan of traditional action movies, SIN CITY will knock your socks off.  It is very unique and hopefully we haven't seen the last of its kind.  Of course, take my recommendation with a grain of salt: if you are opposed to graphic violence, you might be offended by the film.  Sin City is not the land of "It's a Small World After All."</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Sin City" is a live-action graphic novel that adapts 3 of Frank Miller's books for the big screen: "The Hard Goodbye","That Yellow Bastard", and "The Big Fat Kill". Actors were shot against a green screen, and all of their environment is computer generated imagery. The result is a fairly accurate representation of Frank Miller's graphic style, judging by the little I have seen of it. The film is high-contrast black and white with splashes of color. The visual style might be described as a caricature of classic film noir's low-key lighting. The story takes place mostly at night, often on shiny, rain-soaked streets. There is a stunning lack of detail and depth of field, which I found too simplistic for the big screen, but it resembles drawings on the 2-dimensional pages of a book. In fact, the entire film is a caricature of classic film noir, although Frank Miller and co-director/editor Robert Rodriguez are lesser visual stylists and bigger romantics than the artists of classic film noir.<br /><br />We are presented with three stories whose single common element is a bar called "Kadie's". Police Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis) has tracked an 11-year old kidnap victim to a city warehouse, where she is in the clutches of a perverse murderer (Nick Stahl) with powerful political connections. Hartigan can outwit and outgun the murderer, but defeating the corruption behind him will prove more resilient. Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a psychotic, intensely violent ex-con. When his girlfriend Goldie (Jaime King) is murdered, his search for her killer leads him to the dungeon of cannibal-murderer Kevin (Elijah Wood) and up the chain of corruption. Shellie (Brittany Murphy), a barmaid at Kadie's, is trying to get rid of her abusive ex-boyfriend Jackie (Benicio Del Toro) in favor of the better-mannered Dwight (Clive Owen). Dwight follows Jackie into "Old Town", a red light district ruled by the prostitutes who live and work there, with the intention of ridding  the world of Jackie's menace. But the ladies, led by Gail (Rosario Dawson), have Jackie in their sights as well.<br /><br />"Sin City" is the second feature film to place actors in an entirely computer-generated environment, and it suffers from many of the same limitations as 2004's "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow": one-dimensional characters and visual tedium. Like "Sky Captain", "Sin City" is fascinating to look at for about 10 minutes. After that it's dull, dull, dull. I was intrigued by the idea of CGI films for a while, but, having seen 2 of them at this point, I have to say that they cannot create anything close to the visual interest of photography. "Sin City" is essentially an animated film, and it's not a very good one. The characters are one-dimensional and thoroughly unengaging. They all have the same personality, and they all do the same thing. The droning of incessant voice-over narration is so grating that I found myself tuning it out. The project might have fared better as 3 short films, which would break up the visual and narrative monotony.<br /><br />On the bright side, if you want to see Frank Miller's work brought to life "Sin City" does that -more literally than for its own good. Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, as exotic dancer Nancy, generate some real charisma. But they are the only actors who do. These characters and storylines are not nearly sophisticated enough for a feature film, and neither is the CGI. "Sin City" is one of those rare films that had me looking at the clock every 10 minutes. I was profoundly bored. Watching the film has all the excitement of watching someone else play a computer game. You might have better luck if you consider it a live-action graphic novel instead of an actual film. Robert Rodriguez said, "I didn't want to make Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City'. I wanted to make Frank Miller's 'Sin City'." And so he did. The trouble is that Frank Miller's "Sin City" is not cinematic. Note that the film is ultra-violent and not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The DVD (Dimension 2005): The single bonus feature is a "Behind the Scenes" (8 1/2 minutes), which features interviews with Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, "guest director" Quentin Tarantino, and some members of the cast. They talk about the vision behind the film, but there is no discussion of technical details. Odd that we don't get more bonus features on a Robert Rodriguez film, but there it is. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish. Captioning available in English. Dubbing available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>I WAS SO RELUCTANT TO BUY THE DVD, AFTER READING ABOUT THE GORE, AND GALLONS OF BLOOD, ETC.

TALK ABOUT YOUR NOIR FILMS-THIS RANKS ALL THE WAY UP THERE WITH THE BEST. THE DVD IS BARE, EXCEPT FOR THE BRILLIANT, HILARIOUS, SHOCKING FILM, BUT THE MOVIE WAS ALL I NEEDED! THE DTS SOUND WAS REMARKEABLE AS WELL. LOVE IT OR HATE IT, YOU MUST SEE SIN CITY-YOU CANNOT HELP BUT BE ENTHRALLED AND ENTERTAINED FROM BEGINNING TO END.  BRAVO....................</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>One way that this film does this is by digitally affecting the film by providing it with unnatural color schemes that are identical to the ones in the graphic novels.  Now, the reality of the movie/genre/graphic novels, is a kind of hyper realism that doesn't feel realistic (this is fictional after all) although you know that some of the things that happen in the movie could happen and the film plays with these conventions well.  Noir is a genre that takes the audience into the mind of an everyday person and shows how they can be corrupted by sin, but still being a conflicted and basically good until their sin is found out and they're destoyed.  Well, in this movie there aren't many of these characters, most of them are sinners and gladly and accept the consequences indefinitely.  This is where the movie is the most interesting in the way that the color scheme both allows the action to go to extremes and get away with it because it presents an unreality and if you choose to view the perspective of the movie/graphic novel as the dream world of gritty noir characters than you have a good idea of what the film is like.  What's unexpected are how many portions of this film are so darkly humorous like when Benicio Del Toro's character is being drowned in the toilet by Clive Owen, it's completely unrealistic and we laugh at his plight because he deserves it and will do anything to get out of it, anything short of apologizing and backing off.  Yes, although this color scheme helps the film get past its aggressive, super-violent and gruesome content that doesn't mean you don't feel the effects of it.  They are still there, but you are always aware of the unreality and that somewhat deadens the effect and probably likens your reaction to the way the characters feel.  I felt the movie was as true to the graphic novels as possible even going as far as to call the movie plagiarism (That would be if Frank Miller weren't as involved as he is).  The movie is brilliant, if viscerally so, but although it is based on a graphic novel and anything slightly animated is bound to attract kids, this film is anything, but for kids.  I've mentioned the violent content without going into the more bloody details, but the sex is just as present and I'm not sure this dreamworld is one that you want your kids to know about yet, at least until they're older and have a better understanding of classic film noir, because as I said before this is a tribute and at the same time it's an update of the genre. Enjoy at your own risk.  By the way, I just have to give a shout out to Mickey Rourke who put in a great performance.  It's so big that it's almost too much for the rest of this film to stand up to.  I'm glad to see that he can still be used to great effect in films.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Opens up with a rooftop scene with a man and a woman...Josh Hartnett (Wicker Park) who plays a assassin and Marley Shelton (Valentine) who he kills. Then we get into more and more gritty, bloody, brutal and knockout hardcore stuff with 3 intermingling stories. Goes to Hartigan,played by a always rock solid Bruce Willis (Hostage), who rescues an 11 year old girl from the hands of a rapist, played by Nick Stahl (Bully) but Hartigan ends up on the recieveing end of a bunch of bullets landing him in the hospital. The first has Mickey Rourke(Once Upon A Time In Mexico) in a very very good comeback peformance as Marv who's love Goldie, played by Jaime King (Pearl Harbor) was killed by a silent assassin/cannibalistic psycho named Kevin, played with silent creepiness by Elijah Wood (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). Marv finds out that Goldie has a twin sister named Wendy, also played by Jaime King. So, Marv goes on a brutal killing spree in which he slices and dices everyone who gets in his path and ends up in a showdown with Kevin Boy. The electric chair scene was crazy!! Next up we follow shiny red converse wearing Dwight, played by a dynamic Clive Owen (Closer) who gets involved with a waitress named Shelly, played by Brittany Murphy (Little Black Book) and the corrupy cop named Jackie Boy, played by a insanely terrific Benicio Del Toro (The Way Of The Gun). Jackie Boy and his goons all get killed by some vicious hookers, led by Gail, a juicy Rosario Dawson (Alexander). They figure out that they killed a corrupt cop. My favorite scene in this whole movie would have to be when Dwight (Owen) is driving with a dead Jackie Boy (Del Toro)in the passenger seat and suddenly Jackie Boy starts to talk to him. The scene flips from different colors and that's the scene in which Quentin Tarantino special guest directed. Michael Clarke Duncan (Armageddon) and gang kidnap Gail (Dawson) for the head of Jackie Boy and it ends up in a major bloodbath. The last one is the rest of Hartigan's (Willis') story where he goes to jail for something he didnt do and when he is let go he goes in search of a fully grown up Nancy Callahan, played by the delicious Jessica Alba (Honey) and he has to save her from the treacherous clutches of The Yellow Bastard who was the rapist (Nick Stahl) in which he saved little Nancy from before and Willis "litterally" punches The Yellow Bastard's brains in and rips off his other head as well. Josh Hartnett is also at the end, like in the beginning, playing the same man/assassin as he appears in an elevator with hooker Becky, played by Alexis Bleidel (Gilmore Girls). Also starring Michael Madsen (Kill Bill 1 and 2), Devon Aoki (D.E.B.S.), Nicky Katt (Suburbia), Powers Boothe (Frailty), Rutger Hauer (Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Carla Gugino (Spy Kids Trilogy) and Frank Miller himself is in this...he's the preist whom Marv (Rourke) kills. Fast, ferocious and better then the crap that's been coming out for the past couple of months...although I liked Constantine. Frank Miller fans...trust me, you wont be disappointed...a knockout masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie, but with such a big cast I really could not refuse the temptation to see why so many big names would sign on. The movie opened simply, but I know from minute one that it was going to be a blast. The violence was so intense, but somehow not overpowering, at least not most of it. There were a few scenes that made me cringe; however, these were necessary to the power of the film. Having never read the books (although I hear that the movie is a mirror copy) I was a little shocked. I have seen worse, but this was coming from a "Comic book..." oh well. I loved the cast. Willis, Rourke, Alba, Dawson, Owen, and even Hartnett, Murphy, and Wood played it cool. I was also glad to see the emergence of some new faces, who actually got good air time! These included _2 Fast 2 Furious's_  Devon Aoki as the unconquerable Miho and the beautiful and extremely talented _Gilmore Girl_  Alexis Bledel as Becky, the backstabbing prostitute.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is unbeatable, the use of color is wild and brilliant; it accentuates the drama and gore to an extreme - bringing the characters to life. And yes, it is true, the majority of the women are hookers in this film, but they are far from helpless. I would recommend this movie to anyone old enough (and with an open enough mind) to comprehend the beauty in the madness. It takes formidable jabs at the hypocrisy that plagues the Church and the police, while glorifying the everyday, flawed, hero. It applauds loyalty and loathes treachery - important in a workable society. The more I think about this film, the more I think it may be - dare I say - Inspirational.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Hartigan (Willis) is a cop who is on his last case, saving a young girl from the a seriel rapist (Stahl).  Marv (Rourke), after finding love in the arms of Goldie (King), wakes up to find her dead. Dwight (Owen) is helping the hookers of Old Town cover up the accidental murder of Rafferty (Del Toro), and preserve the uneasy peace.  All three are residents of crime-ridden Sin City.<br /><br />"Sin City" is the most stylish movie to hit theaters since "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow".  "Sin City", however, has much more to offer.  Stylish and comic book-y, directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller deliver a film that feels live a graphic novel come to life.  Shot in black and white with some reds and yellows thrown in, "Sin City" engages the eyes as well as the mind.<br /><br />Willis, Rourke, and Owen are the stars in this ensemble cast.  Each embodies their characters and drives their respective stories.  The standout of the three though, is Rourke.  From under a large amount of makeup, Marv's story is the emotional core of the movie.  His desire for revenge against the people who took the only good thing in his life away from him is the best of the stories.<br /><br />"Sin City" is really an amazing piece of work.  I hope that more "Sin City" stories make the jump to the big screen, but only under Rodriguez's guidance.  One can't halp but feel that he really gets the source material, and has a passion for it.  I highly recommend "Sin City".</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>As you have probably heard, Sin City is based off of Frank Miller's "Graphic" novels, and yes, graphic is a very good word to describe this movie.  The movie takes place in a fictional city, maybe nieghboring Gotham City or Metropolis.  However this city does not have any real heros, per se, there are a few good-doers, but they are also crooks (with the exception of Bruce Willis' character, John Hartigan).  This city has been overrun by corruption and director Robert Rodriguez does a great job of creating a digital atmosphere of the City.<br /><br />For the most part, this movie plays out like a Quentin Tarentino film.  The movie consists of three stories, which are not in chronological order, that eventually intertwine with eachother.  The first of those stories is about aging cop John Hartigan trying to save young Nancy Callahan from a serial rapist.  Hartigan gets betrayed by his partner (Michael Madsen) and is set-up for the kidnapping and an alleged rape.  This story concludes at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The second story revolves around Marv (Mickey Rourke).  Marv is a big, ugly guy that has a beautiful girl come into his life one day and he can't figure out why.  Well, she is murdered and Marv is set-up for the crime.  This eventually spirals into Marv going on a hunt for the person who killed his "angel".  The hunt leads him to the home of a Senator and the most powerful priest in town.  With the help of some of the town's female escorts, Marv eventually gets face to face with the killer of his "angel" for a showdown.<br /><br />The female escorts also help out Dwight (Clive Owen) in the thrid story.  Dwight becomes involved with a waitress (Brittany Murphy) and has to deal with her one-time companion Jack (Benicio Del Toro), who is the type of guy that always has a posse follow him around for protection purposes.  Now a chase that leads into the Escort's side of town endangers a truce that was made with the Mob and the police.  Its Dwight's job to try to prevent this truce from ending and to prevent a sort of "mob war".<br /><br />All of the actors do a pretty good job with the roles they are given and seem to be comfortable playing those characters.  Marv is the character with the most depth of any of the many characters.  As mentioned earlier, Rodriguez has done a great job with this movie.  The city and the atmosphere of the movie are great.  Also the colorization of the film is also something that has never been done before.  Some characters or particular item have color, while the majority of the film is in a black comic book looking color.  The visuals of this film are the most impressive aspect.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to see this film.  It is one of the most original films that I have seen in a while.  Also, the film may have changed the comic book genre forever.  If you have a weak heart, this may be too violent.  Otherwise, if you enjoy action movies with a good storyline and great visuals, then you should definately check out this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Sin City is the first movie of 2005 to actually get excited about; it follows the source material 99.9%(which is astounding for it's extremely violent content).  I've heard comparisons  ranging from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars but really the film stands all on its own.  An amazing and altogether unique moviegoing experience that reawakens us to the incredible possibilities of film.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that we have Robert Rodriguez (and of course, Frank Miller) to thank for this.  The guy knows how to make movies like no other.  I was impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's fanboy fueled Hellboy last year and with Sin City we get an equally impressive and awe inspiring realization of an underground comic brought vividly, and brutally, to life.<br /><br />Sin City is comprised of three books, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard.  I could almost swear that for some minor deviances due to film constraints and the insecurities of Jessica Alba (really, it wouldn't have killed you to be topless as Nancy the stripper for cryin' outloud!) the movie is a frame for frame reenactment of the comics.  It helps to have read the books first, just to fully understand what is being done.<br /><br />In 1990 Warren Beatty did a superb job of bringing Dick Tracy to the screen and now, in 2005 we have Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wholly deserving of praise for their new noir masterpiece.  It's visceral, it's raw, and it's entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />The casting is top notch, Bruce Willis as Hartigan; the truly underappreciated Mickey Rourke as Marv; Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Nick Stahl, Brittany Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe-they all do fine jobs.  But it's Benicio Del Toro who has the standout part as Jackie Boy.  He's funny, vicious, and unsettling all at the same time.<br /><br />If you're looking for hard boiled, white knuckle action with insane violence (we're talking gleeful overkill here) look no further than Sin City.  The first must see movie of 2005 and a beacon of hope for the future of film.  I'm hoping this makes a killing at the ol' box office because there are more Sin City books ready and waiting for the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Sin City" is a black and white world, except when the blood is being sprayed around and then be prepared for lots of red or white or even yellow. Based on three of the first four "Sin City" graphic novels by Frank Miller ("The Hard Good-Bye," "The Big Fat Kill," and "That Yellow Bastard") and "The Customer Is Always Right" short-story from "Babe Wore Red" that was the test run for this project, this 2005 film sets the standard for what film noir will be in the 21st century and advances the cause of digital filmmaker even more than "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow." That film was pure eye candy, but "Sin City" is much too gritty to be that sweet. You are going to wince at some of what happens in this film and you might even turn away once or twice as the over the top violence hits you in the gut as hard as it hits some of the characters in the side of the head. But chances are you are going to love this movie to death.<br /><br />Frank Miller's "Sin City" is a world where the heroes can take a whole series of punches as well as deliver them, where justice has nothing to do with either mercy or the cops, and the system is crooked from top down to pretty near the bottom of the barrel. The dames are still worth dying for and some of them might even be goddesses, but others can defend themselves quite well, thank you. This is a world where protecting women is hard-wired into the psyches of guys like John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke), and Dwight (Clive Owen). If you fail to protect a dame, then somebody has to pay and in a way that will make the scum bucket think Hell is heaven when you finally let them go there. This movie is rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue, but that is an R that is a lot closer to NC-17 than it is to PG-13.<br /><br />Ang Lee tried to have parts of "The Hulk" look like a comic book, but that meant throwing several frames on the screen at the same time. But with "Sin City" director Robert Rodriguez knows that a comic book panel can be like a frame in a motion picture and visa-versa, so his solution was to embrace Miller's visual style and make him the co-director of the film (and give him a small role as a priest hearing his final confession). The "Sin City" were done largely in black and white, although sometimes white and black, and other times when the strategic addition of a single color as in the red of a woman's lips, the yellow of her hair, or the blue of her eyes. Sometimes the red is a cool looking car.<br /><br />This is the bloodiest film noir of my experience, so it is a good thing that when there is a lot of blood is it just as likely to appear as bright white or neon yellow as globs of the red stuff. But it is also evokes more bursts of laughter at the audacious violence and the perfectly timed one-liners, most of which will never work uttered in Dirty Harry fashion out of the context of the film. This is film noir in the tradition of Mickey Spillane updated for the Quentin Tarantino generation.<br /><br />The standout performance in "Sin City" is clearly Mickey Rourke as Marv, who is buried under so much makeup you keep assuring yourself that he is really in there somewhere. In keeping with the formula of the film Marv is both the most violent of the protagonists, giving taking somebody for a ride a whole new meaning, and the funniest, in both word and deed. Willis and Owen are both fine as the other two protagonists, but they are more the strong and silent types, neither as reflective nor as sardonic as Marv. Willis definitely has the world weary act honed down to perfection, but Owen seems a bit too mannered in his detachment in his story line and ends up finishing third in the hero sweepstakes. Elijah Wood as Kevin does not get to speak but still creeps you out as Frodo gone over to the Dark Side. Benicio Del Toro shows some nice comic timing as Jack Rafferty and Michael Madsen has not changed a bit as Bob, while Nick Stahl is scum of two different colors. Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth and Michael Clarke Duncan all take turns playing heavies and it becomes pretty clear Rodriguez could get just about anybody he wanted to do this movie.<br /><br />Of the women of "Sin City" it is Devon Aoki as Miho who stands out although she never says a word (she does not have to). Jessica Alba's best moments as Nancy are silent, although there is a change in why that is the case as we go through the movie. Rosario Dawson has fun going over the top as Gail, Brittany Murphy goes slumming as Shellie, and Jaime King plays two sides of the same coin as Goldie and Wendy. Alexis Bledel is certainly trying to get as far away from Rory Gilmore as possible by playing Becky, but I am afraid she does not get far in that regard. Then again, if you have read Miller's graphic novels you will be impressed by how Rodriguez has brought the stark black and white images of Becky, Hartigan, the Yellow Bastard and the rest of them to life on the screen. This movie is going to make a ton of money, Miller is going to sell a lot of copies of the new editions of his "Sin City" graphic novels, and hopefully it will not be too long before we get the next cinematic installment, which should have Johnny Depp playing Wallace in the "To Hell and Back" segment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>If this were a straight "movie review," I'd give Robert Rodriguez's (and Frank Miller's) "Sin City" five stars.  But this is a DVD review, so the product itself gets a mere four stars.  Buyers beware -- there is a "Recut, etc." edition of this DVD that has a heck of a lot more in the way of cookies, extras, and all those other little treats that make DVDs so much fun.  This is a "smaller" DVD with fewer extras.  Make sure you're buying the correct edition.<br /><br />On to the movie.  "Sin City" throws the audience into Frank Miller's ultra-hard-boiled comic metropolis, Basin City (aka "Sin City").  One wonders how this city functions, as its only inhabitants appear to be cops (generally corrupt, with one lone exception), prostitutes (generally, with one lone exception, with hearts of gold), criminal scum, and corrupt politicians.  I pity the schoolteacher who works at Basin City Senior High School.<br /><br />A revolutionary use of digital filmmaking technology allows "Sin City" to be told in the same stark black-and-white color scheme that makes Frank Miller's graphic novels so much fun.  There are occasional blasts of color, but generally black-and-white rules the day.<br /><br />Fans of Miller's graphic novels will see no surprises in "Sin City," other than the technical skill with which the filmmakers translate the comix to the big screen.  This is almost a shot-for-shot remake of three graphic novels:  "The Hard Goodbye," "The Big Fat Kill," and "That Yellow Bastard."  There is also a very brief short story that sort of bookends the film, based on Miller's short tale "The Babe Wore Red."  These are essentially the same stories exactly as Miller wrote them in his graphic novels, only slightly truncated for time.<br /><br />But the tone is all there.  Miller's Holy Trinity appears to be "Bullets, Booze and Broads," the title of his collection of short story comix set in Basin City.  And boy, does this movie bring the goods.<br /><br />I'll leave the summarizing of the plot for other reviewers.  I'll just give you my reaction.  "Sin City" is one of those movies that qualifies as a "Great Guilty Pleasure."  There's nothing "redeeming" or "important" or "telling a story that needs to be told" in "Sin City."  It's Dashiell Hammet's "The Maltese Falcon" for the 21st century.  The acting is all just this side of over-the-top, which qualifies as perfectly restrained given Miller's hyperbolic stories.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen . . . these are fine actors, but "they don't do nuance."  And that's perfectly appropriate.  There are several fine performances by the actresses, too, as Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba emerge as the most memorable amongst the bevy of beauties who live in Sin City's Amazonia, Old Town.<br /><br />All in all, "Sin City" is a thrill ride, the kind of movie where a man can describe his girlfriend as a "Valkyrie," and it comes across as perfectly appropriate, given the hard-boiled circumstances.  Check it out, but just make sure you're buying the right DVD edition.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>This one does follow the comics with no comprimises. If you like Miller's work buy this one.  I can only hope that the "Dark Knight Returns" is made into a movie. I'd love to see a "directed by Frank Miller" on that one!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>The look of this movie is like nothing I have ever seen, the pages of a comic book come to life on the screen. That alone is an amazing achievement and I wish I ended up liking the movie more than I did.<br /><br />There are 3 different stories told here, all taking place in the title location of Sin City. Mickey Roarke plays a low life trying to avenge the murder of a prostitute who showed him kindness. The second story has Clive Owen, a murderer, seeking revenge on Benicio Del Toro, a low-life cop, on behalf of his new girlfriend. The last tale is an odd love story between old washed-up cop Bruce Willis and the girl he saves from a psycho when she is 11.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful on paper, but not all of them give good performances. Some of the dialog and voice-over narration is very well done and some is laughably bad. The film overall is too long and drags after awhile. There is a lot of violence and blood which I have no problem with, except that it was overdone. There comes a point when it doesn't mean anything anymore.<br /><br />This movie affected me somewhat, but not completely. It is darkly beautiful to look at, even through all the blood.</p></br><a href="../users/A29IPLCBZ3LIGX.html">A29IPLCBZ3LIGX</a><br/><p>Pure Eye and Ear candy.

The color'd items popped into view: green eyes, red lips and occasionally white blood -- decapitations and body limbs flying not withstanding.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is hot in this picture, just seeing her in the cowboy outfit rates a couple of stars right there.  Bruce Willis, the tough, arrogant cop framed for a rape/murder he did not commit, a linking of tale and trouble, seemless in its execution.<br /><br />I liked the guy who was in love with Goldie, who was murdered in his bed as she slept; the mysterious fella with the Harry Potter look who ate the souls (and flesh) of whores -- shivering in me timbers, I was.<br /><br />[SPOILER} Some parts were hard to follow:  Who was the guy in the beginning who murdered the woman on the balcony and who later appeared at the end of the film to confront our traitoress in the elevator?  [END SPOILER)<br /><br />Frank Miller took "funny books" and made them exciting entertainment; later adaptation of 300 was his next big one.  Funny, I like S.C. better.<br /><br />Read the novel and then watch this film.

"Sin City" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes "Sin City," the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />"Sin City" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />"Sin City" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow," this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike "Sky Captain," it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three "Sin City" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />"Sin City" is not quite a "Kill Bill" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. "Sin City" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />"Sin City" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. An outstanding piece of work.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Blood. Blood. And more Blood. But the gore, gore and more gore is often minimalized by an effect that shows the splatter in off white and usually only the carnage gets red treatment. In fact, the entire movie was in some cool variation of black and white with red as the predominant color that does not get black and white treatment. Oh, there's an occasional pair of blue-eyes here and there and other brief color treatments, but the film is mostly in the funky black and white.<br /><br />Sin City jumps around a bit similar to Pulp Fiction. The jumping is actually effective and easy to follow. The movie is the story of the pursuit of a couple of serial killers...one pursued by Bruce Willis, the other pursued by Mickey Rourke...and the story of a network of hookers...and how the pursuit of the serial killers and the network of hookers all ultimately interconnect.<br /><br />Captivating, very entertaining, and suspenseful at times. An original movie with a great cast. Worthy certainly of a rental. If you have to own, you'll likely get more for your money with the recut and extended edition, so I'd opt for that.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>It's graphic book version of 'Kill Bill,' it's pitch dark, it's violent, it's nasty, it's whatever makes you sick, and it's very fascinating.  Not everyone would find the film that way, and I confess I am not a big fan of this film or Frank Miller's original books, but I still kept watching this brutal world where the revenge story of The Bride is enacted on everyday basis.<br /><br />Perhaps it is pointless to repeat the story after more than 500 reviewers pasted their own views.  As they said, 'Sin City' means the title itself, the city filled with crimes and violence, where the dark world of the original comic book comes alive.  Three stories, each of which are connected tangentially (ala 'Pulp Fiction'), features three tough guys: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen.  And all of their stories involve women, as old noir films do.<br /><br />[BRITTANY MURPHY SAID ... ] I would like to add something else.  Brittany Murphy, who came to Japan to promote the film (with Devon Aoki), during the interview with Yahoo Japan strongly recommended that those viewers who find the content too sick should wait for Mickey Rourke.  She said, 'it's 'meant to be funny.'<br /><br />Funny?  She said so clearly.  I'd rather say 'darkly funny' but she made a good point about Rourke.  Marv, played by Mickey Rourke, vows a revenge for a beautiful girl who slept with him just one night, and follows those responsible no matter what it takes.  As you see, the story itself is nothing new, just a standard noir one.  But it is the way of revenge or killing that matters.  Bullets are too ordinary.  You should be Hannibal Lector to claim originality in Sin City.<br /><br />[MICKEY'S SEMI-COMEBACK]  Among the various players gathering for this rare chance to become the comic book characters themselves, Mickey Rourke steals every scene in this film.  In fact, almost all actors are excellent ... I said 'almost' because Bruce Willis looks exactly Bruce Willis (perhaps that is not a bad thing), and Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, and Nick Stahl, all cast against type, are less convincing and impressive than Rourke, Owen, or Benicio Del Toro.<br /><br />As to the story and script 'Sin City' needs more re-writes.  Frequent voice-overs are annoying to me, and some materials are used too much (like torture and imprisonement). 'Sin City' is not as groundbreaking as 'Pulp Fiction' but is visually rivetting, no question about it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The most faithful comic to film adaptation of all time, Frank Miller's Sin City is brilliantly realized by maverick director Robert Rodriguez, combining Miller's gritty and pulpy stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) with completely rendered, digital backgrounds.  The three stories, although separate, are meticulously intertwined, and brilliantly brought to the screen with one of the biggest casts ever assembled for a comic to film adaptation.  Disfigured tough guy Marv (Mickey Rourke, perfectly cast), uncovering a plot orchestrated by a sinister cardinal (Rutger Hauer) while tracking down the cannibalistic killer (Elijah Wood, unbelievably creepy) and seeking revenge for the death of his true love (Jamie King).  Then, there is Dwight (Clive Owen), a good guy at the wrong place at the wrong time.  His efforts to stop the violent ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of a barmaid (Brittany Murphy) goes horribly wrong, and leads to a showdown with the girls of Old Town, and a stunner of a revelation that promises blood flowing in the streets.  The final story revolves around old cop John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and his attempt to take down a psychopath (Nick Stahl) who kidnapped a little girl, but he himself ends up in jail.  Eight years later, Hartigan gets his chance to save her again (Jessica Alba, hot as ever) in a climactic showdown with a yellow skinned psychopath.  The casting is excellent for the most part, including Rourke, Owen, and Del Toro perfectly cast as Marv, Dwight, and Jackie Boy respectively.  The rest of the cast, including Rosario Dawson, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, Devin Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Nicky Katt, and even Miller himself, give memorable performances.  Rodriguez (who shares the directing credit with Miller, and Quentin Tarantino even helms a scene as well) uses the comics as directly as possible: from using Miller's art as storyboards to using the dialogue almost exactly, Sin City is easily the most faithful comic adaptation of all time.  Brilliant, brutal, and breathtaking, Sin City is a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed Sin City! Yes it was violent and gritty, but it was real and wonderful. I loved the visual stuff, the plot and the storyline. I thought Bruce Willis, Mickie Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro were Brilliant! It reminded me of Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino had a little to do with this film and it shows)when you know the middle (because it is shown at the beginning), and you have to follow the story and arrive back at the middle and see it to the end. If you like movies like "Sixth Sense", "Pulp Fiction", and the "Others" (although that was not one of my favorites), you will understand and appreciate Sin City. Stated simply, everything is not what it seems.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>Sin City is a good movie.It's one comic flick that sticks to it's original orgin.There's no Batmans or Supermans , but you have comicbook characters that have their special powers mostly strength.Good flick , I'd buy it sooner than later.Get it while it's sixteen dollars.Quentin Tarantino only directed one part in this movie , don't be confsued.I must say after watching it 3 times already , I have to say it's the best movie of 2005 next to Batman Begins.I'm gonna watch it again after I edit this review at 12:42 am.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Nancy - that woman on the cover - she's just a nice, honest girl who takes off her clothes for a living. Just about no one else is that easy to place.<br /><br />This movie is the best in a lot of different directions. For one, it's at the top of the new noir. Everything and everyone has a dark edge; the good guys have a bad edge, and the bad guys have a really bad edge, and some of them are just over over the edge. Just about every scene is night, a dark time for the dark businesses of murder and revenge. And best, this isn't just one story, it's three or four that wind together.<br /><br />It's also probably the best comic book adaptation ever. The comic's original writer and artist, Frank Miller, was co-director, and he brought these stories to their dark, gritty life the way it needed to be done. The actors put in some memorable performances, too - Elijah Wood's "Kevin" is no hobbit, not even a little. The script is close to the original, but the visuals are so true to Miller's chiaroscuro art that it's incredible.<br /><br />This is also one of the most creative, pointed uses of color in any movie I've ever seen. It's black and white, with the emphasis on the black - like the characters themselves, there's not a lot of gray in the middle. That makes every spot of color matter, starting with that first red dress and soft mouth full of red lipstick. Goldie's hair, Cindy's eyes, that yellow b*st*rd, and blood. Lots of blood. Sometimes, though the blood turns black as death, or glows white like molten metal - the color (or lack) conveys the mood better than literality ever could.<br /><br />It's not for the squeamish, though. The hookers and strippers do their work out of sight, but the violence gets pretty raw. It's a raw story, though.<br /><br />And it's great. It's not at literate as the Maltese Falcon, maybe, but it's a comic book, and great within its kind.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>This was a wham bam thank you mam action film, you knew  with Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Dusk Till Dawn, El Mariachi)  it was going to be pretty good and it was and then some!!!<br /><br />Using the latest in cgi technology and mixiing with black  and white noir layering to emulate that of a classy crime  film, Sin City operates on all cylinders like a fine oiled  machine.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good on all from Mickey Rourke,to Jessica  Alba to Clive Olin.<br /><br />I never even read any of Frank Miller's book but the beauty  of the movie is that you dont have to, though it would help.

An all-star cast, a striking visual look, brilliant storytelling, a crazed and rather demented cast of characters, and well-executed action scenes. Sin City is easily one of the greatest films of all time (The Internet Movie Database also backs this up, considering it's on the top 250 list). This is easily one of the best films I've ever seen. It's not quite perfect, but almost.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The film is comprised of three separate storylines, all taking place in Sin City. One story focuses on a disgraced cop accused of kidnapping and child molestation after being framed by a powerful political individual who will not let his son be brought to justice for his crimes against little girls. Now the cop must protect a stripper (a girl who is now 19 he rescues at the beginning of the film from the crazed child molester.) and prevent her from being hunted down by her kidnapper, raped, and killed. The second storyline focuses on a man who is out to seek revenge for his murdered girlfriend Goldie, while running from the police because he has been accused of the murder by a powerful religious official, and now he has to find the killer and the religious official responsible for it while having the girl's twin sister tag along with him. The third story focuses a man named Dwight who defends his girlfriend from her violent ex-boyfriend and her Old Town Girls (A homicidal gang of gorgeous prostitutes who run the Old Town section of Sin City), when the Old Town Girls accidentally kills a group undercover cops, Dwight is tasked with getting rid of the bodies to protect their reign over Old Town and not anger the police and mobsters and have them come after them.<br />MUSIC: The musical score was excellent and fit the film perfectly through every moment.<br />ACTION: This film is modeled like an old black and white film, with small touches of color here and there. The action scenes are quite brutal and disturbing at times, but are loaded with shootouts and dismemberments of people. The action scenes were well done, but this film is definitely not for kids at all.<br />ACTING: The acting was really good, which is no surprise considering the all-star cast of people. The dialogue was also good, and it did feel believable. Unfortunately, I do have to complain that sometimes the dialogue got a little long-winded and dragged on. This is only a small complaint though, but it does put a blemish on this film.<br />OVERALL: This is a must-have for any DVD collection. This film is totally brilliant and well-executed in every regard.<br />THE GOOD: The striking visual style, the action scenes, the acting and actors, the brilliant storytelling, and the great music.<br />THE BAD: Moments of long-winded dialogue.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Not surprisingly most of the rumours circulating about this film (as it is with most films for that matter) were inaccurate. Not all, but most.<br /><br />It was supposed to be ultraviolent to the point where it could disturb some viewers. Not the case. Aside of one single scene everything else we've seen before on this violence level. In fact, to me this film worked more as a very dark comedy than anything else.<br /><br />Then again it turned out being very close to an art-noir film, something not included in all the talk before the film was released. It has all the characteristics of being artsy: clever and intriguing use of color, surreal city-scapes etc.<br /><br />Where it falters is (again not surprisingly) in character development. Keeping in mind that it's based on a comic, we should rememebr that when one reads a comic he builds the characters himself. You tend to attribute traits to characters as you read a comic or a book because your imagination plays a much more active role compared to watching a film. It's the difference of the medium that dictates this.<br /><br />In Sin City most of the characters are shallow with the exception of Bruce Willis who's given unequally more depth than the rest. At some point it all gets too close to a very stylistic but smallminded slug fest where body parts are flying away , various characters are blasted to smithereens, chopped or gunned down.<br /><br />But still the film works, mainly because of its unique premise that there's no hero on the good side involved. Everyone in Sin City is a doomy shady character, every relationship has a strong dark side, every mission has evil intentions, the whole city lives and breathes under dim ominous lights. That's the biggest success of the director and his crew, that they managed to bring acroos this atmosphere very convincingly indeed while delivering it with an artistic overtone.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings, Sin City is worth watching and if the other rumours are true (i.e the creators planning to turn this into a long lasting movie series) it's obviously bound for commercial success as well.<br /><br />But having spoken of very dark comedy, the very first 40 minutes where Mickey Rourke is involved are gonna draw some serious laughs from those with a more flexible sense of humor. This is a character where the word "unsubtle" applies with a vengeance.<br /><br />As far as Rodriguez is concerned Sin City is easily an improvement over Once Upon A Time In Mexico. There could be further development from him to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>Maybe I missed something by not seeing this in the theater; maybe the living comic book visual style of SIN CITY was so dazzling on a big screen that it obliterated any reservations about the sheer banality of its storylines. But I finally got a chance to see this film, a joint effort of graphic novelist Frank Miller and film director Robert Rodriguez, and was frankly bored by it after about half an hour (and I think I'm being generous there!). All the storylines---Bruce Willis' attempt to protect a young stripper (Jessica Alba), Mickey Rourke's attempt to avenge a prostitute's (Jaime King) death, Clive Owen's attempt to put down a thug (Benicio del Toro) and his misogynistic ways---are done in a film noir style that is unfortunately ALL style. There's no psychological depth to any of the characters as there are in other comic book adaptations (BATMAN BEGINS is an exemplary recent example); it's all just a soulless geek show. A fantastic looking, often atmospheric geek show, but a geek show nevertheless. If appearances are all that matter to you, than SIN CITY will probably be a ball (and the visuals are the only reasons I'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of just 1). But for those looking for something other than just fancy-pants visuals in a comic book movie adaptation, look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Three stories from Frank Miller's celebrated series of graphic novels are loosely intertwined here in what is undoubtedly a highly personal project for director Robert Rodriguez and co-director Miller. The film certainly captures the visceral nature of Miller's work, with its curious focus on genital mutilation and dismemberment (but is surprisingly coy when it comes to Miller's penchant for nudity). As an experiment in aesthetics, it works - it's fun, it's technically interesting. As a film for an audience of more than two? Well, that's something else. The three narratives are insufficiently connected for this ever to gel as a single piece, and whatever chance you have of immersing yourself in the Sin City universe is constantly undermined by the insistent use of voiceover narration. You're never allowed to fall into the world, but are instead distracted by a never-ending string of "hard boiled" one-liners that describe precisely what you're seeing on screen or could reasonably deduce from the performances if the camera were ever allowed truly to capture them. These could be interesting stories about complex, damaged people, but Rodriguez fails to get the most out of the material because he doesn't seem to trust it - nor himself. In his obsession to replicate the precise look of what's on the page, he fails to use more of the power of the screen - strong performances, real atmosphere, temporal and aural control rather than just visual style. It leaves me wondering why he bothered. If you're not going to use the power of the other register, why bother with a transposition? The result is a film that's technically accurate, visually stunning, but ringingly hollow at the core.  And violent. Violence is justifiable in the context of a story, but this whole piece seems overly cruel as a way of masking its lack of character, humanity and meaning.  And rather than growing out of the long noir tradition, it feels like a postmodern hijacking of it.  Worse, it isn't even hijacked for good reason - it doesn't add to the tradition, nor critique it, nor say anything new or interesting about it, nor refresh it by flipping it into an unexpected context (as Rian Johnson did so effectively with "Brick".).  Miller has said repeatedly that his central theme is love.  But in a town this self-indulgently violent and artfully superficial, it's hard to take that claim seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>This is a love-it or hate-it movie if ever there was one.  Most of the audience that I saw it with loved it, but my friend thought it was the worst movie he'd ever seen.  Of course, he's not into comic books.  The real significance of this film is that (with the possible exception of the Hulk) this is the movie that most captures the feel of a comic book.  Not only does it feel like "a comic book" - it feels like THE comic book, Sin City.<br /><br />Sin City is a series of black and white graphic novels in the "noir" style by Frank Miller.  Miller shares directing credit on this film, along with Roberto Rodriguez.  Not only was Miller on set every day but the film IS ALMOST A SHOT-FOR-SHOT TRANSLATION OF THE GRAPHIC NOVELS.  I've only read the first in the series, but I don't really feel the need to read the other two that this film is based on because I believe they will be exactly the same.  Rodriguez has used the panels from the comics as storyboards and re-created them as faithfully as possible.<br /><br />The film of Sin City is also the first film to capture the modern conception of comic book violence.  Remember the good old days when the term "comic book violence" referred to superheroes like Captain America duking it out and never suffering greater injury than a black eye?  Not any more.  In the adult, gritty comics, the emphasis is on pain, torture, sadism, and especially dismemberment - I lost track of how many characters get dismembered.  This is possibly the most violent and goriest movie I have ever seen.  Because it is mostly in black and white, blood shows up white.  Characters take and dish out more punishment than could ever be possible in real life.<br /><br />Possibly, the people who do not like this film are put off by its gruesomeness.  I don't know if the audience is meant to take pleasure in the torturing of the bad guys simply because they are villains.  Certainly, there are no "good guys" in this movie - just anti-heroes (with the possible exception of the Bruce Willis character).<br /><br />Also, people who are not into comic books may have a hard time with the film.  Most of talking in the movie comes from voice-over narration because 1) it is a nod to film noir and 2) it is an almost direct transcription of the comic book.  However, I've never seen voice-over used this extensively, and - as the movie Adaptation tells us - voice-over is a cinematic no-no.  Some people may be put off by it.<br /><br />Regardless, I've never seen a movie ANYTHING like this before.  If you're into graphic novels, film noir, or over-the-top comic-book violence - or just movies with an original voice - check it out.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE: This is NOT a movie for little kids and I was horrified to see parents taking their toddlers into the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Of all the comic-book movies that have been made, from Flash Gordon to The Fantastic Four in 2005, this is liable to score a premier spot in the `fan satisfaction' division. No niggling here along the lines of "Spider-Man shouldn't have organic web-shooters" or "Batman's parents shouldn't be shot by the Joker". This collaboration between two one-man bands, comic-book writer-artist Frank Miller and director-writer producer Robert Rodriguez, is as authentic to the source material as those cheapo '60s Marvel cartoons that panned over panels from the caricatures while narrative artists read out the word balloons.<br /><br />Like most flourishing comics, Sin City created a decipherable concrete-but-unreal humanity. Miller mixed a stew of thugs in trench coats out of Chandler or Spillane, a spice of the `bad girl art' that made paperback covers of the 1950s stand out from newsracks and a splatter of the manga-ish stylized goriness which encouraged movies buffs like Quentin Tarantino (who guest-directs one scene) have only recently discovered. The movie candidly matches the look of the comic: stark black-and-white images, with the occasional shocking or beautiful splash of rich color. Most modern noirs incline to the blacker side of monochrome, but Miller's scratchboard techniques, custom-made superbly by Rodriguez, often get the most impact out of white - the blank round reflections of a killer's sunglasses, crosses of sticking-plaster on a much-wounded face, arterial gushes of opaque blood.<br /><br />The movie script also matches the original stories virtually word for word. The original mini-series was about Marv (perfectly incarnated here by comeback kid Mickey Rourke) a relentless but sympathetic freak who avenges the murder of his love by taking on a grisly cannibal (a blank-faced, far-from-Frodo Elijah Wood). The film adapts this (later retitled The Hard Goodbye) and two of its follow-ups including The Big Fat Kill, seemingly blas&eacute; about the similarities among the plots and characters, convinced that the seductive imagery and picturesque citizens would grasp the attention.<br /><br />Be warned, though - this is not a movie for the faint of heart. The extreme violence does get a bit obtrusive, but you can say the same for Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO and others. But to point out its graphic nature is a moot point. It is classic cinema that should be seen and appreciated for what it is-pure entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Sin City takes place within a corrupt and criminal environment where evil and suspicious characters seem to rule the city.  Daylight never seems to reach this place where human transgressions seem to be the norm, as shadows and darkness enhance the gloomy milieu in which the characters exist.  This film is the very archetype of film noir as no one can trust anyone and death lurks around every corner.  The film's heroes are less than perfect with either a dark past or they suffer from some terminal condition.  Everything is perfect in regards to film noir, yet the world is as far as possible from an utopia as life is easily expendable and everyone is guilty of something.<br /><br />In three of Frank Miller's graphic novels Sin City has generated the foundation for the films, as the audience get the opportunity to follow three disconnected adventures.  These three adventures lead the audience into a dark place, an unwanted domain if it was real, but the black and white cinematography make it look and feel like the graphic novel that Miller created.  This makes the film tolerable, as the violence is extreme, detailed, and intense.  If Sin City was shot in the spirit of Spider-Man (2002) the film would be extremely gory, grotesque, and probably would not be allowed in theater throughout the United States.  Thus, as mentioned, the black and white cinematography makes the film tolerable and viewable, but it also surpasses the cinematography from other graphic novels by light-years, as it displays brilliance.<br /><br />The adventures are all divided up by the women in the story, which are an essential part of the atmosphere of the film.  None of the women seem to be over the age of 25 while they all are prostitutes with daring clothing revealing more than covering.  The prostitution and the sexually suggestive environment intensifies the sleaziness of the criminal milieu, which enhances the distrusting atmosphere.  However, the women in Sin City are no feeble women.  These women do not mind pulling the trigger when it counts, or swinging a blade if necessary.  Nonetheless, these women also bring out the little good and human compassion, if one can call it that, which is a rare commodity in Basin City where the stories take place.<br /><br />After the film's opening the audience is introduced to the cop Harrigan (Bruce Willis) who is about to make his final arrest before retirement.  This arrest attempt leads Harrigan to reveal the location where he can find a psychopathic killer that sexually lusts for torturing young girls.  He is also aware that the pedophile has recently kidnapped a young girl named Nancy.  However, this psycho-killer is not unknown to him, as he has slipped his grasp many times before.  The psychopath is the son of the mayor, and this could lead to some major difficulty for Harrigan through the mayor's influential powers.<br /><br />Following Harrigan's case, the audience gets to follow Marv (Mickey Rourke), an ex-convict with delusional tendencies and a beautiful parole officer.  Marv has just met and had his best intimate moment with Goldie.  When Marv awakens from his sexually exhausted slumber he discovers that Goldie is dead and the cops have already been tipped.  Angry and vengeful Marv escapes the trap in order to find the true identity behind Goldie's killer, which leads the audience into a blood splattered river that flows from Marv's path.<br /><br />Shellie's (Brittany Murphy) ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) instigates the third adventure where the freedom of the girls in the Old Time comes in jeopardy, as the truce between the cops, the mob, and the prostitutes is crumbling.  The hero in this tale is Dwight (Clive Owen), a criminal with a recent face job, who turns into the knight in shining armor, but much better than in King Arthur (2004).  This sequence displays the strength that the women possess when they decide enough is enough, which of course turns very bloody.<br /><br />There are several elements in the film that make this film brilliant, but one must begin with expressing gratitude to the casting directors Beth Sepko and Mary Vernieu who put together a splendid cast.  The cast consists of actors such as Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Jessica Alba and many others.  A couple of the highlights are Rourke's performance as Marv, as he brings out the dirty and nasty in a delusional criminal who is on a murderous destructive path while Del Toro's performance as Jackie Boy is simply excellent.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez who has directed several action films is a perfect choice to lead this project, as he also had help from Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino.  The scenes are full of speed, action, and nitty-gritty violence, which intentionally goes over the top with high frequency.  This exaggerated violence often seems humorous and will occasionally force the audience into laughter.  However, laughing at mutilation is hardly acceptable, which suggests that the audience is as guilty to the crime as the perpetrator.  This is a cleverly incorporation of the visual theme that no one is innocent, as all are guilty, even the audience members.  Furthermore, the heavy use of cerebral character monologues enhances the audience's cerebral participation in the film, as little is left for the imagination, yet it leaves the audience contemplating moral values.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>...the rest of us skip this movie.  I'll admit the best thing about the movie is the way it looks.  Rodriguez did an excellenct job in bring a comic book to life.  However, some things need to stick to their original medium.  I'm counting these illogical wrecks of mini-stories as those that fit in this catagory.  After Micky Rourke's short (the best one, IMHO) I was ready for this movie to end.  Clive Owens seemed miscasted, but Benico sort of saved the day on that story, but it was still riding on the so-so part.  After that, I'm thinking surely that's the end...BUT NO.  It keeps going and going, until I'm practically begging the DVD player, please no more.  Then there's just one more bit, that I was so close to pulling my hair out, that I was relieved that it only lasted less than a minute.  Oh, Thank God.  If over the top violence is what gets you off, then this is the movie for you.  If not, please, please avoid this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>The director took a little bit of Pulp Fiction and combined it with some of the gore of Kill Bill to come up with this highly entertaining film.  It is like a dark comic book come to life, shot in black in white, with color only used when the director was emphasizing something.<br /><br />The main actors Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis are all excellent in different ways.  All three are protectors of the women and act as dark knights to save them.  Additionally, Josh Harnett seems to be floating about as someone who murders troubled women.<br /><br />The special effects are wild, the violance graphic and the women are very hot!  Don't look for realism in this film because you won't find it.  It is more like a dark fantasy where guys can get shot a hundred times, get hit by cars, jump off buildings and keep coming.  Highly Entertaining and well worth watching on DVD because you can rewind things that you couldn't believe that you saw!</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>Sin City is based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, who is also the co-director. The movie is split into three stories: Dwight's, Merv's, and Hartigan's. Quentin Taratino is also a guess director.<br /><br />The movie starts off with Hartigan, a "60 year old cop with a bum ticker" and he is trying to save a little girl from being raped. He  ends up sacrficing himself for the girl, "a old man for a young girl". We cut to Merv's story, when a hooker is dead in his bed, and he has the blame placed on his shoulders, he tries to find the man that killed her, and avenges her. We then cut to Dwight, who is then thrown into the war between the prostitutes and the city police, They are seriously teething on the brink of war, and He must find a way to stop what could be deadly. Then, We are thrown back into Hartigan's story, 8 years later, he is in the same situtation, but the people have changed. He has to stop the Yellow Bastard from raping Nancy again.<br /><br />This movie almost didn't happen because The Director's Guild of America didn't want Robert Rodreqiuz to make this film, so he quit the quild, and worked with Frank Miller on this film, creating a page by page movie that makes you feel that the book had come alive on the movie screen. The acting is at its best, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis do their best acting, since their last best acting, and help shape and mold the movie. This is a prime example of esteemed originality, and hard work. It is a might fine film that can put you on a roller coster ride through the place that is called Sin City.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>The film is all about style.  It is a comic book brought to life.<br /><br />At first I was intrigued.  The characters are larger than life and the plot is about the hero trying to find the killer of a woman with whom he spent one romantic night.<br /><br />The film is shot in black and white and uses color to make its point.  Blood is always red.  And so is lipstick.  Eyes are green or blue.  And there really is a yellow bastard.  The acting is good too and the sets complement the film.<br /><br />However, Sin City lacked one important thing - a story I could get my teeth into.  The special effects and style overshadowed everything.  And I was left wondering what all this was about.  I watched this film for over an hour, hoping that it would make some sense.  Finally I fell asleep.<br /><br />Perhaps this film would be interesting to film students.  It certainly is a departure from the norm.  But I need more than experimental techniques to hold my interest.  I need a good story.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Sin City" is a black and white film recreation of Frank Miller's b and w graphic novels with every so often a vivid swath of colored eyes, blood, or some villainous single color. Someone's blue eyes will appear in stark color and thrust themselves at the viewer. The stories are grim, gritty, morose, tough-minded. There's plenty of action, violence, and the scenes are set up to resemble the comic book world, a close approximation of what you would see in a graphic novel. Quentin Tarantino was involved as a guest director so you know what to expect. Computer enhancement was used. Many of the scenes are evocations of the graphic novel drawings--turning the static page into the kinetic world.<br /> There are really three stories melded together, each section with its own hero played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen. The first and third parts come together near the end.<br /> The movie will make you uncomfortable, queasy, squirrely at times with its gritty realism, humorlessness, and starkness. The flick doesn't let up and give you a chance to breathe but keeps on its violent inevitable avenging pace. It's a melodrama gone spastic and ballistic. The avalanche of fateful action goes rolling on and buries the viewer who just hopes to come up for an occasional breath of fresh air. It's a claustrophobic, insular, crushing atmosphere.<br /> We're lucky all movies aren't made at this breakneck pace and with this intensitry, grittiness, and sense of futile inevitability. It's crime and punishment, avenging forces, and anti-heroes fighting against incredible odds. A movie for people with specialized tastes, but a worthy experiment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>I borrowed this from a friend and am shocked at how much I despise this movie.

Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. From this movie on, there are only two credible, if widely divergent, paths to take in bringing a comic book concept to the screen: "Spiderman 2", or "Sin City". One can make a movie as earnestly, beautifully real, full of genuine human feeling, and as lovingly put on screen as "literal truth" as "Spiderman 2", or one can make a movie as stunningly surreal and hyperbolically drawn as "Sin City", but most other attempts will seem poor pretenders. Not to belittle the critic's darling "American Splendor", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after "Frank Miller's Sin City". This movie will be as influential on future movie-making as the original "Star Wars" was in its day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I heard a lot about this before I went to see it at the theater.

Then I took out his other one."<br /><br />"Now, that's a mighty fine leathercoat your wearin'."<br /><br />- Hartigan takes down The Bastard, for the second time, while Marv goes coat shopping in "Sin City"<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez hits the nail on the head with this religously, faithful adaption to Frank Miller's cult comic book of the same name. Miller was very cautious as to whether or not he wanted to bring his comic to the big screen (he had been burned by Hollywood before with "Robocop 2"). But, it was full steam ahead when Rodriguez brought a CGI animatic of what the film might look like to Miller (the same CGI presentation was used to also lure Bruce Willis to jumping on board)<br /><br />"Sin City" is much in the same way & inspiration as that of "Pulp Fiction" (Quentin Tarantino directs one small scene in the film. A minor debt he owed to Rodriguez, since Rodriguez supplied Tarantino the score to both editions of "Kill Bill" for one dollar). If you like "Fiction" you'll love "Sin".<br /><br />"Sin City" consists of four stories that are taken a little out of context.<br /><br />The first two stories bookend the film. The first story has to do with a sociopath (Josh Hartnett), with "Sin City" segueing into its 2nd story about a cop (Bruce Willis) on his last day on the job, before retiring, trying to catch a child molester he's been after, called The Bastard. The cop gets in over his head when he finds out that The Bastard has family in high places.<br /><br />The 3rd story has a former boxer turned nutcase, by the name of Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is looking for the killer who killed off his favorite & only prostitute, Angel, & getting framed for the whole thing.<br /><br />The final story has a brutal cop and his buddies getting killed by a group of prostitutes, in Prostitute Row, a section of Sin City that is ruled by its prostitutes. The only rule is, is that cops can not be killed for any reason at all. Oops. The leader of Prostitute Row (a scantily clad, Rosario Dawson) & her boyfriend (Clive Owen) try to cover up the whole mess before the authorities arrive. They don't stand a chance.<br /><br />Sin City is shot entirely in green screen & on a soundstage no bigger than a warehouse. The handcuff fight sequence between Marv & the young psycho kid were shot seperately. Mickey Rourke & Elijah Wood never met each other until the films L.A. premiere!<br /><br />The look of the film is jawdropping. It looks exactly like the comic book, panel by panel (for those not in the know, the comic book is in black & white with some elements in color. I.e., a character says he drives a red Cadilac, you will see him drive a red Cadilac, but everything else on the page is B&W). At times I felt as if I was watching the comic book come to life. And it does.<br /><br />"Sin City" came out in theatres in early April '05 and will most likely be hitting DVD in late July or August, with everything including Marv's bandages thrown in. You'll need' em.<br /><br />With "Sin City" already recouping most of its budget expect to see more return trips to the City in the future.

Sin City is also a half-hour too long, brutal, and relentlessly juvenile; and it also sends some strange messages about the kind of violence that one is expected to endure on screen. It's hard to know whom the target audience is for this cinematic piece of pulp - it's certainly not women, the director, Robert Rodriguez certainly makes it obvious how he feels about them, and it's far too graphic for younger teens.<br /><br />The action takes place in a kind of monochromatic, noir black and white universe, with the occasional splash of colour, mostly blood red. In the opening scenes Josh Hartnett appears as a handsome, debonair hit man who approaches a beautiful blond babe. Everything is in cartoonish black and white, except her iconic red dress and blood red lips. They are on a balcony of a penthouse overlooking the crime-ridden hellhole of Basin City. After he quietly shoots the woman, the viewer is transported into three separate tales, each layered over the other, where morally ambiguous heroes take revenge on the scum that fester in mean streets of the City.<br /><br />In the first story, a craggy and weather-beaten Mickey Rourke, unrecognizable under lots of makeup, plays Marv, a brutish street fighter with the ability to dish out and take tremendous punishment (in the form of numerous bullets) and also leap off tall buildings without getting hurt. When Goldie (Jaime King) Marv's beautiful blond hooker is killed, he goes on a rampage to avenge her, which involves beatings, shootings, and various assorted decapitations. In the second story, Clive Owen, complete with foppish hair, is Dwight, a churlish yet polished private investigator trying to protect Old Town's sexily costumed bondage-like hookers, including statuesque ex-girlfriend Gail (Rosario Dawson), after they mistakenly kill a cop (Benicio del Toro). Ironically, the prostitutes turn out to need less protection than Dwight.<br /><br />Both these segments are book ended by washed up sixty-year-old cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis). His last hours of service involve saving an imperiled child from a rapist/killer (Nick Stahl) who is the son of a U.S. senator. He stops the serial killer, castrating him with a shot from his cannon-sized revolver, but the child soon comes back to haunt him eight years later as a stripper (Jessica Alba). She longs to go to bed with him, but at the same time, the hideously deformed killer, has now turned into a foul smelling inhuman beast and is still after her.<br /><br />There are lots of big name actors in peripheral roles including Brittany Murphy as a plucky, disaffected blond waitress and Elijah Wood as a murderous cannibal who eats one victim's surgically removed hand in front of her and mounts his other female victims' heads on his wall. There's the promise of child molestation, cannibalism, electrocution, and copious amounts of severed limbs. None of this is at all particularly offensive as it's heavily stylized and edited, but there's something sinister about a scene where the good guy can get shot in the chest ten times and still live to fight another day. Is the message that bullets will hurt but not kill?<br /><br />There's also something disturbing about a movie that unsophisticatedly portrays women as sexual objects in the form of glamorous whores, and as victims of violence - mere cannibalistic trophies with their severed heads hung on a wall. Sin City's moral dilemmas are bogus and engage no emotional response, and with the corpses gradually piling up, the movie ends up having no sense of fun beyond the filmmakers' twisted self-indulgence. What's more, their efforts to produce some kind of pop culture landmark moment ultimately come at the expense of audience stamina. Most viewers will be thankful when it all ends.

What he meant was that the window dressing - clothes, cars, music, setting - was more important than the stories.<br /><br />Today this phenomenon is so familiar that we frequently confuse veneer with content, especially in cases where there is no content - read Paris Hilton among others. In Sin City you find the full flower of this evolution.<br /><br />Rodriguez has taken the two-dimensional comic images of Frank Miller, (in combination with the one-dimensional characters and plots), and succeeded in making them even more two-dimensional. The film is visually mesmerizing, a spellbinding combination of heavily made-up actors, digital backgrounds, and high-tech special effects. It has the flatness of a comic, and like a comic, it is impenetrable.<br /><br />So compelling is the visual style achieved here that you quickly forget that the plots are moronic, the characters both ludicrous and repulsive, the reliance on exhausted stereotypes pitiful, and the entire vibe simultaneously decadent and corrupt on one hand, on the other self-satisfied and smug.<br /><br />Sin City is a place where everyone is guilty, every day is dark, and every problem is solved through violence. Rodriguez and Tarantino are still the two bad 12-year olds who must be separated because they are disruptive to the rest of the class.<br /><br />If you want to see another example of what happens when these two miscreants collaborate, check out From Dusk Till Dawn, a film which certainly has earned a place on any Worst Movies Of All Time list.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>thanks to Frank Miller, Author of original Sin City Graphic novels who have directed this movie too, Ciertaily it's one of the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen. I'm not a cinema guy cause I can't watch a movie from beginning till the end without delay and I used to play back some scenes to watch them again and if I couldn't, It would sure made me rattle and nervous. but this movie is different. I just coudn't stop it even to use restroom! It was great, the only problem I noticed was the boold. In some scenes it was white, in some it was silver and in another some it was yellow and that made blood scenes less impressive. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, they should've shown the bood in black, not any other colors. and another problem of the movie was the Junior, at the end. they colored him and his stuff in yellow. that was inducing that the Junior is an alien not a human. but he was a maniac human and this movie was not star wars or star trek. we expected to see living dead & Unvulnarable Superhumans but not an alien like creature. and the third problem is not this movie's problem in particular! It's the next sequel's problem and the problem is, they'd gathered all suitable stars in this movie. Bruce willis, mickey rourke, Benecio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba and more but most of them died in the movie. so there is not much stars left for the sequel I hope they make it as soon as possible. Cast selection for this movie was extremely accurate and I'm afraid for the next sequel if they'll not do their job as good as this one. and at last it's not bad to mention that this movie was a big credit for Rodriguez after making some horrible movies like Spy Kids trilogy and I hope he continue to making movie with his original talent that we've previously seen in Desperado (1995).</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>This movie is pure film noir. For those of you out there, struggling to find comfort in modern movies; you're barking up the wrong tree. This movie has all the things you would want from a black and white movie. Yes, the movie is shot entirely in black and white with a few collors here and there that often peirce through the screen. Blue eyes that catch. That red dress that needs to be blood red. Hair that looks like gold. Speaking of gold . . . this movie is 100% gold. It is the first movie you should buy right when you come out of someone's womb. Start your movie collection the right way with this piece of m ovie history. The characters are facinating and incredibly rich with film noir qualities. The anithero, the bully, the old cop, the corrupt ones, and the hookers that tie it all together. Watching this movie will never get old. It is absoluetly timeless. And if there is one person who doesn't like this movie . . . well, let's just say that he's got a lot to learn about film noir.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Sin City is a stylish comic turned movie directed by Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) and featuring a star-studded cast including Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Benecio Del Toro (Traffic), Jessica Alba (Honey), Mickey Rourke (Get Carter), Rutger Hauer (Nighthawks), Clive Owen (Closer), and Elijah Wood (the Lord Of The Rings trilogy). The movie also features cameos by Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile), Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), Michael Madsen (Kill Bill), Nick Stahl (Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines), Brittany Murphy (8 Mile) and many others. The film also features behind the scenes work by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) who revised some of the script and directed a few scenes.<br /><br />Sin City comes straight from the comic by Frank Miller, who also takes the helm as co-director. It's a gritty tale of lowlives caught up in disturbing tales of deception, crime and murder. What makes the movie so eccentric is the black and white effect in addition to the bizarre characters, especially Marv played by Rourke and Kevin played by Wood.<br /><br />I can tell that Sin City will be loved by many and hated by some, but it is bound to be one of the most memorable movies of the decade.<br /><br />Sin City is a comic book come true!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez' "Sin City" is a highly stylized adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who, along with Quentin Tarentino, assisted Rodriguez in the directing).  The film draws its look and inspiration from those old film noir movies from the 1940's, the ones set in dark, rain-soaked, crime-infested cities and narrated in florid fashion by a world-weary private investigator or gumshoe.  "Sin City" has that in spades along with deliberately arch dialogue, self-conscious acting and a visual schemata designed to knock your eyes out.<br /><br />"Sin City" tells the episodic tale of three virtually unrelated "super heroes" (played by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke) who take on crime and corruption in what is, as the title implies, a veritable metropolitan den of vice and iniquity.  The three leads are supplemented by Rosario Dawson, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer in various smaller roles.<br /><br />"Sin City" is far more about style than it is about substance, and, indeed, the story is the least engaging aspect of the film, often becoming repetitious and aimless and devoid of cohesion and unity.  The look of the film, however, is what keeps us interested.  Filmed primarily in black-and-white, the movie adds splotches of color at key moments and for various thematic purposes and relies heavily on rear screen projection to give it just that right post-modern/retro look it needs to be effective.  As in the "Kill Bill" movies, the violence in the film is graphic but so highly stylized that we never take any of it very seriously, although there may be just a tad too much dismemberment for some people's taste - though, strangely, the people who are killed never seem to stay dead for very long in this movie.  The art direction is less sensational than it is in many of these comic book movies, but the streamlined simplicity of the look keeps it from overwhelming the film.<br /><br />The child molestation theme that runs through the movie may be off-putting to some and it does result in a few queasy moments later on in the film.  Still, this is an intriguing and generally entertaining comic book movie that really does a good job recreating the look of the source material on which it is based.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>Miller was more than reluctant to see his novels (in comic book form) get made for the screen. After all, he'd worked long and hard to get his own series so why hand over the reins to someone else? Word is, he resisted tons of offers until finally he was convinced by a very persistent director, who went so far as to film a trial scene, complete with the ACTUAL ACTORS to be used in the movie. That did the trick.<br /><br />Okay, so that is a fine backstory but what about the film itself? Does it live up to expectations?<br /> Yes, and more so...just don't be surprised by the graphic nature of the film. Those familiar with Miller's work won't be - it is those who aren't who may have to make a few adjustments in their expectations, although I think they'll be entranced from the opening scenes.<br />  The plot is pretty much as you'd expect from a movie based on a Miller book. Murder, revenge, love, lust and corrumption everywhere. The world so gritty that you feel like showering after you leave the theatre, convinced the dust and grime are so thick that they HAVE to had escaped the screen. The film noir atmosphere is so thick that it makes for a heady experience, especially if, like me, you are a huge fan of film noir.<br /> If it sounds like I"m holding back on the plot details, I am..because viewers really need to come to this movie with fresh eyes, open to a new experience. You won't be disappointed but this movie won't be for everyone. Check out the word of mouth first, especially from people whose opinions you trust. My group loves this one.<br /><br />One of the most creative and innovative movies of the year, so far.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>After watching this movie, I look forward to get myself the extended version.  For enthusiasts, they would have already known that Sin City is based upon comics done by Frank Miller and from excerpt provided in behind the scene, Frank himself didn't believe a movie need to be made as it's perfect as it is.  However, Robert Rodriquez had an idea that he couldn't resist.  Rather than conforming the comic to the movie format, he opts to turn it the other way around, made a movie that looked like a comic.  This movie is a testament of why I love movie at the first place.  It's an escapism, away from reality and for those two hours watching it, I literally was brought into the world of Sin City and totally captivated by all those characters (mainly strong men that had soft spots for fallen girls and who would be their protectors or their minders, to undo the wrongs or to make things right).  It's a movie that ought to be seen to be believed.  It's that good!  It would be one of those movies that would sit on well with Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill I and II.  Highly recommended.  This edition is thin on extras, only a behind the scene which is brief by any standard.  Get the extended one if you may.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>which makes it worth seeing.

Welcome back Mickey.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Ok so I already wrote a review for this, a pretty long one at that and for some reason it never showed up so I'm writing another one.  I wanted to say that this movie, although not AMAZING as some would think, was actually really really good for what it was.  I walked into this movie with different expectations, not to say that my expectations were better, just different.  I've never read the comics and maybe thats why it was so weird for me, but it stayed true to comic style in writing and camera shot.  Because of the comic style dialog it comes across quite corny.  That aside, you have to look at this film with different eyes.  Your not watching a film, your watching art.  And I might say, Rodriguez paints one amazing picture.  The imagry, the omage to Miller, the tribute to the comic was really amazing.  As I said, I've never read the comics, but after seeing the movie I picked up a few at the bookstore and flipped through, and I might have to say that Rodriguez did Miller proud.  The plot is full of twists and turns, small subplots that interwine together all involving strippers, hookers, canibals and pedophiles.  The first story revolves around Marv whos been set up by canibals to take the fall for the murder of a hooker.  He sets out to find her killer and ends up taking the rap for it in the end.  The second revolves around (Clive Owen) who is defending his girlfreind from her abusive x and starts a war between the hookers and the cops.  The last revolves around Hartigan (Bruce Willis)who in the opening saves a girl from being raped by a pedophile and is shot (what apears like to death) but we see is really hospitalized.  Things happen and 8 years pass and he now has the chance to save the now grown up stripper (played by Jessica Alba) from the pedophile again.  The plot is really moot compaired to the briliant way the film is shot.  The violence is brutal and relentless, but since 90% is done in black and white it really isn't as graphic as it could be and for all you horny men out there who are vying to see Jessica Alba naked...she doesn't!  The film is really a hodgepodge of scenes and to be quite frank after walking out it took me a while to rememeber what happened to whom.  Don't go for the acting, don't go for the story, go for Roberts art...and you'll be happy you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Sin City is a collection of semi-connected scenes for various people in a wild city.  Prostitution, pedophilia, murder, and corruption, it's just like Detroit.  Aside from the plot, the cinematography is stunning.  It's trendy, mostly black-and-white, with emphasis on specific colors to draw attention to ideas or concepts that enhance or benefit the movie.  Whether it's the blue eyes of an "innocent" prostitute, the yellow deformities of a killer, or the kaliedescope of colors indicating confusion and tension, the vivid colors are the tip of an amazingly represented film.<br /><br />The movie starts with the murder of a young woman.  At first it seems pointless, but it's simply a buildup for the chaos to come.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays a detective trying to save a young girl from the grips of an evil pedophiliac.  Unfortunately for Willis, the villain has family connections and an appetite for murder.  It's up to Willis to stop the crime, and save a young child, and evidently, satisfy his urge for genital mutilation.<br /><br />The obvious star of the film is, Merv, the character played by Mickey Roarke.  He's a beast that has hideous facial scars.  He gets his dream woman, his Goldie, who "smells like angles ought'ta smell".  Goldie gets insidiously murdered, and it soon becomes time for Merv to start his streak of revenge.  What follows is a collection humorous, albeit unbelievable, scenes that lead to the true murderer.  Heads in the toilet, torsos used as emergency brakes, faces sent several feet deep into concrete, and axes to the groin, it's only the beginning of the carnage.  Once the cannibalization and nudity starts, the movie really gets into the "plot".<br /><br />Hot women!  Tons of murder and blood!  Religion!  More nut-sack mutilation!<br /><br />Eventually the movie leads to "Old Town", a place where prostitution is rampant - replete with the gratuitous semi-nudity - and the girls dish out their own version of justice.  It's where the entire movie ties in together, and all the scenes slightly relate.  A distorted sense of good's triumph over evil serves as a conclusion to the movie, as an absolute slaughter takes place and "order" is preserved.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Okay all of you comic book lovers out there, let's look at this film for a minute. And I don't mean check out the nice hooters on this gal or that, or watch neon-yellow blood spurt from a man's ...uh ...private area as they're ripped off. I mean LOOK at the film.<br /><br />I love to watch action in films as much as the next gruesome guy. I enjoyed the new release of SERENITY in theaters. And I thought PULP FICTION and KILL BILL were pretty darn good films, too. But they had a POINT!<br /><br />What was the plot of SIN CITY? Can anyone tell me? What was the purpose behind all this bloodshed?<br /><br />For me, there has to be action and reactions to bloodletting, not just violence for the sake of violence.<br /><br />I will say that it was engaging to watch the black and white sceenshots mix with bright colors, but that's just visuals. There HAS to be more.<br /><br />Now I'm not a tree-huggin', peace-marching, free-lover, but if you want to see part of what's wrong with our culture of violence, check out this film. It has sex, violence during sex, disembowling procedures, disembowling during sexy scenes, and ...oh yeah, more violence.<br /><br />Holy bashed-in brains, Batman!</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>I really thought this was going to be a pretty good one and it was going to take alot to convience me it wasnt great about less than halfway through it hit me this is not so good and thats how it was all the way through best way to decribe violence,nudity,weird and i like all of those things in a movie if done well,but this movie was i cant belive i would be saying this about this movie but boring.The 3 separet storylines didnt really intersect so it was never really intresting i was very disapointed I will give it three stars for originallity with the comic book look.I watched it on the DVD a was able to get an early copy(legally) just about every time someone speeks there is a high pitched ringing kind like when you have your ears checked its not my sound system was wondering if some else may have noticed this sound throughout the movie it is annoying.RENT especially if there is a special edition coming soon</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>No question I am a film noir, especially a crime film noir, aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various &lt;em>crime noir&lt;/em> efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that "speak" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been better left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy and need no additional comment from me as their plot lines stand on their own merits. Others, because they have a fetching, or wicked, for that matter, &lt;em>femme fatale&lt;/em> to muddy the waters also get a pass. Of course when I think of noir it is 1940s-50s noir, black and white in film and in the good guys-bad guys constellation with a little murder and mayhem mixed in to keep one's eyes open just in case there is no &lt;em>femme fatale &lt;/em>to muddy the waters. Neo-noir, such as the film under review, Sin City, is another matter, perhaps. Here's the why of the perhaps.<br /><br />Central to the old time &lt;em>crime noir&lt;/em> was the notion that crime did not pay and as stated above the bad guy(s) learned that lesson the hard way after a little mussing up or a date with a bullet. Kids' stuff really when compared to the over-the-top action of this three vignettes series on modern day good guys versus bad guys. Three separate male characters, all tough guys and guys you would want to have at your back if real trouble headed your way, are trying, trying within the parameters of common sense or believability, to clean up slices of Sin City. Sin City as the rather obvious name implies, is in the grips of corruption from the top down, including in virtually every civic institution. Our avengers are trying to cut a wedge into that bad karma by individually, one, tracking down a bizarre, politically connected heir whose thing was slice and dice of very young girls, two, avenge the death of a high class call girl who was kind to one tough guy, and, three, keep the pimps and cops at bay in the red light district where the working girls have set up their own Hookers' Commune.<br /><br />All of this doing good is, of necessity in today's movie world, linked up with, frankly, over the top use of violence of all sorts from cannibalism to barbaric death sentences, well beyond what tame old time noir warranted. Apparently the succeeding crime waves since the 1940s have upped the ante and something like total war is required to exterminate the villains. That and some very up-to-date use of cinematography to give a gritty black and white feel to the adventures. And also a not small dose of magical realism, suspension of disbelief, and sparseness of language to go along with the plot and visual action.<br /><br />But here is the funny thing, funny for an old-time crime noir aficionado, I really liked this film. Why? Well go back to the old time crime noir premise. Good guys (and then it was mostly guys- here some very wicked "dames" join in and I know I would not want to cross them, no way) pushed their weight around or tilted at windmills for cheap dough or maybe a little kiss. They got mussed, up, trussed up, busted up in the cause of some individual justice drive that drove the "better angels of their natures." Guess what, sixty years later, a thousand years advanced cinematically, a million years advanced socially (maybe) and these guys are still chasing windmills. Nice, right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>While the new Robert Rodriguez film, Frank Miller's Sin City, is not a horror movie, it isn't not a horror movie. (Yep, I got A's in English.) One of the coolest things about this tres cool movie is, you can't pigeonhole it. Punching, kicking and slashing its way through every genre imaginable - chiefly film noir, comic, mystery, action, drama, romance, and thriller - Sin City has more severed heads, dismemberments and cannibalism themes than The Silence of the Lambs and Freddy Vs. Jason put together. I loved it!<br /><br />It is based on author/illustrator Miller's series of graphic novels of the same name. The plotlines include elements from the stories The Babe Wore Red, The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, and more. Like the phantasmagoric storybooks, the lush yet stark look of the movie is achieved by using satiny black and white enhanced with splashes of color. Early buzz has Miller's fans thinking that only Miller fans will glom onto the cinematic Sin City. Not so - I'd never read or even saw one of his books in my life before viewing this dark delight, yet I was on board from start to finish. It's only April 1, but I can easily say that Sin City is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />A metropolis bled morally dry, Basin City is the site of three torrid tales that follow several larger than life characters through their lives and, for some of them, their deaths. Each one is a man on a mission that takes him down a rabbit hole to an urban nightmare of seedy alleys, strip clubs, into cheap motel rooms, and around winding back roads to rescue, defend, or avenge a woman.<br /><br />Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a no-nonsense cop who, after saving a little girl (Makenzie Vega) from a brutal child-rapist named Junior (Nick Stahl), is punished for his good deed and spends the next ten years in a solitary prison cell. Once released, Hartigan has cause to thank heaven for the little girl who's grown up in the most delightful way: Nancy (Jessica Alba) is now a lasso-swinging exotic dancer who's fallen deeply in love with him. But Hartigan and Nancy's troubles start all over again when Junior reemerges (now as a Max Schreck/Nosferatu styled creep called Yellow Bastard).<br /><br />Marv (Mickey Rourke) has a churlish countenance, but at his center is a heart of Goldie - Goldie (Jaime King) being the pulchritudinous prostitute who was murdered after their one glorious night together. Marv makes it his quest to hunt down and kill her killer. This is the flagship story, and it's wonderfully infused with Rourke's pervading presence (though they might should have lightened up on the prosthetics a tad; he doesn't look like a real person).<br /><br />Another story in the anthology follows Dwight (Clive Owen), a red Converse-wearing, trench-coated Weegee'esque newspaper photographer who has a hand in committing a most unfortunate murder and then must go to great lengths (and depths!) to cover it up.<br /><br />While the anthology ostensibly follows its male residents, Sin City would be dull indeed without its firecracker female characters. Following film noir and classic detective novel convention, the women are kicked as often as they're kissed - but they give as good as they get. Dangerous dames line the city's highrise rooftops like beautiful but deadly gargoyles, protecting their turf from all comers. Tough cookies, hookers, strippers, and cocktail waitresses abound, as do Kill Bill styled assassins (Devon Aoki's "Miho" would give Chiaki Kuriyama's "Gogo" a real run for her blood money), barely-clad lesbians, and the female trophies of a literal head-hunter. Miho's pimp is played with fishnet panache by Rosario Dawson.<br /><br />The Big Sleep wakes up in a hi-def, CGI world with glorious results, akin to film noir on acid. Rodriguez famously chronicled bootstrap moviemaking methodology in his book, Rebel Without A Crew; while he certainly had a lot of help with Sin City (Miller co-directs and cameos as a priest, while Quentin Tarantino also helms a short, gruesomely comic passage), you can definitely see his stamp here. You can hear it, too - as per usual, he composed most of the score himself. Even with his cinematography, Rodriguez faithfully reproduces the chiaroscuro palette of Miller's novels. The screenplay (also credited to Mr. R... does this guy do the catering, too?) tempers the characters' cynicism with believable flashes of hope and sentiment.<br /><br />Dialogue and 40s pulp noir voiceovers are punctuated with clich&eacute;s and gallows humor even as explosive, stylized violence unfolds onscreen. The cast of dozens all nosh the scenery, even when they don't have a word to say - the mute, lethal and utterly vile villain, Kevin (Elijah Wood), is a character you won't soon forget. Smaller roles with Rutger Hauer, Carla Gugino, and Powers Boothe are also sure to resonate with audiences.<br /><br />A famous line from a classic noir film matter-of-factly says, "There are eight million stories in the naked city. This has been one of them." Sin City has at least three, but here's hoping for more in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Movie is a little annoying, and is overkill as far the violence is concerned, pretty graphic, Rosario dawson is super hot, other than that, there is no incentive to watch, I felt like I was being dragged to through another Quentin Taratino-ish flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>In Sin City you will get to see violence in such an explicit way, it isn't shocking anymore. After a couple of action scenes<br /><br />with Mickey Rourke you'll just look at the violence as if it is fun like Tom and Jerry. When you reach that mood the cartoon based movie is definetely nice to watch, especially with so many colourful characters being there. However Sin City should<br /><br />have been at least 30 minutes shorter as Rodriguez needs to use his brilliant trick with the violence for 3 story lines. After the second story line his trick I would have liked to see something else, but this is where the movie let me dow a little. (SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>The first and most important element of any decent Sci-Fi/Action movie is a good script with strong characterisation, plausible dialogue and a believable motivation behind the lead characters. Without these, the film invariably descends into a campy parody of itself, and that is precisely what's happened here.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how closely this movie sticks to the comics that spawned it - when you move to a different medium you need to make changes to reflect the move (like the cut-down character backgrounds in the X-Men movies, or the plot tweaking and omission in the Harry Potter series - two extremely successful sci-fi/literary adaptation franchises), and sadly, 'Sin City' seems to think it can get away with having the actors spout the same kinds of dialogue as they do in the comics.<br /><br />This doesn't work for several reasons. On the printed page, we need to have things spelled out for us that comic art - particularly the kind of comic art contained in the Sin City books, a hugely graphical and stylised look - can't capture. Character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - all of these are things that comics more often than not need to have as printed text, and in the comic book medium, this works. On film, these things - character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - are all possible to achieve with visuals - facial expressions, body language, montage sequences, and so forth. The movie of 'Sin City' has its first major failing, then, in that the characters - grim and gritty men and women of action and consequence - wax lyrical over themselves, their current situations, and their previous histories - until they end up sounding like pedantic Drama majors about to embark on their first audition. The Valkyrie speech? The White Light line? The entire opening monologue? Three of the most horrendous offenders that are so full of their own self-importance that it makes the rest of the script surrounding them pale into mundanity - which isn't too much of a problem since it was all pretty mundane to begin with.<br /><br />The second problem with 'Sin City' is the amateurish use of spot colours, here and there, to suggest a tie to the excellent style of the comic books. 'Schindler's List' used this ploy to great effect, but sadly, here it just looks overdone. Not that this is a bad idea in theory, but thanks to some pedestrian direction (particularly in the first and second stories) it seems to be there just for the sake of it, as opposed to highlighting anything actually important. Case in point: the blue eyes of the young hooker in the second plot are just annoying because there aren't enough worthwhile close-ups of her face to make the colour stand out. It becomes a mere annoyance noticing these small splashes of colour against, it must be said, an overall rather effective visual style of high-contrast black and white areas.<br /><br />Direction is run-of-the-mill action fare.<br /><br />Performances are forced and difficult, particularly the action movie veterans like Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. It can't be much fun having to deal with such clunky dialogue as this. They do their best but sadly, as is the case with the more traditionally artistic actors like Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro, fail to deliver the mawkish, over-the-top lines with anything other than palpable disbelief.<br /><br />Two stars for a brave attempt is all I can award this movie, such a potential wasted and with such a horrible, forced script, it's lucky to get even that. Pick up the comics instead, they're far more rewarding and not half as annoying.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Rule #1  Children do not belong in film noir.<br />  While most classic black & white film noirs are about a single man in a big city or country-side mixed up in something they can't get out of, this modern film noir tries something different.<br />  It's black & white, but uses the green screen for computer-generated locations to give it that comic book look.

In Sin City, he plays "Jackie Boy".<br />  Elijah Wood shows off his karate moves.  Powers Booth plays "Senator Roark".  Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner [1982]) is "Cardinal Roark"  Josh Hartnett (Halloween H2O [1998]) also makes a couple appearances.<br />  Michael Madsen who we have seen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EDVNNU">Die Another Day</a> (2002) plays "Bob" in Sin City.<br /><br /> Update: Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, will to be released October 4, 2013.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>My Friend gets all these DVDs from Singapore, so I went over to his house to watch this movie and I loved it!<br /><br />The S/FX are amazing, especially the fact that this is in B/W with a splash of color! It has 3X story, and the blood looks so cool.<br /><br />But one thing- the UNREALISIM. It's a bit rediculous (I.E. The guy getting shot a zillion times and surviving and The guy surviving being hanged), but C'mon! It's just fiction!<br /><br />The story is about a B&W city called Sin City, and anything can happen! Jackie Boy is the best character, and he's so funny! I like his quotes (you're gonna love this baby).<br /><br />So see this today!<br /><br />UPDATE<br />3/7/05<br />So far only 2/9 ppl found my review helpful. WTF?? I wrote you a long and amusing review but u hate it. WHY?</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>Nudity in the first 10 minutes.  Plenty of killing, blood, torture, and miscellaneous violence.  All the female actors are hot, buff and under 30 (and many naked).  The male actors range from Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Mickey Rourke, & Bruce Willis to youngster in the Charlie Brown sweater, Elijah Wood.<br /><br />Definitely one of those movies for the boys that they'll all run out and add to their little DVD collections right alongside  Star Wars, LOTR Trilogy, Constantine, Matrix, The Professional, Ronin, etc.<br /><br />The "Marv" character and storyline was the only reason I gave the movie 3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>So hungry I am for originality. So hungry I am for filmmakers with a unique vision and the know-how to give us something new and MEMORABLE!!!!!  SO HUNGRY I AM FOR MORE SIN CITY!!!!!<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you Frank Miller, Robert Rodriquez, Quentin Tarantino and everyone else who had anything to do with this BEAUTIFUL film. Beautiful? Yes! It is. Violent. Grisly. But, beautifully shot and designed. From the rain, to the snow, to the faces, to the colors and yes... the blood.<br /><br />All who were involved with Sin City earned some serious brownie points with me because you gave us what we all have been hungry for, for so long. You took us and our imaginations to a new place. You told us stories that pulled no punches and kept us on our toes.<br /><br />In a slew of Non-original, cookie-cutter, same old same old films, mixed with all the lack of new idea remakes, SIN CITY proved to me that the film business still has a pulse.<br /><br />Sin City, with a phenominal cast (Mickey Rourke may have saved his career here), delivered on a phenominal level. With its 60s style and Humphrey Bogartish delivery, it packed a tremendous punch of creativity, design, grit and grime.<br /><br />With it's beautiful black and white colors and the occasional splash of red, it moves like a painting... with 3 intertwining stories of the inhabitants of Sin City. The low, the lower and the even lower... with an occassional splash of righteousnous.<br /><br />Yet, after watching Sin City, I couldn't help thinking that there were so many more stories to be told. I want to see more, and I want to read Frank Miller's books now.  I want to see Senator Roarke get what he deserves!!  He has to!<br /><br />This movie is great. It really is. If anything, even if you don't like violence, hitting the play button, YOU WILL see something new, original and CREATIVE.<br /><br />Finally... I'm only giving it 4 stars because the DVD is sorta bare bones... Surely, the special edition will be coming soon! Hopefully!</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>This past Sunday, I went to see Sin City, another in my recent binge of comic-book-based flicks. The film is comprised of three main stories. One features an unrecognizable Mickey Roarke as a reformed ex-con enforcer-type, who's been set up for murder. Another features Bruce Willis as an about-to-retire straight-shooter cop, who takes the fall for a nasty crime he didn't commit. The last features Clive Owen as a defender of the Old Town ladies of the evening, who run into a spot of trouble when they off an abusive, seedy chap who turns out to be a cop. There's a large, talented, well-known cast...except for Jessica Alba, who's nice looking but I'm not yet convinced that she's picked up any acting chops.<br /><br />The movie's cinematography has the feel of a comic book, right down to its core. Everything's noir-ish, in primary comic-book colors, with odd camera angles that give it just that right feeling. The dialog is similarly stylized, and it's also pretty crude at times...not for younger children. Lots of stylized, noir-ish violence to be seen here as well. Just for reference, there's nowhere near as much violence here as in, say, Kill Bill Volume 1.<br /><br />All in all, I was pretty pleased with the movie. Surprised by how will Roarke did; it's been a long time since I've seen him in anything. Worth seeing...but don't be taking your kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I really liked and loved this movie. And I knew when comes to DVD, I would buy it for sure for my DVD collection ,but this DVD very simple and plain. Not double disk or DTS or nothing an all...if u really love this movie like I did,Wait a while till end the year I am VERY SURE they going to come with DTS or Superbit Or Dir cut,I am going to wait for sure to get the whole McCoy. These days they do that with most movies, Then after few months they come up with all loaded stuffs on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>Did you guys know there was an invention a few years ago called color television?  So what if it is a comic strip? Did you know its cheaper to make a movie in black and white? Quentin Tarantino is laughing all the way to the bank on this one, and don't give me the "he was experimenting, trying to make a comic book, made a revolutionary new idea" statement. The old 70's spider man series did this concept ages ago.<br /><br />Anyway. Some of the mini stories are interesting, some where silly or boring. I am not a big KillBill fan either. I like Quentin Tarantino when he does stuff like "from dusk till dawn"<br /><br />Sin city might be worth watching once, but I would not see it again. Loved the violence though :)</p></br><a href="../users/AGI3VJ0I04QO7.html">AGI3VJ0I04QO7</a><br/><p>I wanted to like this film, i really did. But it just reaked of some lame video game storyline all linked together. It is true to the source material but when adapting a comic to another formal you need to adjust it to that format. This has not been done here. In essence you get a moving graphic novel. If this was to be adapted to a novelisation would the source material be used so literally. I think not. This film was all style over substance. Bad story, lame characters, lame action. It gets one star for Rutger Heurs great performace.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>I am probably running a bit counter to the main stream with this but really this was over the top. We have one character have his arms and legs sawn of and then he is eaten by a dog. There are two castrations and a character is killed by having his head bitten to a pulp. And these things are done by the characters who called loosely be described as the goodies.<br /><br />There does seem to be in a number of films a growing pornography of violence. Hostel, Wolf Creek, aspects of the 24 Hours series and this. Repulsive violence as an end in itself.<br /><br />Now of course this does not mean that the film is not directed by someone who knows what he is about. It is not to say that the actors are less than skilled or that the dialogue and voice over are effective and professional but really there must be some point when things just get a bit gross and I think that this film has reached it.<br /><br />In the real world police work is a grind. Police have to painstakingly catch offenders and try to construct a case against them. The majority of offenders will commit small time offences and be stupid. Police then have to try to develop ways to catch bigger time offenders when small time offenders have tipped them of as to who is there boss or who supplies them with the drugs. This requires hours of phone taps, trying to stick up minor offenders and the like so that they will roll over and pot the big guys. Not the sort of thing that makes an interesting comic book.<br /><br />Comic books are interested in battles a bit like the World Championship Wrestling. People dressed in leotards with some playing the role of good others evil. With comics like Superman or Batman the villians are usually caught in the act and the action is all about a fight over apprehension.<br /><br />To create viewer interest things are made simple. There are good guys who look nice and who we are given parts of their back story so we feel for them. Batman whose parents were killed by a criminal. Spiderman whose de-factor father died as a result of a robbery. The Punisher whose parents.....come to think of it they are all the same.<br /><br />Now in Sin City the technique is to have villians so bad that not only do we want their deaht but we want them slowly tortured to death. (There is one exception but that involves women who are scantilly clad and carry around guns.) Thus the villians have to be cannibals who not only eat their victims but cut of bits of them while they are alive and eat the portions with the victim eating on. Now whilst this is possible, (Said to be a Japanse atrocity towards the end of the war.) it seems to me to be a transperent plot devise to justify laothsome behavour.<br /><br />America is now the country which seems to think that torture is okay. That kidnaping and locking people up in Cuba without trial is okay if there is a slight suggestion of wrongdoing even if no one is sure. One can see that films like this might be either reflective of the mindset or the cause of it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>I have to admit I have never read a Sin City comic, I am a comic book fan but that is one series I've never been all that interested in reading.  When I heard about the movie being made I figured I'd see the movie and if I liked it enough then I would read the comics.  Well, let me say this if the movie is any indication of the comics, then as far as the comics go, no thanks I'll pass.<br /><br />"Sin City" follows three different storylines that really don't have much to do with each other.  One storyline focuses on an old near-retirement cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who is trying to save a young woman named Nancy (Jessica Alba), who as an 11 year old he saved from the same man that is trying to rape and kill her now.  The second storyline focuses on Marv (an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke) who after spending the night with a girl who winds up dead the next morning, goes on a rampage to find out who killed her and why.  Third, is the story of Dwight (a very wooden Clive Owen), a shady man with a mysterious past who now spends his time trying to save his new girlfriend from a crooked cop/ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />All of the storylines work decently on their own, but really don't belong in the same movie together.  Other films have used the format of having separate storylines that intertwine with one another with great success, "Traffic" would be a prime example, but "Sin City" is not one of these films.  Supposedly each of the three storylines had much more footage that was filmed and edited down for time constraints.  Now if a director's cut appears and the storylines get fleshed out then maybe this would be a somewhat better movie.  Even if that happens there are still several things wrong with this movie, the script is very clunky and sounds as if it came right off the pages of a comic book.  Some things just sound better when you're reading them in a comic and not using them to tell a story within a movie.  Another problem would be the acting, it was way too wooden from almost every actor.  I presume this is how director's Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wanted it, though the reason eludes me.<br /><br />On to some positive notes, there was some humor in the movie that helped lift certain moments in the film.  Another positive for the movie is the special effects, since the movie was filmed entirely in front of a green screen the CGI backgrounds were flawlessly mixed with the actors, unlike the terrible "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" that attempted the same trick.<br /><br />All gripes aside, "Sin City" is an alright movie, and I'm sure it stays incredibly faithful to the source material and for that I respect what has been created, but the movie as a whole, just didn't light my fire.  If you are a fan of the Sin City comics then I'm sure you will love this movie, but you will probably be left wanting to see the separate storylines fleshed out a bit more.<br /><br />"Sin City" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593963149">Sin City</a> graphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co-director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard-boiled, crime-infested world of Basin City and its cynical inhabitants. This 2005 film takes a visual cue from 2004's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IIPIK">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</a> by green-screening the backdrops and using digitally-produced images as the landscape, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and white <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QM8G">Schindler's List</a>). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as "Special Guest Director" though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225482">Death Becomes Her</a> (which coincidentally starred Bruce Willis).<br /><br />The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esque Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004XMV6">9 1/2 Weeks</a>, Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall, a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona) and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character.<br /><br />The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career before <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067IZ3">Traffic</a>. Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch. Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer.<br /><br />All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over its two-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow. But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride. The incremental value of the two-disc Collector's Edition DVD set over the standard <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTX">single disc</a> will depend on whether you have become obsessed with this cult film since there is only a behind-the-scenes featurette on the single disc.<br /><br />Disc One contains the 124-minute, theatrical-release version with an excessive three audio commentaries. The first is with Rodriguez and Miller, who focus mainly on the book-to-screen translation and benefits from the author's perspective. The second has Tarantino and Willis join Rodriguez, and the focus turns to the technical aspects of the production even though Tarantino's contribution to the film is marginal at best. The third commentary track is actually the recording of the audience reaction at the movie's Austin premi&egrave;re in order to replicate the experience one would have had at the theater. The remaining extras on Disc One may seem superfluous if you already sat through the first two commentary tracks. Six featurettes are offered - a five-minute short on how Miller and Rodriguez got together ("How It Went Down: Convincing Frank Miller to Make the Film"); seven minutes on Tarantino's contribution to "The Big Fat Kill" segment ("Special Guest Director, Quentin Tarantino");  seven minutes on the vintage 1950's cars used in the film; en minutes focused mainly on the weaponry; nine minutes with special makeup effects supervisor Greg Nicotero on how the looks of the principal characters were achieved; and finally, nine minutes with costume supervisor Nina Proctor about the stylized clothing. There is an odd feature on Disc One, "Sin-Chroni-City Interactive", which allows you to pick characters and locations and get a timeline view of relevant events. Disc One ends with two theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Disc Two contains the 147-minute version of the film advertised as "recut, extended, and unrated". The additional 23 minutes amount to expanded cuts in each episode which allow them to be presented as separate short films. This gives you the option to watch the film as an integrated whole or separately. Each segment has its own menu of scene selections. From a story standpoint, the incremental value of the footage and flexibility is marginal at best. Five more featurettes fill up Disc Two - a twelve-minute short called "15 Minute Flic School" in which Rodriguez shares behind-the-scenes information and basic tricks of the trade; ten minutes where the entire film is shown in accelerated fashion to show how the actors had to improvise in front of green screens; a 17-minute piece on Tarantino's shooting of his scene; and most dispensable, nine minutes of a concert from Willis and his band the Accelerators at Antone's nightclub in Austin, and six minutes  of Rodriguez sharing his recipe for "Sin City" breakfast tacos (seriously!). Beyond the discs is the complete Sin City graphic novel in printed form, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593072937">The Hard Goodbye (Sin City, Book 1: Second Edition)</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1.html">A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1</a><br/><p>>>> The header of this product is listed as DVD for some reason, despite being a review of a BD purchased via Amazon. Go Figure. >>><br /><br />Frank Miller is a favourite of mine, so I am pretty biased. The books the film is based upon cannot in the strictest term be called 'comics'. But this is heaped into the category of 'comic book film'. And you know what, for some reason that doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Miller, who has always been known for shaking up our perceptions on the definitions of what can be expected in the comic book medium, stuck gold with this solid serialized title. With this film, director Robert Rodriguez redefined what a comic movie could be. And with this version of the BD, they both have redefined the comic book home experience.<br /><br />Packed with featurettes, a sharp 5.1 soundtrack, snarky and witty commentary, and some 20 minutes of additional movie, there's not much to not like about Sin City at all. Hell, Rodriguez even puts a favourite recipe (apparently one that helped him get through the filming process) in the mix, a simple breakfast taco with homemade attentions- and I tried it; it is a simply divine way to spice up an early morning. How many other BDs, let alone DVDs, give you THAT kind of bonus features?<br /><br />We know the count. Sin City was a highly regarded "neo-noir" TPB series and a highly praised film. Awards, all-star ensemble cast, lots of action, strong and sexy women, lots of action, gore, and lots of action. Frankly, if you are a fan of gritty comics at all and have no knowledge of Sin City and do not own a BD player... well, there's a good suggestion for your first two purchases.<br /><br />It's dark, twisted, violent, and quite possibly one of my favourite films of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>"Sin City", Robert Rodriguez's "translation" of Frank Miller's classic graphic novel series, is not a film for everyone. It's the type of film you either love or hate, no in between.<br /><br />"Sin City" is, in more ways than one, like "Pulp Fiction". Both films have oodles of violence, a large ensemble cast (even "PF'S own Bruce Willis has a role), and even Quentin Tarrentino himself directs a sequence. "Sin City" also uses "Pulp Fiction's" method of combining several different stories into one movie.<br /><br />The first story deals with grizzled veteran cop detective Hartigan (Willis), who is searching for little Nancy Callahan, an 11 year old girl who has been kidnapped by the sadistic son (Nick Stahl) of a corrupt senator (Powers Boothe). Hartigan manages to save little Nancy, but when his partner Bob (Michael Madsen) seemingly turns the table, it looks as if Hartigan is done for.<br /><br />The next story focuses on Marv (Mickey Rourke). Marv is a hardened ex con trying to go straight with the help of his parole officer Lucille (Carla Cugino). One night, he meets Goldie (Jaime King). Marv sees in Goldie the woman he always wanted, one who loves and understands him. However, that night, Goldie is murdered in Marv's bed. This was done naturally to frame Marv. Determined to clear his name, Marv is led through a wild maze to find who killed Goldie, seeking the help of her twin sister Wendy (King). He is led to Kevin (Elijah Wood in a role that will make you forget that this is the same guy who played Frodo), a sadistic cannibal who preys on prostitutes. He manages to defeat Kevin, but in order to protect the ones he loves, Marv is forced to turn himself in and give up his life.<br /><br />The next story deals with Dwight (Clive Owen), who has recently hooked up with hyperactive barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy). When Shellie's ex boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) pays a little visit and roughs Shellie up, Dwight seeks revenge. He is led to Oldtown, where he runs into Gail (Rosario Dawson), an old flame and leader of a brigade of prostitutes. A shootout between the cops, Jackie Boy and his gang means a war between the cops and the mob in Oldtown. Determined to stop it before it happens, Dwight drives the bodies out to an abandoned tar pit. However, before he gets there, local crime boss Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) gets wind of this, and sends his men out to kill him. He is rescued by Miho (Devon Aoki), a prostitute who is also an amazing fighter. This concludes in a bloody shootout between the mob and the prostitutes, and makes for a truly exciting sequence.<br /><br />The fourth and final sequence ties in with the first chapter. Eight years after rescuing little Nancy (here played by Jessica Alba), Hartigan, who still keeps in touch of her, has decided to start his life over. But he soon learns that Roark's son, whom he thought he killed, has resurfaced, and is out to finish the job. He catches up with Nancy and is intent on saving her. This leads to a bang up finale between Willis and Stahl, and results in a chilling ending that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />To put in simple terms, "Sin City" is an excellent movie. It is one of the greatest comic book films ever created, and both the storyline and special effects work extremely well. This two disc special edition is loaded with bonus features and is a dvd that belongs in your collection.</p></br></body></html>

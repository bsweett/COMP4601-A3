His style is so hip and unique, and the characters always unforgettable!<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is basically the story of a jewel heist gone wrong.<br /><br />The movie opens in a coffee shop with the gangsters eating breakfast right before the heist takes place.<br /><br />The funny part about it is the discussion taking place at the table, about Madonna's song "Like a virgin".<br /><br />We have the boss, his son (Nice guy Eddie)and the color-coded named criminals (the boss gave them the names because they don't know each each other, and boss wants to keep it that way)<br /><br />We have Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink (my fave)<br /><br />What is interesting about this is, that after they leave the restaurant, we immediately flash to a car with Mr. White driving and Orange in the back - shot - blood all over the place!<br /><br />They go to a warehouse and all meet up there, and as they begin to trickle in, one by one, it is realized that someone set them up-one of them!<br /><br />But which one? Which one is the cop ???<br /><br />They re forced to stay in the warehouse and wait it out, and 'honor among thieves' is put to the test.Tempers flare and blood is shed.But who ratted? And how will they get out alive?<br /><br />One thing that makes this so unique is that it sort of plays backwards, and Tarrintino was pretty much the first to use this style of storytelling.<br /><br /> Another thing, the soundtrack is awesome!You will never forget what happens as "Stuck in the middle with you" plays. :(<br /><br />There are a lot of awesome oldies which plays on the movie's 'radio station'  "K-Billy Super sounds of the seventies".<br /><br />There are many editions of this movie out, but the 15th anniversary edition is really PACKED with extras, and the packaging is cool too.<br /><br />The 2 disc set comes in a slim metal "gas can" and the top pops off. Inside is a huge book of matches that hold the DVD's, the matches are from "Uncle Bob's Pancakes"... It really is a cool edition to own, even if you own the 10th anniversary, or other editions.<br /><br />Highly reccomended entertainment!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT.html">A2WSI8HOWHFDOT</a><br/><p>Hundreds of bullets flying, people writhing in puddles of blood, incredibly foul language, bad guys and even badder guys, a severed ear, and torture. And then the violence begins. Say what you might about the &quot;excessive violence&quot;, the gore and blood in this film are really NOT that bad when you put it up next to something like NATURAL BORN KILLERS or FIRE WALK WITH ME. Violence is the only thing those two movies have going for them. RESERVOIR DOGS strives for something more.<p>On the surface, this is a crime film about a gang of jewelry store robbers trying to discover who the &quot;rat in the house&quot; is: the snitch who made a very bloody mess of the heist. But on a second level, it is also about honor among thieves which does exist here. This gang is full of cut-throats who would have successfully pulled off the heist if it weren't for the snitch. And the snitch is NOT a crook, he's an undercover cop. On a third level, it's a story about simple friendships and trust.<p>This is an amazing film filled with powerful performances, especially from Harvey Keitel and Steve Buschemi. All the performances for that matter are great. The movie, which is mostly set in one location, has a claustrophobic feel; but the flashbacks which are mostly set outdoors, give us breathing room. Q.T. has given us an unusual, and unusually humorous, look into the world of men who happen to be criminals, and into the world of criminals who happen to be friends. Get this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>Watch &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; instead? What were you expecting to see, a group of men in suits skipping and singing to Britney Spears? Quentin Tarantino movies are not for the diluted sissys who'd rather watch a romantic comedy. All right? &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; started a new trend in Hollywood with the unorthodox storytelling and rich dialogue. Although there's enough violence in the movie, the blood is not glorified. Not every other scene has somebody doing something gruesome. Are you listening? The movie is a classic and is original. Who's the mole of the group? You'll have to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>And, it's easy to see why one of the alternate ear-amputation scenes was not used:  The resulting wound, and it's pulsing blood, was reminiscent of Danny Aykroyd's cut-and-bleeding finger in his comedy skit portrayal of chef Julia Child.  The film's final cut (ha, ha) was the best one, understated yet chilling.<p>And, the scene with the female detective who provided background on the gang members should have been left in.  The movie wasn't too long anyway -- that scene would have added depth to it.<p>Great cast, great plot, great writing, great film.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino makes his motion picture debut a memorable one.  Tarantino is clearly a fan of the movies.  The interraction between the characters and who these characters are makes his style different than any other filmmaker out there.  The closest I would say he comes to immitating is Paul Schrader & Martin Scorsese.  The acting is top notch.  Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are all outstanding in their roles.  The movie is raw, violent and unforgetable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It's weird but it seemed for awhile it was like Quentin Tarantino's name was on every movie except he didn't even make them. Wanting to give films more recognition than they would've done otherwise, he helps get more attention to films by giving a "presented by..." credit such as on absolute pieces of...you know for Hostel and actually for a really good movie with Hero. But he did used to make movies once and his first one was the controversial Reservoir Dogs, which kind of exploded and made him the new face in directing. Will people love it as much as Pulp Fiction? Probably on the same level with Pulp edging it out but this is still a pretty good movie.<br /><br />6 guys, all given codenames: Mr. Blue, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange and Mr. White, are involved in a diamond heist but only it goes horribly wrong and they all go back to a warehouse and try to figure out why it went wrong and the possibility there's an undercover cop in their midst. Mixed in with this is flashbacks to not only some of the characters before the heist but during the heist itself, shooting their way out.<br /><br />Right from the on-set you can see what would become his trademark: long, drawn-out scenes of characters having normal day-type conversations with his witty dialogue. Some of it doesn't work (I still don't find the theory behind Madonna's "Like a Prayer" funny) but then in other cases, it's extremely funny. Another thing is that the film was criticized for being violent. Well it's actually not a very violent film despite guns firing and people getting hit. The violence comes from the way it portrayed, in a more realistic unflinching matter rather than over-the-top(in other words, this is not Kill Bill) that it seems more violent than it actually was.<br /><br />The casting is quite spot-on although to be honest, even though he passed recently, I never liked Chris Penn, even when he was acting but it's just a personal opinion. However everyone else, especially Harvey Kietel work perfectly. I'll also say Tim Roth does a good job but people might find his high-pitched squealing a little cumbersome. Does the film have any flaws besides the casting? Well, even though the warehouse and heist scenes are interesting, I never did like the pre-heist stuff, such as meeting Mr. Blonde and Mr. White or Mr. Orange telling a story in a bar. It's not like Pulp Fiction where each story was interesting in its own right, but here it almost felt like "get back to the warehouse".<br /><br />In probably one of the neatest packaging I've seen, the case comes in a gasoline can looking thing and the top comes out which reveals the 2 disc which are on the opposite site of a booklet that is shaped like a match book. But like the packaging for internet series Broken Saints, new packaging doesn't make good for practicality and people might find the case easily bendable or those horrible dents. The transfer's better, the extra features seem recycled and why do I get this nagging feeling there's going to be a 20th anniversary?<br /><br />There's a certain self-assurance that I love here. No nervous jittering since it was his first film, it's just go for broke filmmaking and it's all the better for it. While lately it seems his name is everywhere but not new movies, it's still good to see one of the 90's better movies.</p></br><a href="../users/APP5MBH2BSX6I.html">APP5MBH2BSX6I</a><br/><p>On the scale of 1 to 5 stars in the category of "First-time filmmakers," Quentin Tarantino scores a solid 5.  My 3-star rating is a subjective one that balances the film's worthiness with my general dislike of movies with excessive brutal violence and adolescent (so-called "adult") language.  Having heard many times how worthy this film is, I decided to give it a go anyway.<br /><br />I'm glad I did, for several reasons.  For one thing, if one can peek past all the four-letter words, the dialogue is truly excellent.  And, of course, taking into account that this is a world of seedy small-time and mid-level hoods and would-be gangsters, the profanity is necessary.  The words Tarantino gives his characters are as real as you'd expect from any group of overgrown juvenile delinquents, often funny, sometimes unwittingly insightful in character development, and always revealing what a bunch of idiots these saps are.  Those three levels to the dialogue are all on full display when Tarantino himself delivers an opening monologue about the real meaning of Madonna's music, especially "Like a Virgin," and it's a theme that runs through the entire film.<br /><br />Another thing that becomes brutally evident is that Tarantino doesn't want us to romanticize these guys.  While the opening scene in the diner makes us very familiar with these men in a comfortable way, furthered by the scene that follows while the credits roll, Tarantino then abruptly cuts to a scene of horrifying bloodshed that strips away any glorifying we may have expected to come around the corner.  Throughout the film he cuts back in time to show the warm relationships these mental midgets have shared, the forth in time as they repeatedly reveal themselves to be unworthy of even the slightest sympathy.  Even the two cops involved with the hoods eventually unravel and therefore receive no mercy.<br /><br />It's a very thoughtful film and very, very well made, especially considering its microscopic budget.  But be forewarned that it's not for the squeamish.  "Reservoir Dogs" fans will be thrilled with the extras on this latest version of the DVD, the title of which simply reflects Tarantino's love of words and combinations thereof, having no connection with the story whatsoever; it's a play on words that includes a reference to an equally gory Sam Peckinpah film called "Straw Dogs."</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>This edition is NOT perfect. For one thing the transfer is very strange - the brightness is pumped WAY too high. The orange credits-on-black looks incredibly washed out. The original laserdisc transfer looks better than this. There's MORE picture information on the sides of the frame than the previous widescreen transfer, so that's a plus. The audio commentary, while informative, is NOT screen-specific. It sounds like interviews from cast & crew edited together; not bad, if you like it that way. As for the supplements, someone thought it would be clever to present the interviews in a cutesy format. It does NOT work. Can you imagine any other crime film being treated like this? Of the better features are the commentaries by notable film critics like Peter Travers, et al.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>Quentin's first remains one of his best, even better than Jackie Brown. Interesting dialogue, great acting, cool camera work and an intriguing plot. But you have to get the anniversary edition; the tribute to Lawrence Tierny alone is worth it! And I agree with the one reviewer who was disgruntled over buying the "regular" DVD only to discover a special edition was coming later. That's simply unfair and greedy. Although truth be told, the extras on Pulp and Jackie are interesting, but nothing except the most rabid Tarintino fan would lose any sleep over.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>But where's the demension to the characters. When I first saw this film I felt sick to my stomach, I mean I was feeling terrible. But in the end of the film, I felt thrilled, then I realized that Tarantino was bringing the darkside in my personality. The scene when Micheal Madsen's character is cutting the policemen's ear off, I was laughing. That's when I notice what Quentin was doing with this film. He's trying to make you laugh, but he's also trying to make you think on what your laughing at. And when you think that cutting of the ear scene is over, Quentin just blows your mind away at the end of this movie. But this is not his best work. I remember alot of great directing shots, but there's nothing to really look into. I can study "Pulp Fiction" all day, the case that has the number 666, the devils number. The way the camera moves up to show Bruce Willis's face when he stabs one of the rapist's. The dialogue, the redemption of Samuel L. Jackson's character. That's what I mean, there's nothing to really think about at the end of "Reservoir Dogs." But this is an entertaining film, and I recommend it to Quentin Tarantino fans.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>All you have to do is watch Quentin Tarantino talk in an interview to know that, besides he is &quot;a fanboy of his own movies&quot; (as a friend of mine once said), his knowledge of film surpasses any video guide on the bookshelf. And through his first movie he shows his interest has been put to good use - we have not only a good script and great acting, but basically a great movie!<br /><br /> Tarantino's narrative owes much to Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Killing.&quot; (As well as Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Rashamon&quot; and D.W. Griffith's &quot;Intolerance&quot;) Like &quot;The Killing,&quot; the story is of a group of men committing a great caper, and the different parts mix-matched to heighten a sense of mystery and suspense. The story is told in different &quot;segments&quot; highlighting the principle characters. Tarantino did the same thing with his later films &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; &quot;Jackie Brown,&quot; and even &quot;Kill Bill,&quot; so here we see him working his technique into a professional method. It works quite well - yes, I agree, the characters are all scumbags and save for Mr. Orange probably have no real redeeming qualities about them, but it is because they are so fascinating as personalities that we enjoy watching their stories.<br /><br /> The characters and dialogue are extremely memorable, and you will never forget them. (whether you want to or not) The most popular one is of course Mr. Blonde quipping, &quot;Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?&quot; but there is a plethora of others - to quote them, I would have to break Amazon's 1,000 words or less rule. As I said the characters are all fascinating in their own right (even Mr. Blue has a great line regarding what waitresses have to do for a tip!) and upon more than one viewing you start to see them in different lights. Sure, maybe Mr. Pink really is a sissy (and I use that word to avoid trouble with Amazon censors) but when you look at the film closely...he IS the only one that acts like a professional!<br /><br /> The DVD itself is great. Besides some select-scene commentaries, it has a DVD with the film in a formatted version (for all you anti-widescreen people) and another DVD with the film in letterbox. It also has the three different scenes of the infamous ear cutting sequence. Although the opening credits warn you that the cut-scene is graphically violent, I thought the close-up of the ear cutting was more corny than violent - you can tell it's a fake ear. The other cut-scenes include a long sequence that details more of Mr. White's backstory, as well as more minutes of Eddie arguing with Mr. White and Mr. Pink. The picture quality and sound on the video is outstanding - overall, it's a worthy DVD for this movie.<br /><br /> Admittingly, this movie is not for all tastes. It has an R rating for a reason, but if you can stand violence and the f-bomb and just appreciate it as a movie I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>RESERVOIR DOGS is a classic movie. It is responsible, almost single-handedly (along with SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE) for ushering in the current era of "indie films."  Right around the same time that every home in America seemed to have a VCR, these "little" movies came out, tacking daring subjects in a daring manner. And while they got little attention in traditional movie-houses, everyone heard the buzz on them and rented them and turned them into cult classics.<p>I watched the movie again the other day. It shows clearly the Tarentino hallmarks that would make him huge with PULP FICTION, KILL BILL, etc.  Snappy, clever, filthy dialogue.  Elaborate violence...unrealistic amounts of blood pouring from one person's body.  Cool camera moves and great use of music.  (After all, can anyone really hear STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU in quite the same way again?).<p>But the film is showing its rough edges.  What seemed edgy and new now sometimes looks a little lazy.  Long shots through doorways, where the camera sits still and the actors move in and out of the shot.  Kinda cool, but...kinda boring.  Cool male actors encouraged to yell and overact.  Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi are all great actors, and they're  pretty darn memorable in this film.  BUT, they are also occasionally prone to rage and scream above what seems believable.  Many of the "tricks" of this film have been used so often since, that unfortunately, they feel trite now.  It's not fair to blame this film for what came later.  Therefore, I still say it's a classic, BUT, not always a classic that thrills with repeated viewings.  PULP FICTION, all these years later, still tickles me and excites me.  But there were long stretches of RESERVOIR DOGS where I felt like dozing.<p>However, if you HAVEN'T seen it, I still recommend that you do!</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>I don't think this movie's quirky sort of cult reputation does it justice. There's nothing of the guilty pleasure about it; it's more than just a blood-drenched gangster film (although, admitedly, it is that).<br /><br />Tarentino's mastery of dialogue is obvious from the first scene. While the reccurence of sudden, violent death might be the thing which lingers in the mind, it's important to realize that the bulk of the movie's substance consists of meandering, basically pointless conversations between the main characters. A sense of their humanity is built surpassing even the characters in the Godfather; they're human beings first, second and third, and criminals only incidentally. The round-table conversation about song lyrics and the ethics of tipping; the extended one-upsmanship between Vick Vega and 'Nice Guy Eddie;' Keitel's fatherly tutoring; everything is brilliant. Some classic playwrights can't write this believably.<p>Second, the violence, while not central, is extremely effective. The curt way in which death occurs emphasizes the difference between this genere and the martial arts/action genere showcased in the later 'Kill Bill;' in this world, no matter how cool you may be, or how tough, or how well-developed your character, all it takes is one gunshot, and it's over. The rapid-fire executions near the end have a resonance which the ten-hour death scenes replete with speeches in, say, Metal Gear Solid, don't even approach.<p>This move is an absolute classic, Tarentino's best second to Kill Bill, and, more than enjoyable, something of real skill and merit.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Another film about a gang of thieves that turns sour, will you say. Yes, but it is highly humorous and deeply barbaric. It shows how low these gangsters can go. They become beasts to others and beasts to themselves. They decide of the rules and they kill those who do not respect them. It is total alienation to the ? mission ? : the gangsters do not have any autonomy or freedom left. Their names are erased and changed to aliases imposed onto them. Their judgment is in the same way erased and replaced by ? professional ? reactions, like it or not. And when this turns sour, because a cop has infiltrated the gang, they all try to stick to the rules to the end, and hence to their death, but strangely enough, they kill one another in some kind of killing merry-go-round. The irony of the situation is that one manages to escape with the loot because he is swift enough to get out of the firing line and to shoot on the last survivor of the last firing round. There is always an intelligent wolf in a pack of wolves. But that is a habit with the films of this director, except that this one is a little bit more linear in the story telling than the famous ? Pulp Fiction ?. A  perfect exercise in studying what losing control of reality means and what being alienated to your own rules can become. Does it speak of real life for real ordinary people ? I may even go as far as saying : yes probably.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/AQI2CW6UKF1ES.html">AQI2CW6UKF1ES</a><br/><p>I looked at this movie, because I was getting board over the summer, and I didn't even read anything about it(ecept the back of the cover, and it sorta intriuged me).  My brother had it, so I though i'd check it out.  <p>And man, it just made my summer a bit better.  It tells a good story of a ban heist gone bad.  6 robbers in a diamond heist, but ones a police informer, and everybodys at eachothers throat trying to find the rat.  It also shows, how the main characters got involved with the heist.  <p>And the movie is a little violent(Something I like seeing in movies nowdays).  Another strange thing is, I don't like 70's music, but I somewhat liked K-billies sounds of the 70's.  I was saying hugachaka when they were saying it and stuff.  <p>Well if you love movies with suspence in it, or a good mystery trying to be solved then this is the movie you should look at.<p>Peace</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>Add together the elements of Quentin's ear for dialogue, a wonderful cast, great acting, and unforgettable scenes of  ultra-violence and you have a film that you'll talk about long after having seen and experienced it.  Not for the &quot;casual viewer&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>First things first, I'm not going to call Reservoir Dogs 'Quentin Tarantino's best movie', because I love all of his movies dearly and I will not pick favorites. Nevertheless, as of the last time I saw the three of them (the other ones being, of course, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. I'm not counting Four Rooms, because he only had one segment in it - even if it was the best part of the movie), Reservoir Dogs was the one I enjoyed most.<p>A brief overview: Lawrence Tierney is Joe Cabot, and Chris Penn is his son 'Nice Guy' Eddie. Joe is a crime boss planning a diamond heist, and for the operation he hires six men, all of them acquainted with Cabot but none of which knows each other. To avoid having any details about one another they keep their identities secret and call each other by code names: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (the always wonderful Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blonde (action star Michael Madsen in the part of a lifetime), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino himself, who gets killed at the very beginning of the movie). When the robbery becomes a bloodbath, the thieves escape to the rendezvous and try to figure out what went wrong and who's responsible.<p>The movie is basically a very small scale theatrical production, as the main body of the story takes place in only one location, although there are several flashbacks that play a very important part in the film. The movie caused a lot of buzz at the time of its release partly due to its high level of violence, but today it seems much less shocking and that gives us a chance to better appreciate Tarantino's unique storytelling abilities - especially since having also seen Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown we can now safely assume that its success wasn't a one time thing. Tarantino's dialogue is brilliant beyond competition and his juxtaposition of conversations about life-and-death issues and mindless chatter about the most minor trivialities of life makes his movies a treat to watch (Note the Madonna conversation in the beginning of Reservoir Dogs and the Delfonics chats in Jackie Brown. While I'm on the subject, the use of music here is brilliant, as Quentin juxtaposes a nostalgic 70s radio show with the film's most violent scenes). The poetry and beauty put into the most violent sequences are as enchanting as they are shocking, and Michael Madsen's torture scene, backed with Stealer's Wheel's 1970s hit `Stuck In The Middle With You', became an instant timeless classic.<p>Tarantino is of course the main guy in this classic, but the actors are all worthy of praise. Harvey Keitel is a great straight man, who seems to be the only honest person in the film, and the always nervous and catatonic Steve Buscemi balances him out. Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are both spectacular, and Lawrence Tierney is brilliant (as another character describes him - "You remember the Fantastic Four?... The Thing. He looks just like The Thing.") The relationships forming between the six individuals, all of the complete strangers, make Reservoir Dogs a really fascinating watch. Tarantino is a picky director; he makes few movies, but the ones he makes really count. I'm waiting for his next release, `Kill Bill', eagerly. If you missed out on any of his three masterpieces, don't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R.html">A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R</a><br/><p>Resevoir Dogs was a knockout! I thouroughly enjoyed its creativity from the very first scene on. Quentin Tarantino's clout is so noticeable in all of his movies, but he really hit it big with this one. The movies that he writes and directs (True Romance, Jackie Brown) all have such dynamic characters and actors that portray them. It is truly fascinating to watch a Tarantino film. This one took the cake though. The resevoir dogs really were tough. Steve Buscemi stole the show as Mr Pink. Tim Roth also did a fantastic performance. All of them did though. It was just an amazing movie that is probably most enjoyable (as all Tarantino films are) in a college group of friends. This is not a kid movie at all. Its R rating reflects strong graphic violence and pervasive strong language. If you can overlook that however, you're in for a real treat with Resevoir Dogs.</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>Yes. This film definitely demands a major aquired taste. It is the most ruthless, gruesome, blood-fest I have ever seen. This one tops "Saving Private Ryan." Except for that movie, the violence is shown as sad and honorable, but the violence in this film is completely more vile. I am not saying I did not like this movie, because I love it, just that it is extremely grotesque. I bought this after loving "Pulp Fiction" to pieces, and had to see what all the hype was about. I wouldn't go as far as saying that this is better than "Pulp Fiction," but it sure does come in close. Trust me, this is so much more violent than any other movie you've seen. It's not just the violence, it's the way it's presented.<p>Quentin Tarantino sticks with the same recipe for all his films; profane, disturbing, darkly comical, gruesome, and ruthless. But I would have to say that this film tops them all. In every one of his films, he puts in a few highly memorable yet disturbing scenes that rule the cinema. For example, the syringe full of adrenaline in "Pulp Fiction." However, in "Reservoir Dogs," there is one huge scene that's glued in my mind. It is a scene more evil than anything shown in "The Exorcist" and twice as gory. If you saw this movie, you know what scene I'm talking about. It is extremely intense and very sad. You've been warned.<p>This is basically the good version of a "chick flick." It has emotional scenes that jerk your feelings around. The end is very powerful, the perfect thing to end a movie with. However, don't see this expecting to see a "chick flick" because IT'S NOT! I wouldn't be eating while watching this, it's a film you need to pay much attention to and has you glued in...although I wouldn't reccomend eating for other reasons.<p>The 10th Anniversary DVD is quite nice...I got the Mr. Brown version because it was signed by Quentin Tarantino and because he is the creator, even though he has a small role in the film. I don't see why the second disc is fullscreen which is completely unnecessary, but oh well. I'm not complaining. It is a very great purchase and will keep you coming back to watch over and over...if you can stand the content. An overall wonderful film that I will always be proud to have in my DVD library.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>Acting that will blow you away  and characters that disgust you even though you're drawn to liking what little likeable part of them remains.<p>Depraved criminals that are racist, sadistic and keenly  intelligent are somehow very human and compassionate on one hand and  disturbingly evil on the other.<p>This movie is not for those with weak  stomachs.  Although the psychological element of fear is much stronger than  anything you actually see in this film, there are a couple of gory scenes  that will scar your memory forever once you see them... the type of  deliberate, up close &amp; personal cruelty to another human being that  surpasses the desensitizing we've been through by watching other violent  scenes on tv and movies. The isolation of the movie taking place almost  entirely in one room makes even the most tame scenes un-nerving and  uncomfortably intense.<p>Tim Roth's performance is definitely the most  piercing.  Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel, Chris Penn and the rest of the  ensemble cast are also riveting.<p>You will never listen to the song  &quot;Stuck in the Middle With You&quot; by Stealers Wheel the same way  again.  A song I once really liked still gives me the willies each time I  hear it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>"Reservoir Dogs" is another one of my favorite movies.  Despite what critics think, this is a Tarantino masterpiece with unforgettable characters, smooth and cool dialogue, and a shocking finale.<br /><br />I had the older version of this movie on DVD, and it was all right.  The picture wasn't too bad, sound was so-so, and there were virtually no special features.  So when I found out that a new remastered and fully-loaded version of the movie was coming out, I knew I had to have it.  And I am very glad that I did purchase it.<br /><br />Since this is a crime flick, the plot and storyline isn't that complex or deep, and there is no reason for it to be.  It's pretty simple.  Perfect strangers plan the perfect crime, but end up in a bloody set-up.  With only four of them left alive, they must uncover the rat in the house.  But which one is it?  That is something they must find out before the cops get a hold of them in this unforgiving and spectacular crime/noir movie.<br /><br />The writing is off the hook.  Tarantino is a master when it comes to dialogue.  Why?  Because the characters talk like real people.  In ordinary movies, all the characters ever talk about it the plot or scheme.  In THIS movie, they talk about everyday normal things that we would talk about, which makes them seem more realistic and convincing.  His writing reminds me a lot of Raymond Carver, except with more humor.<br /><br />The cast is terrific.  Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, and Steve Buscemi all did their roles justice.  Michael Madsen is awesome and cool as Mr. Blonde, who will always be remembered for that very particular role.  Buscemi is hillarious, and your eyes never leave his sight when he's on screen.  But really, everyone is outstanding in this movie.<br /><br />The DVD itself is very high quality, including two disks.  The picture is remastered in high definition, which really makes it clear.  Ten times better than the other version.  You can either watch in widescreen or in fullscreen.  The sound is also much, MUCH better.  You can watch it in dolby digital or in DTS.  Considering that this was a really  low-budget film, the movie looks and sounds amazing.  You will especially appreciate it if you had the previous DVD of the movie.<br /><br />And there are tons and TONS of extras that will keep you more than happy.  Way too many for me to list, but the ones I liked the most were the interviews.  (Watch the one with Michael Madsen.  That has to be one of the funniest interviews I have ever seen.  Just trust me and watch it!  I don't want to give too much away.)  So, if you are a big fan of bells and whistles, this DVD is the one for you.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, I was more than pleased with this edition of "Reservoir Dogs."  I did not mind re-buying it at all.  If you still have the original DVD and love this movie very much, GET THIS ONE AS SOON AS YOU CAN!  You will not regret it.  This is one of my favorites, and proves just how talented Quentin Tarantino is when it comes to writing and directing.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>Presented in its original aspect ratio, with a DTS HD audio and Dolby 5.1 tracks included and with English and Spanish subtitles, 'Reservoir dogs' is presented in Bluray format.<br /><br />The question I had before getting this was if it would be worth to purchase again a movie I already owned in 2 anniversary editions in DVD, well after watching it I can tell you it is definitely worth the upgrade. The HD transfer is excellent, even though you can tell it is a movie from the 90's the level of details and color quality is eye-popping. As you can imagine and if you are familiar with Quentin Tarantino's movie soundtracks, the audio also presents a major upgrade over its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />A feature called the 'Pulp factoids viewer' is included which made me rediscover the movie, a lot of information on the movie appears on screen while you watch it, the Tarantino references to Scagnetti, the snake charmer (Bill from 'Kill Bill') as well as fun and technical facts were fun to read while watching the films. Besides this feature 2 documentaries are included: 'Playing it fast and loose' and 'Profiling the reservoir dogs'. Other than that, not all the special features from the anniversary DVD editions are included, which is a shame as that is what is making me keep my original DVD copies of the same movie.<br /><br />With a price that is quite insulting to the quality of this release, as a fan of the movie I can tell you the Hi-Def presentation improves the experience of watching 'Reservoir dogs' again.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Reservior Dogs is the story of a perfect crime thrown into chaos by a criminal who is really an undercover cop. The robbery gets botched, a lot of people die, the remaining theives regroup at the rendevous point to wait for their leader, and try to smoke out which one of them is the rat. (I guess this film proves that old saw: There is no honor among theives.) Simple plot, wonderful execution. <p>  Writer/Director/Actor Quentin Tarantino serves up some great dialogue and plot twists, and the Actors (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Lawrence Tierney, Chris Penn, &amp; Steve Buscemi) are all at the top of their games. <p>  The only thing keeping this film from a perfect 5 is the same beef I had when I saw it all those years ago: Without giving anything away, I'll just say this- I don't care if a sting will nab Hitler, Manson, Atilla the Hun and The Devil all at once, no Police Officer is going to stand by and do nothing while another Officer, or Two, (or the Cilivians in the Jewelry store) are ruthlessly slaughtered. Too far-fetched. But if you can suspend the disbelief for 90 minutes, this IS a great film.<p>  The DVD has Widescreen format on one side, standard on the other, and really has no extras except for the trailer and some interesting production notes. <p>  Just as a word of warning: the DVD comes with a little ad touting the &quot;Reservoir Dogs 10th Anniversary Collectors Edition DVD&quot; coming this June, so if you're looking for extras, you might want to wait until then.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NFLRFTMYXF5.html">A17NFLRFTMYXF5</a><br/><p>Blonde heard Stealer's Wheels<p>Then chopped off the poor cop's ear<p>So he won't hear it</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Before Pulp Fiction made him a household name, writer/director Quentin Tarantino shocked Hollywood and critics nationwide with this stunner of a movie.  It all starts simple enough; six perfect criminals are brought together by Joe (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Eddie (Chris Penn) to pull a diamond heist.  None of the criminals know each other and are assigned color coded aliases: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blond (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), and Mr. Brown (Tarantino).  But this simple plan goes awry, and the remaining criminals make it back to the hideout and eventually realize that one of them is a rat.  Reservoir Dogs shifts back and forth through time to let the viewer the get to know the characters, but Tarantino's true genius is the fact that the film thrives on the characterizations and dialogue which carries Reservoir Dogs to unprecidented heights.  Superb performances from everyone involved, especially to Keitel and Buscemi in the beginning of the film, and the last quarter of the film belongs to Tim Roth.  The film is violent, no doubt about that, but nowhere as gory as everyone claims it to be.  The infamous ear scene (involving Michael Madsen gleefully torturing a cop taken hostage with a razorblade while listening to &quot;Stuck in the Middle With You&quot;) is nowhere as graphic as some claim it to be, but it is disturbingly hilarious.  The minimal budget only adds to the grittiness of the film, and Tarantino is clearly a writer and director in his element.  The new edition DVD's from Artisan (there are five different covers) are lightyears beyond the original Reservoir Dogs DVD; you get two discs (disc one is the film in widescreen while disc 2 is the film in full-screen) and extras including new interviews with Tarantino, Tim Roth, Mike Madsen, and others along with featurettes on the Reservoir Dogs action figures, a tribute to Lawrence Tierney, trailers, and a commentary from Tarantino and co.  All in all, Reservoir Dogs is a cinematic triumph and crime noir classic not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>It's taken five films to make Quentin Tarantino an official directing genius. Although the quality of some of his films are debatable, Tarantino's made his work into a cult. The question is, where to start watching them? The best bet is to start where it all began, with Reservoir Dogs.<br /><br />Six expert criminals, going under alias names according to colour, are hired by a mob boss, Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son, Eddie (Chris Penn) to rob a bank. The heist goes wrong and in the confusion, the criminals make their own seperate ways to the rendezvous, an abandoned warehouse. From the start, the film is in real-time, but is heavily interspersed by flashbacks telling the stories of each character. Seemingly a simple plot, Reservoir Dogs is intelligent film making at its pure best.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is packed to bursting with a tense and intriguing storyline for its whole 90 minutes. It is a film that is so accomplished that it is able to give the viewer an attachment to the characters in such a short space of time. Amidst the sharp, dark and insanely witty dialogue, you get a three-dimensional insight into these criminals through Tarantino's sheer genius in scene structure. There are a host of scenes that are accomplished in just a few shots - one camera angle often holds for several minutes, but yet, Tarantino still makes it feel all the more cinematic and theatrical, showing off the talents of actors such as Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. The background stories of the characters are fittingly summarised and neatly slotted into the flow of the film without disrupting it.<br /><br />The acting on show here is superb, ranging from an empathetic Harvey Keitel, to a sharp, mocking Steve Buscemi, to a loyal loudmouth Chris Penn, to the silent Tim Roth, and to top it off, a collected, psychopathic Michael Madsen. They intergrate into the scenes perfectly, which vary from light-hearted conversations, to tense situations, but there are so many blackly funny moments in Reservoir Dogs that it comes to the point where you may be seeing something insanely sick, leading you to not know whether to laugh or recoil in disgust.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is an experience that is worth going through more than once. The first time, as with most times, you'll watch it and be entertained by it, but give it a few viewings and you'll understand and be entertained by it, which is when the realisation of this magic in film will hit you. Although essentially not a film for the light-hearted, Reservoir Dogs is a cult classic, riddled with violence, sharp dialogue, hugely clever sequences, and plenty of expletive ...</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>"Reservoir Dogs" is the most Original Crime/Thriller in Years, it has had Many, Many Imitators since it's Early 90's release, and yet it still holds the Most Original title.

(Oh, and lots of whining from Tarantino about "RD" didn't win an Oscar when it came out.)<br /><br />I first saw this movie at age 14 and and was not too interested in anything but the violence.  Upon re-watching it, though, one can't help but understand why, for better or worse, Tarantino is a legend.<br /><br />Mr White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr Brown (the director in an unnecessary but amusing cameo), the psychopathic Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), and the short lived Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker) are given these colorful names by Las Vegas mobb boss Joe Cabot (in a hilarious turn by the late Lawrence Tierney) in an effort to keep things not so close between the career criminals.  Though it is a simple jewel heist, he does not want any of these guys to know each others' backgrounds, rap sheets, or any personal information at all.  Without spoilers, this most certainly does not work out.<br /><br />Beyond all the flashy brutality, violence, and racism which QT is known well for, this movie is really about the relationship between Mr. White and Mr. Orange.  With the stone cold Mr. Blonde in the background, handled by Nice Guy Eddie (the late Chris Penn in a terrifying role as Cabot's son), the badly wounded Mr. Orange is Mr. White's main concern.  Handling him like a wounded child, combing his hair, ferociously defending him from any accusations of being the man who tipped off the cops and set off the alarm, Keitel's performance is what makes it worth it.  As Mr. Pink screams at him for having disclosed information to his wounded companion, the actor's gaze is spacy, strange.  Why is he so cold when talking about his life long boss and companion Joe?  Why does not care about the rules?  Has this wounded, almost Christlike figure lying on the ground made him think twice about his life of crime?  Is the goodness of Mr. Orange throwing him off his game?  Is he the son he never had?<br /><br />Tarantino offers no easy answers and obviously had no intention of spoonfeeding the viewer.  While this is a remorselessly vicious movie with some of the worst specimens humanity has to offer, there is something tremendously moving about it.  A must for any lover of film--"Stuck In the Middle With You" will always make you perk your ears up after seeing this movie, in a manner of speaking.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>"Reservoir Dogs" is Tarantino at his best.  It's a very focused, character driven film that pretty much anyone can enjoy.  It's one of the better gangster flicks, because unlike recent entries in the genre, it isn't exceedingly bloody or gory.  There is extreme violence, but most of it is suggested or downplayed.  It's also a great drama with an unconventional, non-linear structure that flows so nicely that I couldn't picture it being told any other way.  It's a character driven piece, with most of the action being explained through dialogue after the fact, though I never felt like I was missing anything.<br /><br />The dialogue is very snappy, and that is the shiny exterior that attracted me to the movie.  From the opening speech about Madonna's "Like a Virgin" (which is spot on) to Mr. Orange's reveal to Mr. White, the dialogue carries the film on its back, never letting up.  However, while the dialogue is definitely the main attraction, the quality of pretty much every aspect of the movie is high enough to keep anyone thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />8/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1AUOVXPT5MYX4.html">A1AUOVXPT5MYX4</a><br/><p>This movie, together with Pulp Fiction, is fantastic. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn are equally effective in their roles. Steve Buscemi, however, steals damned near all of his scenes. ("Why do I have to be Mr. Pink?") Even the voice of Stephen Wright as the radio DJ is perfect. It's hard to believe that a debut film by an unknown (at the time) director could pack this much wallop and star power. 'Pulp Fiction' is a great film but it still can't match this one for sheer power and energy. As for the DVD transfer, good job! Two formats, great sound, and extra goodies makes it a worthwhile addition to your collection. You do not know what a seriously good movie is until you see Reservoir Dogs.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Recently I saw Reservoir Dogs for the first time since the '90's, and was struck at how perfect, just dead-on flawless, Quentin Tarantino's writing was in this edge-of-your nerves movie. It says something that somehow Reservoir Dogs seemed far less violent to me today than I remembered in high school, and I think that signifies a lot about how far violence has pervaded the media as well as the entertainment industry (which are increasingly one and the same, aren't they?).<br /><br />For those who don't know, this possessingly intricate story, told in flashback/flash forward/non-linear style tells of a gang of would-be jewelry store robbers hired by a crime boss and his son to commit a fast ("in and out in two minutes no matter what") heist in downtown Los Angeles one lackluster morning. Unknown to each other, these specialists from various corners of the nation are assigned names like "Mr. Blond" "Mr. White" "Mr. Blue" "Mr. Pink" "Mr. Orange" etc. and given precise instructions never to give out any real information about themselves as they go about securing a cache of diamonds recently imported from Israel. In classic Tarantino fashion all goes as wrong as it possibly can, police intervene, blood spurts, gunfire cracks like thunder and innocent lives are horribly lost, as what began amid a laid-back breakfast laced with rapid-fire profanity and cerebral analysis of Madonna's`80's anthem "Like A Virgin" suddenly shifts to a second act in a warehouse in which the remnants of the crew assemble, each paranoically aware that one among them is a police informer. But who is it? Even the audience doesn't know till after it's sat in dismay through one of the more gruesome torture sequences ever caught on celluloid.<br /><br />The first couple times you see this great classic, you'll be dazed, but sooner or later it'll hit you, as it has me, that the screenplay for Reservoir Dogs might be some of the best writing ever done in Hollywood. Owning it on DVD is the best way to take in all the easy to miss twists and turns not only in the plot but in the adrenaline-propelled dialogue. Five stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>So I finally decided to watch this after everyone telling me that I 'simply had to because it's so awesome'. Well, its not. I almost fell asleep. I knew what was going to happen in the end and throughout the whole movie, I just couldnt understand why people love this movie so much. It was pretty useless. When I hear people call it a 'cult classic', I laugh, its just too absurd.

The script here is fabulous, and of course, everything that's been said about the great cast and directing is all true. The time-shifting technique pioneered here went on to be used in quite a number of other films. And the coffee shop scenes, of course, resurfaced in Pulp Fiction and many more following movies. There's a lot of blood, but somehow it's not that gory, despite some torture that is one of the movie's most memorable sequences, set to Stealer's Wheel music. Ha. This is one of the few dvd's I have watched lately all the way through without a pause, my new standard for whether a movie is at the top of the pile. This one certainly is.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantinos debut film is a heist movie, where you only see the aftermath of the heist and not the heist itself. Somehow, in his first film, Tarantino arrives as the complete filmmaker; as both a writer and director he delivers.<br /><br />The film opens with a wonderful scene in a coffee bar, where the gang are meeting. This is a classic Tarantino moment. Essentially nothing happens except for an argument about a tip, but thats the whole point, its very real, and it is marvellously well written. And its in this scene that you realise that you may be about to watch something special:<br /><br />Harvey Keital, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi & Lawrence Tierney - its a fabulous cast.<br /><br />After the Coffee bar scene the opening credits role and Tarantinos trademark use of music hits you. I don't know how he does it but rather like Scorcese, Tarantino finds what you might think would be a completely inappropriate piece of music and fits it to the most odd situations. Remember 'Goodfellas' when the outro to 'Layla' is playing and the bodies are discovered in the car. Its that sort of thing, and somehow Tarantino makes it work.<br /><br />After the heist the gangsters arrive at a warehouse. How they got there is shown in flashback. This is an extremly violent film, and in its day was very controversial for one scene where Mr Blonde tortures a policeman. The given names (Blonde White Orange etc) for the gangsters are a reference to the film 'The Taking of Pelham 123'. The bulk of the film takes place in the warehouse. The gangsters arrive one by one and it becomes apparent that one of them is a Policeman undercover. Essentially thats it, telling you more would spoil it.<br /><br />Worth mentioning that the late Chris Penn appears in the film as 'Nice Guy Eddie', and there is one scene where he is in a car on a mobile phone. So what you might say - but remember this was filmed 16 years so the mobile phone is the size of a brick!<br /><br />This is a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Being a masterpiece of the 90s, Reservoir Dogs is a movie I never get tired of seeing. It has everything that makes for a great guy flick. It has action, an intriguing story and tons of bad language. One thing that sets this movie apart from other movies is that they show that these robbers are more than criminals who care about no one or no thing, but these guys are strong like brothers and actual friends, which ultimately leads to their downfall. The acting in the film is just what I like. Tim Roth does excellent as Mr. Orange, and you really believe he is in pain the entire time. Steve Buscemi is the sarcastic Mr. Pink that provides a little of the comic relief of the film, even though he is being serious the entire time. It is just the personality of these characters that makes this film go by quickly and make everyone who watches this movie wish that it went on for another thirty minutes at least! For a debut film from an unknown director at the time, Quentin Tarantino does a remarkable job in front of and behind the camera; it is easy to see that he was going to be big.<br /><br />The box itself is something any collector would want, it looks and feels like a gas can which is a reference to the scene when Mr. Blonde tortures the cop. The top comes off easy to reveal the real DVD case which is made to look like a match book. The special features are a hit and miss, which kind of dragged this DVD to four stars instead of five. There are great things on this disc that are great, such as the stories told about Lawrence Tierney, but a couple of other extras on the DVD are sub-par. Such as the tipping guide, which is nothing more than a page that tells how a few characters would tip, depending on the amount of money. No videos, no sound, it is nothing that needed to be included.<br /><br />The deleted scenes and interviews with QT, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are great things that I'm glad where added to the DVD. Then there are interviews that have nothing to do with the movie Reservoir Dogs. There are also no behind-the-scenes documentaries or nothing in detailed is said about the movie itself. Everything said about the movie is either about how it was received or what impact it made in cinema. One of my favorite extras on the DVD is "Profiling the Reservoir Dogs", which a narrator gives a little insight to the past of Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Brown. It is very interesting and informative, but you can't really take it to heart since it feels more like speculation instead of real facts about the characters.<br /><br />Overall, if you love this movie, get this DVD! Like I said, the extras feel like a hit or miss, but it is still worth while because there are a few hours worth of extras-whether they be good or bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>From the opening moments of "Reservoir Dogs" you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that "less is more." This doesn't apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch.<br /><br />Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made, the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all, you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them, and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film.<br /><br />When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>When "Reservoir Dogs" was released 13 years ago, it was almost instantly hailed as a masterpiece and its director, an ex-video store clerk named Quentin Tarrentino, a genius. Well, to be honest. I think that's pushing it a little. I think "Reservoir Dogs" is truly a great film, but there are a few minor flaws that prevent it from being a masterpiece.<br /><br />For starters, you have to be very patient to sit through the whole film. In actuality, the film is only a little over an hour and a half, which really isn't that song (I've sat through "Scarface"), but the film is very slow moving, thus making it seem a lot longer. I think this is because the film was lacking the famous dialogue Tarrentino's films are known for, which helps the movies pick up the pace. Another thing is the violence. Granted, "Scarface" and "The Godfather" both had more violence, but this film, thought not as violent, takes it to extremes those films didn't dare reach. I myself don't mind the violence, and I think the infamous "EAR" scene is brilliant, but a lot of people may not be able to handle the violence.<br /><br />But looking pas these minor flaws you will find a great movie. A great cast was assembled for this film. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi are the standout performers, but the rest of the cast is excellent. Michael Madsen is awesome in his role. His character pesrsonifies the term bad***. The late Lawrence Tierney is fatastic as Joe Cabot, and Chris Penn is wonderful as Nice Guy Eddie. Even Quentin joins in on the fun as Mr. Brown.<br /><br />The extras are fantastic. They alone are worth the dvd. Overall, "Reservior Dogs" isn't exactly the masterpiece everyone thinks it is, but it is still a darn good film. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO092BYA4VMU.html">ABO092BYA4VMU</a><br/><p>Very good film, being Quentin Tarantino's film debut. Sadly, this film didn't get nomianted for an Oscar, but either Steve Buscemi, Lawernce Tierney or Tim Roth should have been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor. Can you believe there is only ONE woman in this film? But, who cares.<br /><br />This DVD has both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the movie, and only the widescreen version has DTS sound. The director himself makes a few apperances as Mr. Brown. But the first disc has five deleted scenes, inculding two alternate angles of the bloody "EAR" scene, one which is more graphic than the other. But, the more graphic angle when Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) slices off the ear, he's HOLDING the ear while he PRETENDS to slice it off! No wonder that angle wasn't in the film.<br /><br />Overall rating: 7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>Studios hate pointless dialogue.  Anything that doesn't furthur the story only hurts it.  That's the Hollywood way.  Thank god this was independent with Tarentino in complete control.  Can you imagine this film without the pointless dialogue?  Can you imagine it without the diner scene in the beginning?  Or without the scenes in the car talking about the differences between white and black women or Mr. Orange's extensive knowledge of blacksploitation films?  A major part of Tarentino's charm is his writing.  It's wonderful that he finally got this chance to direct a film the way he wanted.  It's apparent that the studios who bought the True Romance and Natural Born Killers scripts from Q.T. weren't willing to take a chance with allowing him to direct the films.<br /><br />In regards to the ear slicing scene, the below reviewer is correct.  It never actually shows the ear being cut off.  But if you'd like to see it anyway, check out the alternate angle that has a camera pointed right at the ear (you can tell it's prosthetic but it was never really meant to be seen up close).  It's not part of the original movie but fun nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino's first movie is so good that it should be almost impossible to make a better (or to some, on par) movie after it. Of course we know he did that with `Pulp Fiction' but here Tarantino already shows us how great he is. `Reservoir Dogs' is a violent movie with some scenes, one in particular, that could be too much for you. If you can stand the violence you should not miss this one.<p>Six gangsters, who know each other only by there codename, have to steal some diamonds. They are set up and the police is expecting them. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) escapes with Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) who is shot already. They arrive in the warehouse where they were supposed to go. Not much later Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) and Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) arrive as well. Who is the traitor? Is it one of them, or may be the missing Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) or Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), the boss Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) or his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn)?<p>The direction from Tarantino is extremely sharp, Michael Madsen is pure evil and Buscemi, Keitel and especially Roth give fine performances as well. Another great thing is the soundtrack from The George Baker Selection with Little Green Bag to Harry Nilsson with Coconut. A great first movie from a great director. And ask yourself this, do you tip?</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>First things first, I'm not going to call Reservoir Dogs 'Quentin Tarantino's best movie', because I love all of his movies dearly and I will not pick favorites. Nevertheless, as of the last time I saw the three of them (the other ones being, of course, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. I'm not counting Four Rooms, because he only had one segment in it - even if it was the best part of the movie), Reservoir Dogs was the one I enjoyed most.<p>A brief overview: Lawrence Tierney is Joe Cabot, and Chris Penn is his son 'Nice Guy' Eddie. Joe is a crime boss planning a diamond heist, and for the operation he hires six men, all of them acquainted with Cabot but none of which knows each other. To avoid having any details about one another they keep their identities secret and call each other by code names: Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (the always wonderful Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blonde (action star Michael Madsen in the part of a lifetime), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino himself, who gets killed at the very beginning of the movie). When the robbery becomes a bloodbath, the thieves escape to the rendezvous and try to figure out what went wrong and who's responsible.<p>The movie is basically a very small scale theatrical production, as the main body of the story takes place in only one location, although there are several flashbacks that play a very important part in the film. The movie caused a lot of buzz at the time of its release partly due to its high level of violence, but today it seems much less shocking and that gives us a chance to better appreciate Tarantino's unique storytelling abilities - especially since having also seen Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown we can now safely assume that its success wasn't a one time thing. Tarantino's dialogue is brilliant beyond competition and his juxtaposition of conversations about life-and-death issues and mindless chatter about the most minor trivialities of life makes his movies a treat to watch (Note the Madonna conversation in the beginning of Reservoir Dogs and the Delfonics chats in Jackie Brown. While I'm on the subject, the use of music here is brilliant, as Quentin juxtaposes a nostalgic 70s radio show with the film's most violent scenes). The poetry and beauty put into the most violent sequences are as enchanting as they are shocking, and Michael Madsen's torture scene, backed with Stealer's Wheel's 1970s hit `Stuck In The Middle With You', became an instant timeless classic.<p>Tarantino is of course the main guy in this classic, but the actors are all worthy of praise. Harvey Keitel is a great straight man, who seems to be the only honest person in the film, and the always nervous and catatonic Steve Buscemi balances him out. Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are both spectacular, and Lawrence Tierney is brilliant (as another character describes him - "You remember the Fantastic Four?... The Thing. He looks just like The Thing.") The relationships forming between the six individuals, all of the complete strangers, make Reservoir Dogs a really fascinating watch. Tarantino is a picky director; he makes few movies, but the ones he makes really count. I'm waiting for his next release, `Kill Bill', eagerly. If you missed out on any of his three masterpieces, don't.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I don't know why it took me so long to get my hands on this but I got to it last night. Tarantino's first, is one of the best, if not the best one he has ever done, but part of this credit has to go to his outstanding cast.<br /><br />Keitel is an old pro at this type of thing, he has the distinction of being the first older actor whose career seemed to be going into a slump and who has recovered thanks to Tarantino's casting. But Tarantino can't claim sole credit for that, because Keitel really got the ball rolling on the project and help him score his budget and the prominence to gain his cast. Buscemi IS Mr. Pink. Tarantino wrote the role for himself, and he would have been good, but Buscemi brings a type of weasly professionalism to the role that no one else could.<br />Penn and Tierney are ideally cast as the father and son who are left to sort out the mess of the robbery, Bunker is only in a few scenes but livens up the proceedings. Tarantino gives himself the perfect monologue for his characte, and Tim Roth gives a spectacular performance as Mr. Orange, who is relegated to bleeding on the floor for a large chunk of the movie. His scene in the car when he has just been shot is particularly outstanding. But then, of course, I have to throw out a special nod to my favorite character in the piece, Mr. Blonde, as portrayed by Michael Madsen. Blonde is the definition of "Bad*ss", and Madsen fits him like a glove. His first scene back at the warehouse is particularly memorable, as is the "Ear torture sequence". Without Madsen's portraying of Mr. Blonde, I don't think the "Ear" scene would have worked, Madsen just does something with it that nobody else can. Not only does Blonde have most of the coolest lines, he's fun to watch on screen, especially his reaction to a gun pointed in his face by Mr. White. Madsen.<br /><br />"Reservoir Dogs" Is one of the few movies where I don't think the casting could have been any better. Part of the reason it works as well as it does has to go the way the cast works with each other. No one seems to think that they are better than anyone else, and no one seemed to approach the project with the stuck up feeling of how bad it was that they were doing an indie film on a low budget and with an unknown director. Every single member of the cast gives everything he (or, to a much lesser extent, she) has. It's this mindset that, I think, has made "Dogs" the classic it is today. Little could be improved upon.<br /><br />As a side note, This came out a year after "Thelma and Louise" who also stars Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen. However, in "Reservoir Dogs" They play ruthless characters. In "T&L" they play the only sympathetic Male characters in the entire movie. An ideal would be to watch "T&L" then "RD" and really see the difference. They are two great actors, and they deliver. " Resevoir Dogs" is a great film to watch,and for those who enjoyed Madsen in this will also like "Kill Me Again."</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>A jewelry store has been hit.  Two of the thieves return to the rendezvous, one of them dying from a gunshot to the gut.  Another thief shows up, but nobody knows the whereabouts of the other three criminals, what their boss is doing or why the cops seemed to know all about their plan.  Did someone set them up?  Where are the jewels?  And why is everyone named after colors (Mr. Blond, Mr. Pink, Mr. White) and dressed in the exact same cheap car salesman suits?<br /><br />That's the set-up for the 1992 Quentin Tarantino film that changed filmmaking forever.  The genesis of QT's introduction to Hollywood is now the stuff of legend, as the one-time video store clerk spent his spare time watching movies and trying to break into the business.  His directorial debut features a small group of criminals, thrown together by a grizzled old hood who insures each man knows everything about the job but nothing about each other.  Once the heist blows up, the thieves don't know who to trust or what to do.<br /><br />Mr. White (Keitel) works as the film's principal character (although fans of Pink, Blond and Orange may disagree).  Keitel occupies the essential role of having to develop a working relationship with the actors playing the three surviving criminals.  He must be father figure to the dying Orange, debate opponent to the philosophical Pink and Alpha-Male rival to the maniac Blond.<br /><br />The film's cleverest and most engaging scenes deal with the married-couple-like bickering of White and Pink (Buscemi).  They spar in a never-ending debate of rational thought versus emotional thought, as the cool and professional Mr. Pink knows to examine all angles and aspects, not trusting anyone, while Mr. White has faith in his gut, believing more of what he wants to be true.  They argue over the potential identities of undercover cops; they argue over their names (Why do I have to be Mr. Pink?); and they even argue over whether to leave a tip at a greasy diner similar to one found in all Tarantino movies.<br /><br />The White/Pink debates feature the fresh, pop-culture injected dialogue that defines Tarantino's filmmaking aesthetic.  Characters also discuss Pam Grier films, the true meaning of Madonna songs and their new favorite radio program, K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies (which provides great buffer music for the film's chapters).<br /><br />With cool bad-guys, irresistible dialogue and a storyteller skilled in bringing his audience along with just enough information to keep them guessing, Reservoir Dogs deserves as much attention and admiration as Tarantino's more famous creation, Pulp Fiction.  And with an entire generation of filmmakers wanting to make the next Reservoir Dogs (the opening credit sequence that has been parodied in everything from Swingers to The Simpsons), its cult status will eventually grow into mainstream acclaim.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut, Reservoir Dogs is a brilliantly written, unique film that paved the way for Mr. Tarantino's breakthrough film, Pulp Fiction.  The plot of Reservoir Dogs revolves around a diamond heist that goes afoul.  A group of criminals who have never worked together are assembled and given names like Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde.  The film is intercut with flashbacks in which the characters played by Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth are explored in more detail.  Mr. Madsen is incredible as the psychotic Mr. Blonde and his scene in which he brutalizes a cop in medieval fashion is alternately disturbingly brutal and humorous.  Steve Buschemi is a scream as the jumpy Mr. Pink and Mr. Keitel provides the film with its backbone as Mr. White.  Mr. Tarantino has keen eye for detail and the opening scene in a diner in which the crooks are discussing everything from what Madonna meant in her song &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; to 70's songs to tipping contains some of the sharpest dialogue in years.  Mr. Tarantino also uses music to great effect and he overlays scenes with the voice of comedian Steven Wright as host of a radio show K Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's.  Reservoir Dogs is a tremendous debut film and introduced Mr. Tarantino as a force.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>One of my favorite films, and definitely Tarantino's finest (I love `Pulp Fiction' but in all seriousness I just like this one better), `Reservoir Dogs' is a landmark in modern cinema.  I'm ashamed that this was not the film to garner Tarantino his first Oscar nomination for, while `Pulp Fiction' may be a more intricate work, `Reservoir Dogs' is a stronger work.  At times `Pulp Fiction' can seem to be all over the place (the script is pure genius, don't get me wrong, but you have to admit it really pushes it sometimes) `Reservoir Dogs' is a much cleaner film in that it follows its main objective very closely and allows the audience to keep focus and never find themselves lost.<br /><br />`Reservoir Dogs' follows a group of criminals after a jewelry heist they were all in on goes terribly wrong.  Mr. Orange (you'll notice that none of the men know each others names and all refer to one another by colors) is bleeding to death, Mr. White is trying to get a handle on the situation, Mr. Pink is panicking out of control, Mr. Brown is apparently dead, Mr. Blue is missing and Mr. Blonde, who apparently started the bloodbath that was the heist, seems determined to make matters worse.  As we are introduced to these men and given a little background information on them we are caught up in the same game as the criminals, trying ourselves to uncover the rat, the leak, the man responsible for tipping of the cops.<br /><br />There you have it; that's the movie in a nutshell.  What makes `Reservoir Dogs' so amazing though, is that that is not all there is.  It may seem like your average gangster type film, but it's not.  Tarantino masterfully uses his humor, his values and his visual stylings to bring us a gangster flick that is superior to most all other gangster flicks.  In fact, I'm tempted to go ahead and say that Scorsese only wishes he could direct this kind of masterpiece.<br /><br />Ouch.<br /><br />The violence is extreme if not mostly implied rather than grotesquely embellished.  The heart of this film is not the blood spilled but the blood running through the veins of these mad men.  When these men are faced with the possibility of a rat within their midst we begin to see their true colors.  There is a certain code of honor that swallows these criminals whole, and then that code is broken they start to unravel one by one.<br /><br />The film hinges strongly on the performances by the ensemble cast, most notably that of Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth.  Michael Madsen is effortlessly collected as the ruthless killer Mr. Blonde.  His calm veneer gives way to the psychotic madness running loose behind his gaze.  When he snaps you tell yourself that you saw it coming yet you're so utterly winded by it that you can't believe all that you're taking in.  Steve Buscemi (who won the Independent Spirit Award for this performance) is marvelously on edge throughout the entire film.  His nerves are shot through his skin as he prances around as if on broken glass trying to figure a way out for himself.  It's a brilliant performance, one that is eye-catching and very real.  Tim Roth has that explosive opening sequence where he's covered in blood and screaming for his life in the backseat of the car and that scene alone is award worthy in its own right, but he continues to build his characters pain and guilt and fear so that he becomes a fully fleshed out participant in the film instead of merely falling into token gimmicky territory.<br /><br />And then there is Harvey Keitel.<br /><br />In an ensemble piece with no clear leading actor, Keitel ultimately dominates the audience's attention with his marvelous portrayal of Mr. White.  White becomes the moral centerpiece of the film and really the one character that establishes the point of this film.  His dedication and loyalty to his partners, especially to that of the dying Mr. Orange is noteworthy and moving.  He conquers all emotions, from irritation to sympathy to desperation to mortal disappointment, always following through one-hundred-percent to deliver a rich and commanding performance.  His final scene is devastating to watch because you know everything that is running through his head at that very moment.<br /><br />Quinton Tarantino is a brilliant director, we all know this.  The opening sequence alone cements that belief.  As White, Orange, Brown, Blue, Blonde and Pink sit at a diner with Joe, the man responsible for setting up this rendezvous, and Eddie (Joe's son), they discuss the meaning behind Madonna's classic `Like a Virgin' and the end result is one of the most entertaining scenes in Hollywood history, and a scene done so efficiently and so masterfully that it alone should have garnered Tarantino a directing Oscar.<br /><br />From his smash hit `Pulp Fiction' to his stunning follow up `Jackie Brown' to his marvelous `one-two-punch' that is `Kill Bill', Tarantino is always on point and ahead of his game.  His visual flare is uncompromised and incomparable and his sick sense of genius shines through with reckless abandon on everything he touches.  `Reservoir Dogs' marks the beginning of his illustrious career, and honestly, it is the best thing he's ever done.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>This is a great Guy Film, to watch alone or with a buddy and, preferably, with a giant pizza and a few glasses of beer.

Not nearly as funny or enjoyable as Pulp  Fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EENLV6OQ3DYM.html">A2EENLV6OQ3DYM</a><br/><p>Before Quentin Tarantino made &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and became the most overhyped filmmaker on the planet (THREE movies in TEN years, please!) he made his ambitious low budget directorial debut with help from Harvey Kietel and one of the best casts ever assembled for a crime picture.  Kietel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Penn and Michael Madsen ALL give first rate performances that are all completely different.  Roth is haunted, Buscemi is manic, Madsen is amazingly menacing, Penn is slimy and Kietel is the &quot;moral&quot; center around which the rest revolve.  Tarrantino gets inside the criminal mind so completely, it is difficult to imagine that he was not himself one once.  The screenplay is brilliant, full of snappy dialog and witty reparte.  The action is quick and bloody and the ending is a classic.  <p>Overall, along with &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; this is one of the best crime films ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>I don't get the passionate admiration this movie seems to evoke. My take was that two thirds of it was a very good, interesting film, but a third of it was just self conscious direction with a lot of the hip ultra-violence. I liked Lawrence Tierney, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi a lot, especially Penn (although I didn't recognize him at first). The premise was interesting.<br /><br />But then I kept bumping against items like these (which may be spoilers):<br /><br />Mr. Blonde has already been established as a psycho, so why the extended cop torturing and ear removal? What did that add to Madsen's character or to advancing the plot? It seemed to me it was just calculated violence to be hip.<br /><br />Why the camera work that, for me, only brought attention to the camera work: The circling camera; the stationary camera in front of the window with the actor walking back and forth out of camera range; the set up in front of the graffiti-laden wall for apparently no reason except the graffiti looked great? Unusual camera work can add to the feel of a movie (just look at Welles' stuff) but it shouldn't keep saying, "Hey, look at me," which was the effect it had on my viewing.<br /><br />Why the over-the-top melodrama of the three-way shoot-out climax except to give the audience a chance to say, "Cool"?<br /><br />Why the over-the-top and, in my opinion, indulgent groaning, moaning and spluttering of Keitel at the end?<br /><br />As I said, I found about two-thirds of the movie pretty good. Many say it's been very influential, and it probably has. But like a Paris high fashion gown, it might get your attention, it might be influential, but sooner or later it becomes dated and a little ridiculous. I think that may be Reservoir Dog's fate.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Reservoir Dogs served notice that a new auteur was on the scene, but though a good first effort for Quentin Tarantino, it was just a taste of things to come; and it seems like an experiment that was only partialy successful. Though it is often imitated, spoofed even like for instance a scene in 'Swingers,' it seems like it uses a lot of gimmicks, and even though said gimmicks are pretty much Tarantino's style, in later works, i.e. 'Pulp Fiction,' he is able to better integrate those gimmicks into a seamless tapestry.<br /><br />It seemed very fresh and original at the time, but it may be getting a bit stale now, past its sell-by date. Like for instance, the scene where they plan the caper in the restaurant while discussing Madonna. Flash forward to 'Pulp Fiction' where they discuss what cheeseburgers are called in various European cities.<br /><br />---------------<br />Mr. Orange: Personally, I can do without her.<br />Mr. Blue: I like her early stuff. You know, 'Lucky Star', 'Borderline' - but once she got into her 'Papa Don't Preach' phase, I don't know, I tuned out.<br />Mr. Brown: Hey, you guys are making me lose my... train of thought here. I was saying something, what was it?<br />==============================<br /><br />Or how about where Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) does an interpretive dance/Vincent Van Gogh impression to the sounds of "Stuck in the Middle With You" by Stealer's Wheel?<br /><br />------------<br />You can say anything you want cause I've heard it all before. All you can do is pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.<br />[He removes his razor]<br />Mr. Blonde: You ever listen to K-Billy's "Super Sounds of the Seventies" weekend? It's my personal favorite.<br />============================<br /><br />Can't remember specifically where in 'Pulp Fiction' he used this gimmick to better effect, but it is oh-so Tarantinoesque, and if Quentin didn't do it in 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Kill Bill, Volumes I and II' then a tsunami of imitators that followed in his wake surely did.<br /><br />Funny how even though it is a caper movie, the actual caper is never seen, only the events before and after, not the actual caper itself. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen (did you know this guy actually published an award winning book of poetry?), Steve Buscemi: awesome.<br /><br />Key Cast Members of Reservoir Dogs:<br /><br />Harvey Keitel ...

Quentin Tarantino was the hottest director to emerge out of the early 90's. Expectations from others placed on Quentin Tarantino were so high that he had to top Reservoir Dogs in the next film, and he did. Back to Reservoir Dogs, everything I could possibly ask for was in the film. Reservoir Dogs may boast of having the strongest introduction ever because it's that good...creating naturalism, setting the atmosphere, and getting know to the characters and then liking them immediately. Somehow, I would say, if I had my expectations extremely low when starting off the film, I would have been totally unprepared for the rawness that Reservoir Dogs brings. Meanwhile, Reservoir Dogs was an acting workshop where each character can work out their manners, lines, and movements. All of the performances were equal and of superior kind. I did think that Chris Penn gave the best performance out of the bunch. The more interesting thing about Reservoir Dogs was that Quentin Tarantino did not show the actual diamond heist gone bad but rather allowed the audience to absorb the details as if they were creating a secondary story. In a result, the optional scene became superfluous. That's a brilliant work of a director. The aftermath after the fiasco was much more interesting and set the tone for the entire picture while at the same time the beforehand knowledge of the characters became the more the merrier. Of course, it's violent, bloody, and explosive. Then again, the idea was to top something else for the sake of newness, and, in that case, it's The Wild Bunch. Perhaps the most memorable character out of Reservoir Dogs was the psychopath Mr. Blonde played well by, ironically, the black-haired Michael Madsen. Then, came along Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, and Steve Buscemi for their supporting roles...they were all outstanding. Lawrence Tierney, a veteran actor of dark film noir, was the perfect boss because he looked exactly like one. There was a couple of problems in the film. One was the weak character development of Mr. Blue. Don't you think his character ought to be cut out? Secondly, when I slo-motioned the final confrontation scene, Chris Penn fell backward as if he got shot yet he wasn't shot yet. Anyway, the latter was really trivial. Now finally acknowledging it as a masterpiece as I raise its rating from `7' to `10', Reservoir Dogs is one of the fewest coolest pictures made, and it's already a cult film for so many reasons.<br /><br />6/11: Going to drop my rating of Reservoir Dogs from `10' to `8', I still think it's a good film. Just a couple of flaws in it. One is the acting is a bit overdone at times and just a bit too theatrical for me. Two is that so much blood came out of Mr. Orange over time that it becomes hard to believe he is still alive. The story is as clever as it gets, and the random moments are all connected together. It's a great piece of work where Quentin stole ideas from so many films and incorporated them into his own film, and the result is quite good. Of all actors, I think Sean Penn's work stands out the most. He is real good in his performance. The rest of everybody else is decent. Of course, there is a lot of moments in the film, making it a very watchable picture. All in all, no matter how bloody the film looks, Reservoir Dogs is worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>It's nice to see that Lions gate is putting out better Blu's these days,their Blu's of films like T2,The Punisher,Stargate are pretty void of extras,they look good but Blu's can hold a %#$@load of content,much more than a DVD,get me wrong I DO own those mentioned titles,and they do look great on Blu but they could have been so much more,so if you have the origianl DVD's keep em' for the extras,I smell yee' ol' double dip in the future,especially since the new Punisher and upcoming Terminator film,well back to the review,Reservioe Dogs has never looked of sounded better,and the extras a top flight,but keep your 10th anniversary dvd,because the extras here are different than the ones on that release!!!

Great character studies hold your interest throughout despite the implied graphic violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino is a director that brings real life violence to the big screen. This is his first film and I have to say, bravo.  I'm not really into gangster movies, but I heard good things about this film, so I took a chance. It is a masterpiece that will never be forgotten. It's a heist picture, with no actual heist. Tarantino went in a different direction with "Reservoir Dogs" by not showing the actual robbery, but it's visualized with descriptions provided by the characters. That's what made this film so great. This is a definite-must buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A32DTCFBBB9WIV.html">A32DTCFBBB9WIV</a><br/><p>Tarantino is a fake, from beginning to end. But putting this fact aside and judging only the movie, not the man behind the cameras, you'll see this is a good movie, although violent and exaggerated. The acting is very good,  the budget is low (and this is a merit for Tarantino). Anyway, we soon saw  how limited this director is when not dealing with violence and ideas he  steals from older movies, comic books and songs.</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>What you get for the money is far and away above most DVD's that give you much less in terms of special content.  This is also a special commemorative edition because it's a little older and usually they also cost even more, but not this one.  Boy oh boy, this includes both versions of the film, widescreen and PS, in case you loved the theatrical, or caught it later on video.  The extras are all personalized and funny.  Interviews with the cast and director, a review of the year in independant cinema breakthrough, Sundance film festival reviews of the directors and their films.  Critics at the festival who offer their view on the film, scene specific commentary from various people involved in the production, a dedication to various influences on the film by Tarantino, and much, much more.  My favorite thing was to listen to the raw audio tracks of Stephen Wright recording his DJ work with Quentin, hilarious.  The film is now considered a masterpiece of unique proportions and yet it also talks about certain things in it that might have derailed that success if the public hadn't been open to them, such as the violence.  Overall, a great presentation of a very influential and seminal film.  It almost gives you too many special features, which is rarity.  If you love American independant cinema you awe it to yourself to check out this inexpensively priced gem.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>i was pleasantly surprised by this feature film debut of Quentin Tarantino as writer/director.i had heard all the hype of how great it was over the years and was sure i would be disappointed.as it turns out,it was a pretty good film.great dialogue.memorable characters.smooth transitions from one scenes to another.the story was interesting.there's some violence,but bot at all at the level i was expecting.in fact,i had seen a lot worse before than and even directly after,while watching True Romance,coincidentally also written by Tarantino.True romance is much more blood soaked than Reservoir Dogs.however,there is some some very strong language.in conclusion,while i certainly wasn't disappointed in Reservoir Dogs,i wouldn't say it's a great movie.for me,Reservoir Dogs is a 3.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A258MSMKY2710V.html">A258MSMKY2710V</a><br/><p>from the comparrison that ign.com made between the picture quality of the no extras release and the release with good extras, the picture was horrible on the release with good extras. i don't actually own reservoir dogs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>First of all, I agree with some of the other reviewers with regards to the casting and the editing of the movie. Superb performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn and Steve Buscemi. Number two, a nice preparation for what lay ahead with Pulp Fiction, in terms of the editing and playing with the timeline, going back and forth, to tell the story in little pieces, almost ending with the middle of the story.<br /><br />As for the downside: I didn't find the story as compelling as Pulp Fiction's. Sometimes it can be funny, but the violence and the blood in the movie are pointless more than once and they don't contribute quite enough a brilliant storyline. Overall, I found it to be an good debut by Tarantino. As far as I'm concerned, "Pulp Fiction" was his first big break, and the best thing he did until the Kill Bill series.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>Reservoir Dogs is, in many respects, a precursor to the bigger and more sophisticated Pulp Fiction. However it's more basic, gritty style still highlights Quentin Tarrantino's directoral masterpieces. These include:<br /><br />1: Superb characterisation.<br /><br />2: Attention to meaningless dialogue and black humour (does any director do this better?). Among the finest scenes in the film include Mr Pink complaining about his assigned alias and Mr White trying to console the recently shot and catatonically bleeding Mr Orange lying in the back of his car.<br /><br />3: Classic fashion. What other mobie has defined a generic piece of kit like Reservoir Dogs did for black suits, skinny black ties and white shirts?<br /><br />4: Brilliant acting. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, even Tarrantion himself in a cameo find their perfect roles in this film, all played out with macho attempts at gangster type compassion and empathy.<br /><br />5: Innovative soundtrack. Not to the same extent as Pulp Fiction, which used songs such as Chuck Berry's 'Teenage Wedding' and Cat Stevens' 'You'll Be a Woman Soon' to genius extents. But Harvey Keitel prancing around a warehouse with a razor to 'Stuck in the Middle With You' to torture a captured cop is a brilliantly conceived scene.<br /><br />12 Years on, Reservoir Dogs remains a classic showcase of what Tarrantio does best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>In contrast to Quentin Tarantino's more polished and more elaborate later work, "Reservoir Dogs" pales in comparison.  This is ultimately an unfair criticism because this is the debut of a director getting his feet wet and he had limited resources at his disposal(a budget under one-million dollars).  Considering that, this film is a smashing success.  The dialogue that Tarantino has written for his characters is priceless, the tension he ratcheted up is palpable, and the performances he's gotten from his actors is top-notch.  I cannot cite one performance here from a single actor that is better or worse than another.  They work as a true ensemble, like an efficient machine.  This DVD is loaded with good extras, my favorite being a remembrance of Lawrence Tierney who played Joe in the film.  Tierney was a real character and it is lovingly related in this tribute.  My least favorite are the sections where Tarantino talks (and talks) about the movie.  Tarantino is an interesting person but not everything he says is a pearl of wisdom.  He should employ his editor, Sally Menke, whenever he has a sitdown interview.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>"Reservoir Dogs" has a lot of flashes of what's to come from Q.T.  And for that reason alone, "Dogs" is worth a watch.  To some extent the movie comes across as uneven, though the design of the film, with its flashbacks, is going to seem like that anyway.  Probably what best illustrates this is the extended conversation between Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) in the beginning of the film, regarding who set them up.  It just goes on too long, and could of easily been trimmed back.  It's like Tarantino had fallen in love with his dialogue, and then frontloaded it into the film, which makes for an awkward and talky start.<br /><br />That said, things pick up quickly.  Tarantino assembled a first-rate cast, and it pays off.  Lawrence Tierney, as the tough mastermind, is wonderful.  (I love how Q.T. brings back actors from the past.)  Buscemi, Keitel, Roth.  All excellent.  But check out psycho killer Michael Madsen!  He may of stole the film.  He's like a young Robert Mitchem at his most threatening.  His torture dance before a bound cop to the radio tune of  "Clowns to left of me, jokers to the right of me, here I am, stuck in the middle with you" is inspired (if very brutal) film making.  (Boy, did I squirm during that scene.)  Another winner, is Steve Buscemi's argument with Joe (Tierney) over his designation as "Mr. Pink."  Very funny, in an Elmore Leonard sort of way.  It's such scenes as these that have me nudging this one up from a three star to four star movie.  You sense this director is a cut above most others.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>To a degree amateurish, but to an equal degree compelling and original, Reservoir Dogs is a stylistic, gritty look at the gangsters of Quentin Tarantino's imagination.  The story, such as it is, is the weak point of the film.  The strange tale of an undercover cop who tries to bust up a family-sized gangster ring is just plain silly at times.  The strong points, however, are many.  Each character has a terrific, interesting voice; the dialogue is snappy and artistic; the music choices are inspired.  And that infamous &quot;ear&quot; scene?  Frankly, it's one of the few scenes that doesn't work.  It just comes off as dumb.<p>Think of Reservior Dogs as the rough sketch for a movie yet to come:  Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction is superior in every respect, but it's a treat to see its progenitor.</p></br><a href="../users/AK61LQI92GTCH.html">AK61LQI92GTCH</a><br/><p>Watching RESERVOIR DOGS for the first time a dozen years late is an odd experience.  It's like watching a football game - long stretches when nothing is happening are punctuated by brief moments of exaggerated violence, following by more interminably long stretches.<br /> A group of low-rent thugs are recruited by a crime boss to steal a shipment of diamonds.  To protect things, nobody uses their real names.  Rather they are given color names - Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, etc.  If they're caught, that deep level of anonymity will protect the rest of the group.  RESERVOIR DOGS is all about what happens when good heists go bad.  And this one goes very bad indeed.<br />  There is some very graphic violence here and gallons of movie blood are spilled; I strongly suggest anyone with a weak taste for such things pass this one by.  There are also some scenes that just go on and on and on, minutes after they've finished their business.  The characters, save for a few exceptions, are vaguely drawn.  I watched the special with the critics' review and I guess this was all intentional on Quentin Tarantino's part.<br /> The cast is excellent.  I don't usually like graphically violent movie, but I thought the infamous "ear" scene was very well done.  Yeah, it's brutal and it'll make you squirm some, it wasn't needed to push the story along, but it works.<br />  I give this one a tepid endorsement, mainly because I'm a big fan of Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 1992 film by Quentin Tarantino is creative, brilliant and has the force of a bullet at high speed.  And speaking of guns and bullets, there sure is no shortage of them here.  It's all about a diamond heist gone wrong.  It's not about the caper though.  It's about the bloody aftermath.<p>It opens with the would-be robbers having coffee in a restaurant.  They're smoking cigarettes and telling tall tales and, and even though they never mention the future robbery, they're getting to know each other and doing their one-upmanship macho thing.  Their real names are secrets.  Their leader, an older gruff veteran of similar heists, Lawrence Tierney, has forbidden them to use real names and, with the exception of Eddie, the tough guy's son played by Chris Penn, we only know them as Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Pink.<p>After that first scene, the credits are flashed on the screen.<p>The actual opening scene of the film is with Harvey Keitel driving a car with a wounded Tim Roth in the back seat.  Later, they meet up with the others, Michael Masden and Steve Buscemi in an abandoned warehouse.  There is much confrontation, more bloodshed.  There's also a cop whose been taken prisoner, Kirk Baltz, who winds up being the victim of Michael Masden's unflinching cruelty.<p>The dialog is fast and brilliant.  The flashbacks are quick and come at just the right time to enrich the story.  The characters are placed in a pressure-cooker situation where their true colors eventually come out.  It's incredibly violent.  But it's the character development that is what is really important.  The acting is uniformly terrific.  And how it all plays out is inevitable.<p>The DVD has some great interviews with some of the actors and with Tarantino himself.  Each interview is less than ten minutes; each has a different background; and each is about a unique experience in the filming of Reservoir Dogs.  These extras were enjoyable, interesting and enriched my experience of the film.<p>This is a groundbreaking work with the hint of genius.  I loved it.  I therefore highly recommend this film for anyone not afraid of copious amounts of make-believe blood and gore.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "Reservoir Dogs" (Special 10th Anniversary Edition). I watched the full screen version. It was an interesting and stunning movie on many different levels. The movie attracted considerable critical acclaim, and it deserved it. It's a gristly and violent movie, so beware if you're squeamish. Also, most of the language leans toward the F-speak dialect, a little too much in my opinion.<br /><br />The movie concerned a major diamond robbery which was anticipated and thwarted by the police and, ultimately, turned into a disaster for all concerned. Now, doesn't this seem like a good plot for a high action movie? Well, it's not. The robbery wasn't even shown and there's very little in the way of action. Most of the movie is pure dialog which took place at a limited number of settings. What limited action took place was gory and somewhat difficult to watch.<br /><br />The movie was divided into a number of scenes and these were shown out of chronologic order so it's up to the viewer to piece the story together. It's complicated, but thought provoking. The scenes depicted the Reservoir Dogs characters, each given a color-code name, such as black, white, pink as a security matter. There were about six main characters, plus a couple minor ones. Some scenes involved planning at different stages. Some scenes involved the different characters and their lives outside of the robbery story. Some involved different aspects of the robbery as it unfolded and afterward. Most of the scenes involved the regrouping of the Dogs at an old warehouse after the robbery. The robbery was thwarted through the efforts of an undercover cop who was, in fact, one of the Reservoir Dogs and the group gradually realized that one among them was a traitor to the group effort. The movie was a very interesting study of character and the  tension built to a catastrophic climax. It was an exceptionally well done movie. The acting was absolutely first rate! If you're having problems understanding things in the early going, stay with it. It's worth the effort!<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Director Quentin Tarantino is one of the most passionate filmmakers I have ever seen. If you listen to him talk about his films, he can barely contain his enthusiasm. He reportedly dropped out of high school despite having an IQ of 160 because he wanted to pursue his passion. I can certainly identify with that.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs was Tarantino's first full-length feature and it contains most of the elements we have come to expect. Although his style is all over it, it feels a little rough around the edges. That doesn't stop it from being a superb film, but it's interesting to see how he perfected his craft in later efforts.<br /><br />If you have ever seen a Tarantino film, you'll know that his dialogue is distinctive. In fact, I don't think anyone writes better dialogue. The story opens with a  restaurant scene in which a gang of thieves, led by Joe Cabot (Tierney), discusses the meaning of Madonna's Like a Virgin. The scene develops with Mr. Pink (Buscemi) explaining why he rarely tips. It's clever, funny and logical, and it says a lot about the character.<br /><br />This approach is present in all of Tarantino's films and it's so refreshing. Why would thieves, police or German colonels only talk about their job? It just doesn't ring true. Tarantino's characters become more real because they talk about anything that comes to mind.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is essentially a heist movie, but we never actually see the robbery take place. We see some of the planning and surveillance as the gang plans the robbery, and we see some of them fleeing the scene after it takes place. The bulk of the story takes place in a warehouse where the surviving gang members agree to meet, and it could be happening in real time.<br /><br />Mr. White (Keitel) arrives first with Mr. Orange (Roth) and Mr. Pink. Orange was shot in the belly after the robbery and White and Pink are discussing what to do. Pink has a theory that someone ratted them out and that the police were at the scene much too soon. We gradually learn that Mr. Blonde (Madsen) started shooting everyone in sight during the robbery and his actions caused the police to intervene.<br /><br />Tarantino loves to pause the story to explain the origin or background of his characters, and he uses that technique in Reservoir Dogs. We find out who Mr. Blonde is and why he is part of the gang. Another scene shows how Mr. Pink escaped the crime scene, although the account may not be accurate as it's from his viewpoint. The most interesting flashback reveals the identity and motivations of the rat and how he memorized an anecdote to make his character seem more authentic to the other members of the gang.<br /><br />My favorite characters are Mr. White and Mr. Pink. I could watch Buscemi in anything and his character is similar to the one he played in Fargo. His final actions fit his character perfectly. Keitel's character is the most complex. Although he's a criminal, he has his own sense of honor. He clearly cares whether Mr. Orange lives or dies, while the other gang members seem indifferent. His choices are somewhat brave under the circumstances.<br /><br />There is a lot of violence in the film, but the camera pans away from the action during the most violent scene. Like Hitchcock, Tarantino allows us to imagine the events rather than see them. The color red is removed from almost every scene, although Mr. White is seen wearing a red shirt at one point. This makes the scenes involving blood stand out even more. The gang wears black suits, white shirts and black ties. It's almost like a uniform.<br /><br />I avoided seeing Reservoir Dogs for several years because I don't like pointless violence, but I'm glad I eventually decided to watch it. You have to realize that Tarantino's films are dark comedies and that humor is present in almost every conversation or situation. It's intelligent humor, but it's there. As a result, I'm able to watch the violent scenes knowing that they are tongue-in-cheek for the most part. I'm tempted to say that Tarantino films belong to a genre all of their own. The only other films that have a similar feel are some of the Coens' work, such as Fargo, and Martin McDonagh's In Bruges.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is a fascinating and original look at events after a robbery. You can see many of Tarantino's trademarks such as the use of music, dialogue, camera shots from inside a trunk, flashbacks to expand characters and a Mexican standoff. I highly recommend Tarantino's unique style.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>A brilliant, brutal heist film focusing on the before and after rather than the act itself, Tarantino's darkly funny "Reservoir Dogs" was the most auspicious debut of the 1990s, brought to life through the efforts of Keitel, who was impressed with the unconventional script. Tarantino peppers his film with pop-culture references, salty dialogue, and flashbacks that not only heighten suspense but fill in the back stories of his key characters. Keitel, Roth, Buscemi, Chris Penn, and Michael Madsen really run with their roles as bickering psychopaths. Great use of `70's period music as well- anyone remember "Stuck In The Middle With You?" At once graphically violent and darkly funny, "Reservoir Dogs" has one hell of a bite.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>I first saw Reservoir Dogs on video, and I remember very vividly that first experience of seeing such a fascinating story told in such an original way.  It would begin my love affair with anything Tarantino threw on screen, because it's so clear that this is a man who loves movies, and Reservoir Dogs was such a great way to begin his career with a bang.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is the story of a heist gone terribly awry.  It's discovered, through typical Tarantino flashback-style, that one of the members of the heist team is really an undercover agent, meant to disrupt it.  Problems result and one of the members of the team (Tim Roth) takes a vicious hit to the stomach as the heist ends in an unexpected shootout, and the other surviving members of the team are left in a warehouse fighting the clock to figure out who the 'rat' was, as well as what to do with their team member who is dying in front of them.<br /><br />Watchin these men turn on each other as they try to figure out who was the plant, how to save Roth, and how are they going to explain this to the boss makes for a story that has surprising depth and twists.  Tarrantino is a MASTER with dialogue, and this was the film that set his bar extremely high.<br /><br />The casting for this was impeccable as well.  Michael Madsen is flawless as Vic Vega, the hitman who takes pleasure in his dirty work,(I gaurantee you that you will never be able to listen to 'Stuck in the Middle with You' without cringing ever again) Steve Buchemi as the bit player hitman who wants a bigger part, and may just get it, in spite of himself, and Harvey Keitel as the one who takes Tim Roth's character under his wing to mentor him and must make hard and fast choices to keep him alive. (Keitel also was so impressed with Tarrantino's script that he was the driving force in getting the financing, and took a serious pay cut to have the film made)  Chris Penn also has a terrific turn as the thug-boss-son trying to run the show on his own and scrambing to figure out why everyting went so wrong.<br /><br />This film is absolutely amazing, and the DVD is by no means a wast of money.  Repeat viewings offer different insights into the story and help build on one's appreciation of it.  Also, the extras are really better than you would expect on a film this old.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A crew of criminals rip off a diamond merchant.  The cops intervene far more quickly than seems natural.  Were the robbers set up?  That's the question left for the survivors to puzzle out as they rendezvous back at their meeting place.<br /><br />Writer/director Quentin Tarentino has clearly learned the lesson that a basic, straightforward narrative gains intrinsic interest from a skilled skewing of narrative.  What seems like an uncomplicated crime story gains new and unexpected levels because Tarentino chooses to shoot events in an unconventional order, often producing surprising juxtapositions. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8AO9XASQ15C.html">A1R8AO9XASQ15C</a><br/><p>I would not advise watching this movie with anyone other than a person who has A) a strong stomach, B) a high tolerance for foul language and C) an appreciation for black humor.<p>QT's debut film is a powerful crime drama with images vivid enough to sear holes in your brain. Few directors who have been at work for decades can match the ferocity, passion, and sheer intensity found in Reservoir Dogs. It is an unforgettable experience, whether you ultimately like the movie or not.<p>The acting is first-rate, as usual with a Tarantino film. The dialogue is funny, obscene, insightful and instantly recognizable as QT. As a thriller, this is one tight little number.<p>The only trouble is that Reservoir Dog probably will not age as well as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. Subtlety isn't its strongest point, and it lacks the nuances and character development that Tarantino went on to master. This is not Tarantino's best movie, but with his level of talent, perhaps that's not surprising. Reservoir Dogs was a great place to start, and as a writer and filmmaker, QT has improved tremendously.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Mr. White ( Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange ( Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink ( Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blue ( Edward Bunker), and Mr. Brown ( Quentin Tarantino) are all perfect strangers that have been brought together by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney)to pull a simple diamond store heist. Unfortunately, when they show up, the cops are waiting for them and the simple robbery turns into a blood bath. Now this obviously means that they were set up. But no one knows which one of them is the police informant. The majority of the film involves introducing us to the characters and showing how they came to be involved, as well as flashbacks and flashforwards taking us through the day to watch the events unfold. <p>&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; marked the directorial debut of Quentin Tarantino, and I must say that it has to be one of the best film debuts that I have ever seen. The cast picked for this film was absolutely perfect. They all offer outstanding performances, and the film could not have succeeded without them. Tarantino was not only responsible for the direction of the film, but also wrote the flawless script. The script is brilliant. You have got a simple robbery gone wrong, that turns into a hard to solve mystery. Any man could be guilty. Not to mention the violence, which includes the infamous torture scene with Michael Madsen. The main reason this film succeeds, is that it shows what ordinary crime films keep out - the frustration when something goes wrong, the humor, and the clashing of egos between the criminals. The soundtrack to this movie is outstanding as well, and each song used fits each scene perfectly. <p>Overall, this is one of the best crime films that I have ever seen. The film is shot brilliantly taking us back and forth over the day of the robbery. This provides for tons of violence, a hard to solve mystery, and outstanding dialogue between the characters. This is the first crime film that I have seen that runs mainly on the personalities of the characters, and not the actual story. The DVD is great. The film was re-released with this Special 2 Disc Edition. Now you get deleted scenes, interviews with all of the cast, a tribute to Lawrence Tierney, and much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>Quentin Tarantino's blood spattered tragicomic tale of a robbery gone wrong still leaves an impression every time I see it. Top drawer acting by Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi. A few lapses in logic creep in here and there, but you'll still be gripped by the rest of the film. Kinda functions like a play, most of the movie takes place in one location,where everyone involved in the robbery tries to figure out what had gone wrong. Everyone who is in the movie dies except for maybe seven people. No women in at all in the film, either. Just slick villains who lose control over a tense situation. Strong stomachs are advised for certain scenes, and an ability to not be offended easily might help. The kids would love it, but this is a very adult affair. A keeper, worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>This movie does not contain that much action but the dialogue is great and holds well. The action takes place near the end which is kind of important because without the action the truth would not be revealed to some of the characters. Anyways it's about 5 guys planning to do a heist , except one of them is a cop. So the movie goes through each character's angle on the heist until each angle equals a scene in which a face off takes place with every character going against eachother to find out why their perfect plan whent so horribly wrong. This film is a must have for Tarantino fans everywhere and a definte must see for anyone looking for a film that makes you assume the roles and actions but makes you keep on guessing the whole time!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is an intelligent cross between mobster and typical gangster movies. Unlike many where the people are too drunk, stoned or incompetent, this is much more realistic. The actors do a bang-up job of playing their parts. The cinematography and editing are great. The sound is great, especially the soundtrack. You get to see snippets into the future, so you have some idea of what might happen, but the suspense makes you watch all of it unfold. Probably in the top 50 of my 2000+ films, perhaps in top 25. Watch those colors, boys!</p></br></body></html>

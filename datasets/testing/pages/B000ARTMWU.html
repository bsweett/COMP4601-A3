The way it looked, as well as some of the structural elements as well. At first it appears as an art film, but by the end of the film, it's something completely different. Although, there were problems with the film's plot, which didn't make a lot of sense, the central character's motivation wasn't explained at all, either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Sometimes you just have to admit it's your own fault for renting a movie. You probably know it's going to be terrible because of word of mouth or reviews but you just try anyway, in hopes that it could pull a rabbit out and surprise you. After being uber-disappointed in the Saw sequels, the Hills Have Eyes remake and the too-awful-for-words tragedy that is Hostel, I know now how recent horror movies are so if it sucks, I've no one to blame but myself. Before he made the Hills Have Eyes remake, Alexandre Aja made this with more than a couple ideas from other films but it ultimately doesn't lead to a satisfying whole, just bit parts.<br /><br />Marie and Alex are 2 friends driving to the countryside to stay at Alex's old house with her parents and brother. Things are fine until a truck driver pulls up to the house and brutally kills everyone, stalks the rooms looking for Marie and tying up Alex. Marie decides to save the day and help her friend but the killer isn't some run-of-the-mill moron either.<br /><br />Now, unlike the film's I mentioned where they seemed like endurance tests and how long would it take before I switched the movie off, I had to admit this film did have me for awhile. The first section of it, taking place in the house is creepy with plenty of atmosphere, heightened sound effects and a foreboding feel in the air. Sure there's some gore but it was excusable since they didn't go full tilt with it. But then goes nuts and has some gore, including a big act involving a circular saw and it just feels too much. Whereas before it was more of a thriller/horror, here they overdo it and it becomes just another slasher movie.<br /><br />Now it comes down to the "twist" which I won't reveal but it feels slightly gimmicky like they saw the Usual Suspects, Memento, the Sixth Sense and Fight Club in a row and thought twist endings were cool so they wrote one of their own. It would be fine if the twist fit but instead it brings just an out of the blue shift that it just doesn't feel right. Then there's the writing where you can notice clues along the way. Some twists work because it's only on second viewing you notice whereas here certain things just look too obvious. Example? A hand carrying bullets. I'll say no more.<br /><br />If you like Hostel, Hills Have Eyes or Wolf Creek, you'll like this too. If you prefer the Shining or the Exorcist, you might want to look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I just want to say that in the past week I've watched two of the most brutal horror movies I've ever seen and both of them were directed by Alexandre Aja who is most likely the most ingenious horror director working right now (much better than Wes Craven that's for sure).  In this film Aja develops a truly horrifying sequence of events and builds an intense and disturbing atmosphere that will eat at you until the very end.  `High Tension' takes place in France and it follows the formula set out by Dean Koontz in `Intensity' where you have a young girl named Marie (Cecile De France) who's visiting her friend Alex's (Maiwenn Le Besco) family when a stranger breaks in and kills everyone off leaving Marie to save herself.  Yes, as many have stated, the ending is a shocker and some may feel slighted slightly but I don't feel it a total letdown.  Cecile and Maiwenn do a great job of portraying completely convincing fear and pain.  All in all this is a horrifying ride full of realistic gore and quality scares.  Highly recommended for any fan of the horror genre, this ones a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I didn't know what to expect with this one.  I had seen some reviews on web sites and the packaging proclaiming this to be the horror movie of the year.  I was also under the impression that this was a very low budget affair, but doing some research I found that this film had a 2 million dollar budget.  While that is not a high number, it is a decent budget for a horror.  The movie is French, and the dubbing is pretty bad.  It is also imcomplete as many places they still speak in French.  It is probably better to use the subtitles.  The story itself is pretty effective, though I was able to figure out the twist long before the movie revealed it.  The blood flows heavily on the unrated version.  As the movie progresses, the fx killings get better and more realistic.  I think this is worth a watch, but probably not a buy in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>When I saw this I thought that it will be really scary,but it wasn't it was really clever to even be a movie.But it was really well made too which was good. But if you'll see it you won't regret it because of the ending which reflects the texas chainsaw massacre will scare and surprise you so I say it's a worth to buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This movie is violent and frightening. Some scenes will really make you clench your teeth. When the lead character tries to deceive the homicidal maniac into thinking he's already killed everyone in the house, she works fast - trying to erase in a flash all signs that's she's been occupying the upstairs guest room. Then she hides. The killer senses some additional occupant and slowly, excruciatingly examines the room. A single telltale drop of water oozing from the lip of the faucet suggests a sink that was recently used - and therefore suggests someone left alive. Fee, fi, fo, fum... The tension attached to this discovery is almost unbearable. We have here a maniac who's more than just a killing machine. This maniac has some wile and some capacity for outwitting his victims.<br /><br />However, this movie ends up by outwitting itself. It tries to be so surprising that it leaps right into the realm of the totally unbelievable.<br /><br />The twist ending it contrives is both physically and psychologically implausible in the extreme. A particularly gruesome scene that occurs early in the film becomes especially inexplicable in light of the final revelations.<br /><br />Cecile De France's lithe athleticism is compelling on screen as she resists the savage onslaughts of the killer. The French subtitles aren't a chore because there's not that much dialogue. And the movie was a thrill ride the first time around.<br /><br />However when I viewed it through the second time, with some of the suspense stripped away, I could be more critical. I saw how the U-turn the film takes causes it to lose all credibility. While the story line might seem to maintain high-tension tautness at first, it definitely goes slack when you examine the premise.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>HIGH TENSION is not your typical gore fiesta. It starts out gently enough, quickly shifting into an all-out frenzy of murderous insanity! This extreme level of intensity doesn't let up, so don't expect any comedy or romantic breaks here! The basic plot has been well covered elsewhere. I'll just say that it only serves to give a narrative skeleton to hang the visceral shocks and thrills on. There are many memorable scenes that are best seen without prior warning. No spoilers! The stalker / killer is perfectly evil and relentlessly driven. As for the "twist" ending, I found it to be a true jaw-dropper, in the SAW (the first one) sense. I've watched HT several times now, and the clues are there if you pay close attention to the characters' actions and words. This movie left me w/ my thrill addiction satisfied, and my horror itch well scratched. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Ahh, the French. In my personal world of cinema, the French are mostly known for crafting films with leanings toward the artsy-fartsy, but, you know, every now and then, they do eschew the lofty, artistic pretenses and simply bust out with a no-nonsense, cut to the chase kind of movie. And that's what I thought we had initially when I started watching HIGH TENSION. But, alas, as it turns out, this movie does end up being true to its innate Frenchness as, amidst all the gory slaughter, it does provide its own set of symbolisms, and so, in that sense, it is arty. But not enough to hamper my enjoyment of what is predominantly a bloodily direct, point A to point B, slasher horrorfest.<br /><br />HIGH TENSION, as co-written and helmed by French director by Alexandre Ada, is damned harrowing and moves at a driving clip. In Ada's own words, HIGH TENSION was "conceived as an ode to the 1970s American horror/slasher films (he) loved as a teenager." As such, this latest offering in the slasher genre is deliberately reduced to its bare essentials. HIGH TENSION is a film that is spare, visceral, single-minded, and it definitely pulls no punches. If you're a gorehound of any quality, you'll think it's terrific stuff.<br /><br />The premise is simple and straightforward, involving two girls' frenzied and nightmarish bid for survival against a frightening, homicidal maniac intent on butchering them. The majority of the movie consists of Marie (Cecile de France) determinedly pursuing the murderous lunatic in the workman's outfit who had already massacred the inhabitants of the country home in which she was staying and who had also kidnapped Marie's best friend, Alex (Maiwenn).<br /><br />Now, this paragraph, in part, concerns the movie's climax and does contain serious SPOILERS. With regards to the "twist" ending, this stabhappy feature is somewhat reminiscent of IDENTITY and Agatha Christie's WHO MURDERED ROGER ACKROYD? If you've seen that film or read that book, then you already know what the surprise ending here is. There are clues and hints put out there in the course of the film that do seem to point towards the shocking revelation, but they are so subtle and seemingly non-sequitur as to become virtually negligible. No wonder several viewers are confused and even feel cheated. There is a tendency to feel that the surprise reveal does come out of left field. Myself, I didn't see it coming. I had to watch it twice, with the second screening being devoted solely to ferreting out clues and hidden meanings. For example, only after my second viewing does the early scene - of the nutso killer performing masturbation via the decapitated head of a girl (who resembles Alex) - begin to take on deeper symbology, rather than being merely a scene reflecting the killer's depravity, which was what I thought it was about, originally. There's also a clue-divulging scene involving one character who indulges in a "self-treat" after glimpsing a nude Alex thru a window.<br /><br />But, nevermind all that. Yes, there are inconsistencies in the film, but the aura of unrelenting tension and stark desperation serves to carry the story and camouflage the flaws, at least, until the the big reveal. The intense, if one-note, acting of lead actress Cecile de France and the acute terror displayed by Maiwenn go a ways to accentuate the horror aspect. However, Philippe Nahon, who plays the killer, is ho-hum. Now, the version I saw was dubbed in English (with Cecile de France adeptly doing her own dubbing honors) and I feel the translation did take a miniscule something away from the movie; whenever I get a chance, providing it's sub-titled, I prefer watching a foreign film in its original state.<br /><br />So, let me encapsulate: HIGH TENSION is no frills and gorily no-holds-barred; it's more of a psychological thriller than you might think. Compared to some recent and even not so recent derivative efforts in the horror/slasher genre (the remakes of WHEN A STRANGER CALLS or BLACK CHRISTMAS, anyone?), HIGH TENSION is decidedly a cut above (sorry). So, add this one to the more diverting dice 'em, slice 'em flicks, such as SCREAM, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, and the SAW series, although as I was watching it, the one film that kept popping up in my noggin was Rutger Hauer's THE HITCHER. As I recall, THE HITCHER, too, shared the same inexorable pace and the same debilitating (from the protagonist's point of view) sense of "Oh, crap, this a**hole's gonna be fairly impossible to stop." Three and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>High Tension carried me on a suspenseful, frightening trip that never had a boring lull. If you want to be scared and constantly wonder what's around the bend, watch this film. The French cornered the market on fright and horror with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Tensions run high in High Tension.  Sorry about that awful and pitiful attempt at a pun, but I didn't really know how else to start this review.  Coming from the land of Lattes, Pepe LePew and croissants, this film is actually pretty good considering it's a newer horror film.  Plotwise it's not terribly original, but it's pulled off with style and never becomes boring considering most of the film is a cat and mouse game.  There isn't a very high body count, but the murders are especially graphic and look quite realistic actually.  The blood really looks like blood in this film.  I catch a big Dario Argento influence to the whole thing.  Basically we have two women who are witnesses to a brutal slaying of one of the girl's parents.  The killer kidnaps the daughter, binds her and throws her into the back of his truck to take her to God knows where to do God knows what with her.  The second girl sneaks aboard the truck and basically tries to free her friend without arousing the killer's suspicion.  This constant dodging of the killer is what leads to the moments of High Tension.  Plotwise it's similar to the book Intensity by Dean Koontz if you've ever read that.  Many folks despise the "Twist" of this film.  I won't pretend to understand it either, coz it does defy all laws of physics, but if you really want to analyze it deeply, you can probably find something more to it.  I won't waste my time doing that though.  I found it entertaining enough, and could just accept it as implausible as it is.  Highly recommended if you're like me and all but given up on the state of the horror genre anymore.  Take the plunge!  Check it out!  D'accord?</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>For most of its running time, HIGH TENSION is a mindless, albeit suspenseful, retread of many slasher movies of the past.  Fueled by the presence of Cecile DeFrance in the leading role, the movie manages to keep us enthralled with the plight of a young girl who is trying to escape the murderer who has brutally slayed the family of her best friend.  What undoes the movie however is its ludicrous plot twist that is so outrageous, it can't be believed for a minute.  While to be applauded for an attempt to put a new twist on the tired genre, HIGH TENSION falls apart with its contrived and unbelievable ending.  Too bad, it was doing great up until then.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>High Tension is an intense film that you will want to watch from start to finish. If you can make it through all of the blood and gore to the finish you might find yourself scratching your head due to an unexpected twist in the film.<br /><br />The film is about two college students, Maria and Alexia. Maria heads with Alexia to her home in the middle of nowhere surrounded by cornfields to study. Alexia's family is comprised of her mother, father and very young brother. High Tension was originally released in France. This movie has a lot more blood and gore than U.S. horror movies have had in the last 15 years. The first night as everyone is tucked into bed the massacre begins as the viewers watch a highway man bloody kill and torture one person after another. As the film ends it becomes baffling to even describe what happened during the course of the film. Basically, Alexia appears to be kidnapped by the highway man and Maria appears to be doing everything in her power to rescue Alexia down to being involved in a car wreck when trying to rescue Alexia from the supposed murderer/kidnapper. If you have seen the movie Identity or the movie Intensity you may notice some storyline similarities. The film is very bloody and very gory in it's unrated version. Despite the storyline that might leave you scratching your head it is an intense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last frame appears on the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I heard a lot of good things about this movie before I watched it.  I was impressed by all the gore and I thought to myself that finally, in this genre, there was going to be an excellent movie.  All the way up until the ending, I was really into it.  The ending messes up the movie because things start making absolutely no sense.  If they would have incorporated the ending into the movie where it would have made more sense, this movie would have been better than I thought it was.  Another thing that took the viewing pleasure away from me was the poor dubbing.  I would rather watch this in French with English subtitles, at least that way, it wouldn't be so annoying.  Overall, I would say this is good for a rental.  I have to say that I am slightly disappointed because this showed so much potential.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>I watched the unrated version and loved it.  I loved the fact that someone had the balls to make a decent, brutal, gory horror film with a great storyline also.  There was so much blood in this movie that the camera seemed awash with it at times, but it didn't bother me, it made it scarier!  Def the best in years!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>What starts as a really wild white knuckle suspense flick fumbles away its greatness by the time it ends, even if it seemed on track to be a five star scare movie. While I won't throw the ending in as spoiler, suffice to say that the final scene negates anything that would have happened in the rest of "High Tension."<br /><br />Yet this nationally successful French horror takes the usual slasher set up and uses about half its running time in a frantic cat and mouse game between Alex, Marie and Le tueur (the mystery killer). Alex takes her school pal Marie to her family's rural bungalow so they can concentrate on the collegiate studies, but a dark and creepy van pulls up to the door in the middle of the night. Begin the gory body count. Cue the slit throat. And check out that hot chick in chains. Yup, it's the return to teens in trouble that made films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIWAVW">Halloween</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C8ART">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> into classics.<br /><br />Marie is kidnapped and hauled away from the carnage and it's up to the infatuated Alex to save her. Even though "High Tension" leaps around from French to English and subtitles, during the chase scenes, the words are more or less unnecessary since fear is the primary language. When Alex finally gets her barbed wire weapon and faces off against the psycho, you'll be gripping your armrests. Up to this point, "High Tension" had me hook line and....<br /><br />...stinker. The final twist is so amateurish and bogus as to rend your previous 90 minutes as a waste. As the cops come review video of one of the murder scenes and the twist is revealed, you realize that the total sum of the film up to this moment was utterly implausible. It was almost as bad as a forced Saturday Night Live skit where the just throw away the endline to get out off the stage. I've seen Scooby Doo episodes that ended more believably. It shifts "High Tension" to the realm of films for horror junkies only, as those with a passing interest will wade through the gore and chase scenes just to bellow WTF at the final credits.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>The French horror film "High Tension" is actually two movies, and one of them sucks.  If you want to watch the four-star version, skip the first fifteen seconds after the opening credits, and turn the DVD player off right after the greenhouse scene near the end of the film.  If you let it play any longer, I guarantee you that what previously made sense will cease to.<br /><br />The movie has two climaxes, two resolutions, and two narrative threads, and only one of them has any entertainmnet value.  The first story has legs, and it uses them to pace with sure footing through some standard (but cunningly utilized) horror movie moments.  The second story, however, takes two plot twists and applies them directly to both of the movie's ankles, giving the audience a hopelessly crippled mess that only barely manages to drag itself to a reasonable finish line.<br /><br />I could go into the plot twists, but that would ruin the movie (so to speak).  The most I'll say is that, while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">these</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002234LS">types</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00092ZLSK">of</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008EY9G">twists</a> have formed the backbone of some seriously excellent films, they have since been worked to death by an industry that has begun to confuse inventiveness with inanity.  And are they, for the most part, even necessary?<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9HH">some</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ4">cases</a>, absolutely.  In this case: are you kidding me?<br /><br />It's a shame, too.  The beginning to Alexandre Aja's film is riveting and unsettling.  Two college friends, Marie and Alexa, go on a study-vacation to Alexa's parents' country home, but they hardly get to crack a book before a mysterious murderer enters the picture and starts cracking other things.  Skulls, for example.  The entire sequence that occurs in the house is brilliantly done, and gives the title of the film some serious credit.<br /><br />The power of the plot dwindles a bit when the story hits the road.  The central character, Marie (a talented Cecile De France), sweats and schemes her way out of the house in an attempt to escape the killer or at least find help, and the audience is with her the whole way.  However, the raspy-lunged, creepily-methodical killer absconds with Alexa, and Marie becomes bent on saving her friend and avenging the deaths she's witnessed.  It's a not-entirely-acceptable personality shift, but in light of the even more ridiculous shifts to come, its passable.<br /><br />More than passable, the core of the film is actually pretty darn absorbing.  Cecile plays the tortured heroine with just enough off-the-cuff intelligence and fault-the-fear stupidity to hold the helm as the Leading Lady.  It's too bad that her contributions to the story (and even Aja's bewitching directing) are buried under last minute theatrics.  There's a good movie here, to be sure.  But, like a supermodel in a gorilla suit, this film's seductive center is wrapped in something stupid, fake, and rented.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>The movie was going really good. It was tense, exciting, nerve wracking....then the ending just ruined it all.<br /><br />Most of what you see in this film is just what the killer is imagining.  I'd say only 15% of the movie actually happened.  Everything else is just a dream.  We don't figure this out until they reveal the ending.<br /><br />While this could work for most people, many of us have seen this same plot device used many times before in other movies or TV shows, so the idea is old and basically just ruins the film for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Absurdly unrealistic thriller, but entertaininging nonetheless. And I was neither high nor tense as I watched.<br /><br />Without giving the twist away, let me just say that I was questioning some of the holes in this flick prior to "the big twist". Then came the twist and the whole movie collapsed like a house of cards in a hurricane.<br /><br />There's suspense (in the start of the movie), there's a decent storyline (in the start of the movie), there's pretty good acting throughout the movie, but don't buy this...it's not a keeper unless you collect gore (and absurd stories).<br /><br />It's the the story of a family's house-guest that witnesses the family's brutal murder; the guest hides during the murders, then follows the murderer during "his" escape. That's when...well...that's all I'll say. But let's put it this way: The movie is pretty good up until the last half hour when the hurricane blows in to knock down the house-of-cards-plotline into the abyss of the absurd.<br /><br />I must say that for the amount of time that I was entertained it's worth a rental. But even if you don't mind burning the cash for a purchase of this silly frightfest...your first viewing will likely be your last.<br /><br />Rent it. Don't buy it.

There's a failed escape, an axe, a car chase, some stalking, more stalking, barbed-wire beatings, a tremendous buzz-saw thingee that yes, causes a lot of blood to just spraaaaaaaaaay all over the audience, etc, etc.<br /><br />But...unfortunately, our Franco filmmakers can't leave well enough alone.  Look, I like slasher movies, I can deal with the usual, the demented male killer chopping people up, I know where it's coming from and going.  But something happened here...they had to be cute and include a 'twist'.  And not a good twist, either.  No, this is a baloney twist, a makes-no-sense twist.  According to this twist, every bit of logic is thrown out the window.  Seriously, the twist just doesn't make any sense--it's on the 'it was only a dream level' of 'twists' (ie LAME) but it's not 'only a dream', so I didn't spoil it for you.  In one of the extras, the filmmakers start discussing it and 'the clues' (which in hindsight are pretty lame) but it's not even worth trying to dissect it.  It's just a cheap story device.<br /><br />So for most of the flick, we have an old fashioned insane madman on the loose killing people.  Fair enough.  We have some impressive gore, done by the dude who used to spray the red stuff for Lucio Fulci, and we see some of those old stylistic touches (the gruesome murder in front of the slatted-door closet is one, the relentless spray in the car with that crazy buzz-saw is another, the overall love of gore, period).  There is some good high tension, actually, including the killer stomping around the farm house, looking for victims.  There's also some of the stupidest slasher-movie behavior I've seen in a long time, I mean, very stupid.  There's a high demented factor, of course, and the filmmakers were even nice enough to make sure that a little kid gets it, too.  So tasteful are the French and their American slasher counterparts.<br /><br />Overall, most of the ride is decent.  But the twist really negates so much of the film and makes you feel like, well, an idiot, even though it's the filmmakers who should feel idiotic since the whacky surprise ending is completely unnecessary.  (Even worse, the twist assumes a level of character development that the film simply does not bother with, so again, why?)<br /><br />Looks good, sounds good, multiple options for listening, a bunch of extras, blah blah blah.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>The feature film breakout from French director Alexandre Aja is just the kind of grueling and grisly splatter-fest you won't soon forget. However, "High Tension" (or "Haute Tension," if you prefer) is more than just gore galore with a stylistic touch; it's also a psychological horror that not only plays with your mind, but alters your expectations of what a horror movie could and should be as well.<br /><br />In the film, best friends and college students Alex and Marie find their vacation in a remote farmhouse owned by Alex's parents cut short when a mysterious man in a grungy overalls welcomes himself in. After the family is dispatched of and the man kidnaps Alex in his creepy Scooby-Doo van, Marie pursues him on a roadtrip that finds the carnage mounting as the tension builds, capping off in an unforgettable conclusion.<br /><br />Proving to be a true master of horror, Alexandre Aja combines arresting visuals with disturbing imagery to concoct a bold piece of cinema that takes the genre to a whole new level. Among its accomplishments, this film marks the beginning of the French horror boom that eventually gave way to the director's fruitful career in the United States, directing the successful remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAOC2W">The Hills Have Eyes</a>. It's a tough film to discuss without giving too much away, but rest assured, its effects will linger for days after seeing it. It's a film that begs to be seen twice as there is so much to digest and the film leads you to believe it's something it's not the first go-round. Crammed full of suspense, gore and style, "High Tension" is the kind of film that more than lives up to its name.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GANR9I6XHTU9.html">A2GANR9I6XHTU9</a><br/><p>High tension is a new and interesting horror film recently released. Ive never seen anything like it before. They dont call it High Tension for nothing, thats for sure. The whole movie will have you on the edge of your seat and there is more than the fair share of shocks and suprises throughout the film. The overall atmosphere has a lonesome creepy feeling about it, full of cornfields, seclusion and quietness. Gorehounds will love this, there is tons of gore and the ending will suprise the hell out of you. There are very few horror films that can shock you in such a way where you literally jump out of your seat but this one has its moments.<br /><br />Setting,France. The story surrounds Alex and Marie, 2 college students who retreat to Alex's parents isolated farm house looking to study for their college exams for the weekend. While everyone in the house settles in for the night, Marie is in bed when she starts to hear sounds and sees a truck pull up. Soon enough a homicidal maniac breaks in the home and from there its a non-stop rollercoaster ride of terror. And then the twist at the end..<br /><br />This is a movie that shouldnt be missed by fans of the horror genre. It revels in its gore and has a smart edge to it.<br /><br />High Tension is partially dubbed into english but for a lot of the movie you dont need subtitles.

Here we have an athletic, spare, no-bullsh*t little horror flick that drives up to your house in the dead of night (while you're just getting into that "I gotta be dreaming" state of deep-groggy-helplessness), smashes your door down, stomps up your stairs, and butchers you like a squealing hog before you've even gotten your jammy-clad butt clear of the bedclothes.<br /><br />"Haute Tension" is a compact, stylish, jarring, gorgeously shot, supply terrifying little tale of a happy little family and their visitor Marie (the astonishingly nubile Cecille de France, who can wield her buzz-saw on my country estate any time), enjoying a quiet, slightly rustic life in the French countryside, and what becomes of them one night when a Monster comes calling.<br /><br />Is it possible to destroy that perfect film within 10 seconds?<br /><br />Mais oui!---Aja does that as well, in the final reel, with a cheap, feeble "twist" plot device that basically takes everything in the flick that has gone before and tosses it into the sh*tter, effectively taking a highly disrespectful, unceremonious dump on what was---up to that point---one of the few flicks I've ever seen that came close to the raw, brutal, uncompromising horror of the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre".<br /><br />Ah well: we do what we can with what we're given. "Haute Tension" is marvellously simple: two French chicks---Marie (the buff De France) and Alexia (Maiwenn le Besco, who for some reason sets my teeth on edge, and not in a good way) decide to spend a little quality time studying on Alexia's family farm deep in the French countryside. Relaxing, n'est-ce pas?<br /><br />Their little collegial R&R is broken up in the dead of night by The Killer (the amazing Philippe Nahon), who shows up, kicks down the front door, and manages to single-handedly undo 200 years of nasty jokes about wimpy Frenchmen by unloading all sorts of hardcore a**-whuppery on the unsuspecting family within. In his first two minutes onscreen, he manages to make Michael Myers, Jason, and Freddy Krueger look like a bunch of pansies.<br /><br />He also brings some much needed punishment-fits-the-crime judgement to the horror genre: be slow to answer your door at 2 in the morning? Have your block knocked off by a chest-of-drawers! Have the bad form to try and call the police? Try dialing 9-1-1 with a stump, mademoiselle!<br /><br />As I  mentioned, when "Haute Tension" works---and it continues to do its brutal business well even after the stupid twist---it works in spades: this is a pungent, nasty, truly scary flick. De France is astonishing to look at, but she's also an amazingly capable actress, and serves as a fitting opponent for the flick's hungry Monster in his blood-spattered, trophy-studded delivery van.<br /><br />And let's save the best for last: Philippe Nahon as The Killer is just astonishing in what could easily have been a throwaway role. Nahon played The Butcher in the lose-your-dinner-horrific "I Stand Alone", and he's effectively bottled and distilled that coiled rage and translated it into "Haute Tension".<br /><br />Nahon's Killer is a show-stopper: he's a kind of black hole of pure physical presence and smoldering, sadistic evil---check out that sick little smile that forms up on his fat pug while he's checking out his 'trophies' in the rear-view mirror. Gorgeous. Nahon's Killer is a nasty piece of work.<br /><br />The same can be said of "Haute Tension", despite its glaring flaw: Aja has created a very simple---deliciously simple---little film that touches---Hell, presses down hard---on that deep-seated, primal fear of the Murderous Outsider barging in through our door in the wee hours of the morning and killing, raping, burning and eating everything we hold dear.<br /><br />Bon appetit!<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>LOL!  So I'm not sure exactly how I got on here twice...the other review is supposed to be for the DVD release, not this one...sorry for innundating you all with my two reviews instead of one :-\<br /><br />When I originally wrote this review, it was based off of the import DVD from France that I was able to get about 5 months ago.  But, Amazon took all reviews down as it got closer to the movie release date here in the states.  So I'm redoing my review based on the American release.<br /><br />The American release is a cut version of the French film which received an NC-17 rating.  This rating means death at the US box office, so they cut it down a bit.  I'm happy to tell you that they didn't cut too much.  I think the length of the movie dropped maybe 2 minutes at the most.  Ironically, what was cut from the movie was not any scene involving sex.  Most NC-17 films that are cut to miss the rating, have their sex scenes cut.  In this case, it is the hardcore violence that is slightly muted.  In some cases this works because I thought some of the violence early on (see the weird decapitation) was over the top blood wise, verging on Kill Bill type blood.  But, it also detracts from the ending with the scene involving the wood spike and barb wire.  That scene, unfortunately, was cut down.<br /><br />This movie is sick and I don't mean sick as in cool (though it is cool, too).  Even cut down, this movie is violent and bloody.  In fact, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who is squeamish, weak stomached or scared easily.  That said, if you are tired of the current crop of American horror movies (Cursed, Hide and Seek, Alone in the Dark, Ring 2, et al ad nauseum) and want something visceral and in your face, look no further.<br /><br />I will only talk about the setup to this movie.  It's about two college girls who go to one of the girl's family farm for a weekend to study in peace and quiet.  But when a guy pulls up in the dead of night in front of their house, it becomes a cat and mouse game between one of the girls and a truly homicidal man.  And what follows is about 85 minutes of pure tension.  The movie is aptly named.  While there are few "cheap jump out scares" in the movie, there is this feeling of tension that balls up in your stomach where you constantly wonder when the protagonist will make the wrong move.<br /><br />If you have read the book Intensity by Dean Koontz, the setup is very similar to that.  It's like the director was working with that book as a starting point for the movie before moving in a different direction, namely changing the events leading up to the climax.  In fact, I'm surprised there hasn't been more mention of this fact since half of the movie is almost scene for scene from the book in some ways.  My recommendation is to not check out any other reviews for this movie.  I've read a few on some different websites and they gave away some of the plot.<br /><br />The director knows music and uses it very effectively to increase the tension of the movie.  Unlike horror music today, it doesn't peak at moments to tell you "be scared right...NOW!" Instead, he uses some ambient music that you might not be aware you're hearing but you will feel its effects.  For example, he uses a metranome that dings at a constant beat, mirroring your heart beat thudding.  It's subtle but very effective in pulling you into the movie and making you feel like even the music could give away the protagonist's hiding place.<br /><br />The acting is also really well done.  Well the physical acting.  Since this is a French film, the movie is dubbed instead of being subtitled and while the voice dubbers did an admirable job, it's still dubbed.  The dubbing in the theatrical cut is different from the version I have.  In the theatrical cut, they tried to make the characters bilingual.  I think this detracted from the movie.  I happen to not like dubbing, but I would rather them stick with one form through the movie, not moving back and forth at will for no apparent reason.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the movie, I'd recommend trying to get a copy of the import version through Ebay or something.  The DVD version is rated NC-17 for a sexual scene, brief nudity and more violence and blood than you can imagine.  Overall, it's better than the theatrical cut.<br /><br />I have to talk about the major turning point in the movie.  I have seen this movie 4 times now, twice from the DVD I own and twice in the theatre.  When I first saw the twist ending, I thought it was cool.  But after thinking about it, I didn't think it made much sense and was confused about it.  After seeing it an almost obsessive 4 times, I can say that I understand the ending and that it really does make sense.  It's a different kind of movie than what most American cinema goers are used to.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of foreign films, both horror and not, and a prevalent theme is that they are usually ambiguous and allow the viewer to draw their own conclusions.  This movie falls into this category.  If you think about it, and watch it more than once, you can see how the movie falls into place.  They don't lead you along by the hand, you have to see and find the puzzle pieces that fit.  I will tell you that after seeing it so many times, most of the puzzle pieces are there.  I can see how the ending will infuriate and frustrate some.  I can also see how people will say the ending doesn't make a lick of sense.  It's true that on your first viewing it won't make much or any sense.  But, if you see it a couple times you can see how it fits together.  The question is, is it worth it to you to see how it works or not?  For me it was.<br /><br />Ending aside, however, what we have here is a truly intense and disturbing film.  Not only in what happens in the film but the themes only hinted at in the film.  Because of its content only those who truly like horror movies should see this movie.  Truthfully, why do us horror fans go to see scary movies?  To be scared.  Not to discuss the twist ending.  For me, this movie was intense and scary.  It's very in your face and not for the weak of stomaches.  But if you can stomach it, it can leave you breathless.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GANR9I6XHTU9.html">A2GANR9I6XHTU9</a><br/><p>High tension is a new and interesting horror film recently released.

Alexandre Aja's first film to be seen in the U.S. is one of a rare breed of horror films.  Not many horror films can claim to truly create tension for the viewer like most of the classic horror films did.  As I was leaving the theater at the end of High Tension, I was angry and frustrated.  I hated the ending.  I thought the twist made no sense, and made a good film into a token Hollywood piece of crap.  After second viewing, however, I could watch the film and be more appreciative of what it does accomplish, and, while I still don't like the ending, I think that I can understand why the filmmakers did what they did.<br /><br />The plot of High Tension is simple: Marie and Alex are friends from college.  Its exam week, so the girls head up to Alex's family's place in the middle of nowhere in France to have some private, uninterrupted study time.  Everything seems to be normal until everyone falls asleep on the first night.  A maniac descends upon the family and random, gruesome acts of violence ensue, with a couple pretty original kills.  No one in the film is really developed so that we care about what is going on.  It only takes 20 minutes of film time for the deaths to start piling up.  After the initial mayhem at the house, Marie follows the murderer into his truck, and a gory road trip follows, leaving bodies in its wake.<br /><br />A film like High Tension isn't made to win any awards.  It is made to provide some scares, and some thrills.  It is a very tense movie, and Aja does a great job of milking every scene totally dry of its ability to put us on the edge of our seat.  The gore is also fairly impressive, especially the scenes involving some type of chainsaw-like tool near the end.<br /><br />There are only two real drawbacks to the film.  The first is, as already mentioned, the ending, which I didn't like, but am willing to deal with.  The second is the fact that, since the film was made in France, you have to watch it either with subtitles or dubbing.  I almost prefer subtitles, due to the fact that dubbing is just too ridiculous-looking to ignore.  I would recommend High Tension to any horror aficionado, who will appreciate a horror film for what it is supposed to do, not what some hope it will do.<br /><br />High Tension is a bold, dark, gruesome look into every person's heart of darkness.  This movie is definitely not for those who have weak stomachs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"I won't let anyone come between us."<br /><br />"I won't let anyone come between us."<br /><br />"I won't let anyone come between us."<br /><br />- Marie tells Alex they have a solid relationship, but, all Alex feels between them is "High Tension"<br /><br />From the country that makes the art of surrendering into high art (that's France, people) comes a great attempt at reinventing the slasher film. It succeeds only until the plotholes show up. Still, "High Tension" lives up to its title & is worth a look.<br /><br />Marie & Alexandra are two college friends who are going up to Alex's parents farmhouse for the weekend, to study for upcoming exams. Arriving late, Marie meets Alex's parents & her little brother & everyone settles in for the night.<br /><br />Just as Marie "settles" in, the front door buzzer rings steadily. Alex's father answers the door & is savagely slashed across the face by a homicidal maniac. The killer makes it's way into the house, just as Marie gets her senses together, narrowly avoiding an encounter with the killer. Trying to find a phone, Marie hides in the master bedroom (the bedroom closet) & gets a front-row seat to the killer's next act of mayhem - slitting Alex's mother's throat clean across & slicing off her hand - that's holding the only phone in the house (Marie finds out later that the phone lines are cut, anyway). The killer kidnaps Alex, tying her in heavy chains with a piece of tubing for a gag, bringing her to his beat up van. While the killer dispatches Alex's brother, Marie sneaks down into the van & while trying to free Alex is accidently locked in, unseen, by the killer. It's up to Marie to free Alex & slay the killer. After all, as Marie says, nothing can come between her & Alex.<br /><br />"High Tension" is one of those films that you are either going to love it or leave it. If you can get past the plotholes, you'll find that "High Tension" is better than a lot of American slasher films of late. The film is unflinchingly brutal when it comes to the killings & isn't for the squeamish.<br /><br />There are problems with the film & I won't talk about them here  because it would kill the film for future viewers. I did, however, find the film only half-dubbed in English annoying, but, with most of the dubbing at the beginning of the film where the film sets itself up, it isn't too bad.<br /><br />There isn't to much with the DVD release. The usual behind the scenes featurettes are here, but, there are no deleted or extended scenes. The film is presented in the widescreen with Dolby Digital french or English dubbed.<br /><br />"High Tension" is worth the rental, even if something comes between you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>The plot is this simple....roommates go home to study/visit. There is a happy family that is excited that their daughter is home with a friend. There is a well loved cute little kid and a seemingly happily married couple. And there is a "truck driving mad man" who comes into the house and kills everyone, takes one roommate hostage with the other following to help with the big escape.  There are several other murders and great chase scenes, and lots of twists and turns in this movie, but you should be able to guess the ending way before it happens. My only criticism is  that I really didn't like the dubbing, at times it made the movie a little low budget and hokey. But if you like scary movies, you will enjoy it, you just have to ignore the dubbing!</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>High Tension is a well-made horror movie with a strange twist. Without giving out spoilers, 2 college girls travel to a remote farm where they encounter a gruesome and relentless killer. The twist is unique, but like too many horror movies, the twist is showcased and takes away from the film's congruency a little too much.<br /><br />The pacing in this film is very good, and the fear and scare levels get quite high. I was on the edge of my seat quite often.<br /><br />While I would recommend seeing this movie, it is not without flaws. Any scenes with dialogue are very poorly acted and come off as phony filler. But, the acting when these isn't any dialogue is top notch. Ma?wenn Le Besco is wonderful at the end, and you feel her terror and fear quite well, despite the fact that her interaction with C&eacute;cile De France at the beggining of the film seems very poorly acted.<br /><br />Also, the ending isn't foreshadowed good enough for my liking, which is a disappointment. Soem scenes in the movie flat out make no sense whatsoever. There is a scene with the killer in a truck playing with a severed head. This scene, after viewing the end of the movie, seems pointless.<br /><br />Again, with these flaws, the movie is still origianl and scary enough that I highly recommend seeing it. The setting, scenery and murder sequels are brutal, intense and incredibly terrorizing. I was entertained by High Tension, and would  watch it again. I still think Wolf Creek was a little better.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 61<br /><br />33 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />3 (out of 10).

The film was going in a good direction until the amazing but horrible end. The ending is lazy and you'll see what I mean when you see it. Basically your being leaded to believe one thing and that belief is ripped right from under you when they switch everything up. They give the story away very obviously in the beginning and I think they thought nobody was going to notice it. I'll tell you what your basically getting in this film, your getting gore, not as much high tension as they say it will give you, and a half done story that definitely has been done before.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>This film was hyped everywhere as "the best horror movie of the year".<br /><br />Perhaps that is indeed an accurate statement if 2005 was a weak year for horror movies.<br /><br />As bad as Hollywood seems at times these days, it is still good to see the one business where the USA still leads the world is film-making.<br /><br />Most European films simply don't cut it, and this French film was worse yet.<br /><br />Yeah.. yeah.. there was some good gore scenes, but the "people stranded in the wood with a mad killer" plot basis is getting old and overdone.<br /><br />I suppose films must only be made by big city dwellers since they always portray the wilderness as a scary eerie place.<br /><br />Personally, I would rather spend the night in the woods with a psycho killer than walk down a back alley in New York or LA at 3:00 am in the bad section of town!<br /><br />It's hard to get worked up or too excited by horror films of this type.<br /><br />The key to a good horror movie is when you place yourself in the potential victim's shoes and realize it would be VERY hard to get yourself out of that situation.<br /><br />By contrast, horror movies get irritating fast when the story only continues due to the ineptness or stupidity of the main character.<br /><br />You know a horror film is missing the mark when your wife is picking up a book to read during the movie because she has gotten irritated at the movie after yelling at the screen 10 times... "Come on already just whack the slow fat redneck over the head and be done with it, that guy is not threatening... heck even I could kick HIS ass".<br /><br />When your wife is making those comments you can definatley tell the film-makers missed out on the scary part !!<br /><br />Now in the case of this movie, there was a "surprise" ending that may explain some of the above, but honestly as many reviewers on here commented, it seemed like an illogical "cheap shot" surprise ending thought up as a last minute rewrite...... kind of like those murder mysteries there you can't figure out who the murderer is (and for good reason), when at the end of the film they introduce some brand new character that was never part of the first 119 minutes of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>WOW!!!!

I do have to admit that it was better than most American horror flicks. But that really isn't saying too much. I have no idea about how good the dubbing is because I watched it in its original language because I'm half french. The acting seemed fie though. The music was good but what kept it together was the very solid cinematography.<br />You could basically describe this movie by saying this: Saw times 10. I watched Saw and I don't have a weak stomach but Saw is Barbie compared to this splatter fest. The director here went WAY overboard. There must have been 500 bucks spent on tomato sauce. Every seen, there was something. For example, the psychopath takes a desk and crushes a mans head with it. It was sick. He jsut ran it over. He had his little rasor and cut everyone up and made me disgusted. I mean he even blew away the little toddler. No joke! Noe that's overboard. But let me tell you, this movie had nonstop violence and gore and is even a toughy for people with strong stomachs. Just to warn you, the violence involves: a desk, rasor, axe, chainsaw, shotgun and even barbed wire (yuk!). [...]<br /><br />Yet, I still was very interested by it and even compelled at times. This would end out being a descent horror rental with way too much gore. But, the ending screwed it over. The ending, I kid you not ruined the entire movie for me. The ending's absurdity shows how this foreign director tried to use twists like every American director. But this is completely out of context and makes the movfie crap. I'd ignore this trashy movie not worth anything. It had some good scenes that were wrapped up in 8 tons of gore and were then smuthered in plot twists that really ruined this and unlike the solid movie, Saw, stayed as just another horror flick much like the Amityville Horror and the rest of them. This movie borrowed elements from litterally every other movie and did a fair job but ended out NOT BEING SCARY WHATSOEVER but instead being disgusting. So, if I were you, ignore this horror movie and instead check out horror movies like these:Identity, Secret Window, Gothika, Halloween, The Shining, Stir of Echoes, The Silence of the Lambs, Seven, etc..<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />For all of you that saw this movie, please read this.<br />The ending was horrible hands down and made no sense. Where did this truck come from then? Marie came with her friend in a car not in a van! The ending is horrid and just makes no sense. And the whole lesbian stuff, is that a joke? What?! Wow!</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>.... and i say Thank You for making HIGH TENSION or atleast having it released here. Oh yeah cant forget the Statue of Liberty, I guess thanks for that also. Anyway.<br /><br />I was forgetting that people are allowed to make R-Rated HORROR movies which is exactly what this is. This mnovie is extremely violent and extremely well done, as i rate nothing 5 stars but this movie does not have one flaw,IMO atleast. The only thing I didnt like was the fact that the movie went from being dubbed ( which bothered people also, I dont know why, I guess people need something to complain about )to subtitles. Basically half the movie is dubbed and the other half is in subtitles, but that in no way has anything to do with this flick and the way it was made, directed ,edited and acted out.<br /><br />This movie is no less than a true horror and a classic to be no question. The movie has a geat twist at the end ( which many didnt like, but this ending could have gone 2 ways, but im still satisfied with this one ), and with the ending giving me goose bumps ( The very last scene ).<br /><br />This whole movie is sick and twisted and gives you a ride of non-stop violence and pure terror-suspense through out the whole film. Plus one of the main things I had mentioned to my friend only 10-15 minutes into the movie is the music which is very creepy and sets a great mood to this movie.<br /><br />To see something like this lets me know there are still some true fans and/or film makers/writters who know what horror is, and this movie is a prime example.<br /><br />There is no humor at all in this movie, which is what I love something made to make you jump which the 4 or 5 scenes that are suppose to make you jump do in fact make you jump.<br /><br />Horrors need to be made like this i give 100% kudos and respect to this film maker for giving us fans horror like it should be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>I wanted to like this movie, but it failed me. First off the dvd has three versions: US, French and dubbed. The US is a mix of dubbing and subtitles. The French is subtitle (and the best) and the dubbed is horrendous.<br /><br />Now to the film itself. It's gritty and well done. The gore will keep you on the edge of your seat. All is well until the plot twist. This is where the film disappoints. Such a potential of a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>High Tension offers nothing new to the slasher movie genre. It's nothing more than a succession of set-pieces manipulated to provoke maximum dread from the audience. Everything you've seen before, but the relentless gore, superb photography and eerie, minimalist atmosphere make it a decent time-waster and probably one to share with all your pals.<br /><br />Marie and Alex are 2 college girls vacationing at Alex's parents house in the country. Marie is given her own room and seems comfortable sleeping on her lonesome despite feeling a little unnerved by the isolation of the farmhouse. Not long after nightfall a stranger in grubby cover-alls pulls up in his rust-bucket van/tank and sets about murdering Alex's dad, mum and brother. He kidnap's Alex and plans to rape, torture and kill her but Marie is hot on his heels. Can she rescue her in time.<br /><br />For most of the running time this film works purely on eager energy but in the last act, when the director has wrung out everything he can from the clich&eacute;-ridden script he chucks in a stupid, ridiculous plot twist that completely contradicts everything established in the opening act. Yes, there are clues and hints that limply tie it together but it still doesn't add up to sense.<br /><br />I saw Wolf Creek recently and found it rather dull. Upon reading a lot of reviews of it I was made aware of many people comparing it to High Tension, which is what made me check it out in the first place. Yes, the films are very similar but High Tension is surely the best of the 2, no matter how dumb it gets at the end.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with badly dubbed in English DD 5.1 sound. Watch it in French with the subs on.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>If this movie were a person, I would devote the rest of my life to hunting him down and making sure he spent the rest of his life in a solitary confinement cell.  I absolutely hated this movie - I hated every single thing about it.  Normally, I love all the blood and gore I can get, but when the movie giving me all that blood and gore is telling me a terrible story and then egregiously insulting my intelligence to boot, I have to yell "Shenanigans!"  And just to rub a little salt in the wound, it's French. Sacre bleu!  How in the world did this movie ever win a single award from any entity even remotely associated with the film industry?  It's the equivalent of naming Yoko Ono female vocalist of the decade.  Come to think of it, I think I would rather listen to Yoko Ono sing for ninety minutes than ever have to suffer through this putrid mess of a film ever again.<br /><br />So what goes on here?  Well, Marie (Cecile de France) goes home one weekend with her college friend Alex (Maiwenn Le Besco), supposedly to study.  Yeah, right.  Anyway, Mr. Magoo could see that Marie (who is an inherently unlikable character, by the way) sees Alex as more than a friend.  After everybody basically turns in for the night, a stranger in a horribly ugly truck invades the house and sets about systematically slashing everyone in the house - well, almost everyone.  He kidnaps Alex, at which point Marie sets out to follow him and free Alex from his clutches.  Basically, the huntee becomes the hunter becomes the huntee.  All the while, blood and gore are the viewer's constant companion.  Sounds like a movie worth watching, doesn't it?  Well, it's not.  For one thing, Marie - well, let's just say that she has obviously never seen Scream because she doesn't know the first thing about how to survive in a horror movie.  I wish I could go into more detail about that here, but it's too germane to the plot.  Oh, yes, the plot.  Just moments into the film, it's pretty obvious what is going to happen.  You don't want to believe any director could be that stupid, though - but this one is.  The last thing the horror genre needs is a director willing to work this hard just so he can insult the intelligence of everyone in his audience.  Blarrgggh!  High Tension makes me want to scream.<br /><br />Speaking of the film's title, I think it's a misnomer because I didn't feel the slightest amount of tension at any point in the story.  I will concede that some viewers will find this movie exceedingly suspenseful; heck, a few will even think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  That's fine.  In the opinion of this veteran horror fan, though, High Tension is one of the most ineffective, disappointing films I've seen in years.<br /><br />We s Craven actually referred to director Alexandre Aja as the future of horror.  Please, if you know Wes Craven personally, beseech him to seek psychiatric help immediately, as he has quite obviously lost his ever-loving mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>High Tension is a French intense psycho slasher film that will grab the audience's intestines with a twisting grip that will not let go until the final scene.  The director Alexandre Aja continues where Psycho (1960), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), House of 1000 Corpses (2003), and Wrong Turn (2003) end.  Similar to the other slasher films High Tension has a female hero that the audience gets to follow, as she witnesses a series of harrowing murders.  Aja generates an idea that seems to be a metamorphosis between Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and House of 1000 Corpses, yet it has it's own touch as the film's hero Marie (C&eacute;cile De France) follows the killer in order to try to rescue her kidnapped friend.<br /><br />The story opens with Marie and Alex (Ma?wenn Le Besco) who are on their way to visit Alex's parents who live on a remote farm somewhere in France.  During the trip the audience is introduced to the two young and attractive women through their discussions in regards to men and other things that interest them.  They arrive at Alex's home late in the evening when everyone except the father is asleep.  Alex shows Marie to her room, and they decide to go to sleep shortly thereafter.  However, Marie stays up a little longer listening to her walkman while masturbating, unaware of the the danger that is arriving to the remote house.<br /><br />The audience has already been introduced to the psycho-killer before he stops his dirty and bloodstained van outside the house.  The first introduction the audience receives of the killer will cause him to remain in the minds of the audience for a long time, as it deeply shocks any viewer when he requests his first victim to look him in the eyes.  The killer is performed by Philippe Nahon who some might recognize from Gaspar No&eacute;'s distressing I Stand Alone (1998) where he is the disturbed butcher with abnormal and perverse logic.  The truck that the killer is driving seems to be a French version of the Jeepers Creepers van, which serves as tool for his disturbing games that he plays with his victims.<br /><br />Marie notices the family dog barking, which also wakes up Alex's father.  Marie listens from her room while looking out through the upstairs window, as she sees the killer strike a metal object through an opening in the door.  This is followed by Marie attempting to come up with an idea of how to stay alive while the killer begins to visit each member of the house.  Through the walls and the floor Marie hears how the rest of the family is being attacked by the psychopath while panic intensifies within her.  Marie finds a way to hide, and she also discovers that her friend is alive.  It turns into a hide-and -seek game, as the killer is still unaware of Marie's existence while he chains Alex inside his van.  A long and bloody journey continues while Marie attempts to free her friend from a painful and tormenting death.<br /><br />Aja's horror film brings the audience into a realm of the truly disturbing and shocking, which cannot possibly entertain.  However, the film will ultimately provide a chilling venture that crawls under the skin and leaves small imaginary eggs that wait to hatch when darkness falls.  These imaginary eggs will help remind the audience of the horrors and terrors that imagination can concoct.  The cinematography is actually very good, as it uses filters and camera movements that help generate further fear and paranoia.  When the audience leaves the theater the audience will look around wherever they go because who knows what is behind the next corner.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>But the movie had me very confused in the end. Other than the other errors of the movie, it was the ending that didn't make any sense. I could not understand how Alexa could be in two places at once. Is she omnipresent? How could she be in the back of the truck helping Marie and be driving the truck? Or driving behind the truck or being in a car accident and be driving the truck as well? Either Alexa is Schizophrenic or the director is. Other than the "twist in the end" confusion, it was a very good movie that could be very scarey and gorey as well. See the movie if you would like a different scarey movie, but be aware of the ending and don't hold your hopes too high.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>What everyone is saying about "High Tension" is true.<br /><br />This is a rock'n good time of a horror movie until the last 20 minutes. Then the movie stumbles and falls flat on its face.<br /><br />However, up until that point, the acting, cinematography, and direction are all superb. "High Tension" is creepy and effective, and regardless of its ending is still a fine horror movie. Definately worth watching for any horror fan out there. Although the ending is quite bad, it doesnt ruin the first 3/4 of the film.<br /><br />Give it a viewing but be warned.....your gonna love it till the end.<br /><br />After that, nothing quite makes much sense!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>High Tension is a great horror foreign movie that really keeps you in tension the whole time!!!!!!! When two girls go over to her parents farm house in the countryside of France they are running for their lives from a mad killer that drives a old rusty truck!!!!!! This movie is like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre and little bit of Halloween rolled up into one!!!!!! Its worth renting and it will keep you in high tension from the beginning of the movie to the very last ending TRUST ME ON THAT!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>I must confess that I had high hopes for "High Tension".  The brutal killing of the family was quite savage and disturbing.  However, when examining "High Tension" on its merits as a horror movie, there simply are no redeeming qualities.  What is scary about this movie?????  Granted the violence against a mother, her child and husband might be disturbing and horrifying in a sense, but how is this movie scary to an audience?  It simply is not scary at all.<br /><br />When I finished watching this movie, I turned the TV on and caught the tale end of Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror-suspense movie called "Psycho".  I've seen "Psycho" a hundred times, but it is such a great horror movie, and it is smart, atmospheric, suspenseful and scary.  Movies like "Psycho" remind me why I love horror movies so much, but today's new age horror just fails to deliver the goods like the classics.<br /><br />"High Tension" is about a couple of girls who want to get away from all distraction so they can study for exams.  However, all is not quite what it seems to be when a killer breaks in and brutally murders several people...although, clearly, this movie should have kept the plot simple.  "High Tension" is all about shock and awe horror which employs graphic violence and disturbing imagery to shock the conscience of the audience, but there is not one thing scary about this movie if you think about it.  Where are the scares?  You might be disturbed by this movie, but you won't find anything scary about "High Tension".<br /><br />Also, the twist at the end just made things even worse in my opinion.  I agree with the above reviewer that this was not necessary or effective...ultimately, this twist makes the movie much worse than it already was to begin with because it becomes completely nonsensical rubbish by movie's end with this ill-advised twist.  Indeed, the makers of this movie should have kept it as simple as possible notwithstanding the movie's fundamental flaw of relying on extreme violence and gore to instill horror in the audience.<br /><br />Perhaps some people find this kind of movie entertaining, but these new age horror movies like the "Saw" movies, "High Tension", "Hostel", and "Cabin Fever" aren't scary at all, but are only designed to shock the audience with graphic violence and excessive gore.  "High Tension" is just another example of the direction that today's cinematic horror is going.  The problem is that these movies are a dime a dozen, and are sorely lacking in creativity and atmospheric elements which are crucial to any horror movie's success.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Haute Tension (Alexandre Aja, 2003)<br /><br />There are some movies that, when you see them, change the way you look at an entire genre of film. Haute Tension is not, by any stretch of the imagination, one of them.<br /><br />Haute Tension starts off relatively well, if mediocre; two friends, Marie (Around the World in 80 Days' Cecile de France) and Alex (The Fifth Element's Maiwenn Le Besco) are headed out to Alex's family's country place for a weekend of intensive studying. Of course, if you're headed to a secluded area in a movie, chances are there's going to be a serial killer lying around waiting to menace you. True to form, we have one (Irreversible's Philippe Nahon).<br /><br />The short review is: if you've read Dean Koontz' novel Intensity, or seen the TV miniseries based upon it, you can safely overlook this film's existence. (It's such an obvious copy that some wag added Koontz as one of the film's writers on IMDB.) Aja and scriptwriter Gregory Levasseur (who also collaborated on this year's subpar remake of The Hills Have Eyes) throw in a twist at the end to stop the movie from outright getting sued, conveniently forgetting that said twist invalidates most of the movie previous unless those watching it do some pretty creative thinking to come up with paper-thin rationalizations for earlier scenes.<br /><br />I've been largely disappointed with the recent rash of remake horror films, but Haute Tension was worse than any of them. **</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Sometimes you are watching a movie and enjoying yourself and then, in one moment, something so ludicrous happens on screen that the entire movie is ruined.  That is High Tension in a nutshell, a film that goes from four star quality to two stars in a matter of seconds.  Only the thrills of the first part of the movie keep it from a one-star review.<br /><br />The story follows a pair of college age girls, Marie and Alex who go to visit Alex's family at an isolated farm.  In the middle of the night, a twisted killer arrives and starts killing the family one-by-one, until only the two girls are left:  Alex, because the killer intends to take her prisoner and subject her to various acts of sadism; Marie because the killer is unaware of her presence.<br /><br />What follows is a suspenseful game of cat and mouse, with Marie intent on rescuing her friend while avoiding notice.  And it works well, until around fifteen minutes from the end, when a plot twist is thrown in that utterly ruins the movie.  I won't spoil things, but suffice it to say it uses one of the most tired cliches in the suspense genre.  In addition, the twist requires actively lying to the viewer and makes no sense in terms of what happened before.<br /><br />Although I didn't see his name credited anywhere, the story (up to the twist) is clearly based on Dean Koontz's novel Intensity.  If he didn't get paid, there are enough similarities for a successful plagiarism suit.  For viewing purposes, this may not be important, but Koontz fans will catch on quickly.<br /><br />The best I can recommend for the this movie is to turn off the movie right after Marie's inevitable confrontation with the killer.  To that point, it is a good movie, if you a fan of slasher flicks.  Shortly afterwards, however, things go bad very quickly.  However, since most like to stick around to the closing credits, I recommend that this one be skipped altogether.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>I would like to start off by saying that this film made by French Director Alexandre Aja was a complete and blunt copy of Dean Koontz's "INTENSITY" in fact the film was nearly 100% the same ... until the end (BEWARE... SPOILER AHEAD!) those of you that have seen the Film know that throughout the whole movie it was Cecile De Paris doing the killing all along which you could not see because you were following her mind and it was obvious that she did not know that she was doing the killing therefore you did not know that she was the killer, I know its complicated but bare with me ... anyways in Koontz's Novel "INTENSITY" everything was the same except that in the Novel there really was a killer that was slicing and diceing,the woman finaly over coms him by burning him into an oblivion (the few of you like  myself that have seen the movie as well as read the book will most likely agree that the novel has a much more effective ending... not to mention it is about 1000 times less confusing...) but anyways I cannot lie when I say that I was still scared when I watched this. The title does not fail the plot or story line and those of you who like to be scared or are looking for a good ole' fasion bloodfest are likely to be mighty pleased with this one......<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>I did not like this movie because it was merely nonsensical violence.<br /><br />When you watch a movie, as opposed to a documentary, there is supposed to be a story, suspense, character development and a rational (emphasis added) climax. This movie had neither of those elementary elements and therefore this cannot be a good movie.<br /><br />I do not care for extreme violence simply because violence for "violence sake" does not make a good movie. When you see enough violence you get de-sensatized and there is no longer any shock value.<br /><br />When you actually care about the character and there exists suspense...that is when the violence has meaning.  This movie had no emotional contents. The violence was simply mean and exploitive yet this film was hardly scary or suspenseful.<br /><br />The ending was so silly, it practically qualifies as the ridiculous "it's only a dream ending".<br /><br />This movie shows weak, vulnerable people getting killed. The killer in this movie is a frumpy, fat, 60 year old hillbilly. Lets see how he does against a more able bodied opponent...Oh, I am sorry...that is inconsistent with frail people (in this film) getting killed.<br /><br />In contrast, if you compare this to a good zombie film, with all the graphic cannibalism, because that violence examines the horroric concept of getting eaten alive...it leastit stresses how dire the premise is. There, the extreme violence serves a purpose.In this fil, the violence serves no purpose since there is no suspense, scares or anything.<br /><br />People patronize this film and you wonder why society has unexplainable violence!</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>After seeing High Tension you start to think why people were making such a big deal about Hostel because this movie goes crazy with the gore. The film was going in a good direction until the amazing but horrible end. The ending is lazy and you'll see what I mean when you see it. Basically your being leaded to believe one thing and that belief is ripped right from under you when they switch everything up. They give the story away very obviously in the beginning and I think they thought nobody was going to notice it. I'll tell you what your basically getting in this film, your getting gore, not as much high tension as they say it will give you, and a half done story that definitely has been done before.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>First off before I say anything about this movie...have you ever read the book 'Intensity' by Dean Koontz? Well...this movie, whether intending to or not, is the movie for that book. Until the ending. The ending..imo..was horrible for this movie. I didnt like it at all, and wish they hadn't done it that way.<br /><br />BUT..for the most part, the movie was fkn awesome for a Horror movie. Because it's been a few months since I seen it, I dont remember the names of the characters. I'm also sitting here...thinking of a way to review this movie, without ruining anything. Because when I read the book Intenisty..it was just that..INTENSE. The movie starts off a TAD slow with two girls that are friends (one of them being our main girl) going home to the non-main girls family for vacation I believe. It seems to be a nice little home and nice parents. Then at night while everyone is in bed (and our main girl being naughty with herself), there is a knock on the door. Dad goes downstairs to see who it is. And then all...psychotic..hell..breaks loose. And it doesnt just stay in the house. It goes on the road also.<br /><br />Basically..i really dont want to even give away anything that happens. This is definitely a Thrasher Psychotic Horror. And I was REALLY enjoying the story also that went along with it. That is..up until the ending which really made me cringe and roll my eyes. I wanted to punch the director in the throat for making such a good movie and then just fkn it all up at the end. Also if you like gore..this movie has some good scenes that made me laugh and say 'HOLY *bleep*, THAT'S *bleeped* UP!'.<br /><br />Even though I hate the ending, that didnt ruin the WHOLE movie. If you are a slasher movie fan, I think you'll love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>Terrific horror flick. Well done all around--but I must say this: I hated the damn twist ending so much that I am tempted to reveal it! But I won't.<br /><br />Aja and his partner Levasseur are going places in this genre, no doubt about it. Only let us hope and pray that they stay clear of annoying twist endings in the future.<br /><br />Get the widescreen UNRATED VERSION  if you can. Gore effects, by the way, are top notch. This is one suspenseful horror flick that will have you on the edge of your seat--that is, up until around the twist--and then you'll go: What? No way!<br /><br />(And you'll say a few other things that I can't print here.)<br /><br />I suppose mainstream audiances may not be bothered by it as much, although the true horror fan will be ticked off plenty. Still worth getting.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>After watching High Tension, I'm now convinced that America has lost its way in the genre of horror. We just don't make them like those outside our country do. The ones that are getting the most news (The Ring) are remakes of Japanese films. High Tension is a French horror film; it's kind of a mixture of Saw and Jeepers Creepers, only about five times better than both.<br /><br />High Tension (a name that rings so true) is about two girls who suffer through one terrifying night at the behest of a perverted killer. I know, it sounds like one of those "same-old, same-old" kind of horror films, but it isn't. When I watched it I started to believe that the scares came from the steady stream of gore in the film; that went away soon after the cat-and-mouse game began between the killer and the protagonist. Slowly, this movie builds suspense, first by presenting a secluded, no-one-can-hear-you-scream setting, then by presenting an image of horror from the killer himself, then by making it night, and so on. By the end of the movie, if you're not a nail-biter, you'll be one. Plus, the twist in this movie is excellent and, more importantly, convincing, as it slowly builds up to it.<br /><br />Another great thing about this movie is the protagonist herself. She's a strong woman, one who takes only so much before finally fighting back. And fight back she does, or at least she tries to, in a number of ways. She definitely isn't the girl you've seen running in the woods only to trip and fall and be skewered by one of the killer's weapons.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Saw, likes foreign films, or wants to find an escape from horror films produced State-side. This is one the best in years, no matter where High Tension was made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Once you press Play, even though every cell in your body screams "Turn away," you won't be able to stop watching the derivative but jolting nightmare.  This very scary, eye-popping, relentlessly bloody exercise in the horrific.  This story about being chased by a maniacal, blade-wielding, body-slicing killer is not for all tastes.  A much talked about hit in its native France, this slick, sick film caught viewers off guard and the buzz generated long lines at the box office.<br /><br />The plot is simple: Close college friends Marie and Alexia are spending a weekend at Alexia's parents' secluded country farmhouse. They plan to study for exams.  But in the darkest hours, their idyllic get-a-way is interrupted by a stranger wielding a knife and they fight for their lives against an seemingly unstoppable human predator.<br /><br />This one makes TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (original and remake) look like a nursery rhyme, but the last shot left me scratching my head.  Perhaps this is really a lesbian love story disguised as slasher/horror film?</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>The best thing that happened in the movie was the unconventional ending.

Is this 2005 or 1965?<br /><br />Trimmed by the MPAA from the original NP-17 yet containing scenes way-over-the-top grisly and gore-wise that I had to wonder what is the MPAA holding back the NC-17 for? Oh yes, for the dreaded S-E-X scenes. Oh yeah: it's ok to show a guy's head being sliced off than to show two consenting adults having sex.<br /><br />Phillipe Nohan (Gaspar Noe's "I Stand Alone") plays a loony who murders, nay... slaughters a wife, husband and a small child in the rural south of france and kidnaps their teenage daughter, Alex.<br /><br />Alex's friend, Marie (Cecile de France of "The Spanish Apartment")gamely tries to rescue her friend Alex against all reason and logic.<br /><br />"High Tension," probably even with the deleted scenes,would not be a good film. But the arrogance and short-sightedness of the producers and the ignorance and illogical cutting of the film by the MPAA turn this minor film into a cause celebre among those of us who support free artistic expression in a world in which so many of our freedoms have been randomly and summarily snatched from us.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Marie (de France) and Alex (Ma?wenn) are heading home to Alex's family's farm house, isolated in the French countryside.  The first night there, a killer enters the house, kills Alex's family, and takes her hostage.  Marie goes unnoticed, since the killer doesn't know about her and she is hiding.  When Marie tries to untie Alex in the killer's truck, she is accidentally trapped, and taken along for the ride.  Marie is now in a battle of wits with the killer, as she attempts to save Alex and escape the killer.<br /><br />While not completely original story-wise (I was reminded of Dean Koontz's "Intensity" specifically), "High Tension delivers just that...high tension.  From the beginning the very end, the feeling of unease permeates the film.  It is excellently directed, with no cheap scares.  The killer is ruthless, from the first kill to the last.  And there is blood galore.  This movie is a hard R for violence and gore, having been trimmed from the original NC-17, and is not for the faint of heart.  What makes this movie so great is the execution (pardon the pun).  Horror fans will delight in this movie and I recommend this specifically for them.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have with the film is the subtitles & dubbing.  This is a French movie, so you know that you are getting one or the other, but for some reason, the filmmakers chose to use BOTH.  It seems kind of odd, but fortunately, there is not much dialogue for this to become too large of an issue.  Some will also argue that the ending does not support what has gone before, but I disagree.  I don't want to give too much away, so I will not go into specifics.

Without giving out spoilers, 2 college girls travel to a remote farm where they encounter a gruesome and relentless killer. The twist is unique, but like too many horror movies, the twist is showcased and takes away from the film's congruency a little too much.<br /><br />The pacing in this film is very good, and the fear and scare levels get quite high. I was on the edge of my seat quite often.<br /><br />While I would recommend seeing this movie, it is not without flaws. Any scenes with dialogue are very poorly acted and come off as phony filler. But, the acting when these isn't any dialogue is top notch. Ma?wenn Le Besco is wonderful at the end, and you feel her terror and fear quite well, despite the fact that her interaction with C&eacute;cile De France at the beggining of the film seems very poorly acted.<br /><br />Also, the ending isn't foreshadowed good enough for my liking, which is a disappointment. Soem scenes in the movie flat out make no sense whatsoever. There is a scene with the killer in a truck playing with a severed head. This scene, after viewing the end of the movie, seems pointless.<br /><br />Again, with these flaws, the movie is still origianl and scary enough that I highly recommend seeing it. The setting, scenery and murder sequels are brutal, intense and incredibly terrorizing. I was entertained by High Tension, and would  watch it again. I still think Wolf Creek was a little better.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 61<br /><br />33 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

I watched the whole thing, and although a little confusing, the twist does make sense with the rest of the movie, so stop your B****ing.!<br /><br />  Okay, now, for the film itself, although, it is french, and I knew there was sex, I wish that it was not quite as explicit, but its french, so I knew it was coming... Don't say I didn't warn you, the first 20mins, has some HIGHLY sexual stuff in it... If you're not a typical horror freak(which I'm not, I don't enjoy nudity and sex onscreen, just GORE&SCARES), than you've been forwarned...<br /><br />  Now the story is simple enough, a girl and her friend are at their house, and a PSYCO comes in and slaughters everyone except the girl and her friend... What follows from there is not as predictable as you'de think... It is a very sick little horror film, and despite what reviewers say, FAR above par as far as writing, acting, and directing goes in this genre... It is WELL above average...<br /><br />  So, if you can get past the small portion that's dubbed in, you'll enjoy the film, as long as you either A. don't mind sexual content in movies. Or B. Can ignore a moderate amount of it... And of course, as long as you looooooove oodles of gore!!! Although I do wish there was a bit more of it, it delivered the goods VERY well!!!<br /><br />  So, I hope you enjoy it.!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>Do you remember when, we did the twist last summer?

At a horror event, I received some very cool promo material for this movie and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  After a sweet titillation near the beginning (head jokes will roll), the movie slows down.  Keep watching...it gets better.<br /><br />Marie (Cecile de France) is invited to visit the French countryside by classmate and pal Alexia (Maiwenn le Besco) and stay with her family at their old French manor house.  Needless to say, Marie is bored before they even arrive.<br /><br />Enter the ugly French redneck, who brutally and without reason butchers Alex's family before taking Alex away in his filthy, rattling delivery truck.  Marie escapes his notice and follows.  Marie must get Alex away from said ugly French redneck before something horrible happens to her, too.<br /><br />I say no more.  A typical horror plot turns into a twisting tale of obsessive love and inner conflict.  When this happened, the movie quickly jumped from three stars to four.<br /><br />The FX gets better as the movie progresses, so the best gore is near the end, when we are introduced to a decrepit circular saw (a wonderfully vile toy in the hands of the insane).<br /><br />I had no idea at first this was a French movie, and the English dubbed version is pretty bad.  I recommend watching it in the original French and using English subtitles, you will pick up more of the emotion and won't miss out by using subtitles.  Even in the English dubbed, some of the movie is still in French.<br /><br />All in all, a nice, bloody tidbit to add to your cheesy horror collection, suitably gory with a "gutsy", twisted ending.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>European Horror movies have always been a little more vicious, and a little more surreal than their American counterparts.  High Tension is a textbook example of this unerring phenomenon.  This French film was released in, strange as it may seem, France back in 2003.  That particular version of the film was slated for a not so box-office friendly NC-17 here in the states.  "No way", said the money puppeteers, ahem, studio executives.<br /><br />So how much did they cut from the film to get that oh so desirable R rating?  Surely we're missing buckets of gore, oodles of flesh, mountains of viscera, well, you get where I'm going with this.  But what's that?  Surely it can't be.  The amount of time cut from the original French version.  It's shocking!  It's colossal!<br /><br />It's apparently just over one extra minute of onscreen gore.  Over 60 seconds and under 120 seconds.<br /><br />I'm sitting here, scratching my head in the land of the "Free".  How is it that those of us in America lucky enough to make it to adulthood allow for censorship to take place?  We can drink, smoke cigarettes, buy pornography, and load up on firearms, but for some unknown reason we have institutions like the MPAA coddling us, holding our hands, and covering our eyes from what, make believe gore and simulated violence?<br /><br />Tell you what though, that minute plus of French carnage must have been extremely nasty to get excised from this film.  Because what I saw today at my local megaplex/movie shrine was a gleefully sadistic, clever, and over the top splatter fest.<br /><br />In other words, I liked it.  Alot.<br /><br />Sure it takes many elements from other slasher films, but when I left the theater I felt as if I'd seen something original and actually worthy of bearing the banner of Horror.<br /><br />The dubbing was also a trip.  Although for some reason some parts were dubbed and others weren't.  Which actually added to the fun.<br /><br />When I know that the dismemberment, cruelty, and bloodshed are done according to a script and that no one actually gets hurt I enjoy the terror and the dread, because I know it's not happening to me.  It's make believe, pretend, not real. Hopefully some day we'll be able to say the same thing about censorship(or at least the MPAA) here in America.<br /><br />So Europe, keep making movies like this.  Eventually us Yanks will see them, even if we have to wait for the DVD release.<br /><br />P.S.  Did I mention that I despise the MPAA?</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>This movie can't be as bad as I think it is.  Or is it?  Avoid the misery of finding out for yourself.  High Tension is a one-gadget movie with plot holes large enough to drive a Home Depot truck loaded with chain saws through.  The war in Vietnam did not have this much senseless violence.  De France is quite attractive in her blood-spattered T-shirt but she'd be a lot more attractive if she spent a little less time sawing people's heads off, nailing their feet to the floor, and torturing them in various other ways.  Not seeing this movie isn't good enough.  You will never again be a whole person until you've forgotten that it exists.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Man, the way some people talk about this film you'd think it was something more than just another slasher movie.  And the way some people wonder about the ending, man I think they're trying too hard.  It's just stupid and gratuitous and nonsensical, so don't worry about it too much.  Stupid though it it, I really don't think the twist ending ruins the movie.  Again, it's just a slasher movie.  I don't care about these characters, so if the director eventually decides that, NOTHING IS HOW IT SEEMS, MUWHAHAHAHA!!!!, ehh, no big deal.<br /><br />Anyway, about all that needs be said about 'High Tension' is that it's a polished, efficient and rather brutal slasher movie.  We get to the killin in about 20 minutes, and it doesn't stop until the end.  Characters? I didn't notice any. Ms. Protagonist had an irritating lesbian haircut, and the killer was rather chunky and menacing.  Didn't notice too much else. Again, no big deal.<br /><br />Like I said, it's pretty much just one endless horror scene after the first 20 minutes.  Frankly, it isn't all that tense, as most of the characters get wasted pretty quickly, but it is quite an INtense film, which is just about as good.  It's not a gorefest, really, but it is one of the more brutally violent films I've ever seen.  Death is rarely clean and fast in 'High Tension', and they throw in a number of nasty little touches. (Such as how the killer kinda wrenches one victims head back after slitting her throat, and later when he drives an ax into another victims chest, and then stomps on their back while he's lying on the ground, to drive it further in.  ouch.)  That, and they finally let us see the gruesome potential of power tools in a horror film, which are often threatened, but rarely used to their full potential.  There's a very soggy sawing here which probably surpasses even the great jackhammer-impalation from 'The Church'. (Great movie, btw.  Check it out.)  They also up the intensity by *not* showing us some things, but simply letting us here the effects from someone else's perspective.  The gore effects, done by the legendary Gino de Rossi are of very high quality, even if they aren't quite as realistic as you'd see in a major release. (The unlikely decapitation ain't so convincing, but it's still pretty damn amusing, so it's no huge loss.)  Gino's technique has improved a lot over the years, though it's still recognizably him. (Like how much of the blood in this film is practically black, particularly when it is spewing/gushing.  The slit throat is totally vintage Gino, though, again, more convincing.)<br /><br />The acting is generally capable, if not remarkable.  The major exception is Phillippe Nahon, as the killer.  He's great, and is one of the most intimidating slashers I've ever seen.  He's basically a normal guy, but pretty big and bulky, and he squeezes an appropriate amount of barely controlled sadism into his actions.  He's not quite as effective at the end, where he becomes so messed up that he looks kinda like a bloody, demonic clown, but it ain't too big of a problem.<br /><br />Alexandre Aja probably didn't have much of a budget, but this is a great looking film.  Solidly atmospheric with lotsa smooth, controlled camera movements and some fairly artistic composition.  The DVD looks very nice as well, though as I've said before, I haven't a great eye for that sorta thing.  I've only seen the unrated cut, so I can't compare them, but it's hard to imagine why anyone watching a slasher movie would wanna see the less gruesome edition.  Keep in mind, this is a real unrated cut, meaning that this film actually did have to be cut in order to get the R rating.  So mainstream fans may find this excessively intense, and it's certainly way more brutal than any of the mainstream, American slasher movies that I've seen of late. (Actually, in terms of sheer volume this probably isn't much worse than 'Final Destination 2', but the violence here is a whole lot more serious, with little of the wackiness that pervades that film.)  Serious horror devotees certainly won't be shocked by this film, but it's still some pretty strong stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, it seems I've said little of significance, but I'm tired of rambling on.  Suffice to say, if you like slasher movies, you shouldn't hesitate to see this.  And don't worry about the stupid ending.  Just ignore it.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>Man oh hairy man, this film was quite the dandy. I felt like I was watching a snuff film with a weird soundtrack. Here are the highs and lows of this film.<br /><br />First twenty minutes: I laughed till I peed - literally, I think some natural lemondade made its way down my leg. The soundtrack was beyond the point of nonsensical and the dialogue made me want to beat myself in hilarity. Seriously. You could smell the cheese of its cheesiness in each scene. Then came the second twenty-minutes. I think Gollum makes an appearance in the opening van scene. It sure sounds like him. When you see what Gollum is doing, you might have a whole new outlook on the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />BOO! We get our lesbo scene - I hate lesbo scenes: well, it actually only involves one person. If this was meant to be sensual, they thought wrong. I almost puked up my frosted flakes. The weird part is, they drag it on FOREVER. I found myself contemplating walking out and began looking at the floor as opposed to our young lady - it was that disgusting - and I like women - but me no likey that type of thing - no, siree.<br /><br />Now onto the home invasion: Let's just say I'm going to have to watch It's a Wondeful Life five or six times in a row just to get those scenes out of my mind. The killer cuts and shoots, stabs and slashes his merry little heart out. I tried to make it less than it was, but guys, this was cruel. Even the little boy who once says, "I want to be a cowboy" (which was funny), finds out that the cowboy life ain't for him when the deranged psychopath chases him down with a shotgun through a cornfield(actually, that part was funny too!!). The death scenes are quite chilling and I wouldn't recommend this film to Hitler if he asked me what films would fit his preferred taste.<br /><br />I need to take a shower just thinking about this film. I repented of my terrible crime. Despite what the critics are saying, this is not a chick romance, guys! Someone said it was a lot like the Wedding Planner but they were WRONG, unless they meant, The Wedding in Hell Planner.<br /><br />Don't watch this. I know you're going to anyway, just to be like the bratty little kid who does things just because he's not supposed to, but these scenes are not wholesome. They demoralize your soul. Scratch that, they take a 12-gauge and blast a whole through your soul's forehead, plastering the walls with soul juice. You see, this film's already having an affect on me!!!!<br /><br />GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD, DAAAAAAAADDY!!!!<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the ending is pathetic. Those French thought they got us but Chubby Checkers makes a better "twist", guys. Two thumbs, and an extra, mutated thumb down.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! This is a total waste of time. Not only is the movie vile and unentertaining but it also lacks a story and is a rip in the side of many moviegoers. It is disgusting, stupid, filled with never ending brutal deaths that are pretty much obvious and lame. And the Twist at the end makes no sense whatsoever. Heed the warning. This movie is the worst movie ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>This is what psycho killer thrillers should be like!  Actually INTENSITY, actual fear...actually making the viewer uncomfortable.<br /><br />Marie and Alexa, two college roommates, are off to visit Alexa's parents in their new country home.  Alexa is a bit boy-crazy, and Marie is obviously smitten with her friend.  They arrive at the quaint home late at night, briefly meet the parents and little brother, and then go to bed.  Suddenly, the peaceful, remote house is descended upon by a true madman, apparently bent on nothing more than kidnapping Alexa for what will clearly be prolonged abuse and brutal death.  The madman also dispatches the family...but misses Marie, who manages, in several breathtaking scenes, to avoid detection.  Her friend is whisked away, and Marie pursues.<br /><br />Yep, it sure does sound like Dean Koontz's INTENSITY...at least up until this point in the story, which is about halfway.  But it doesn't bother me, because the only American version of INTENSITY was a truly pitiful TV movie that had none of the grit and outright horror of the book.  So a couple of French guys stole his idea...let the courts work that one out.  Meanwhile, I got to enjoy that queasy feeling that only comes when a filmmaker steps over the line of commercial safe horror/thrills and into a pit of depravity.  The killings are horrific and graphic, but not in the way that makes audiences giggle outloud (a la NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET sequels or FRIDAY THE 13th, for example)...they are nasty, painful and almost enough to make you turn away or turn it off.  This is NOT a feel-good movie...it is bleak, bleak, bleak.  The low budget helps this aesthetic, and for American viewers, it probably helps that none of the performers are recognizable.  They look more like real people than we are accustomed to seeing in glossy US films.<br /><br />Many people have complained about the "surprise" ending.  My only real problem with it is that the filmmakers foreshadow it just a bit too much for my tastes.  I kinda saw it coming...granted, I forgot about that once the madman began his bloody work.  The twist isn't terribly original, not does it stand up to scrutiny, BUT the twist doesn't keep the gory thrills from coming, and presumably that's the only reason we started watching in the first place.<br /><br />The young actress who plays Marie is very good, in my opinion.  She cuts quite a figure with her short hair and sinewy limbs.  And the guy who plays the madman...well, I kept wondering if this guy would be able to keep his friends after they saw him in the movie...he's quite unpleasant, and believable.<br /><br />The film does have flaws.  The first death suffers with some poor special effects...but after that, they improve a great deal.  Also, the events unfold the way they do only because no one in the house is awakened by family members screaming bloody murder...literally.<br /><br />But it does create some HIGH TENSION, and has a heroine who doesn't make one stupid mistake after another...we can actually follow her logic from one move to the next.  Sometimes we know more than she does, but at no time do we shake our heads in wonder at her stupidity.  It's amazing how much of a difference that makes in enjoying a thriller.  I recommend the movie, if the kind of gore and thrills I've talked about interest you.  By the way, the DVD appears to default to playing the dubbed version.  Avoid this...I watched about 1 minute of it, and greatly disliked it.  The "American" voices were VERY poorly matched.  I would select the "original uncut French version" and then be sure to select "subtitles" as well...this takes two separate selections.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>This is truly one of the best horror films ever made! It's a bloody french kiss to the backwoods genre with an excellent twist to give it some originality. This is a very scary,gory & vicious film,filled with some very High Tension not for weak stomachs & as a huge horror fan i couldn't ask for anything more. Alexandre Aja's "HIGH TENSION" is most certainly distine for horror classic status!</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>It all starts with loving, and with visiting people you love to show off just how much you care. Then it progresses to the bizarre, with a man that almost acts as a force of nature plowing into your home. Invading your sanctum, taking apart everything you are, replacing it with the little pictures he keeps in his delapidated truck. Him, with his overexaggerated features and his thick arms and legs, torturing you and the person you love. and yet - there is always more buried underneath the surface.<br /><br />When I first saw high Tension, I was not certain that I agreed with the conclusion of the film. Do not worry - I will not spoil it - i hate it when that happens. I am simply commenting on the way the movie went and the way it turned and tossed, like a ragged infant in a bed filled with anger. It was a mad movie, too, filled with great acting and terror and torment most foul. It was simply the thing at the end, the part you did not see coming, that took this watcher aback.<br /><br />I am not going to say it hurt the movie that much, either. Some will say it did, partly because they could not perdict it and partly because it is one of those oddling things, but it also has a nice impact in a lot of ways. There is sheer terror in it, madness too, and that is brillant in a lot of ways. I did not see it coming and would not have guessed it. I am not certain it is made for you to figure out.<br /><br />If you like foreign and you like Hitchcokian madness, this is a great way to play. It will make you guess and keep you wondering, then reward you with a little taste of weird. I liked it and more the second time around, until I felt like I had been rewarded by multiple viewings. A 5/5 on that side of it alone, not to mention the rest.<br /><br />Thank you and I hope you like it. It had some really odd toys that came out with it, like a toy baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire and little buttons and other things if you also want them. They are still there to find if you are so inclined.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is a good modern horror film that acknowledges its roots, but manages to be original enough to warrant merit in its own right. Psycho is the oldest influence, although this only becomes apparent in the latter part of the film. Clearly Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have been an influence as well.<br /><br />Two young women go to visit one of their sets of parents at a remote farmhouse. Once night falls all hell breaks loose. There are one or two clues to the big twist that will occur later in the film, but I didn't spot them at the time and it was only after the film finished that I realised what they meant.<br /><br />The director of this film clearly understands how to build tension. I suspect that he has watched all of Hitchcocks finest movies. Given the freedom to use such explicit violence this is the sort of film that Hitchcock might have been making today if he had been born 40 years later. Except of course it would have been better.<br /><br />I watched this for the first time shortly after seeing Wolf Creek for the first time. For me Wolf Creek just gets the nod because its slightly less derivative. Nevertheless Switchblade Romance is well worth seeing, if you're not easily scared and films don't give you nightmares!</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>OK, I'm pretty easy going when it comes to this type of film. I never expect too much--I don't expect redeeming value, I don't expect character development, I don't expect great acting. Heck, most of the time--I don't even expect much of a story. Having caught Alexandre Aja's effective remake of "The Hills Have Eyes," I was more than willing to give this French (but poorly dubbed) entry in the slasher genre a chance. Well, now, I'm not really sure if it was worth it.<br /><br />The film has a pretty standard setup. Some have already noticed its similarity to Dean Koontz's "Intensity," which is apt--but that, too, already followed pretty conventional guidelines. As two girls are staying in a desolate family home of one of them, a rural madman comes a knocking. Jumping right into a brutality and unpleasantness, various members of the family are dispatched and/or attacked. One girl manages to elude the madman while the other is taken captive. The film has plenty of effectively tense moments during the "house" sequence. It sets itself up as a nasty bit of brutality, but nothing particularly original.<br /><br />Intent on helping her friend, the free girl rides with and/or chases the kidnapper's van for the remainder of the picture. Things get a bit sillier, but it is what it is. You know you're just biding time until the final confrontation. Again, I know there is an audience for this--but as our heroine never displayed much ingenuity, she wasn't really someone I cared about. Mainly the film is "Hide and Seek" followed by "Hide and Seek" with more "Hide and Seek" after that--Not a lot of diversity, I guess I'm saying.<br /><br />Now, then, in the last 15 minutes--the surprise twist is unveiled. I have seen this device used in countless other movies, and it can be a tremendous revelation. But not here. Had it been done with any sort of logic, it might have enhanced the film. I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say that a perfectly detailed film is needed to pull it off. A film where this device is used must be a thing of precision. "High Tension" just isn't that movie. The twist here makes sense in the context of the picture, however it is not logically supported by what has transpired. For anyone who thinks it is ingenious, I'd like to sit down, have a cup of coffee, and list the dozens and dozens of inconsistencies that just don't work. That said, it irritated me more than anything. What was going to be a 3 star review for derivative unpleasantness with some chills turned into about 1 1/2 stars for being nonsensical. KGHarris, 01/07.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>`High Tension' has already garnered well-deserved attention from the horror fans, and sure, the content of the film lives up to its title. It is high tension all through; it takes itself very seriously; and it is gory, violent, and most importantly, very scary. But what is remarkable about this French horror (from Europa Corp., Lec Besson's company) is that it has its own style, which proves the talent of the director Alexandre Aja.<br /><br />The film takes up the basic storyline of the 70s horror film when Tobe Hooper or Wes Craven was young. Two college students Marie (Cecile De France) and Alexia (Ma?wenn Le Besco) stay at the house of the latter's family, which is surrounded by the cornfield. With the arrival of the merciless killer, the survival fight begins for Marie and Alexia, but the basic premise is that of a cat-and-mouse game as you will realize in the second chapter.<br /><br />`High Tension' is a literally blood-soaked experience. Extreme violence or bloodbath sometimes becomes unexpectedly funny, but that does not happen in `High Tension.' The film also has references to other films of the genre (the van the killer drives looks like the one in `Jeepers Creepers'), but they never detract the tension that prevails on the screen. Clever use of the sound effect and spooky images is a proof that Aja is a real thing. His orthodox approach has the authentic power of horror films before they become too self-referential.<br /><br />That makes me greatly regret his decision to wrap up the whole film in the way he did. He should not have shot the last 15 minutes of the film. The ending twist has so many incredibly big plot holes. This is not good, but it gets worse when it virtually negates the integrity of the first 80 minutes, which is simply marvelous. If you do something straightforward, and you do it better than any one else, you should keep that way to the end.<br /><br />These complaints aside (and the terrible English dubbing), `High Tension' proves that old-fashioned horror films are not dead. It has much gore and violence, but you cannot help noticing the brilliance of the director who makes good use of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>I love horror movies but most of them suck so I rented High Tension without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised. My taste must run along a different line considering all the negative reviews here.<br /><br />Marie and Alex are college students going to Alex's family farm for some peace and quiet to study. The first evening there, a man shows up, murders the mother, father and child and chains Alex up to take along with him. Marie manages to avoid him and stows away in the back of the man's truck trying to find a way to free Alex. As the movie nears the end there is a big twist, which I'll admit having mixed feelings about. On the one hand it was kind of cool, but if you think about it too much, it doesn't make a lot of sense with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is bloody as hell with some very graphic scenes. If you like your horror more psychological this one isn't for you, but if you like your violence painted with buckets of blood, High Tension is a good one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>I wasn't able to watch High Tension in the theaters when the movie came out but I looked forward to it being released on DVD. I bought the DVD the day it came out without having seen it before for I felt that this would be a good movie! my kind of movie! and it truly was. I love this movie!! Two friends, Marie and Alexa go home to Alexa's home for a little getaway. That night, a sadistic killer knocks on the door. Alexa's father opens the door and the horror begins. The madman kills Alexa's father and mother ( Cool death scenes!! ) and then takes Alexa hostage. Meanwhile, Marie is witness to all this madness and the killer does not realize that he left one victim behind as Marie was hiding from him and wasn't found. She then follows his van to try to save her friend and the thrills and suspense begin. If you are a gore fan, you will love this movie. Plenty of blood and gore!! Well acted, well written and well directed. For gore fans, you are in for a treat with the circular saw scene! ( which is my favorite scene in the movie ). Cool Cool scene. Although the ending to this film is confusing, it does not take away from the great horror film that this is. I sure hope there is a High Tension 2 in the works!!!! A must see for horror movie fans!!!!!!! Loved it!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"High Tension" is a French-horror film which Lions Gate decided to release after the success of such horror films as Saw. Problem is, like I said, "High Tension" is a French-horror film therefore some English dubbing is needed. I read some of the Amazon reviews before renting the movie and all of them said the English dubbing was bad. Well, when you're having actors speak a language over another one when the actors are moving their lips to the other language it's kind of hard to get it to look good. However, "High Tension" I thought didn't do to bad with the dubbing because first off; In the film the girls are made out to be bilinguial. Second; there isn't that much dialouge in the film, so it really doesn't matter. The film (I watched it twice. Once in English with subtitles for the french speaking parts. And once in French with english subtitles) is actually well done. It's a great horror film; Very bloody, gory, morbid, sick, and nasty. Pretty much everything one would want from a horror film. So, if you ignore the English dubbing; It's pretty f**king good.<br /><br />First of all, if you have a weak stomach (I don't and even I cringed at a few parts) don't watch this movie; If you don't like horrific horror films, don't watch this movie. In truth, my only complaint about the film was the ending.<br /><br />I think it was well played out actually even when the "twist" is revealed. Unlike most horror films where this same twist occurs; They don't bother playing it out anymore, this film still does...Hopefully if you've seen the film you know what I'm saying. Anyway, the film follows Marie (Cecile De France) and Alex (Maiwenn) who head out to Alex's parents secluded farm house to study for the weekend. As they head there, we see a guy in a rusty old truck getting a b***job from a woman; then he pulls the head up and throws it out the window. Morbid... Anyway, after Alex and Marie arrive they get settled in and in the dead of night; the Rusty truck pulls up and the man inside kills everyone in the house (except Marie who is actually pretty smart at hiding) and takes Alex hostage. Marie hops in the back of the truck with Alex and...Well, you're going to have to see it. (In English: B+; In French: A-)</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>When a film like the 2008 remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AV3BWM">Prom Night (Unrated)</a>, you have to wonder what exactly has happened with not just the horror genre, but with Hollywood films altogether. Prom Night was utterly terrible and is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. It wasn't scary, it wasn't gory like a slasher should be, and it was nothing more than a worthless, cliched mess. I generally didn't like many of the films that came out during the torture porn craze, and I believe that most torture porn films are an insult to the horror genre. I hated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a> and I really didn't care for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>. When horror films like High Tension and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOTVU2">Wolf Creek (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a> come around from foreign filmmakers, they show us that we have forgotten what a horror film should be like. Raw, unnerving, scary, bone-chilling, and they rattle you to the core. That is how a horror film should be.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When two college friends; Marie and Alex decide to spend a weekend with Alex's parents to study and relax, the most unthinkable happens. A mysterious stranger pays a visit to the farmhouse, kills Alex's family, and takes the girls as his prisoners. This may seem like simple storyline, but as it unravels, it will throw curveballs that not even the most hardened horror fanatic can predict, and I was very surprised and left going, "What the f***?"<br />MUSIC: This film's music does take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it does set the mood and atmosphere quite well.<br />ACTION: This film is extremely violent and gory. In fact, when it came over here to the U.S. from France in 2005, it received an NC-17 rating (The highest MPAA rating possible) and Lionsgate had to tone it down to an R-rating. Thankfully, this Unrated version leaves every bit of horror goodness intact and uncensored. The film is very gory, to the point of shocking and disturbing on every level. This film is also pretty damn scary and will leave you on edge, and like any horror film is supposed to be, it is very unpredictable. Definitely not for the faint of heart.<br />ACTING: Now remember, if you are considering to purchase this film, please only watch Original French Director's Cut. I've heard far too many ramblings that the English voice-overs are terrible, and anyone who knows me, knows that I refuse to watch a film with English dubbing if it's foreign, and that I prefer to leave it in its original language. If you watch the original French version, the actors are fantastic and perform their roles extremely well, and they do make you believe that they are terrified. If you watch it with English dubbing, most people will tell you that it sucks. Any film with bad English dubbing is bound to be ruined, unless you watch the original version. Overall, I have no gripes with this area.<br />OVERALL: Tired of the usual crappy Hollywood horror flicks? Then buy High Tension, dammit! This film has gone down as an instant horror classic that is not afraid to be brutal and unnerving in every way possible. It will rattle you to the core and you will not know what's coming next.<br />THE GOOD: Great acting, good music, truly terrifying, unpredictable, and devastatingly brutal in every way.<br />THE BAD: Terrible English dubbing (Only watch the French Director's Cut!) and some moments of odd dialogue.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The French breed `Haute Tension' is one of the best horror films I've seen in years.  It's not perfect but it brings with it so much fear and paranoia I can't help but get swallowed up in its atmosphere.<br /><br />Before I get to deep into this review I just want to say that anyone who doesn't think this film was constructed around the Dean Koontz novel `Intensity' is blind.  The entire first two thirds of the film is identical to the novel (almost) so I have a hard time believing it was all coincidence.  What I was happy to see though was the third act since it scrapped the copycat routine and brought in something unexpected.  Now, just because it favors Koontz novel does not mean the film is predictable or passable.  In fact the film plays out so intense, so horrific that it far surpasses `Intensity'.<br /><br />The film follows two college co-eds, Marie and Alexia, as they visit the home of Alexia's parents.  Marie, you can tell, has not really experienced a home life of her own and so is a bit apprehensive of her stay, but the family is nice and they welcome her.  Before Marie really has a chance to get comfortable with the idea though, something horrific happens.  A mysterious man breaks into the house and brutally (and I mean brutally) murders Alexia's family and takes Alexia herself hostage.  Marie, who happened to elude the killer's eye, trails behind the killer in an attempt to rescue Alexia.<br /><br />Cecile De France delivers beautifully as Marie.  She captures the fear in this woman's eyes without taking away from the apparent determination to save her best friend.  In order to ready herself for her performance she underwent training to physically bring herself up to the task, and it paid off.  Maiwenn Le Bosco does a fine job but she is somewhat non-existent until the brutal climax.  In that climax though, she blew me away with her sheer magnetic realism.  I believed her one hundred percent.<br /><br />`Haute Tension' burrows itself beneath your skin and crawls around until the credits begin to roll, and for some time afterward.  As the shocking conclusion begins to unveil itself you will be beside yourself with anticipation.  The film is littered with gore, especially the unrated version, but the film is more than just a bloody mess.  It actually works at splicing the nerves of the audience as apposed to merely shocking them with beheadings and such.  `Haute Tension' is genuinely frightening, and that alone makes this worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Wes Craven was correct when he suggested director Alexandre Aja was the future of horror.  Watching this film as well as his polished remake of Craven's `The Hills Have Eyes' will help further impress that fact.  Aja has a knack for understanding what creates real fear, what picks at our sanity and infuses paranoia and I for one can't wait to see what he sends our way next.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Alexandre Aja takes us to a roller-coaster of horror in a movie that lives up to its name. "Haute Tension" keeps the tension to the max as we see a return to the visceral gory violence without being vulgar or void exploitation. In fact, the film manages to hold a perfect equilibrium between the elegance and beauty of French film-making and brutal grim horror of movies like Hooper's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre".<br /><br />C&eacute;cile De France plays Marie, who is visiting her college friend Alexia (Ma?wenn Le Besco) in rural France. The day she arrives, a mysterious man appears on an old rusty truck and brutally begins to murder Alexia's family. Marie becomes the last hope for Alexia to survive the brutal killings. Great moments of suspense and tension are built, as the fantastic performance of C&eacute;cile grabs the attention of the public; she really owns the screen and is a perfect match for Philippe Nahon, as the ruthless killer.<br /><br />The most recognizable thing about this movie is how strong the violence is. It is really a movie that will impress people with its graphic violence. The make-up and SFX are great and very realistic. While some killings are clich&eacute;d, others are very surprising. Nevertheless, even when it seems that is gory just for the sake of being gory, the camera-work gives images of complete beauty in the composition of the scene. The colors are so well handled that at times the movie gives the impression of being a horrifying canvas. There aren't that many killings in the film (only 5 and one isn't shown) but they are BLOODY!! Not just a little blood here and there...this film throws BUCKETS at the viewer. It's more than a little disturbing and this film has no humor in it. It has a grim, dark tone from the very beginning and never lets up.<br /><br /> The plot is quite simple, not everything is perfect, and I have to say again that the scrip is probably its big flaw. The glaring plot holes are big enough to keep you thinking about them, something writers should avoid like the plague. Nevertheless, Aja's execution will keep you on the edge of the seat and probably, asking for more. While many things have been written about the ending, I thought it was a fitting and (although unoriginal) ending to the brutal trip, since probably is not the ending what matters, but the way Aja takes us to it. In the end, a movie that stays true to the most brutal school of horror, and yet it still delivers more than the typical slasher. A must-see for horror fans, but be warned...this is some strong stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>OK, I'm pretty easy going when it comes to this type of film.

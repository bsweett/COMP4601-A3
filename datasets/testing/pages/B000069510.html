Folks pulled up in cars, attached speakers to their windows, and watched movies on a large wall set in an enormous field. In my day, the drive in had two uses. One: it was a place where you took a girl on a date because you were too young  to have your own apartment and not worldly enough to get a hotel room. When used like this, you and your date simply steamed up the windows in your old man's car, and it didn't matter what the movie was. The other purpose of the drive in was to go with a gang of your friends (with one usually stuffed in the trunk to save the price of one ticket) bringing in as much beer and wine-cooler as you could stuff under the seats. Resident Evil would have made a perfect drive-in movie, and frankly, I loved it. <p>The gore was well done, barrowing from Alien, John Carpenter's The Thing, and Night of the Living Dead. Milla Jovovich is a pleasure to look at, scampering through the whole affair in a miniskirt, and she displayed a real flair for action as well. Finally, there is just enough good story and plotting to keep you brain at least idling. <p>Nope, it's not Citizen Kane, but then sometimes that's a good thing. It was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, who always brings a certain integrity to all his work, and at the least this is a carefully crafted movie. <p>Back in the day, my friends and I would have talked for hours about this film, and considered it time well spent.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>I like Sci-Fi horror films and this one is a good one.  It is based on a video game of the same name and it has really become a cult type of zombie film.  A beautiful woman named Alice wakes up in a large mansion and doesn't know who she is or where she is.  She is really an guard for the Umbrella Corporation which is the largest company in the USA.  They are also a company deeply involved in military technology and viral weaponry.<br /><br />A deadly mutating virus has been released and the massive hidden facility below the ground is being shut down with all of the employees trapped inside. It is located under the mansion where Alice is. Alice is a guard who was living in the mansion which really is the entrance to the facility called the Hive.  As she wanders about trying to recognize where she is at as a group of commandos break into the mansion.....<br /><br />This movie is just constant action and suspense.  The commandos and Alice try to reenter the Hive to see what has happened only to find out that the mutating T-Virus has escaped and the Hive's employees are infected.  In addition, several of the Hives experimental creatures have escaped. Alice and the commandos are now trapped in the hive with no way to escape and they are being attacked by the creatures and Hive's employees who are now zombies.  This movie is filled with high tech special effects and it is an excellent horror story with zombies and monsters galore.  If you like scary movies with a high tech theme then this is a good film for you.  I enjoyed and I recommend it to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>There's just something about watching a hot babe laying the smack down on anyone and anything that gets in her way - and no one does it better than Milla Jovovich.  She is, to put it mildly, a whole lot of woman.  Resident Evil isn't all about Milla, though; nor is it all about the gore (actually, the movie wasn't nearly as gory as I expected).  Above all, though, Resident Evil is not to be dismissed as just another video game adaptation thrown haphazardly together just to make money.  This film has substance, subplots, and surprises to go along with the generally impressive special effects and, for my money, pretty good acting.  In other words, while the unfortunate denizens of the Hive may be essentially brainless, Resident Evil is not.<br /><br />I have only limited experience playing the original video game.  I never got very far into it, mainly because I wasn't very adept in the gameplay department and didn't spend the time necessary to significantly improve my minimal skills.  All I remember is exploring the house and trying to kill the occasional zombie that popped up along the way as the music did the principal work of creating a spooky atmosphere.  The movie is much more intense than that - and far more suspenseful.  It's not like some clumsy scientist just happened to drop a beaker, thereby exposing the deadly T-virus all of his geeky colleagues.  On the contrary, this story generates a whole host of questions in the first few moments, questions such as who released the virus and why, but also why is the room housing such a deadly virus tied in to the ventilation system of the whole complex to begin with?  (I can't say I got an answer to that last one.)  I actually had to go back and watch the exposure moment a second time because I thought I had missed something the first time.<br /><br />Don't expect Milla's character to supply you with any early answers, as Alice wakes up in a ritzy-looking house with no memory of who she is.  Even the shocking jolt of a stranger claiming to be a cop grabbing her just before a team of commandoes suddenly crash through the windows fails to jog her memory, but she doesn't question the special ops commander when he tells her she is one of two security agents stationed in the house to protect that particular entrance to The Hive, the mega-powerful Umbrella corporation's top-secret, underground facility devoted to all kinds of dangerous and illegal research into bioweapons and the like - and that her amnesia is the temporary byproduct of exposure to a nerve gas.  By the time she and the suspicious cop accompany the group to the entrance to The Hive, Alice has met her equally amnesiac "husband" and learned that the Red Queen, The Hive's central AI, locked the whole facility down and killed everyone inside in an effort to try and contain the super-deadly T-virus from spreading outside the complex.  Their mission is to get to the Red Queen.  It sounds pretty simple, what with everybody down there being dead and all.  As they soon discover, however, those 500-odd dead bodies have arisen as blood-thirsty, flesh-eating zombies, and the Red Queen isn't going to let anyone into her inner chamber without putting up a fight.<br /><br />The majority of the movie, to no one's surprise, consists of the team members trying to survive the onslaught of hordes of zombies, high-tech computer defenses of last resort, etc.  As all of that exciting action is taking place, however, we see Alice trying to sort through the memories coming back to her in intermittent waves.  She is a much more central figure in all of this than even she knows early on, and she isn't the only team member with secrets to be revealed.  That leads to some surprisingly effective plot twists that not only advanced the story in important and plausible ways; they were also presented very much in the context of earlier scenes in the movie.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you've ever played the video game or not - Resident Evil is just an exciting, action-packed horror film.  I don't consider it to be the least bit scary, but it is quite atmospheric. As a horror fan, I must say I've never counted zombies among my favorite monsters - let's face it, they're basically mindless, slow-footed creatures with no erotic potential whatsoever - so I'm not just whistling Dixie when I say that Resident Evil is a great movie.  Of course, a lot of the credit has to go to Milla Jovovich, the finest of one-woman killing machines.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>"Resident Evil" is a great science fiction/horror hybrid.  The plot, a virus released from a laboratory, is frightening and plausible.  A beautiful cast, led by a multi-talented Milla Jovovich, comprises a group of paramilitary commandoes who find themselves trapped miles beneath the earth's surface in a secret laboratory where illegal genetic experiments are being conducted by the Umbrella Corporation.  It is a "who-will-live-who-will-die" action adventure.  Flesh-eating zombies are not usually my cup of tea but this movie makes them very plausible.  The Red Queen computer is chilling, especially when her voice and hologram are that of a child issuing threats such as "You're All Going to Die Down Here!"  With the advent of avian flu, the movie's T-virus has frightening possibilities.  Thus, the movie remains current and fresh.  It is reminiscent of "The Stand," "Rabid," "The Crazies," and other out-of-control virus movies.  Favorite scene:  When the Red Queen traps four commandoes in a glass corridor and dispatches them with lasers that slice and dice.  A must have for all fans of science fiction/horror.  "Resident Evil" is followed by two strong sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Resident Evil" is actually a pretty cool movie.  I've never played the game(though I've been aware of it since it originally came out), so I don't have anything outside of the actual movie to base this review on.  I was expecting a mediocre action yarn about zombies run amok.  What I got was a lot better than expected.  Milla Jovovich is good as the brains/beauty heroine of this flick.  She's very believable.  Michelle Rodriguez is also good as the tough-as-nails soldier.  The rest of the cast does a very good job(including the walking dead).  The story is pretty good considering that it is based on a video game.  I'm assuming that the game is just as complex and confusing with its plot.<br /><br />I spent the first minutes of the film confused about what was exactly going on, which probably happened to everyone who hasn't played the game.  Once the plot has been set, though, the movie is easy to follow and the action is very good.  The soundtrack is fitting for a movie like this.  It has a horror/techno vibe to it, not unlike "Blade."<br /><br />As stated before, the action is very good.  It is paced just right and there are very few lulls in the action once the movie gets rolling.  The special effects are good, but are sort of awkward at times.  The mutated creature looked pretty fake due to some "Mortal Kombat"-type CGI.  Both films shared the same director, so that doesn't surprise me.  This film is, however, superior to "Mortal Kombat."  One thing that impressed me the most about this film is that it had slick set design and good lighting.  Most films in this genre tend to darken things up a bit in an attempt to hide flaws in the special effects.  "Resident Evil" lets you view all of the action, even though some of it is looks a bit fake, in great lighting.  No squinting to do, which is a good thing.  That's one of the main reasons I let some of the CGI screw-ups slip by.<br /><br />The horror aspect of this film was basically a lot of "jump-at-you" scares.  I enjoyed that, but I feel that this movie is better categorized as an action flick.<br /><br />As far as the DVD goes, the special features were par for the course on this type of film.  Lots of "making of" segments, which were fun to watch, are included.  There's also a filmography of the main characters and the director.  The free ticket to "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" was also a nice touch, and I'll definitely go check it out.<br /><br />Overall, a nice action flick that does good for the Milla Jovovich machine.  It's worthy of multiple viewings, but if you aren't into action/gore films, you may want to avoid this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Rated "R". Running time: 1 hour, 40 mins. Shown in widescreen.<br /> Everyone enjoys the "Resident Evil" video game series.  personally, I play on a Playstation One (PS One).

It is based on the same principal.  The train is from the "Resident Evil 2" video game.  The nice surprise for all you "James Bond 007" fans is Colin Salmon is in this film as well as he was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304916558">Tomorrow Never Dies</a> (1997), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIBURQ">The World Is Not Enough</a> (1999) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQO3TW">Die Another Day (James Bond) [Blu-ray</a>] (2002).<br />  Everyone in the offices and laboratory of the Umbrella Corporation is gassed with a biohazard substance. Those that tried to escape in the elevator are killed.<br />  Alice (Milla Jovovich wakes up naked in the shower. The room looks like a suite. She has no memory of how she got there. She is still under the side effects of the nerve gas. A red dress is laid out for her on the bed. She walks around the mansion. Another man, Matt (Eric Mabius) is there in the same situation. Suddenly, soldiers bust into the place. They take them downstairs. They see the Umbrella rooms and the underground Umbrella Train.<br /> The soldiers are James Shade (Colin Salmon), J.D. (Pasquale Alcardi), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Kaplan (Martin Crewes) and Spence (James Purefoy).<br />  Alice was a soldier too, but her memory is only coming back in bits and pieces.<br />  Their mission is to get to the Hive which is deep under Raccoon City. The Hive is a top-secret research facility, but getting through it will not be easy. You have biohazard zombies and other horrifying surprises.<br /><br />  The cast also includes: Heike Makatsch and Jaymes Butler, Jason Isaacs.<br /><br />  Screen Gems (remember them from television in the 1970's?) presented this film which is now part of the Sony Pictures Entertainment company.<br />  The audio commentary is really cool to turn on the second time you watch this film.

Okay, in a lab, a group of scientest are studying to do, well I forget. Anyway they fail, bcause in the middle of the process they drop there project and it turns them into the living dead a.k.a. zombies. A govrment group was sent to destroy the scienst, but when they get there all the scientest are all ready zombies. Cool plot huh? The main actress Milla Jovovich is really good( cute to). The film is never really slow and is entertaiting. Brought zombie film back to life, you can tell with 2003 Undead and 2004 Dawn of the Dead. Can't wait for the sequel.(P.S. If you want to get house of the dead because you liked this and it sounds sort of like this, don't)</p></br><a href="../users/A3AY3EV2MFRFGG.html">A3AY3EV2MFRFGG</a><br/><p>Based on the hit survival horror video game series from which it gets its name, Resident Evil does an adequate job of setting up a film franchise, but does practically nothing with the rich world available to it from its source material - it's all set-up and no follow through.  Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson does keep the pace brisk and the film uncluttered with too much detail, but a little more shading in the character department would have been nice, and having the two people who should know more about the facility than they actually do because of a nerve gas induced amnesia is just a dirty (and lazy) little cheat, narratively speaking.  Also the movie too often resembles other, better movies (i.e. Aliens, Dawn and Day of the Dead, etc.) instead of the games upon which the movie is supposed to be based.  Weak script aside though, the movie is visually exciting and fun to watch in its own way.  It just isn't the moody and scary experience the games are.  Hopefully the inevitable sequel will be an improvement and not another semi-successful missed opportunity.  For Resident Evil fans only.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>it doesnt do good with its wooden dialogue and its crappy acting. basically some moments are way better then others but the blending with zombies and heavy rock isnt great. the suspenseful piano music in the game is better and the games themselves are way better. Anderson directed a ok but boring movie to a great and horrific video game. a dissapointment really</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Resident Evil will probably never win any awards for subtly, acting or writing but it does satisfy the urge to watch an interesting horror movie. The original game was really a knock off of the concept from a number of previous movies (Night of the Living Dead, Warning Sign among many others). It's lack of originality is more than made up for with an imaginative production design and nicely paced narrative.<p>The plot is as simple as the game. There's dangerous research going on in the Hive. Someone has stolen a lethal virus that turns whomever it kills into flesh eating zombies. A crew is sent in to discover what's happened to the Hive when the computer shuts it down killing the infected staff of 500 workers. <p>It's clear that Paul Anderson's film owes a huge debt to Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. While George Romero chose to inject an element of savage satire into his trio of films, Anderson plays his film as a straight ahead thriller. There's lots of close ups of gruesome things. The most clever and original element in this film is making the persona of the central computer into a little girl. <p>This isn't anything heartwarming or original about Resident Evil but it's a fun thrill ride for fans of the original game. It's a pity that Anderson chose not to add any additional subtext to the film as it would have given him and his performers more to work with given the thin narrative. This superbit edition has improved resolution (particularly noticable on a progressive DVD player and HDTV) when compared to the previous, regular editon. Is it worth buying again and paying more money for? Frankly, given the film itself probably not. It's not a surprise to see this film released in the superbit format (vs. more deserving films)as Hollywood has learning to fleece customers many times for "new improved" product.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>This was a taut, chilling, and surprisingly effective zombie kill fest.  The opening with the lethal lock-down of the complex by the super-computer is at once coldly methodical, and deadly.  Milla as the heroine has transformed markedly since her Fifth Element days, and does an admirable job as the anesthesia victim.  This film really moves along at a great pace, the Marylyn Manson soundtrack kicks it up a notch along w/ the action sequences.  A deadly virus is released in an underground research complex, the host computer kills all the scientists rather than risk external exposure of the virus.  A security detail is dispatched to ascertain what went wrong, but are themselves targeted by the newly animated dead.  One of the better of its breed to be sure, very polished and gritty at the same time.  It works, recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>I have to confess that I don't play video games - eye-hand coordination and lightning reflexes weren't included in my genetic package, so this review is based on the movie - and nothing but the movie.<br /><br />Other than Milla Jovovich, no cast member did any real acting.  Michelle Rodriguez had a fairly difficult role to play, but the snarling and eye rolling was just too much at times.  She was necessarily tough, but the dialogue also really let her down. The rest of the cast was on par for a B Grade horror movie, and only slightly more animated than the zombies.<br /><br />This movie is what happens when you mix too many good things in a haphazard way. Imagine trying to write a coherent script when your "must" list includes zombies, were-dogs, sloppy genetic mutations with long tongues, a controlling computer system, an impregnable "fortress", a knockout babe with amnesia, a SWAT team, biological warfare, viruses, spies and saboteurs, a battle on a train, and guns - lots of guns.<br /><br />The zombie scenes failed to impress, no gore to be seen anywhere - they just looked like a typical crowd of people in the mosh pit at a rock concert.  The mutating tissue-thing was straight out of a Dean Koontz book, and most of the suspense scenes weren't very suspenseful, because whatever you expected to happen - did.<br /><br />On the cool side, you had the wicked lasers to do the slicing and dicing, Alice's (Milla) hot red zombie-kicking slit-way-up the side dress, and the fight scenes.  Many parts may seem familiar, mainly because you've seen scenes just like them in other popular action movies.<br /><br />Next time let Alice do some Mortal Kombat with Lara Croft and you can call it a Final Fantasy.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 22, 2005</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>I like it but I like part 2 better.

I still remember buying Resident Evil 2 when I was a teenager and taking it home and playing it for the first time. It just sucked me in instantly and before you know it I was out looking for the first one. This movie is no different. It sucks you in from the very beginning and doesnt let up till the end. It is a fantastic action/horror/sci-fi movie that is filled with great special effects. If you are a zombie or video game lover this film is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>In the never-ending effort to find new material for movies, the industry has gone to a whole host of new media over the past 2 or 3 decades to include graphic novels, video and computer games, and even theme park rides.  Perhaps not surprisingly game adaptations have been perhaps the least success of all the films based on new sources.  Almost without exception movies based on console or computer games have been unspeakably awful.  RESIDENT EVIL, while not a great movie, nonetheless manages to be perhaps the best that the genre has produced.  It has, moreover, provoked two sequels that are both arguably better than the film that started it off.<br /><br />I have not played RESIDENT EVIL (apart from RPGs like Dungeon Siege and Elderscrolls and especially MMORPGs like Asheron's Call and World of Warcraft I generally avoid games), so I don't know how closely this film adheres to its storyline, but you constantly feel the restrictions of a highly predetermined story line.  The entire film -- unlike the sequel -- feels as if it is progressing via a formula.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich has managed to build a career playing strong, heroic women.  The first film most people know her from is THE FIFTH ELEMENT, but she later went on to make THE MESSENGER (about Joan of Arc), also with Luc Besson at the helm (over the course of his career he has constantly made films featuring female action heroes).  She does a creditable job in all three as someone who manages to be heroic despite attempts at the Umbrella Corporation to manipulate her for their own purposes.<br /><br />This can be a fun movie if gone into with rather low expectations.  There is a low of gore, some pretty tense moments, but not a lot of plot.  As usual in these movies, greedy corporations are ultimately the enemy (something even truer in real life, yet why don't we remember that in real life?).  If taken for what it is -- slick fluff -- it can be enjoyable.  But if you start interrogating the plot and trying to make sense of it, you'll get frustrated quick.<br /><br />I first saw this several years ago.  At that time the only cast members I knew were Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez.  On this rescreening I was pleasantly surprised to see Eric Mabius in one of the main roles.  He is best known today as Daniel Meade on UGLY BETTY.  And while he doesn't quite make it into the sequel, his character sorta, kinda does.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>Converting video games into movies is a recipe for disaster.  Especially given how overdone the zombie genre is.  I came in to this movie with suitably low expectations.  In return I got a movie with many interesting twists and turns, some social commentary, subtle ironies and a great ending.  At times it was predictable, but there were enough surprises to keep the movie fresh.  Who could imagine looking forward to part 2 and 3 of a video game based trilogy?</p></br><a href="../users/A17O7AGDZPOJSS.html">A17O7AGDZPOJSS</a><br/><p>I have played all of the RE games and this movie was better than expected the story line was decent the acting was good and the effects where nice<br /><br />However there is not much to relate to the game thats my reason for 4 rather than5</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>My biggest annoyance with this movie is the fact that it has almost nothing to do with the original video game.  The other thing that annoys me is the fact that 2/3 of the characters are killed in about 5 minutes and we don't even get to really know half of them.  Other than that the visual style, special effects, and story of the movie all add together to produce an entertaining sci-fi horror movie that will hopefully not cause an outrage amongst die hard fans of the video games.  This isn't meant to be a re-make of the first game, but it does use some similar elements and some completely knew ones.  If you enjoy Paul Anderson's other works such as Soldier, Event Horizon, and/or AvP, you'll probably like this.  If you only go for Spielberg type movies than stay away from this at all costs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Okay, everyone.  This is a movie based on a popular video game.  Enough said.  Now, as a movie, it is a fast-paced, roller coast ride of a film.  We're not talking HAMLET here, folks.  Director Paul Anderson keeps the action fire hot, and the cast play their roles as one would expect in this kind of movie.<br /><br />The visual effects (for a non video-game fantatic like me) are well done, and there are some jump out of your seat moments.  Milla Jovovich, who was so good in FIFTH ELEMENT, has a rubber face that displays a wide range of emotions for a basically undeveloped character.  Michelle Rodriguez overdoes the tough girl part, but is effective nonetheless.  Eric Mabius gives Matt both a tough and sensitive edge, and redeems himself for BLACK CIRCLE BOYS.  Martin Crewes as Caplan is quite good, as is James Purefoy (A Knight's Tale) in the role of Jovovich's undercover lover.  The monster dogs, zombies, laser killer and chief monster are all well done, and the movie's apocalyptic ending certainly leaves room for the upcoming sequel.<br /><br />I enjoyed this much better than MORTAL KOMBAT, so I'm looking forward to the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Resident Evil is a nitroglycerin packed horror film that is based on Capcom's best selling horror videogames with the same name.  Before the story begins the audience is introduced to the Umbrella Corporation that produces 90% of every home's household products.  However, its large profits are derived from military technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry, which is unknown to the public.  The story begins with Alice (Milla Jovovich) waking up with temporary amnesia caused by gas released by the Hive's supercomputer, the Red Queen, as a defense mechanism.  The Hive is a secret underground research complex with an exterior design similar to the form of a virus, which hosts over 500 scientists.  Alice learns through a group of special operatives working for the Umbrella Corporation that she is also a special operative and something has gone wrong in the Hive.  The mission of the group is to find out what went wrong and turn off the Red Queen that has seemed to run amok.  As the group enters the darkened corridors of the Hive they enter a nightmare that submerges them into an agonizing reality of hellish creatures that want to nourish.  Resident Evil is a fast paced horror tale where the unknown is known, yet the moment of surprise will cause nerves to twitch involuntary as it offers a creepy cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Resident Evil is a movie version of what is called "Survival Horror" in the gaming industry.

Soon she is beset by commandos who claim she is one of them and that they work for the Umbrella Corporation.  In the mansion is an underground train station that leads to a large underground research facility that is in trouble.<p>In the facility, known as The Hive, the team is trying to shut down an AI computer that killed everyone in the facility.  Aside from the killer AI, there are plenty of zombies and even a monster.  The team must defeat these and get out before the facility becomes completely sealed.<p>Milla's character is central to the movie and she slowly regains her memories as the plot advances.  We come to know her better and feel sympathetic for her.<p>All of this is bound up and painted with classic elements of horror and action and blended so well you don't really notice the switches.  Camera angles, stunts and atmosphere really push the viewer's buttons and keep the fear and adrenaline running.<p>As the film nears its conclusion, the viewer tries to guess just what is going to happen and how it will be resolved, but the surprises keep coming until the final scene.<p>Very fun with a minimum of blood and gore for this type of movie, but with plenty of action and spookiness.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>To begin with, lets get one thing straight, video games do not make great movies. Like books, video games are a different sort of medium and when turned into movies are usually nothing more than cool bad movies. With that said, I was really surprised by RESIDENT EVIL.  I had never played the video game, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The movie uses film techniques and cliches borrowed from a host of other films, e.g. THE MATRIX, ALIENS, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD just to name a few. Yet, the movie sucked me in. I was enthralled by it. I got caught up in the action and the story and kept wanting it to go on.<p>There isn't much dialogue here and therefore the acting is limited to physical reactions, facial expressions, body movement, and action sequences. The movie starts off slow and confusing with the seemingly hodge-podge of scenes not making any sense. However, once the background to the film is given and after a few flashbacks are seen, things begin to fall into place.<p>The movie is classified as a horror movie. However, it's really more of an action/adventure or sci-fi movie with a little gore and for a horror movie the gore is rather tame.<p>I've read a lot of mixed reviews about people who have played the game. Some say it strays from the games plot, while others say (with the exception of character changes) stays pretty close to the original video game. I don't know. However, I do know that I really didn't think I would like this movie, but I ended up liking it and was thoroughly entertained for 90 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>"Resident Evil" is yet another in a very long line of video-game movies. It ranks somewhere in between "Street Fighter" and "Super Mario Brothers." The plot is this: an underground office known as the hive is infected with a strange virus and all the people as well as a few dogs turn into zombies. Yes, it's as pathetic as it sounds, but there's some pretty good action. For the most part, though, the film fails to generate the intense frights that the video games have. The zombies really aren't that terrifying, but the special effects and makeup are very well done. As for the story, it's only mildly interesting and very obviously incomplete. The ending is the best part of the film, gearing audiences up for a possible sequel. I hope they make a "Resident Evil 2." I found myself enjoying this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>RESIDENT EVIL was a great Capcom videogame (with many successful versions) with a very simple plot: someone must do something in order to solve a mystery. In this basic outline, the character must cross many different spaces (each has its obstacles) and accomplish smaller missions, that help him to gather objects that lead to peaces of information leading to a final confrontation. Period.<p>The good thing is that the adaptation for Cinema of that basic game structure is reasonably well made. The result is this: a group of top-soldiers is sent inside a secret corporate lab complex where a lethal virus has been spread. They have a few hours to a) discover what happened, b) disable and neutralize the virus and c) get out.<p>Like the game, the complications rearrange the order of priorities and the journey is constantly being redesigned according to the new obstacles found. Like the game, some characters have secret agendas and everything leads to the high-powered action confrontation scene.<p>Put like this, it all seems cerebral, but don't missunderstand me: the film is very entertaining! If the story/screenplay design is (in this case) simple, it is because film is not for the cinemateque. It is pure (and good!) fun. It has a lot of rhythm, the cast is appealing, the characters are fine (in their game-like dimension) and the action makes you jump.<p>Even if you do not play the game (or even know nothing about it) you will understand it perfectly for the screenplay was designed for a wider audience. In this sense, the film is constructed so you'll get early on all the information that you need for the rest of the film. <p>I liked it very much and I believe this to be the best game-to-film adaptation ever made. It works even for those who did not play the game and it delivers a simple plot with lots of interesting twists and great action scenes.<p>The ending is begging for a sequel (but you know that already) and - I have to admit - it is a great ending (and it alone worths the whole film!). Great art direction (doesn't have much to do with the game). Good soundtrack.<p>The extras are fine and they're mostly on the technical side (why wouldn't they be?). Milla Jovovich is absolutely beautiful. Despite the fact that we are dealing here with game characters, I do think that Milla gives a great performance. Furthermore, I do think she is capable of taking higher flights in the future. Aside of that, she is someone the camera trully loves.<p>See it and have fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>"Resident Evil" starts off with a slam-bang double-opening - inside an ultra high-tech underground research-and-development facility, something goes terribly wrong and a gas escapes as the facility's emergency system kicks in, locking down the building and resulting in the apparant deaths of hundreds of employees;  at about the same time, above ground, a young woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up inside a grand mansion with no memory of who she is, only minutes before the place is stormed by a group of well-armed commandoes.  Thus begins the successful movie adaptation of the "Resident Evil" series of video games.<br /><br />  With "Resident Evil", it was far from a given that it could make such a good transition into a movie, to me at least.  It's not like "Silent Hill" (which has also generated an excellent movie) or "Fatal Frame" (which I'm still waiting for the movie version of), both of which had lots of identifiable movie potential from the beginning.  The "Resident Evil" games are a bit different, almost nonstop action, most of them not as developed along character or story purposes (these aspects have begun growing in some of the more recent Resident games).  They needed to fill in some areas for the movie to be as good as the games.  Most of the games pit S.T.A.R. (a highly trained law enforcement organization) agents against hordes of ravenous zombies, occasionally teaming the S.T.A.R. agents with other characters.  It's made a lot of great games, but could it move into just as great a movie?  One thing they did was split the focus up among more characters of different backgrounds - you've got the S.T.A.R. team, you've got the amnesiac Alice - whose nature is kept a mystery until near the movie's end) - as a main point-of-view character, there are the Umbrella (the name of the corporation that owns the underground facility) people and you've got another major character coming into it from outside the main 'groups'.  (This trend of character diversifaction has continued with the "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" sequel, and some of the more recent entries to the game line)  It takes longer to build into where the zombie carnage really starts flying, which is fitting for the first entry of a movie series. It introduces the elements at a pace that's equally good for longtime fans of the games and books as well as for viewers who've never even heard of the concept.  All in all, the transition was more successful than I thought it could be - this is a great, hi-octane horror-action movie which succeeds in establishing good characters and a great 'edge-of-catacylsm' air.  The ending flows directly into "Apocalypse"; and a third "Resident Evil" movie is coming in Fall 2007.<br /><br />  Great beginning to what's shaping up to be a great, and long-running, horror saga.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Blood flows and the Dead walk and chomp in Paul W.S. Anderson's charnel house of a videogame-to-movie zombie opus "Resident Evil", a hyper-kinetic, supremely stylish, super cool barrage of living Dead and corporate wickedness.<br /><br />Instead of plowing its profits and R&D budget into detergents and oven cleaners, the nasty Umbrella Corporation has built itself a big bad virological bug. But as go the best laid plans of mice and men, the Big Bad Bug gets out into the uber-secret underground laboratory/think-tank/weapons factory that is the Hive, and the Hive's super-genius super-computer called the Red Queen gets all twitchy, snuffing all hands on board---with extreme prejudice.<br /><br />The fun is just getting started. Cut to former shiny-happy Umbrella Corporation employee Alice (played tastily by actress-model-singer Milla Jovovich) waking up in the shower of a mansion with no memory as to how she got there. Not to worry, as she soon has plenty of company: a crack-squad of commandos sent in to do a by-the-numbers infiltration: get in, shut down the psychotic Red Queen, get out. Simplicity itself, right?<br /><br />Dead wrong. Everybody in the Hive is dead---but they just don't seem to want to stay down. Slaughter, high-style, ample blood and goop, and a note-perfect Marilyn Manson score ensues, and our marines have to look sharp or find themselves turned into zombie chewtoys.<br /><br />If you're looking for insanely high style, zombie chewing goodness, some nice scares, a good workout for your home entertainment system, model-actress-singer Milla Jovovich in a torn mini-skirt kicking wire-fu butt against undead Doberman pinschers, and all of this served up with a generous side-order of the Red Sauce---well, brothers and sisters, you've come to the right flick! Make sure the safety's off your 9mm Ruger, sling the double barreled shotgun at combat ready---that's you, Soldier!---and let's head deep into the zombie-haunted hallways of the Hive.<br /><br />Zombie purists were concerned when original director, and zombie Grand-Master, George Romero turned the reins over to Paul Anderson, who had a choppy directorial resume: he had previously helmed the lackluster "Soldier" and the grisly if silly space-opera gruefest "Event Horizon". They need not have fretted; from the opening credits to the apocalytpic coda, Anderson proves a master stylist, working with cinematographer Dave Johnson (who worked with Anderson on "Alien versus Predator") to deliver ample zombie-chewing fun with a tight editing technique that serves up the carnage with a mix of brutality and flair.<br /><br />The acting here is equally note-perfect: Milla is at the top of her game and shows off her acting chops as well as her more corporeal talents; in the hands of a lesser actress the role would have been generic action-flick fodder. Michelle Rodriguez (Ocampo) keeps snarling and cracking wise 'til the bitter end; Eric Mabius is charmingly and appropriately plastic (where is his character coming from, anyway?) and also carries off his role like a champ. Colin Salmon (James "One" Shade) once again bravely carries Shakespearean delivery into Anderson's laser jaws of death, while James Purefoy does what he has to do as the poor man's Chris Lambert. He's a good villain, and because of that you end up rooting for the zombies and even the digusting "Licker".<br /><br />But look, the real delight here is the way Paul Anderson, cinematographer Johnson, and composer Marilyn Manson all work together to play out their gory magic on a palette of silence. Can you beat the scene where the Red Queen is first shut down, the blast doors all slide open, and there is that palpable hiss against the tomb-like quiet of the Hive---and then the groans of the shuffling, shambling, *very* hungry dead? Or when, after a second's reprieve, the survivors cower in a control room from an undead bio-engineered abomination, hungry to get in, pounding at a bulkhead blast-door? The movie is at its best when it is a series of gorgeous shifts from dead quiet to blood-thirsty crescendo.<br /><br />The Hive and its environs are so brilliantly executed that Anderson effectively creates another character in the set-pieces alone, from the parquet and marble digs of the Mansion to the sleek, techno-sexy sterility of the Hive, to the goth-industrial Road-to-Nowhere that is the train---all of this adds to the horror and frame the desperation of our heroes as they war against the Living Dead (the train station and Hive Entrance being an actual underground system in Berlin!). Few films manage to bring everything together like "Resident Evil", and Anderson is to be commended in making it all work out in spades.<br /><br />Finally, kudos to Anderson's team for mixing up effective CGI with animatronics: in the last few years, horror directors have taken the easy road with cheap computer-generated effects, and happily Anderson opts for tastily gory animatronic models that give beasties like the "Licker" the respect they deserve.<br /><br />A word should be said about the special features here: while it's a treat to have a ticket to the less ambitious "Resident Evil: Apocalypse", fans of the original will find the six segments on the special effects centerpieces of the film tasty, particularly in the mix between good old-fashioned animatronics and CGI. The alternate ending is amusing for completists, if only to show just how critical a solid editor can be. And without a doubt, the hysterical main commentary track with Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez is worth the price of admission alone. Lucky, lucky Paul Anderson.<br /><br />The billion dollar question, of course, is---is "Resident Evil" scary? Imagine being locked up in the wilderland of the cubicle with flesh hungry co-workers, armed only with your wits and a 9mm automatic. You tell me, Soldier---you tell me.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>I am not a fan of the games.  I rarely (if ever) pick up a video game.  I know about the "Resident Evil" games, I know it's one of the most popular of items.  This movie just lacks "something."  You can't really put your finger on it but overall it's great eye candy.  Great special effects, awesome sound and for once, a good plot!  The biggest problem here though is, for a video game turned movie, this DVD sure lacks quite a bit of inspiration!  Where's the deleted scenes?  Where's the "fun" extras??  Where's the fun???  All are missing unfortunately.  So, I guess we'll have to wait for the real deal when Blade 2 comes to DVD in September.  In the meantime, this DVD is worth a rental.  Cheers!</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>Resident Evil is one of those films that I said, "Ah, I'll wait until it gets to video to see it."  I didn't expect it to be any good - not really.  How could it be?  It is based on a video game.  Now, I actually liked Mortal Kombat, which is also based on a video game (it wasn't great, but it was fun) - and I didn't know that the same director was responsible for it.  So, I was expecting the worst.  I was wrong.<p>As someone completely unfamiliar with the video game on which the film is based, I didn't know what to expect.  In short, Resident Evil is about a group of "security" personnel who work for a huge conglomerate that is doing all sorts of research - some of it suspect.  One of their more sinister viruses is released and they must go into the secret facility where it is created to try to fix things.  Little do they know that they will be facing all sorts of creepy security devices and ... zombies.<p>Milla Jovovich is the female lead and she manages to carry the film well.  I'm really not that informed on her background, but I will say that while she probably doesn't have a great depth of talent at her disposal, she is a capable actress and I liked her in her role.  To say that she was believable would be impossible, as I don't know that such a person could exist (how many zombie fighters do you know?).<p>Sadly, the men in this film are almost interchangeable.  I really didn't know who was who until names started getting fired off and I actually bothered to pay attention.  They all sort of look the same.  There are two other women in the film too, and I didn't realize it until one of them gets injured - they look the same as well.<p>The interesting thing in this sci-fi/horror film is that the horror aspects were not the ones I found frightening.  It was the sci-fi stuff.  The whole zombie aspect seems to be ground better covered by George Romero in Dawn of the Dead.  In fact, the zombie mythos seems to be taken directly from Romero's film:  they move slowly, they look terrible, and they eat flesh of the living.  If you get bitten, scratched, etc. by one of the undead, you, too, will become one of the undead.<p>The sci-fi angle worked better for me (and I don't really like sci-fi).  I found the security devices and the assorted set pieces to be very intimidating and frightening.  I definitely was feeling the suspense.<p>Part of the fun for me was that I DIDN'T know about the video game.  Why? I didn't know what was going on.  The beginning of the film was very confusing as I didn't understand what was happening or why it was happening.  Fortunately, the screenwriters did a very good job of having a few of the characters actually explain the subject to me - and it was done well - as a few of the other characters were designed to be as confused as I was.<p>The script, the sets, the make-up, and the actors made this a very enjoyably scary film.  I actually recommend it and give it four stars when compared with other films of this genre.<p>The DVD extra features are rather standard and I didn't avail myself of all of them.  However, as DVD extras become the norm, I think we'll see more and more added features for big budget films and more of the "standard fare" extras, such as these, offered:  Director and actor commentary, subtitles, music video, biographies of the actors, etc.<p>Have yourself a good scare and watch this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>If you like action/horror films, find zombies terrifying (and therefore, excellent scary movie material), have a thing for Milla Jovovich, or most likely, have played and LOVED any of the many Resident Evil video games out there, then you need to check out this awesome film and its even better sequel. Personally, Milla is a bit too "stereotype super model" for my taste, but she's made some great movies, few things scare me more than Romero-stlye zombies, and  the Resident Evil games are the shiznight! Especially part 2, with the delectable Claire Redfield! Anywho, Resident Evil (the movie) is a sort of prequel to the video games, so don't worry if you're unfamiliar with them. The plot goes something like this: The Umbrella Corporation is the most powerful commercial entity in the world, producing a variety of cosmetic and other type products, but making their real money off illegal scientific research and development. Their most horrific new discovery is the T-virus, a chemical agent capable of causing monstrous mutations and even bringing the dead back to life! As if that didn't make it a scary enough place to work, their main center of operations is a huge, underground research facility called "The Hive," located deep below the surface of Raccoon City. The only entrance to the facility is through the walls of a huge mansion on the outskirts of the city. The mansion is guarded by two security agents working for the company and under the guise of a newlywed couple. Everything is very well controlled and planned out, until the day the T-Virus is set loose!<br /><br />Alice (Milla Jovovich), one of the security operatives guarding the mansion, wakes up to find herself naked and confused on the shower floor, with no memory of her life or identity. Suddenly, her home is stormed by a special ops team, and she and two mysterious men are taken prisoner. She soon is informed of who she is and who she works for, and that the strange circumstances are due to something gone wrong within the Hive. Using the secret entrance, the group travels via an underground train to the secret research facility, where they discover the worst has occurred. The T-Virus has escaped, the "Red Queen, the computer entity that controls the security of the underground lair, has killed all employees to minimize risk of spreading the contamination, and all those dead employees are slowly waking up....and they are hungry! Suddenly, the race is on to get back to the train and out of the mansion before the secret blast doors close-up and seal their doom! But, before they can save themselves,  they'll have to face the wrath of the Red Queen, the terror of some monstrously mutated dogs, a horrific creature called "The Licker," and an army of the living dead!<br /><br />What makes "Resident Evil" such an excellent film is the style and attention with which it is executed. Even on a tight budget, the filmmakers, most of which were fans of the game themselves, went to great lengths to make this a movie worth watching again and again! The style of the game is ever present, from the extremely authentic scenes, creatures, and characters, to the brilliant sets, lighting, and camera angles. Homage is paid to great scifi/horror films of the past, as well as to "Alice in Wonderland," seemingly a favorite book of filmmakers all over. The cast is excellently chosen for this type of movie, and I'm particularly impressed with their love of the games. Michelle Rodriguez is frightening, even when not a zombie, and Eric Mabius looks computer generated himself! And I don't mind adding that the producer's sister makes quite a lovely Dr./zombie in the film. And speaking of zombies, thanks so much for sticking with the game and not making those new, fast moving style zombies we see so much in current horror. Those are scary, but they're nowhere near as creepy. Conserving their energy for when you're within reach, these zombies are fast when they need to be, their deceptive slowness making them all the more frightening! The new "Deluxe" version of the DVD isn't overwhelmingly loaded with extras, after all, it's still only one disc, but it does include a fun cast and crew commentary that brings to mind a favorite line from Zoolander: "A model, idiot." It also includes theatrical trailers and featurettes, a clip from Resident Evil: Apocalypse, a visual effects commentary, an alternate ending that I'm sooo happy they didn't use (the ending they DID use is awesome), and filmographies. An incredibly cool, must own film for all fans of the video game and zombie genres! And the sequel is even better!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Like many that have seen this movie, I have been a fan of the video game series for years, and this movie never disappoints me. It has everything that makes RE great; strong characters, interesting story and scenes that make me jump. At first, it is sad that no video game characters make it on to this movie, but Milla Jovovich is great as the heroine Alice.<br /><br />The special effects were really good for this movie. The licker and the dogs were really impressive. The action is also very entertaining. When the action is happening, I find myself not being able to turn away, it is very fast paced. I also really enjoyed the scene when the security lasers were slicing up the team. The Red Queen was an interesing villain as well, maybe even more so than the licker. Overall, this movie is way worth seeing and having if you are a fan or even if you aren't a fan of the games. The movie is just fun</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Paul Anderson's "Resident Evil" was released in 2002 and is based on the video game of the same name. I don't play video games so this review is based solely on the film.<br /><br />Since its release I never gave the film any thought, but the red film poster/dvd cover with Milla Jovovich in a ripped red dress somehow snuck into my subconscious over the years. Then I caught a 15-minute snippet of the film while channel surfing recently (not knowing it was "Resident Evil"). The part I saw was near the beginning where Milla mysteriously wakes up in a shower in a mansion. She obviously doesn't know who she is or where she's at and wanders around the mansion trying to figure things out when -- BAM! -- a team of commandos storm the mansion and take her via secret subway to a vast underground research/development complex called The Hive, which belongs to The Umbrella Corporation.<br /><br />That's all I saw. I didn't have time to watch anymore but I decided right there to pick up the dvd. The set-up is truly intriguing and, in ways, brilliant.<br /><br />[PLOT SPOILER! Don't read the next two paragraphs unless you want to know the basic plot] After viewing the dvd I discovered that a biological "accident" causes the supercomputer that runs The Hive to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and the commandos are sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer (called the Red Queen) to shut down the facility and kill the people.<br /><br />It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies (I know this sounds totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable). Milla and the commando team slowly discover this. Meahwhile the Red Queen has trapped them in the Hive with the zombies and other undead creatures. Can they get out alive? [END SPOILER].<br /><br />POSITIVES:<br /><br />-- As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.<br /><br />-- The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.<br /><br />-- Milla herself is stunning. The entire film she runs around in a red dress with a slit up the side. Her face and expressions are magnificent.<br /><br />-- The story itself and the delivery (sets, etc.) ring of brilliance. This is sci-fi of the highest order.<br /><br />-- The film features a cool eerie score highlighted by some rocking nu-metal acts.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:<br /><br />-- Although "Resident Evil" is original in many ways it's sometimes reminiscent of other films like "Aliens" and "Dawn of the Dead." Hence, some things are predictable; for instance, anyone who gets bitten by a zombie is gonna eventually turn into one.<br /><br />-- To be expected, the mystery build-up in the first hour is better than the last half hour, which is action-filled. Why? Mindless action with numerous quick edits somehow always becomes boring. Wouldn't it be great if a sci-fi/horror film like this ended in a truly unconventional blow-your-mind way (e.g. the original "Planet of the Apes")? But the final sequence makes up for it, sort of. Besides, since the film is based on a video game the zombie/human slaughter comes with the territory.<br /><br />The film runs 95 minutes before the credits roll.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>First of, I am not a gamer, and am not familiar with the game. This was the first time I watched this Blu-Ray.

This is the best zombie film when it comes to story and it puts all zombie films to shame in comparison. It is a definite must-watch for any zombie fans and it will surely put many of your zombie favorites to shame when you watch it.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: In an underground lab facility called The Hive; which is owned by the Umbrella Corporation; an outbreak of the Umbrella-developed T-Virus has escaped into the air-conditioning system. So the AI security system known as the Red Queen, seals The Hive, and kills everyone underground to prevent the virus from escaping; trapping them in elevators, filling lab rooms full of water, and spewing a gas that removes all of the oxygen in the air. When the report is received an Umbrella unit of soldiers are sent to retrieve the security people from the Spencer Mansion; Alice a hot, young woman, who wakes up naked in the shower after a nerve gas was released into the mansion knocking her out and making her lose her memory, Spence, a guy who wakes up inside the train that takes the Umbrella team to The Hive and also has lost his memory, and Matt, an environmentalist disguised as a cop in order to retrieve samples of the T-Virus from The Hive in order to expose the Umbrella Corporation's illegal genetic experimentation and find his sister who works in The Hive. So the group goes into the basement of the mansion, and takes the train that is stored in the basement, and takes it to travel to The Hive which is located a half-mile underground. Their main mission is to go the Red Queen's chamber and shut her down, to unlock the doors and see if there are any survivors. All hell breaks loose when the Red Queen is shut down, and all of the doors are unlocked, because it turns out the dead have been re-animated (a.k.a. have become zombies). So the team has to find a way out and prevent the zombies from eating them or something else eating them and get out of The Hive before time runs out because if they don't get out in time, the doors to the basement which they entered will seal shut and they will be trapped a half-mile underground. The team also learns of the Umbrella Corporation's misdeeds and the things they've created. And as Alice and Spence regain their memories they begin to remember how the events leading up to the outbreak transpired and caused it, and remember who caused it.<br />MUSIC: The music in the Resident Evil movies have always been great, and this is no exception. I also love the song played by Slipknot in the credits (My Plague).<br />GORE FACTOR: There is very little gore throughout most of the movie, and only really has gore near the end. But this film takes a more realistic approach to zombies as to the fact that the blood in them has become coagulated (Dried up) because they're dead.<br />ACTION: There are shooting scenes which are pretty cool, there are zombie escape scenes which add a nice effect, the scene with the infected dogs was awesome, and the scenes involving the licker were cool.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: This is definitely an awesome zombie movie. The story is great, the plot twists are excellently done, and the characters are cool. The action really keeps the film going as well and the music really sets the mood. This movie also has good pacing, and is hardly boring or over the top. A definite buy, don't just rent it. Plus the ending is bizarre and is actually kind of creepy and it will bother you in a good way.<br />OVERALL: It is a spectacular zombie film that every zombie enthusiast should watch (Get to it, J-Train, while I focus on finding Day of the Dead and watching it). It is a great representation of the classic game franchise and it serves as an example of how game-based movies should be made.<br />THE GOOD: Great story, great music, great characters, cool creature designs, cool action, bizarre ending, hot female lead.<br />THE BAD: One or two scenes of action and acting are a little cheesy, thankfully these happen early in the movie and don't last long.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>This movie had me going for a while. At first I thought that they would base is on the acclaimed capcom resident evil. Thought that they would base it on the frist game in the series. If you really wanna know where it fits in the series, it's sort of like a prequel to the events that unfolded. The mansion in the movie is not the one in the game. It takes place at a different mansion but takes place during the first game. This movie left me shocked most of the time what with the countless surprises and consistant 'have to hurry' flow. It's the perfect begining to kick off the series. The only reason why I'm not giving it five stars is becuase the zombie effects could've been a littl better. But, other than that, that's all.

From Pong to Madden, Pac-Man to Tomb Raider, there is not a single doubt in anyone's mind that though most games have been created for entertainment purposes only, and that the graphics have significantly improved through every generation of gaming.  There are some games that standout from the rest in terms of almost movie quality experience within the game, from intense stories, stunningly realistic graphics, and for the most part solid voice acting, many of today's video game franchises have felt like they are movies that players have full control over.  Such franchises are extremely successful, some examples would be; `Silent Hill 1-4', all of the `Tomb Raider' games, and the controversial `Grand Theft Auto' franchise.  One of the most popular video games with that cinematic quality would have to be the `Resident Evil' series.  With its eerie and creepy storyline and music, dark and dangerous environments that are loaded with evil zombies waiting to kill you, and the great voice-over actors used to bring your favorite characters to life, it is clear why this franchise is one of the strongest franchises to this day, even after having 3 sequels and a prequel game released in the series.  Many of these video game franchises have been so successful that even Hollywood has begun to take notice, recent Hollywood movies based on video game franchises have been pretty much hit-and-miss in terms of loyalty to the source material and interest from the general movie-going public.  The failures would have to be "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within", "Alone In the Dark", "Mortal Kombat", and "Bloodrayne", the successes have basically been between two franchises the `Tomb Raider' franchise starring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft in "Tomb Raider" and "Tomb Raider:  The Cradle of Life", and the Milla Jovovich thrillers "Resident Evil" and "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse".  It just so happens that this review is for "Resident Evil", look for future reviews to feature my opinions on both the good and bad adaptations.<br /><br />"Resident Evil" begins with a paramilitary commando team invading a house that appears to be mostly vacant except for a strange woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich).  Upon further searching of the grounds, it appears that all is not as it seems, and that this house is really a cover for a secret underground facility set up by the evil Umbrella Corporation.  Though Alice doesn't recall what has happened in the recent days, except for the bits and pieces she receives via flashbacks, she quickly begins to understand that there is definitely something awry with this facility.  A fact that is proven to be correct by the existence of zombies that have begun hunting the paramilitary team.  As if the zombies weren't enough to contend with, it seems that the facility's defense mechanism has been activated and the facility itself is hunting the commandos.  Now, all are in a race for their lives to escape the facility without letting any of the zombies make it to the surface.<br /><br />Writer/Director Paul W. S. Anderson really had his work cut out for him when releasing this movie.  With previous video game adaptations failing at the box office, many movie-goers and critics were highly skeptical that any video game franchise could translate well onto the big screen.  Understanding that his biggest asset would be to not assume that everyone knows the source material, i.e. the video game, Anderson crafted a story that stays true to the video games, even feels like it could have come from any of the video game installments, yet also stands on it's own as a separate creation.  The actors are all very talented, and all give solid, realistic performances that serve to raise the movie up from being a simple video game adaptation and/or zombie movie into a truly suspenseful thrill-ride that doesn't require any knowledge of the source material so that all movie audiences can walk right into the theater and be on the same page in terms of what's occuring in the movie.  The special effects work for the most part is very well done, a few scenes are a little weak, but I understand that the studio might not want to risk breaking the bank on a video game franchise that isn't a guaranteed success at the box office.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed "Resident Evil", I must admit that upon my first viewing of the movie I wasn't as enthralled by it.  This has mostly to do with the fact that there is a wide open ending to the movie, there is some resolution, but for the most part the story is left open and screaming for a sequel.  Since I saw the movie within a few weeks of its arrival on DVD, there had not been any announcement made regarding a future sequel.  Without a sequel the story is incomplete, and therefore a let down.  However a year later Columbia Pictures announced that they had begun production on "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" and that the basic story written again by Paul W. S. Anderson, would pick up directly where "Resident Evil" left off.  Needless to say, this made me happy and so when the sequel came out on DVD I rented both movies and watched them back to back.  By doing this I was treated to a complete story that is truly too big to fit into one movie and the need for two movies to tell one story made sense, and I was no longer frustrated with the first film.  With all that being said, if you are wanting to watch "Resident Evil", please keep in mind that you need to rent the sequel at the same time or shortly after viewing the first film so that you will get the complete movie experience as it was intended to be.<br /><br />"Resident Evil" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>Resident Evil is sort of an unbalanced mixture of old-school zombie horror and new-school filmmaking and special effects. Everything about the movie has to be a lot faster (except the zombies themselves, somewhat surprisingly), there has to be martial arts complete with even some wire-fu, and it has slimy monsters that are rendered by CGI, not old-fashioned animatronics. As you can see, I was never particularly won over by the film.<p>Resident Evil opens in an underground laboratory called "The Hive, a top-secret facility owned by a company called the Umbrella Corporation, situated underneath Raccoon City. One of the lab workers sabotages the place, shutting the power down and unleashing a deadly virus that kills its victims and brings them back as zombies.<p>We then cut to a cutie naked chick (Milla Jovovich) called Alice, who awakens in a bathtub inside some large mansion; not only is she unclothed, she's also suffering from a mild form of amnesia. Before she can collect her bearings (though she has enough time to put on a dress), an elite military task force barges into the building, taking her and an outsider (Eric Mabius) to the underground facility, directly connected to the mansion. Their mission is to shut down the Red Queen, the computer controlling the lab, but they''ll have to get through flesh-eating zombies and maniacal defense systems to accomplish that.<p>As directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the same man who crafted the far superior and terrifically frightening Event Horizon, Resident Evil is unfortunately lacking in much of that film's thrills and chills. Anderson shows an inconsistent hand at staging and filming action sequences; the movie's numerous shootouts and fight scenes are only mildly exciting at best, hampered too often by close-up shots of big guns and expended shells. Worse yet, all the violence is sanitized; there's hardly any blood or gore in this picture.<p>Actually, what's probably most memorable about the picture as a whole is how maddeningly inconsistent it is in terms of pacing and excitement. For every scene that's fun to watch, there's another that's just plot-stopping, whether it's watching the survivors move from one bland-looking corridor to another, or Milla Jovovich jump-kicking zombie dogs in slow motion, or a computer program tiresomely going over the very simple zombie rules.<p>There are also some glaring technical faults that I'm surprised were't fixed or edited in post-production, such as an unbearably loud industrial score that blocks out most of the expository dialogue, most of it uttered by Colin Salmon, who if you're familiar with his work, already has a pretty quiet voice that'd be inaudible matched up against anyone else in the cast.<p>The zombies in this movie are your basic "pale and rotting skin" undead, some with the occasional missing bits of face and flesh. Unfortunately, the zombies in this film have goofy-looking mechanical movements, as if though their joints were so stiff, they could barely show much in the way of mobility. Maybe it's the effects of rigor mortis, but this makes zombies far less enjoyable to observe.<p>Most of the cast ranges from non-descript to just plain awful. Easily the worst of the bunch is Michelle Rodriguez, whose only distinct trait is a perpetual frown; she's given a lot of macho dialogue, but Jenette Goldstein she is not. Surprisingly, it's Jovovich who stands out as the film's kickass heorine. Sure, she's not much of an actress, but she's got the physical stuff down pat, for the most part. And she's cute enough that I don't mind seeing her in a slinky red dress, as well as a couple of scenes that briefly reveal some of her naughty bits.<p>Because there's hardly any gore, Resident Evil doesn't really work all that well as a zombie flick. And because it's not scary, horror is out of the question, too. But being a zombie fan, I'm prone to forgiving movies of this ilk simply because I'm pretty easy to please. Resident Evil is a passable enough timewaster, worth a rental, but it's certainly nothing I'll ever give much thought to again. <p>Compared to the recent spate of zombie horror, Resident Evil might very well be the most lackluster of the bunch. It's never as intriguing or intelligent as 28 Days Later or as marvelously thrilling as the Dawn of the Dead remake and it's never as hilariously enjoyable as the misguided House of the Dead, proving that mediocrity really can be less entertaining than plain awfulness.<br />** 1/2 out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>Forget about eating raw meat, just watch this movie. Based on Sony Playstation's terrifying game, a deadly virus has taken over Raccoon City and mostly everybody is dead. That's the plot, now the funnies. Michelle Rodriguez kicked some serious backside in this movie. While shooting zombies to Marilyn Manson music, the movie's action never stops. Watch commandos get sliced by lasers. Watch out! Hey, that one guy Eric Mabius looks like he's on something. Chica should've lived. Where was the mansion? Where was Chris and Jill? Instead we get &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; chick who should have kept her clothes on. Elevators are dangerous. Don't let people bite your hands. If they do, go to a doctor and say a zombie bit you. Don't trust man's best friend. Oh yeah, be sure to cook your meat, you don't want the runnies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>I think that anyone who went to see 'Resident Evil' expecting character development or a witty script are foolish.  This is the kind of no-brainer entertainment that is good fun at the cinema and from this perspective it is actually pretty good.  The story has Jovovich playing a...babe with memory loss who, along with a group of army officers infiltrate an underground research facility called The Hive.  Unknown to the public above this is where the hugely influential Umbrella Corporation has been researching the deadly T-Virus, that reanimates the dead.  However, the Red Queen computer mainframe killed all of the Hive's employees after a security scare.  Now it's up to the cast to find out what went on there.<p>First of all I'll go through everything that's wrong with this movie.  Most glaringly, there are several long scenes which just have the cast shooting at zombies, which I could have seen playing the game at home.  Other things critics have labelled as ridiculous mostly adds to the movie's trashy fun.  For instance, check out the employees of The Hive, all researching a top-secret virus over cups of coffee and all under 25.  On top of that we have Jovovich parading about in a red dress split at the thigh, and whilst the rest of the cast are bitten and maimed she remains with a few delicate smears of dust across her face.  Unfortunately, the story is very inconsistent, and for a while the audience can't be sure what's going on, why Red Queen's mainframe couldn't be overriden from outside and who everyone is supposed to be.<p>Still, there's actually plenty of elements here that mean 'Resident Evil' is a cut above other computer game adaptations.  Despite being almost totally reliant on dumb jump scares, there's a few things here that have the ability to make you recoil in disgust and a few other creepy elements.  For anyone that's seen similar movies, you just know that when we focus in on the dead woman pressed against the glass of a research lab that she'll open her eyes suddenly.  Thankfully knowing what's coming doesn't take away from a lot of genuinely enjoyable aspects.  For example, the Red Queen's manifestation as a little girl is great fun, as are the zombie Dobermans and Michelle Rodriguez is fantastic in what could easily be a very unrewarding role.<p>Although this is certainly no classic, it's a good watch and is a lot better than 'Tomb Raider' or 'Street Fighter'.  Even so, anyone over the age of 30 will be scratching their heads, but that's probably the idea, what with a Slipknot-laden soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I am about ten years from retirement to give you an idea of my age. And yet I enjoy many of the new horror movies if they have something besides all head banging music and tons of gore. This movie will rock your world no matter what age you are. Many adaptations of games do not make it in my replayable list. This one excels there. This is one you will find yourself regularly popping in the player for a revisit of the haunting music, great acting, and scary as hell zombies and other creatures. This is by far one of my favorite horror movies. Well thought out screenplay, excellent directing, and super music score. I give it a high recommendation. I haven't owned a console game since the first Nintendo, but this movie has tempted me to buy a new one even though I prefer the PC versions. By the way I did not care for the last Final Fantasy movie, but I'm sure game console gamers may. This movie although possibly not as appreciated by those with game consoles, will definitely be appreciated by Horror/SciFi movie fans. I recommend the sequel as well. Although not quite as scary, still quite good in the action department.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>A deadly virus has escaped into a underground scientific colony owned by the Umbrella Corporation killing all the researchers and employees, a lovely woman named "Alice" ( Milla Jocovich) is joined with "Rain" ( Michelle Rodriguez) and a elite commando squad to investigate the mysterious deaths of the workers. They discover that the computer that runs the place has taken over and accidently unleashes hordes of zombies & mutant monsters, they must find a way out or else end up as dinner before the virus will infect humanity.<br /><br />A well made adapation of my all time favorite video game series of the same name, sure it doesn't have Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine ( whom stars in part 2) but it's a breezy ride loaded with gore, horror, sci-fi, decent acting, cool music score and a twist in the end that leads to "Resident Evil Apocalypse" which was almost even better.<br /><br />The DVD here has great picture with good sound quality and neat extras like 2 commentaries, featurettes, trailers, and clip from "Resident Evil Apocalypse", so if you enjoy zombie movies then this is definitely worth adding to the zombie DVD collection.<br /><br />Also recommended: " Dawn of the Dead" ( 1978) "Day of the Dead" ,"From Dusk Till Dawn", " The Matrix", "Blade 1 & 2", " Re-Animator", " Cemetery Man", " Total Recall", " Versus", " 28 Days Later...", "Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 and 1990 versions)", " The Stuff", " Scanners", " Hell of the Living Dead ( a.k.a.

Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was excellent, although it was 1.85:1, instead of the 2.40:1 I prefer.  The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 was also excellent.<br /><br />The movie was okay; not great.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>The first film of the three, was the best. A zombie film, that was influenced by Night of the Living Dead, but elaborated upon, by adding action, combined with sci-fi. Plus, some of the visual effects are also quite good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I went to see this film when it first came out and I was syked since I love the video game.  I was wanting to be scared to death but that didn't happen.  I didn't even get a shiver.  The film is done as a action film, not a thriller so don't expect to piss your pants in fear.  The action scenes are decent and the gore level is up there...some of the CGI is a little corny but Jovovich is enough to make you forgive the defects of the film.  It's fun and entertaining while not living up to the hype I placed on it.  I give it four stars because for what it is, an action film with a beautiful star, it pulls through.  It just doesn't have the same feel the video game has...it doesn't do the game justice in that respect.  But if you want to see a bunch of people shooting zombies and rabbid dogs then this is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I this movie has people living and working underground in a place call The Hive. It's right under Raccoon city. A T-Virious starts to infect all the employees down their and turn them into zombies. A woman who can't remember anything was caputred by a cop until some guys in uniforms broke in and grabed the cop they took her and the cop down the hive to shut the hole place down, it turns out that they ran into some trouble by kill the zombies if they don't want to get bitten and become one. This first is not so much base on the video game like the second movie is but it is a lot more blooder which I like.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>I have played almost every Resident Evil game that's come out from the first to the latest and greatest Resident Evil 4.  When this movie came out I was pretty hesitant.  Would they do a remake of the first game or would they create an entirely new movie?  And which would I rather they did?  Having seen this movie and the second movie's attempt to incorporate actual video game parts and movie parts, I must say I'm relieved they didn't remake the first Resident Evil movie.<br /><br />Instead, they created new characters and created a semi-backstory to the events of Resident Evil the video game.  And, also surprisingly, it works pretty well!  What helps is that we have two cool actresses, Michelle Rodriguez and the always enjoyable Milla Jovovich.  But what also worked for this movie is the tension and suspense that built from the very beginning to the exciting climax.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, we have fully clad men and women ready to kick ass but through a series of events, they end up losing lives and most of their ammo.  That is when the true Survival Horror that the video game stands for begins.<br /><br />Now granted this movie is a rip off of many different and better sci-fi and horror films from Alien to the countless zombie films that have been made.  But what it lacks in originality, it makes up in style.  The action and violence is pretty stylized and it was fun to pick up some RE connections.  You're not looking at an Oscar-winning movie of course, nor is it as good as some of the zombie movies out there (28 Days Later, both versions of Dawn of the Dead, etc) but for what it is, it is very well done.<br /><br />And, for whatever you can say about the movie in a negative light, Paul Anderson handles the subject matter much more deftly than Uwe Boll could ever do with his own Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead films.  So far, Resident Evil stands tall as the best and, sadly enough, most faithful video game movie yet.  That's not saying too much, given the competition, but it's still a fun, mindless romp through familiar territory.  And it could have been a lot worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>Being a movie based on a videogame I had low expectations but right from the start it grabbed me and kept me glued to the screen. The movie hold a high level of tension and terror right from the opening scenes. It does get somewhat choppy at times but overall I really enjoyed this movie. The vhs video quality is excellent and the audio is top notch with a clear, dynamic and very deep low and upper ends. Overall: VERY GOOD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>Sexy security operative (Jovovich) wakes up one night with amnesia, then gets ambushed by a commando squad and led into an underground research facility over-run by flesh-eating zombies. More entertaining than one would expect from another video-game adaption, but the visual effects are so laughably poor and the concept so ridiculous that most die-hard horror fans will see this to be a direct rip-off of George A. Romero&#65533;s zombie films. Ten points to anyone who can figure out Jovovich&#65533;s character&#65533;s name before the credits.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>The Genera of zombie movies has had many cogs in its wheel.  For example Day of the Dead, Night of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the living dead and so on.  Resident Evil proves that this formula can still work for an audience in the 21st century.  The biggest fault of this movie is what it doesn't use.  <p>These include 90% of the cast and its soundtrack.  It is a wonderful B movie and if it's a choice between this and Pearl Harbor rent Resident Evil.  I personally can't wait for the sequel</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>To me, "Resident Evil" is a film that delivers intense action as well as cutting-edge special effects from thrilling start to breathtaking finish! I have played all the "Resident Evil" games on PlayStation and I thought that the film version definitely lived up to the games in a big way! "Resident Evil" takes place in a future city called Raccoon City. A lethal virus has been released inside a medical facility building called the Umbrella Corporation, killing everyone in sight and shutting down elevators, etc. The main character is a woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich, "The Fifth Element"), who is teamed up with a group of commandos (including Michelle Rodriguez, "The Fast and The Furious") to find the cause of everything that went on inside the complex...but not before some flesh-eating, virus-infected zombies come chasing after them! And the movie goes on from there. A lot of the credit goes to Screen Gems, part of Sony Pictures Entertainment, for bringing this movie to the big screen. Also to Milla Jovovich for not just her performance, but for her physical abilities as well. I mean, you should have seen Milla fight off those virus-infected canines one-by-one! In fact, Milla kind of reminds you of Angelina Jolie in last year's "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider". And also to Michelle Rodriguez for her outstanding role as Rain, who is part of the commando team and to director Paul Anderson ("Mortal Kombat", "Event Horizon"), he did an outstanding job in directing his second video game adaption since "Mortal Kombat"! With a great soundtrack, excellent supporting cast, and lots of action to boot, "Resident Evil" is the best thrill ride of 2002 by far! I can not wait for the DVD to be released!</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>I do like seeing scary movies, so I saw previews for this so I thought I'd check it out. Well I liked it scared me to death if the filmakers make Resident Evil 2 hope they make it scarier all the zombies looked scary. So if you really like horror flicks go see this.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>George Romero originally wrote the script to this film. While he is mostly known for his "Living Dead" series, he also has experience with Resident Evil - he directed a Japanese commercial for the first Resident Evil game, and it became pretty popular. However, Romero got in arguments with the producers over the movie, was fired, and the script was rewritten by Paul Andersen. What we got was this - a travesty of a film in general. The story involves things going haywire at "the Hive," an Umbrella Corporation laboratory. A T-Virus escapes the testing laboratory and escapes into the air conditioning, and the security computer ("The Red Queen") responds. I don't understand why it should respond to this, since the T-Virus is spread by touch and not by air. I also wonder why, if that was a concern, there was an air conditioner in the first place. Isn't having an air conditioner in a test lab where you make chemical and biological viruses a bit...stupid? You would also think they would have tougher glass for containers of dangerous chemicals and...oh dear, am I using logic with this movie?<br /><br />A special-ops team working for Umbrella (sorry, no S*T*A*R*S) is sent in to shut the laboratory down. Using a secret entrance, which is a mansion (the mansion is in the film for maybe five minutes), they come across Milla Jovovich's character and her "husband," taking them to the lab. It should also be mentioned that the two were sprayed by a nerve gas to erase their memory for a long time, as activated by the security. At no point is it explained how this was supposed to help in the first place - it is also never explained why a special ops team would take two extra loads on a secret mission when they could just pass them on to a surface security team. The team goes into the lab to turn off the system, and hilarity - I mean - horror ensues.<br /><br />I'd like to first say off that, like "Final Fantasy: Spirits Within" which had little fantasy, there was little horror in this film. The enemy in this film is not really the undead or the biogenetic failures, but the laboratory computer. Uh, pardon me, writers? This is "Resident Evil," not "2001: A Space Odyssey." The only real thing you had to fear from computers in the game was that in the last level you had a timeline before the lab/mansion/city/sewer/whatever blew up. There was no Hal screwing things up for characters.<br /><br />Did I mention the producers stated one of the reasons Romero was fired was because his script was "too zombie-ish?" That'd be like if Peter Jackson's script for "Lord of the Rings" was rejected for being "too fantasy-ish." Zombies take up about ten minutes total in the film. (yes I actually timed it) They appear and then disappear at random moments as if the producers said, "Dang it, I just remembered we promised the fans zombies!"<br /><br />Any way, second thing: I have always abhored Milla Jovovich, and this movie only strengthens my hatred for her as an actress. Look, she can't act, she gets the majority of her roles by sleeping with one of the filmmakers (case in point, "The Messenger"), the only good thing she can do in her films is get naked, (and even then she's about as exciting as a pencil with boobs) and once again...she can't act. I tried counting the amount of facial expressions she had in this film, but could at best get two: prissy and super prissy. Dead body found? Prissy look. Zombies attack? Prissy look. Butter spread on toast? Prissy look. The only purpose she serves here is to be the cute body standing around while helpful characters do meaningful things.<br /><br />Actually, many of the characters are rather useless. The Red Queen tells them that one tiny scratch will turn you into a zombie...but after the female trooper is bitten practically ten times, NO ONE seems to think, "Hey, she's gonna turn into a zombie!" or shows any worry over it.<br /><br />I've only ever heard one good thing about this movie: the gore and death scenes are cool. I have yet to discover why a fantastic film like "Saving Private Ryan" gets poo-pooed for its violence, yet atrocious horror films are praised for the amount of splatter they show. You might argue violence is more necessary in horror films than war movies. People - getting shot by a .50 caliber bullet is by defination NOT a pretty thing. Neither is getting decapitated by an elevator, mind you, but I'm not going to spend two hours watching a demo of make-up affects. If I want to do that, I'll watch a low-budget Japanese horror film.<br /><br />Incidentally, try to guess what the main monster (the big one the characters have to destroy at the end) is. Give up? You guessed the Tyrant right? Wrong. The Licker. Yes, you got that right. A monster you kill in the first five minutes of "Resident Evil 2," and with two shots from a shotgun. Say what you want about the Super Mario Bros movie, at least the main villain wasn't a Koopa Troopa. It's also the ONLY biological monster in the whole film, aside from the zombie dogs in another scene. The film just didn't live up to its monster potential - I remember seeing a scene with flooded water and expecting the zombie sharks from the first game, but was left with nothing. The film just doesn't live up to the game's standards for cool enemies.<br /><br />Don't watch it if you're a Resident Evil fan - the script plays out like someone read the back of a Resident Evil video game box and made a story from that. Don't watch it if you're into horror films, it's not scary and it's got horrible acting and a script that shouldn't have survived pre-production. In fact, just don't watch it at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure what to expect when "Resident Evil" fired up, so my pre-conceived notions were minimal.  I've never played the game, and thus have no bias from that viewpoint.  To summarize the movie:  Another movie where a lot of people die and then come back to life, running around and attempting to eat everyone in sight.  How many times have we seen this plot?<p>Even though the plot is a retread that we've seen more times than we can count, there are a few nifty differences.  I loved the underground train.  I know.  What is the difference between the underground train and any subway?  In this case, it's the fact that it is under a house, leading to a top secret facility.  Furthermore, the train plays an important part in the end of the movie that has some top-notch special effects.  Some of the best special effects in the movie, in fact.<p>The hive was an interesting concept that the director spent just enough time on to provide a background for the plot, without spending so much time on it that you felt like it was time to go make popcorn.  I also liked the concept that Milla Jovovich and her male partner lost their memory and regained it throughout the movie.  However, the transition from memory loss to memory gain felt a bit jerky, and wasn't covered well by the pseudo-cool flashback sequences that weren't all that well done.  The best special effect was a super cutting laser effect that plays in a couple of deaths.<p>After these cool things, the movie is basically a bunch of people running around in zombie makeup trying to kill and eat the people still living.  There were places where the director tried to infuse a modern look into the movie by the way certain shots were set up and by laying a metal rock sound track to make everything seem more impressive than it really was.  Lastly was a heavy coating of blood on everything, as though that is sufficient to cover the spots where the creativity weakened.<p>I am glad I watched the movie, which will likely be the only time I ever watch it.  Not a terrible movie, but not terribly good either.  If you are relatively new to the zombie genre, you might find this movie interesting.  If you've seen very many of this movie's predecessors, such as "The Night of the Living Dead", "Dawn of the Dead", and the numerous imitators, then this movie will be same old, same old.  Unless you are a hard-core Resident Evil video game fan, or just love a gore-fest no matter how thin the plot behind it, then perhaps this is the movie for you.  All others, rent first, buy later.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Resident Evil (Paul W. S. Anderson, 2002)<p><p>No, Paul W. S. Anderson is no relation to Paul Thomas Anderson (of Magnolia fame). Anyone who's seen Resident Evil probably knows that without having to be told. But I get the feeling that even Paul Thomas Anderson fans will get at least a guilty kick out of this movie. Hey, you've got beautiful women, hard-case police officers, loud music, a psychotic computer, and a bunch of zombies. What more could you possibly ask?<p><p>Paul W. S. Anderson, responsible for bringing us the fun little flick Event Horizon five years ago, turns his attention to videogames here. He opens with a scene right out of The Stand; a bacteriological contagion races through an office building, while the computer that runs the building, fearing the contagion getting out, seals it off, killing everyone inside. Cut to Alice (Milla Jovovich, last seen by Americans crossing swords with Dustin Hoffman in The Messenger), naked, passed out, and in the shower. ...She, along with a number of other law enforcement types, head into the Hive to find out what went wrong. Complications, as they say...<p><p>Those who have played the video game series (I've only played a demo of the second game) will find lots of little homages within the film, at least according to the trivia section of IMDB; so will fans of George Romero films (both Dawn and Day of the Dead are well-represented with visual cues and the like; Romero was originally slated to direct this film) and Alice in Wonderland (Alice is fighting a computer called The Red Queen... In fact, some folks will have enough fun with the movie playing spot-the-reference that they won't really have to have much else for the film to be worth the admission price. For the rest of us, there's more than enough action (almost nonstop after the team has been in the Hive for about ten minutes), decent acting from a cadre of rising B-list actors (along with Jovovich, we have Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, and a number of easily-recognizable others), more jump-out-of-your-seat moments than in any so-called horror film from the last decade, and, well, zombies. How bad can a film be if it's got zombies?... Add in a Marilyn Manson-scored soundtrack, shake, chill, and serve.<p><p>Loads of fun. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>When a Dangerous Virus that got Broken in a Giant Corporation and turning the Virus loose and it has Scaped in a Secret Facility, which is called-The Hive.

Romero was the Writer and Director for this Movie but he left from Creative Differences (Although Anderson does some Tribute to Romero in this Flick). This Movie plays like it's Dawn of the Dead meets Aliens, which surprisingly works well but It's does have Some Weakness and also has some unintentional laughs coming from the Dialogue. Anderson brings a stylish Edge to the Film and Even when the Zombies are Scary. Jovovich looks good in this Flick, also Michelle Rodriguez and Eric Mabius gives Good Performances. The ending isn't great but it's a set-up for a Sequel. Resident Evil wasn't a Huge Hit in Theaters, since there's a sequel in the works. We will see, if that second part of the film-would be better than the first film. Director:Paul W.S. Anderson pulls this off well. Don't miss, this Underrated flick. DVD's has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an commentary track by Director-Anderson, Producer-Bolt and Actors-Jovovich and Rodriguez and a few nice extras. Rumor that Anderson is working a 2-Disc Collector's Edition on the film-Including his original NC-17 Cut before he recut it for an R and it seems to have a different ending also. Grade:B+.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>Ravenous zombies - what more could you ask for on Halloween?  RESIDENT EVIL is chock full of monsters, blood, gore, and actually cool, creative decapitations.  Based on a popular computer game (which I have never played), RESIDENT EVIL is an entertaining monster flick for a cozy evening at home.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL opens with a bang:  something has gone seriously wrong in a secret, underground research facility.  (Isn't that always the case?)  Red Queen, the computer that runs the complex, has gone mad, killing everyone in the place, and initiating a complete lock-down of the facility.  The only people on the outside who might know what is going on have no memory.  A crack military team is sent in to determine what happened.  But things go horribly wrong...<br /><br />As zombie movies go, RESIDENT EVIL is pretty fun.  It launches the viewer on a wild ride, rarely pausing for breath.  The special effects are pretty well done, and as stated earlier, there are some pretty original decapitations using lasers.  The plot is pretty loose and full of holes, but I really didn't care; I was having too much fun.  The acting is typical for a monster flick, but then again, you don't watch a monster movie for the acting.<br /><br />If you enjoy this sort of thing, you will really like RESIDENT EVIL.  My husband and I did, and it was just the thing for Halloween.  But seriously, couldn't the Umbrella Corporation, who owns the research facility, see this coming?  I mean, they named their master computer Red Queen.  It was in the cards.  Eventually, the Red Queen was obviously going to say "Off with their heads!"</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>What might have been: Opening scene a helicopter flies over the forrest on the north western side of Raccon City, STARS Bravo team, lead by Albert Wesker are are investigating the disapearance of the Alpha team, when they land they are attacked by zombie dogs and chased into a mansion where they uncover the house is full of zombies and all kinds of different monsters. The original game (currently being remade for Nintendo GameCube) had the perfect premise for a scary movie, it had the atmosphere, the monsters, the suprises and everything that kept a person on thier toes, all things which the movie that was made a s a prequel did not have. WHat did this movie have that was good? Michelle Rodrigiez is very good looking... aside from that... There were some great makeup effects, but the one non-zombie monster that appeared was the licker, which looked terribly CGI. Over all the special effects were unimpressive, they held back way to much with the gore, and there was far more eye roller moments than scares. This is what we call a hack fest flick, except there wasn't a lot of hacking... so there wasn't a lot going on here that would make it a good horror flick. The problem with a lot of game based movies is that the movies don't follow the games closely enough, that's why only Mortal Kombat has succedded to be a good movie so far, but Mortal Kombat Annihilation strayed too far from the original plot of MK 2 and failed miserably because of it. The same can be said of all of the other game based movies. Many of them have been moderate successes, but we gamers go to see these hoping for a movie that will be true to the games, not be related by name only. Resident Evil Rebirth for GameCube will be time much better spent than watching this movie. The movie has a lot of guns, and a lot of zombies grabbing at people, and neither are enough to call it a Resident Evil movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced) can bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process. Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.<p>With Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me. <p>The characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character. <p>Video games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.<p>The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clich&eacute;d Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>This BD has great video and audio quality. The story is just, ok. Seems the story has been done before, govt experiments unleash a killer virus, kills then brings you back to life, this time we dont stop it. This movie I think is the best of the first three.</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>This is the kind of shlock SF/action thing that, regardless of reviews or how bad the ads look, I nearly always have a gut desire to see - and which all too often disappoints.  Having gone into this one 8 years after its release, having studiously avoided it and its sequels and knowing almost nothing about the plot or the game it was based on, I have to say that I was somewhat pleasantly surprised, at least at first.  No, it's not a great film or even a particularly good one, but in the hands of a director who is even remotely competent or interesting, this could have been a solid entry into the action/horror/sc-fi arena.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the director we have here is Paul W.S. Anderson, who has managed not only to have a fairly productive and lucrative career but also to marry the fabulous Milla Jovovich, his leading lady in this film and the sequels.  The only other PWSA film I've seen is ALIEN VS PREDATOR, and this is certainly a notch above that film, but it still shows plenty of examples of poor editing and narrative construction, dull and ugly action scenes - excepting a couple where Milla gets to kick butt on her own - and fairly obvious and trite horror movie clich&eacute;s in abundance.<br /><br />What's good about the film is mostly Milla, who I wouldn't say gives a terrific performance exactly, but who does exude a presence, show some nice physical grace and power, and communicate reasonably well the character of a woman just starting to come out of memory loss - and to realize just how much the mega-corporation that she and nearly everybody else works for has betrayed them all.  She is Alice, apparently a former security professional for the Umbrella Corporation, and she has seemingly lost her memory as a result of some kind of nerve gas.  She awakens in a fancy mansion that turns out to be a secret portal to the underground Hive, a supercomputer that runs nearby Raccoon City and is a breeding ground for all kinds of unorthodox experiments.  Alice has to accompany - and eventually lead - a team of commandos into the Hive to see what's gone wrong with it, and along the way they encounter those most boring (to me) of currently popular horror icons, zombies.  Somehow an anti-aging virus developed in the Hive has this unpleasant zombifying side-effect, and the Hive has killed off all of the scientiests within.  Except, of course, that you can't really kill a zombie.<br /><br />Like I said, there are some good action scenes with Milla, and there's also a nice sense of claustrophobia at times - it seems like the Hive might go on forever - but on the whole this wasn't any better than "OK" for me, and it sure wasn't helped by the dreadful bang-your-head-against-the-wall music by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson.  I guess it's what the kids like.  But to be fair, this probably does feel a lot like the videogame - lots of action and blood, paper-thin story and virtually zero in the way of characterizations.  Well, being a hardcore fantasy and SF viewer, I've certainly seen plenty of worse stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/AYSIGFYKISNHB.html">AYSIGFYKISNHB</a><br/><p>Since I am a fan of the game, I see all the many flaws in this fake version of a film pretending to be Resident Evil. When I heard that Anderson was writing and directing this film, I thought it could be close to the game since he did a good job directing Mortal Kombat, and did a good job writing Shopping. But when I heard that none of the charcters or much of the game's elements are not in this film, I knew trouble was ahead.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich playes Alice, an employee of Umbrella Corp. who doesn't remember anything after being exposed to knockout gas. She goes with soldiers to the hive that's under the mansion. When they get there, all the workers in the hive are dead. While trying to turn off the Red Queen, the dead workers become undead because of the T-Virus that gets loose in the hive.<br /><br />The characters in this film are dull and boring. Rain (Rodriquez) and J.D. (Aleardi) are nothing more than a Vasquez and Drake ripoff from Aliens. The gore is so PG-13,this film is onlt "R" for language and the little nudity.<br /><br />This film was the beginning of Anderson being a liar. He lied about a much gorier version coming on DVD. No version of that came out. However, he did told the truth in Fangoria issue #211 about the script of this film is just a homage to the game he wrote before he got the job. That would explain why it's really nothing like the game.<br /><br />Another lie from him is that he says it's based before the mansion situation in the original game. Well, if that's true, where's Rebecca, Forest, Kenneth and a few other that were in that mansion before S.T.A.R.S. arrived?<br /><br />Resident Evil does have good visuals, some good scenes, and a very cool score by Marilyn Manson. This film doesn't bore, doesn't make you go to sleep, doesn't make you look at your watch, but it's not a Resident Evil film. All we're watching is the script Anderson wrote that was turned into Resident Evil. He should've just released the film like that.</p></br><a href="../users/AAI57M3OXP5NK.html">AAI57M3OXP5NK</a><br/><p>This is a fun movie to watch if you're not the Resident Evil fan but if you are you probably think different.  I enjoyed the movie but the problem with this movie is I have a hard time remembering it.  It was pretty forgettable because the storyline was pretty thin.  The actors gave pretty good performances.  If you haven't seen the movie, I would rent it first and then buy it because it is violent and thin storylined.  This is not for children.  All in all this was a good movie but if you are a Resident Evil fan you may not like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>Based on a computer game, Resident Evil actually looks like a computer game:  the characters run around in a maze-like environment, shooting zombies and mutants while a standard video game soundtrack hums in the background.  There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there.  Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings.<br /><br />With more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.  The action is passable but nothing special; essentially, anything this movie does, some other movie has already done better.  On the other hand, there is nothing truly bad in this movie: it merely lacks anything good.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>This director really has only one good movie - "Event Horizon" - and everything else is just plain bad, Resident Evil being absolutely no exception to this general rule of thumb and God help "Aliens Vs Predator" with the way things are shaping up.<p>This film is marginally better than Ghosts of Mars, but only because Milla Jovovich goes around the place in a really very short mini-skirt and just happens to get skin sticking wet clothes towards the end of the picture. Overall the movie has extremely low production values and even lower prospects in the execution of the film. All of the sets looked contrived, i.e - they have no point being there other than to match scenes in the computer game or look interesting. Oh, yeah did we mention that this is based on a computer game? No, okay lets back up a bit here... Resident Evil just happens to be a really popular 3rd person zombie shoot 'em up horror survival game that they are now selling as a movie. Okay, let's move on...<p>When the actors in this film are more robotic than the characters in the game then you know something has gone seriously wrong... and it has. Nobody in the cast is mildly recognizable except for Milla Jovovich, and they shouldn't be either, because they all suck real bad. The camera work is some of the worse seen in a long time. Why? Because it attracts attention itself almost all of time. Bad cinematography. For 35mm it looks like it was shot on video. The lighting is pretty good whenever it turns on or off but when it is static it is just useless. The editing is extremely bad at times and cuts fail to match. From an atheistic standpoint its all terrible production values for a Hollywood budget. The CGI also happens to be extremely, EXTREMELY, dodgy most of the times. You know when the animation looks like animation? Well x 100 times worse is what you get here. It looks terribly fake, and even the dogs covered in RED PAINT look very cheesy. Overall this is a really really really very bad production. The story is worse and even some of the.......<p>Bah.<p>Forget about me writing anymore. Not worth it. Just go play the game instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I haven't played the game version, but I'm certainly hooked on this action/horror/sci-fiction story that moves along at a great pace. When experiments by the Umbrella Corporation result in an out of control, mutating T-virus, Raccoon City suffers the consequences. Alice is a highly trained super-chick who fights Zombies as she tries to get the secret to the surface of 'The Hive' to warn the innocent people. A mad scientist has more sinister plans for Alice and her fighting skills, not to mention the computer run 'Red Queen' who doesn't want to risk letting anyone out and taking a chance on spreading the virus. Of course, it's already too late for many of the living.  Can't wait to view the next in this series!<br /><br />Chrissy K.

Can't wait for the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>Twenty years ago, a movie like "Resident Evil" would have been considered a horror masterpiece, heralded for its social commentary on the evils of the advancement of mankind, and praised for its stunning array of action sequences and make-up and special effects. Here, in the age of movies like last's year's "Thirteen Ghosts" and countless other entries into the horror genre, it's a big, obnoxious, at times baffling effects show fueled by incoherence and banality. <p>The film is derived from a popular video game franchise, which would explain why the plot feels jumbled, or why its characters feel flaccid and empty. It begins with an introduction that is aggravating in its choice of leaving too much in the dark to be explained later in a less-than-admirable manner. The world is dominated by major corporations, many of which deal in such things as genetic and viral testing and experimentation. In a series of chain reactions, an underground laboratory known as the Hive is contaminated by a viral strand, after which its computer, referred to as the Red Queen, begins the containment process, locking its hundreds of employees within the complex, and extinguishing them. <p>Enter Milla Jovovich (character names matter not in such a film), who awakens after a fall in the shower to find a mysterious scar on her shoulder, a strange note left in her bedroom, and a dresser drawer that holds a full arsenal of weaponry. Equally unsettling is the storming of her elite home, where she, along with Eric Mabius, is taken into an underground cavern through a hidden door in her home, and transported by rail to the Hive. This sequence, as well as those to come, is poorly shot, with the use of flashy cinematography and quick-cuts; it matters little, though, because to see it clearly would not be to like it more. <p>The underground setting itself is another slap in the face, being everything you'd expect from a movie such as this: endless hallways of steel, an abundance of fluorescent lighting, and a sense of claustrophobia that goes unnoticed in director Paul Anderson's eyes. Joining Jovovich and Mabius is a team of gun-toting security guards led by Michelle Rodriguez. The objective of their mission centers on the Red Queen, whom they must reboot in order to regain access to the Hive's many chambers, presumably to find some answers to the lockdown. <p>The real evil that resides here is the story's desperation to try and provide coherent solutions to its mysteries. Once things start going awry after the opened doors release the many undead facility workers, victims of the viral strand, the story descends further into camp territory, recalling plot twists and surprises from previous horror and science fiction films, some better, some of the same caliber. <p>... The overall film boasts a loud, aggressive soundtrack replete with heavy bass and ear-splitting treble, becoming aggravating and obnoxious without ever attaining our interest. There are innumerable amounts of quick jolts, in which undead zombies jump onto screen to a beat of the music; the abundance of such tactics quickly grows tiresome and redundant. The antagonists themselves, from the sleep-walking zombies and inside-out Dobermans, to the clich&eacute;-riddled monster that can change form and attain the strength of its victims, do nothing to raise the fear factor, providing more laughs than scares. <p>On those grounds, "Resident Evil" is little more than another horror entry riddled with familiarity and incoherence, banal characters and lousy plotting, that feels less like a movie and more like disjointed cinematic interludes that appear during the course of a video game.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>I'm not really a fan of the comic book or video game based movies, however, "Resident Evil" is one thrilling movie.  The story line is well put together and original for the most part (ok, so there are zombies, past that though...)<br /><br />The sequel to "Resident Evil" I think makes this movie even better and you should definately watch both, in order.  While Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigues might be type-cast, they certainly deliever when it counts.<br /><br />Those who play and know the video game I'm sure will like the movie even more then the uniniated such as myself, but do not let that stop you from see this surprisingly good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>But I doubt it was a plot that someone like me was supposed was to understand in the first place! :) If I'd understood the plot a little better, I'd definitely be giving this four stars - the way it stands at the moment, it's borderline four stars. I think the plot was just a little too complicated for me!<br /><br />I've never played the game, although I've watched it being played, so I recognised a few of the places, and got other places pointed out which were in relation to places in the game. I wasn't sure what it was about beforehand, but I loved the zombies! Of course people are going to draw comparisons with the original and remake of Dawn of the Dead, and Shaun of the Dead, as they feature heavily on the walking dead, but in this, there's new, inventive and very gory ways of killing people and the walking dead. Once again, the word zombie is never used in this movie, much like the other 'zombie' based movies. Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero was originally attached to write and direct, but left the project in 1999 due to creative differences over the script. The project was dormant for over a year before Paul W.S. Anderson signed on to write and direct the movie. This film was originally titled "Resident Evil: Ground Zero," but the title was changed to just "Resident Evil" after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the USA.<br /><br />And for the guys - Milla Jovovich gets naked! Which I got told about before the movie started. Do you see me caring?! It's also weird, because her character, Alice, never has her name spoken, written or identified until the end credits.<br /><br />The scene with the lasers is definitely a scene you need to watch out for. It's so weird to watch, as you think they're OK, and then the bodies split apart in all kinds of ways! Ugh!<br /><br />For some reason, I thought Mira Sorvino was in this, and had no idea who Michelle Rodriguez is, apart from the fact she scowls a lot. One of her lines is very funny, where she says she's going to get laid once this is over.<br /><br />A newspaper in Racoon City reads 'The Dead Walk!' This is a direct reference to Day of the Dead, in which a newspaper at the beginning of the film reads the same.<br /><br />I don't really know much about the director Paul W.S. Anderson, apart from this wasn't his first movie based on a video game - the first was Mortal Kombat. I know some people don't particularly like him, or his work, but I really liked his movie. I don't really pay much attention to how the movie is directed.<br /><br />There's quite a few connections to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. These are: main character's name is Alice (an easy one to start with); computer is named 'Red Queen'; 'The Red Queen' needs to kill someone who is infected, so she tries to get someone else to chop off their head. (Off with her head!); Alice in Wonderland paperweight; a white rabbit was used to test the T-virus; to enter the hive they go through a mirrored door (through the looking glass); and the Red Queen also succeeds in cutting off "her" head - the medic in the laser hallway.<br /><br />With a soundtrack done by Marilyn Manson, you kinda know what you're gonna get with the soundtrack for this, and it's surprisingly good!<br /><br />The extras include: alternate ending with director Paul Anderson's video introduction; clip compilation: Resident Evil: Apocalypse; commentary by cast & filmmakers; visual effects commentary; costumes featurette; featurette: Playing Dead: Resident Evil From Game to Screen; scoring Resident Evil; set design featurette; storyboarding Resident Evil featurette; and 6 exclusive featurettes: The Creature, The Elevator, The Laker, The Trainm Zombie Dogs and Zombies.<br /><br />This is a surprisingly good movie, and if you're unsure, I would definitely give it a chance. It's worthwhile. And if you're a guy, you'll probably be drooling over Milla.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>I've read many of the reviews here at amazon.com.  I find it interesting how what is considered "a minor film" has brought on so many "Love it"/"Hate it" opinions.  I (a non-gamer) fall in the "Love it" group.  I've read criticisms of the beginning of the film and how it is hard to follow.  It seamed quite apparent (to me) that you were supposed to be confused in the beginning so you could identify with the main character that has lost her memory.  I thought it actually brilliant how things become clearer to the viewer as the effects of the knockout gas wear off of Mila Jovovich's character.  I am also surprised that people can watch a video-game based film and have such high expectations.  I went into this thinking, "I sure hope there's a lot of special effects and good action".  I came out of viewing my rental thinking, "That was so much better than I expected, I must own this!!"  Heck, I thought "Mortal Kombat" was a passable video game adaptation; Full of action, had a story, fair acting.  I'm not sure what people expect when a film like this comes out.<br /><br />Here's my reasoning behind supporting this DVD;<br />-There is actually a story in this film and it requires your strict attention.<br />-Better than average acting for a film of this genre.<br />-Visually stunning.  Pay attention to how color (and the lack of) is used.<br />-So it has a metal soundtrack... what did you expect?<br />-Sound quality is very good.  "Whisper" in the vent is very subtle and creepy.<br />-I have never played the game.  This is the film, not the game.<br /><br />What to look for;<br />-Not much gore.  Some will find this disappointing.  I personally don't think it matters.  There is an ample supply of blood however.<br />-More tension and suspense than scares.  I think this film has a great emotional edge to it.<br />-Great character development.  You might care when they die.<br />-George Romero Zombie rules are in effect; Blow to the head, infect with bites or scratches, and eat the living.<br /><br />-Laser room is a great moment in horror film history.  If it does not freak you out, then I don't know what craziness you've witnessed.<br />-Plenty of good extras for the money.<br /><br />I personally looked at this as a film, without consideration to the video game.

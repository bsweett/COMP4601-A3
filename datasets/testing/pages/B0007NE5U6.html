That's what I wanted to ask when this one came out in theaters. Some movies are better if no sequels were made. This one obviously wanted to make more money when the script is really not as interesting and funny as the first one. Apparently, Renee Zellwegger got paid like twenty times more money for this film than the first. The hundreds of donuts, cheese cakes and pizzas she had to eat to gain the 30lbs really showed in this film. She's very "striking" in one scene when she wore a tight fitting gold colour evening gown. Talk about the waistline of BJ. Well, we got to give the American Texan the credit for the stunning transformation, and the British accent is still right on.<br /><br />So we know that she found the love of her life in BJ Diary. Colin Firth reprises the role of Mark Darcy, the future husband of BJ,since they have moved in together. Their relationship looks picture perfect at first, but jealousy and insecurity took over BJ's mind when she mistaken him for cheating with a tall and beautiful assistant. Bridget gets pregnant, and Darcy was very happy and decided to propose to her. Then Daniel(Hugh Grant) reappeared in BJ's life, and they spent some time together in a journalism partnership in Thailand. Bridget's life is at a chaotic state when she was mistaken by the customs for carrying drugs in her luggage, and who will bail her out before she faces possible imprisonment.....<br /><br />There's many attempts on jokes in this movie. They did Madonna's Like A Virgin and Material Girl in the prison scenes, but it didn't provoke much laughters like BJ did when she did All By Myself in the first film. Darcy and Daniel also get to have a man-to-man fight over BJ again, but we know Daniel is not the man for Bridget, because her heart belongs Darcy.<br /><br />Hugh Grant had limited screentime here, and didn't have much chemistry with Zellwegger. Colin Firth is good as a calm and sophisticated high class gentleman/lawyer(a true ladies man). As for Renee Zellwegger, she's tried her best at being funny, and touching while maintaining her British persona, but the role has lost it's zest compared to the first BJ. Hopefully we won't have to see her playing overweight and English again for a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Don't buy this movie, as you'll just regret wasting your money on a film that's not up to scratch as the original. Get it for your birthday, Christmas, or hint that you want it, but can't find it cheap enough, and some nice person will buy it for you.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from this movie, although I ended up watching it straight away, just to see what it was like. I already knew it wasn't going to be a patch on the original, and it was going to be totally different from the book. What I noticed was how different Bridget was from the movie. She was slightly attractive in the first movie, but in this, Renee had awful stylists etc. Her hair was a mess a lot of the time, and she had hamster cheeks. And what was equally distracting was the fact she was poured into really low cut tops a lot of the time. We all know that when Renee's not being Bridget she's ultra skinny, but in this she just wanted to flaunt her chest as much as possible! At least 50% of the world's population, if not more, have them dear, there's no need to shove them in our faces! And as for the lesbian kiss - what was the point in that, apart from the fact it was a cheap thrill for the guys? There was absolutely no need for it.<br /><br />So the film is very different from the book. Bearing in mind, I haven't read the book in a few years, so don't quote me on this. The Thai jail scene is a lot longer, and more tougher in the book. There's no Like A Virgin singalongs in that! And Bridget lost a lot of weight during her time in there (in the book), but she looked just the same when she came out. The first book was not-so-loosely based on Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice". The first movie left a lot of that in, and even included a lot of "inside jokes" for those of us who are familiar with the book and the filmed version starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy. "The Edge of Reason" was not-so-loosely based on another Jane Austen novel, "Persuasion," but any overt Austen references are completely wiped out here. Also, in the second book, Bridget had to interview the God in her life, Colin Firth. That would have been slightly difficult since Colin Firth is already in the movie playing of course Mark Darcy. I'm pretty sure this scene might be among the extras, but not included in the movie. Of course, they could have always done an Oceans 12, and had Colin Firth playing Mark Darcy playing Colin Firth. The mind boggles.<br /><br />Some of the movie is funny - the skiing scenes gave me flashbacks of my own skiing incidents (including dragging the instructor down the slope with me cos I was so scared), and yet again, the hair-pulling, and eye gouging between Colin Firth & Hugh Grant. But apart from that, there's nothing else that funny about the movie. It's watchable. It just doesn't have the same class as the original. At least with the second book, Helen Fielding attempted to move away from her original work, and have some fun with Bridget. This movie sticks closely to the first, with no surprises thrown in.<br /><br />Bridget's friends have a lesser part in this than the first, and they were hilarious in the first! There is also another 'friend' added who's never really introduced, but just hovering in the background.<br /><br />A lot of this movie is meant to be spent watching with a group of girlie friends, in your PJs, drinking wine, and having pillow fights. Why? Mainly because every other scene is backed by an overly loud soundtrack, featuring a lot of the songs that funnily enough on the soundtrack to the movie!!! Funnily enough, there is also a lot of drunken ballads to be sung at the top of your voice, like the "All By Myself" at the start of the first movie. Talk about over publicising the soundtrack to the movie! Also, there's a lot of product placement in this movie: Coca Cola, Vodaphone, BMI and probably more that I missed. It's very noticable product placement, not just subtle.<br /><br />The movie was better than I was expecting. But still not up to scratch. I really need to read the books again. And start keeping a diary - again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>What is a young woman supposed to do when she is torn between two lovers? That is the question posed by this movie, "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason". Renee Zellweger is back in the main role as Bridget Jones in this continuation of the original Bridget Jones from 2001. And this time around, she is forced to choose between her new lover, Mark, and her former lover, Daniel.<br /><br />This movie is the type that most will find agreeable enough to give it a chance, but it isn't as loaded with laughs as some viewers will hope. I found only a couple of scenes funny, and I started to wonder why the movie was billed as a romantic comedy. It is really more dramatic than humorous, and many of the attempts at humor are tired and worn out- the type of humor you hear over and over again in movies.<br /><br />I didn't care much for the storyline of this movie, mainly because it is so ordinary. How many times have we seen a movie like this- one that portrays a woman who is torn between two men, feels jealous about the new guy, but is still attracted in a strange way to the former lover, even though he has betrayed her trust in the past? It is the same old formula from Hollywood that we have grown to expect, but would like to see changed.<br /><br />I like the performances of the three main characters; Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant. They all bring a certain degree of charm to their respective roles and they all seem believable, although it is difficult to look at Hugh Grant as a bad guy. He just doesn't have a nasty- enough look to fulfill this role, even if his bad reputation is because of dishonesty in relationships.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent flick, and those who enjoyed the first Bridget Jones will probably like this one too. There isn't anything particularly memorable about it, but there is enough entertainment overall to make it worthy of seeing just once.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>Rene Zellweger packed on the pounds once again to play Bridget Jones in the sequel to her successful run in the first movie.  WHile three years passed in real life until the second movie was made, it has only been a few weeks since Bridget found her happiness with Mark Darcy.  She is happy as can be, with her winner of a boyfriend, and enjoying an all around happy streak in life.  Soon, however, she is on shakey ground.<br /><br />She fears that Mark is turning his affections towards the new hot number in his law firm.  Her paranoia is rising, as she sees the other woman's bright smiles and her appearences at every outing she and Mark go on.  Out of the blue, Daniel Cleaver, the cad who played her, reappears in her newly aquired field of television reporting.  Convinced that Mark is cheating, Bridget goes on an ill advised and irrational trip to Thailand with Daniel Cleaver for business which will inevitably turn into pleasure.<br /><br />It wasn't as good as the first one, as there were no big surprises.  Daniel will inevitably cheat on her and be caught like in the first one.  Bridget will end up in some terrible mess again (getting thrown in the Thai jail - and notice how all the cellmates speak English marginally well?).  And Mark will come to her rescue once more and bail her out.  Still, it was a good time, with Bridget's bumbling antics.  SHe can laugh at herself, as we can all laugh at ourselves.  And if you can't laugh at yourself, than you're even stupider than others think we are.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>As in the first film, Bridget Jones (Rene Zellweger) embarrasses herself again and again.  We're supposed to root for her because she's the underdog, but in the universe of these films she's been blessed with cuteness beyond words, a devoted boyfriend (Colin Firth) who forgives everything (despite an endless string of contrived misunderstandings), and a trio of single eunuchs (Sally Phillips, James Callis, and Shirley Henderson) whose sole reason for existence seems to be cheering and supporting Bridget.  In addition, pop songs swirl around her whenever she's feeling sad and pensive.  Given all that, I wouldn't mind trading places with Bridget.<br /><br />The gifted cast isn't up to the task of saving this one.  It generates an occassional smile but also some genuine grimaces, such as during an embarrasing (for the filmmakers as well as Bridget) sequence in which she is incarcerated in a Thai prison.  Naturally, the downtrodden Thai prostitutes are charmed by the chubby British white girl, hang on her every word, and enthusiastically participate in her impromptu performance of a Madonna song./</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>I really was worried how well I would like the second movie of this plot. I really enjoyed the first one and wanted to enjoy this one as well. It took me awhile but I decided while at the movie place to get the film and I must say I was relieved that this film was just as witty and interesting as the first one. Bridget is a cool character that you just have to watch and she doesn't fail on the second story on her. It's a romance comedy in all its glory and even though I usually find romance comedies silly and overdone at times I find both Bridget Jones great and original.<br /><br />I love the little quiz they give throughout the film as well that makes the movie fun- and that is what this movie is fun and just a film you watch with your friends or when you just need to lift your spirits.<br /><br />PS- Daniel and Mark fight again- don't miss it it's hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>Last time we saw her, Bridget Jones (Zellweger) was in love with Mark Darcy (Firth) and they were staying together for the movie's happy ending. Now, we find them again only a few weeks later, exactly one year after they first met in the buffet organized by Bridget's mother. And guess what, they are there again; another year, another buffet, another diary. This is how we jump into the sequel, and as usually happens, it is not as good as the original; but it still provides us with a fun time.<br /><br />Bridget is working in "Sit Up Britain" and is continuously finding herself in ridiculous situations, which do not portray her in a very flattering light, but boosts rating. As happened in the previous movie, we get to listen to her comments on the events that she is going through; comments that are usually pretty funny, but sometimes turn out to be a bit corny.<br /><br />You probably are asking yourself by now, what about Daniel (Grant)? Well, he has a TV show in the same network as Bridget, and even though she does not even want to hear about him anymore, their paths cross when they have to work together on one of the shows. And this happens right when she is thinking about marriage with Mark, but the encounter situation things a bit. And the fact that Mark is working with a very attractive woman does not help in the least.<br /><br />The movie keeps the main characteristics of the winning formula used for the first one, and yes...you will get to see another fight between Daniel and Mark, so do not worry. But some things are funnier the first time around, and that is true in this case too. The creators did add a little variety though, with a little travel that allows for a change of settings, but it is still not enough to compensate for the repeated humor.<br /><br />The cast does a very good job, especially Zellweger, who is perfect for the role and shows a clear ability for portraying a character that constantly makes a fool of herself. The soundtrack is eclectic and fits the movie well, including songs ranging from Barry White to Madonna. Finally, I need to comment on the option of watching the movie with the quiz option, since it is an annoying feature that keeps stopping the film to ask the questions. And on top of that, it has such silly options as answers that my wife decided to quit it and stick with the "normal" version of the movie. - 3.5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>What I loved about the Bridget Jones books and the movie most was the fact that we got to see a heroine who was far from perfect in every possible aspect. She was someone women could relate to and perhaps laugh at her flightiness and in turn make the rest of us feel better that we are not in her shoes. However, watching the film version of Bridget Jones: The Edge or Reason was like watching a parody of the aforementioned anti-heroine. Almost every scene in the sequel centers on Bridget Jones going through humiliating moments that are too over the top at times. There were some poignant and sweet moments with Bridget and Mark Darcy, but they were few and far in between. The plot also seems bloated, like the editors tried to add as many elements of the book as possible in 110 minutes. And the solution regarding relationship interloper Rebecca is too contrived and simplified for my taste. Also, the elements of Jane Austen's Persuasion that were in the book are missing here.  What happened?  The first book had been inspired by Austen's Pride and Prejudice and said inspiration was also apparent in the movie.  This is yet another major flaw in this film. But despite the aforementioned things, the movie was indeed funny and entertaining and Renee Zellwegger (who gained more weight to do this film than she did in the first one) and gorgeous Colin Firth had great chemistry. Hugh Grant is always fun to watch whenever he plays a bad boy. Grant is more believable in the aforementioned roles than he is when he plays the boy next door type of characters he played in Notting Hill and Love Actually. All in all, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is not as good as the Helen Fielding novels or as good as the first movie and I'd advise you to rent the DVD before you buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>Bridget Jones Diary-The Edge of Reason is a hilarious romantic comedy starring a slightly plumper Renee Zellwegger as the British Brigette Jones. At the beginning of the film, Bridget is at work totally on cloud 9 after a fantastic shagadellic session with her boyfriend. The shag session was so fantastic that the next day at work she has a shag flashback and decides to call him at work to tell him how absolutely fab he looks in the buff. She then realizes that she has paid him this compliment on speaker phone. Bridget has one mishap after another and this comedy will keep you laughing. Fans of the first Bridget Jones movie won't be disappointed in this sequel that is just as funny. The comedy in the film is slapstick and it does get annoying at times to see Bridget repeatedly make a fool out of herself but fans of the underdog heroine will be pleased with this film. Will Bridget find true love with Mark Darcy? Or does Daniel Cleaver hold the key to her heart? Or will she find true love at all? You have to watch the movie to find out.<br /><br />The DVD itself has some pretty cool extras. You have the option to watch the film with the quiz on or off. The bonus features are separated into three sections-"Daniel's Hotel Room," "Bridget's Desk," and "Mark's Law Office." In Daniel's hotel room are the extras, "Fight" and "Who's Your Man Quiz?" "Fight" is commentary from cast members talking about the fight scene in the first movie and the sequel. "Who's Your Man Quiz?" is a fun interactive quiz. In Bridget's desk are the option to watch the feature film with director commentary and the option to watch deleted scenes with introductions. In the "Mark's Law Office" section is a featurette titled "Mark and Bridget Forever," and an interview titled, "Bridget Jones interviews Colin Firth." This is interesting because Renee Zellweger interviews Colin Firth in character. Colin is in street clothes and they are talking about "The real Colin Firth," not Mark Darcy. They talk about his filming "Pride and Prejudice," among other things. The final featurette is titled, "Lovely London." In this feature they discuss how computer generation is used in filming some of the exterior shots.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>The only reason there's a second BRIDGET JONES movie is because the first one turned out to be pretty good and made itself some money. That's the same reason there's a second BRIDGET JONES book, and there's nothing wrong with using that justification to make a movie.<br /><br />However, BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON departs from what made the first film so charming, instead concentrating on the goofball slapstick of Bridget, rather than her inherent "Everywoman" quality that made her so relatable.<br /><br />Lots of women know what it's like to be stood up for a date or to be lied to by a cad. Hardly any women or other members of the target audience for BRIDGET JONES know what it's like to be under arrest and held in a Thai women's prison. (I also doubt, in that situation, that most women would spend their time choreographing a Madonna number for fellow inmates.) Other women likely aren't going to accidentally end up skiing down a championship racing slope. Or skydive into a vat of pig slop. Or get into another of the groan-inducingly unrealistic situations that the makers of the film put Bridget in.<br /><br />The movie's not like the second novel, either, which has its own set of flaws. The second novel didn't even include the Daniel Cleaver character, but the movie had to find a way to include Hugh Grant - so they threw him in there.<br /><br />The problems of the romance between Darcy and Bridget, like in the book, could be solved if the two of them just sat down and had an open conversation. But, instead, we're treated to the situation - and the movie AND Renee Zellweger's wavering accent - just getting worse and worse.<br /><br />That said, the romance is interesting. Colin Firth is good. Renee Zellweger is good enough. And the movie makes London look awfully pretty.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this was an okay movie, it was a little better than the first, but it wasn't bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason is a great follow-up to the surprise box office hit, Bridget Jones's Diary. Only Renee Zellweger can play this role, she is wickedly fabulous as larger than life Bridget. Renee looks adorable all chubby and curvy, she is too thin in real life, I like her body in these movies. The second one is just as good as the first one. Bridget gets herself arrested and still has boyfriend trouble but this time with new beau, Mark played by Colin Firth. Hugh Grant returns to his role of Daniel Cleaver, he is even a bigger wanker in this one, I love to hate him. I love the scene where Bridget thinks she is pregnant ( funny dream sequence!). The Edge of Reason is a strong sequel, I have seen a lot of sequels and this one is pretty great.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the 2nd as much as the 1st!  Bridgett is a bit more annoyingly stupid, but the movie is cute, and there's even more of Colin Firth.... to which I say hip, hip, hooray!  What a fabulous actor.  His character is so totally different from Hugh Grant's that sometimes Mark Darcy can seem really boring and dull.  The love scenes with Hugh Grant & Renee Zellwegger were definitely much steamier than the airtime between Firth & Zellwegger.<br /><br />I don't know why this movie didn't do better at the box office.  Our only comments negatively, are that the star, Renee Zellwegger did not look as cute as she did in the first movie, and she is perhaps even chubbier and less attractive, and sillier and bubble-headed.  A very annoying character indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>Richard Curtis really has completely run out of ideas. This was apparent in Love Actually which just rehashed all the most popular scenes from his earlier movies and this Bridget Jones sequel is just a reheated version of the first movie. The plotlines are the same - Bridget torn between reserved, uptight, underpant folding lawyer boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and raffish Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who gets all the best lines and, as in the first movie, has far more sex appeal as a cocky, funny womaniser. Bridget obviously finds him irresistable but he keeps blowing his chances with her due his nymphomaniac sex life (in the first movie, his American fiancee got in the way, in this movie he is just about to close the deal when the Thai prostitute he ordered enters his hotel room, prompting the film's funniest line 'I'm up for it if you are' to the unimpressed Bridget). Apart from Hugh Grant the rest of the movie is just a padded out unrolling of the on off romance between Bridget and Mark. Even the actors come across uninspired by the script. Zellweger appears less kookily sparky than in the movie and Colin Firth looks as if he is bored and embarrased with his part (he has publicly admitted that he never wants to act in another Bridget Jones movie). Richard Curtis's material used to be original (when Four Weddings and a Funeral came out eleven years ago) but now his writing resembles a busker playing the same tired old tunes, keeping going only because the money keeps rolling in. Like all film genres, romantic comedies evolve. Curtis's conservative, trite, cliched offerings should make way for more creative, original productions.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>Although I only laughed a few times during this film, I found it to be rather interesting.  I love the plot twist at the end.  I was thinking something completely different (I won't say because it would ruin the movie for others) I say this is definitely worth a viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>I never had a sister, but Bridget Jones would be the one I wish I had even if only for the entertainment value.<br /><br />In BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON, our heroine (Renee Zellweger) is an on-air personality for a British telly that specializes in pseudo-journalism. In the first sequence of scenes, Bridget reports live as she parachutes from a plane into a pigpen's excremental bog. Consistent with this, her life is pretty much of a total disaster except for an ongoing affair with a high-powered amnesty lawyer, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), about whom she dreamily counts the days, hours and minutes of their relationship as well as the number of times they've &#34;shagged&#34;. The wildcards are Rebecca (Jacinda Barrett), Darcy's assistant, both elegant and gorgeous - attributes not to be associated with Jones - with whom Mark may also be dallying, and Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), an old boyfriend who still lusts after what's inside Bridget's &#34;giant panties&#34;.<br /><br />Bridget's engaging persona is established in BRIDGET JONES DIARY (2001). Though the original was perhaps a better film, neither it (nor this one) are the comedic fluff of which indelible cinematic memories are made. Therefore, by default and my failing memory, THE EDGE OF REASON must stand on its own merits. (Perhaps the two are best seen together when they're eventually released as a DVD set.) In any case, I've always had an objection to any appearance by Colin Firth, which always results in an on-screen character, in my opinion, totally devoid of charm or humor. Perhaps he reminds me to much of myself:&#62;) (Only in a 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE did this formula work for me.) Hugh Grant, here a charming rascal that could well be my alter ego, has only a subordinate role. Too bad.<br /><br />Bridget certainly has pluck, best depicted when, after being arrested in Bangkok for drug smuggling, she becomes the song coach and darling of a jail cell-full of Thai prostitutes . Ok, ok, that subplot was a bit of a stretch by the screenwriters, but it works for her. My biggest problem with Jones is that I can't see her in a romantic (or even prurient light), so her triangular relationship with Darcy and Cleaver remains, for me, unconvincing. It's a chemistry thing.<br /><br />I hope Zellwegger, at the risk of being typecast, consents to do another episode in the series. Despite my reservations and chemical imbalance, they're good fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>Renee Zellwegger, Hugh Grant and (especially) Colin Firth are three actors I'm willing to give any benefit of the doubt to, but "Edge of Reason" really tested my patience in that regard.  These three professionals try their collective best to breathe some life into this slight tale, but only marginally succeed.<br /><br />Blame the material - the original 'Bridget Jones' penned by Helen Fielding basically invented the chick-lit genre (or at least brought it to the collective consciousness of the UK/US public).  Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually) helped Fielding bring it to screen, as directed by close Fielding friend, Sharon Maguire.  'Edge of Reason' - the book - was shunned by most of the audience that flocked to the original.  It comes across as a stretch.  And what doesn't work in print definitely falls flat on the screen - a call girl-backed rendition of 'Like a Virgin' in a Thai jail (don't ask) for example did not succeed in elicting a single laugh from the audience.<br /><br />Too bad, because these three deserve better.  Hugh Grant was quoted recently as saying he was contemplating 'retiring' from film.  If so, it'll be a huge loss - this guy makes it look so effortless.<br /><br />One other point is how abysmally under-used some of the actors are - Jim Broadbent might be one of world's foremost character actors.  We get a couple of shots of him in a lavender tux.  He has maybe ten (at most) lines througout, none memorable.  A waste.<br /><br />And, amongst Bridget's support crew, we get Jude, played by Shirley Henderson.  Since the release of "B.J.'s Diary," Henderson has gone on to star in "Intermission"  and "Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself," both to critical acclaim.  Yet, she's completely part of the woodwork here.  Another lost opportunity.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Having seen trailers of both the Bridget Jones films in theaters (and being grateful at not having spent the theater price for this duo), renting the DVD was for one reason only: could these films be as bad as they appeared in trailer or was there really a reason they were successful?<br /><br />When a cast of the order including Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Hugh Grant,  Colin Firth, Renee Zellweger, and Jacinda Barrett, there must be a reason for this group to consent to participate in this mindless mess.  Money, I suppose, because there doesn't appear to be another reason.  The script is poor at best, the 'fat actress' concept and poor accent that besiege Renee Zellweger's attempt to create a credible comic character is ludicrous, and the obvious big budget/multi-location squandering of production costs is shameful.  Sad that there is an audience for this type of film.  Maybe others can be entertained by this escapist route, but the smarmy digs at characters embedded in lesbian or Thai prisoner roles etc are in poor taste and definitely not funny.<br /><br />Let's hope there are no plans for the further lack-of-adventures of this fatuous Bridget Jones idea.  Grady Harp, March 05</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>If there was a worse film released in 2004 than Bridget Jones Mark II then I'm glad I didn't see it.  After watching this execrable dross it dawned on me that I just wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life that I won't be getting back.<br /><br />Yet, perhaps it was just me?  Much of the audience did laugh from time to time at the often slap stick humour.  I just found it predictable and tired.<br /><br />The original film of 2001 was fresh and at sometimes amusing.  This sequel, however,  showed that you can only get so much out of the one idea.  Bridget Jones had morphed into an absurd caricature.  She even gets stuck in a Thai jail on a drugs charge!  What's more, the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu when her two suitors are involved in another fight is palpable.  It just wasn't funny!<br /><br />If you're even just thinking of seeing this film, don't waste your time!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I didn't care much for the first "Bridget Jones" movie, and the second one was just plain awful.  For the life of me, I cannot figure out what is supposed to be appealing about Renee Zellweger's character.  She's not a BAD person, but she's annoying and is a social disaster, and I don't understand how these two fabulous British guys (played by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant) could possibly be interested in her.<br /><br />The plot of "The Edge of Reason" also leaves a lot to be desired.  There really wasn't anything else to tell about Bridget Jones, but since the first film made so much money, they decided to make a second movie (regardless of the fact that it was so crappy) in hopes of making even MORE money.  Sadly, the plan worked, but I wasted two hours of my life in the movie theatre that I'll never get back.<br /><br />I really tried to like this movie.  I love Firth and Grant, but they weren't enough to save the film.  (Grant is only in the movie for a grand total of about ten minutes, too, so moviegoers who haven't read the book version will likely be disappointed.)  By the time the Thai prison scenes rolled around, I was thoroughly disgusted.  How could they have made this movie more ridiculous?!  I don't think they could have.<br /><br />The only "good" thing I can say about this movie is that it supposedly sticks pretty close to the plot of the book, but that should tell you something about the quality of that particular novel.  I haven't read it, but I'm guessing that it sucks.  Don't waste your time or money on this crappy, crappy movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Movies usually don't turn out better than the books they are based upon.  Movie sequels, unless part of a trilogy, rarely turn out better than the original movies. However, movie sequels based upon book sequels usually turn out better (see THE LOST WORLD for example). BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON isn't one of those cases. In fact, it's the exact oppositte. This movie is an example of what happens when you make a copy of a copy a couple of times over. The original film adaptation of BRIDGET JONES was a joy to watch and in many ways improved upon the original novel.  However, the book sequel was a disappointment and this movie sequel is a pure disaster. The film is one of the worst movies I have seen in a theatre in a long time and if it wasn't for the prescence of Colin Firth, it wouldn't be worth watching ever.<br /><br />The first film stayed fairly close to the novel. This movie doesn't. That's not necessarily bad, especially seeing that the novel's sequel is inferior to the original writing as well. However, the way the filmmakers chose to veer away from the novel's plot is just so wrong. From the commuted stay and sentence in Thailand with very little background information to the turning of Bridget's nemesis Rebecca into a lesbian out to seduce her and not Mark Darcy to the complete disappearance of certain important events, situations, and people (e.g. naked housekeeper's son, the party at the summer house, Wellington) the book rarely uses the original text as an outline. Like I mentioned before, that's not necessarily bad, but instead of straying away from the text to improve upon it, the book swerves completely away.<br /><br />Then of course there are all the extras that were added. Supposedly to make the script more interesting:  Bridget trying to buy a pregnancy test somewhere in, Austria I guess. Or how about the fistfight between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant--the only reason that scene is even in the movie is so the directors could have some excuse to have Colin Firth fall in a fountain of water again and get soaking wet so that the ladies of England would lick their lips. Scenes like these add nothing to the story whatsoever. Not only that, they aren't even funny; not in a typical American-type ha-ha-funny, not in the usual droll British guffaw type funny. The only people who would get a serious laugh out of those scenes are people who aren't going to be watching the movie (the REAL WORLD/MTV crowed will be watching things like AMERICAN PIE, not BRIDGET JONES) to begin with. So why even bother to putt them in as filler?<br /><br />Besides all that, there's also the actors' enthusiasm.  In the first movie, everyone seemed liked the must have really had a good time making the movie. In THE EDGE OF REASON, everyone but Colin Firth seems like they are just there to pick up a paycheck. Renee Zellweger is a very talented actress who is one of my favorites and one an Oscar nod for her first performance. In this movie, Zellweger appears as though all the weight gaining/loosing/gaining and other physical demands she has placed upon herself have gotten to her. Bridget no longer seems perky and adorable, but down and almost pathetic.  Colin Firth does the best job out of all the actors, but even he at times seems like he's just walking through the paces following the tape on the floor. It just goes to show, if you're going to copy a copy of a copy of a copy, change it up a little bit and make it more original. Originality can be a lifesaver because Colin Firth isn't always going to be around.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>I fell asleep about two-thirds into this sequel when there seemed to be nothing at all happening. Colin Firth is dull as dirt as the dashing boyfriend lawyer, while Renee Zellweger's main joke is her fattened up appearance. The problem is there is no chemistry at all between the two, so we don't believe for even a second that Mark Darcy "loves" her, as he professes. And ditto for Hugh Grant who does and says nothing amusing. I didn't laugh even slightly, not even once, during this way too long comedy. Time to put this yarn to bed for good...</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Bridget (Renee Zellweger) is back with Mark (Colin Firth) and Daniel (Hugh Grant) in tow: looking resplendent in a variety of wacky outfits, which only accentuate not hide her weight concerns.<br /><br />But some of the fun and gloss of the first installment is gone, however. Zellweger is still chipper and a blast as Bridget. It's just that the plot and everything surrounding her is just a bit off.<br /><br />Many scenes, in particular the Skiing sequence, reminds me of a similar one from a 1960's Doris Day movie: which is OK if it is done in the same light, snappy vein, but it isn't... it just falls flat. Humorless.<br /><br />One scene that does work is the fountain scene/fight between Darcy and Daniel. It's silly, awkward and dumb.... but very very funny.<br /><br />But to tell the truth, what we all want to see anyway is some kind of resolution to the Bridget-Darcy-Daniel triangle. Am I right? And we get one...finally. But like life it takes awhile to get there.<br /><br />"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason" is humorous and sometimes even downright funny. But with all the talent involved here, this last of the Bridget Jones movies should of at least been all the things that the first one was: warm, emotional, caring and hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Did this movie really need to be made? The first movie was fresh, funny and cute.  The sequel however, is annoying, not funny and lacks charm.  No longer is Bridget funny and charming, she is just an embarrassment to watch.<br /><br />The sequel starts out ok, but quickly relies on subplot after subplot to keep the viewer interested.  This actually made the film rather annoying as you constantly had to focus on yet another storyline happening.  Perhaps the director could tell the film wasn't working and wrote in more subplots.<br /><br />To me, the main problem with the film is that Bridget is no longer funny. You can only stretch the fat jokes so far. Also, the scene where she stormed into Darcy's chambers with a wet dress and hair was just too far fetched and not credible.  It was supposed to be funny, but ended up being a poor attempt by the Director to make us believe that a man of Darcy's calibre would be interested in a woman who storms in when he is in a meeting with his colleagues.  A similar scene occurs in the first ten minutes of the film.<br /><br />Hugh Grant's brief appearance in the film was an attempt to recapture the magic of the first. It failed. He was annoying in this film because he didn't fit in this time around.<br /><br />Overall, 2004's most eagerly awaited film turned out to be 2004's most disappointing film.  Please, do not make a third installment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>After reading the reviews online I was a little hestitant about seeing the movie afterall, it's common sense that the sequel to any good movie never really turns out the way you want it too... but, in this case I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is what fans of Bridget have waited for-<br /><br />What happens after happily ever after we all wonder when we see the end to any movie and in this one we get the chance to see a piece of what becomes between the buff Bridget and her "perfect" boyfriend Mark-- who folds his underwear before he goes to sleep. In this reality strikes their relationship as Bridget and Mark deal with snobby/single friends, lesbian kisses, Thai prisons, break-ups, family, weekends spent away together, and work-- also a beautiful young secretary with long legs who happens to work with Mark. Of course, as in any squel there is a comeback by Daniel Cleaver who everywhere Bridget turns manages to see his face as he has just landed himself his own television show and is the same as ever-- and still going after Bridget. Can Bridget and Mark manage to survie??? Well I think we all know the answer to that.<br /><br />Colin Firth is more charming in this as Mark Darcy than he was in the first and of course, Renee does a wonderful job as the buff Brit who never seems to get anything right. Hugh Grant is davishly evil and once again you see that wonderful on-screen rivalry between Hugh and Firth.<br /><br />This was the film I have been waiting for after seeing the words "the beginning" in Bridget Jone's Diary... and I loved seeing Bridg and Mark together. I found myself swooning after Mark who likes Bridget-- "likes her just the way she is"--wobbly bits included... what girl dosn't want a man like Mark? And Bridget maintains to be the symbol of all woman- slightly overweight and wanting wedding bells to dong.<br /><br />This is a movie for fans and a must see for any Colin Firth or Hugh Grant fan. All in all rent this one or do what I'm doing and buy this one!</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Tours of duty in "Chicago" and "Cold Mountain" have moved Renee Zellweger past the Bridget Jones character, and it shows on her moony, perturbed face in "The Edge of Reason." It's a sequel of absurd slapstick - in contrast to the mannered comedy of the original "Diary,"  -  and sitcom trappings need jolts of inspired whimsy. But Hugh Grant drops by for a only cup of coffee and Colin Firth, as the constipated Marc Darcy, wraps himself in even more discomfort than he did in "Diary."<br /><br />That leaves Zellweger, who grinned and cried and stuffed herself into max support bras with zeal her first go round, earning nominations and perverse recognition for size swapping. Now, it's paycheck time, and little more, and no wonder Zellweger shed her chunky monkey physique so quickly post-production: She plays one miserable character. This is not the Jones you'd want to know.<br /><br />Director Beeban Kidron has designed "Edge of Reason" to make Bridget not a heroine but a lightning rod of unappealing, embarrassing sequences - in a pig slop, at Marc's lawyer ball, on the ski slopes, in, yes, a Thai prison (where the girls shrug off their communal, disease-ridden existence for an impromptu rendition of Madonna's "Like A Virgin.")<br /><br />What was it again that was so special about Ms. Jones? Is staring at someone as they sleep really that endearing a trait? How about suffering three increasingly annoying, meddling friends? Kidron seems to have forgotten Bridget's plucky cuteness - there isn't one scene in "Edge of Reason" where Zellweger is allowed to look, well, attractive for very long without being drenched or slopped or having her hair ruined.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Rene Zellweger was nominated for the Oscar for the first Bridget Jones' Diary film in 2001.  She was also nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance in this sequel.  Beeban Kidron whose Hollywood directorial debut was for "Used People" in 1992 and also had a moderate hit with "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar," takes the slapstick and pratfalls to the next level in her work on this film.  The pacing on the film is brisk and keeps us riveted to the fine actors' performances.  Zellweger has gone from success to success with her Oscar nominated performance in "Chicago" and her Best Supporting Oscar win for "Cold Mountain."  She puts on a few pounds and makes Bridget seem like a real woman caught up in the strangeness of her life.  The sequence in Thailand where she lands in a jail and teaches all the Thai inmates to sing is hilarious.  What really works about the film is the romance.  As Mark Darcy, Colin Firth has a magnetism that he's been able to show repeatedly on film ("A Month in the Country," "Valmont," "Circle of Friends," "The English Patient," "Shakespeare In Love," "Girl with a Pearl Earring").  As the somewhat stiff barrister, he shows great heart while still maintaining that British reserve.  The fight sequence in the pond with Hugh Grant is hilarious.  The DVD extras where Grant & Firth repeatedly put each other down like, "He's gaining some weight," or "He's showing his age," is good-natured fun.  Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is again one of Britain's best comic actors with great timing and charming good looks.  While Cleaver is as sleazy as ever, he's also hilariously sleazy, and the audience feels that the character just can't help himself.  All in all, while a bit more slapstick than the first film, this sequel puts a smile on your face and is a satisfying good time.  Was it good for you?  :)  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>I had read, and laughed hilariously through, Helen Fieldings' book of the same name, so I was on tenterhooks to see the movie. I would not say it's as good as the book or even the first movie, but it has plenty to recommend it, and I found myself hooting with laughter more than once.<br /><br />Just remember where the last movie left off, and settle back for the mindless but purely enjoyable sequel. Bridget is still getting into impossible situations at work, all is NOT well with Darcy, and the nefarious Daniel (Hugh Grant at his most wicked and desirable) turns up again to muddy the waters. Throw in a Thai prison, a drug smuggling charge and sundry other embarrassing predicaments, and you've got the gist.<br /><br />Hugh Grant and Colin Firth have a truly side-splitting fight (again, but better than the first movie), each is perfect in his role, as always. Renee Zellweger, puffed up to the max, is wonderful as the overweight Bridget, although I must say that a scene BEFORE the ending, which must have been shot last, has Renee considerably slimmed down, only to appear heavier than ever in the very next scene. Quite disconcerting, actually.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are a riot, especially when Hugh and Colin, separately, each diss the other (in fun) and discuss the fun they had filming the memorable fight scene.<br /><br />Altogether a fun addition to one's collection, maybe not as perfect as the first, but so what? I loved it anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>The original Bridget Jones' Diary committed so many Book-To-Film conversion crimes that it's impossible to know where to begin - it changed events, omitted things, cast an American in the role of British Poster Girl for Singletons, etc - but for all of that, it was an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable movie, full of the same kind of bittersweet humour and zany slapstick that has made the novel such a seminal classic.<br /><br />The book "Edge of Reason", while perhaps not in the same league as the original, is still an excellent read, and Helen Fielding's wry observationism and witty sarcasm are as vibrant as ever before. Sad, then, that this movie adaptation of that novel lacks almost all of the warmth and wit of the book, replacing it instead with schmaltz and tired stereotyping, histrionic set-pieces and truly predictable comedy.<br /><br />Bridget is now in a relationship with Mark Darcey and the Daniel Cleaver affair seems to be well and truly behind her. Her career is going well and her friends are jealous. So far, so good. Suddenly, she and Mark break up, she and Daniel are sent to Thailand together, she's framed for cocaine smuggling, and unless her friend Shazzer can alert Mark in time, it'll all end in tears.<br /><br />Except after the first thirty minutes or so, the sugary sweetness and blind mundanity of the movie we just don't care how it ends.<br /><br />Zellwegger's accent and performance mannerisms are once more flawless in their British impersonation, and she does what she can with a truly uninspiring script. Firth as Mark Darcey is the same as before, except now almost totally one-dimensional, lacking any of the depth of either the novel or the original movie. Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is now a totally transparent character, and the movie-invented TV show he hosts does not serve any purpose other than to showcase his soullessness - a trait which we were already well aware of, why underline it here? - and at the movie's end we do find ourselves wondering what the point of including him in the screenplay was.<br /><br />Not that these are bad actors, you understand - this is the fault of a lousy script that relies far too heavily on schmaltzy emotion and a gross underestimation of the audiences' intelligence levels. Devoid of all subtlety and warmth, the movie  rattles on to a cheesy and predictable close, but by that stage, you may well have switched off before the inexorable happy ending.<br /><br />One to avoid, read the novel instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Same story, second verse. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason stars Renee Zellweger in her reprisal of the chunky, outspoken, good-hearted Jones. For several reasons, I thought this movie was a hit and miss endeavor. First of all, I couldn't understand why Jones was whining about boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) never fighting for her, considering he beat Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) to a pulp for her in the LAST movie. (Which incidentally, was only four weeks before the second movie begins. Apparently, fighting for Jones at least once a month is required.)<br /><br />Secondly, some quite preposterous plot turns (Being thrown in a Thai prison? That's a bit much for even my flexible suspension of disbelief.) made the whole movie pretty hard to swallow. Zellweger descends into pure slapstick, and the script takes every opportunity to make jokes at Jones' expense.<br /><br />The movie was okay, but I don't expect that another film following the escapades of Jones will be worth watching unless the formula is changed enough to allow for some relief.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>...and tell you to avoid this twaddle at all costs-this sequel is a sequel, and as such it is a bomb. Maybe it's my invented memory that the Bridget Jones I remember from the first movie was a likeable gal...because here, she's pretty irritating and I have trouble believing that insecurity and a chunky frame is enough to hook a successful lawyer with international connections. 'Cuz that's all Bridget does in this movie-obsess and babble inside and out of her head.<br /><br />Zellweger does a fine zoftig but beyond that, this is a chick flick only for devoted fans of the genre. But what do I know? I'm just a guy that got made to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>just left Bridget alone! This movie just doesn't do the story line any justice.

But at the beginning of "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason`" she seems not to have achieved the happy-ever-after ending that both she and we thought she had.  After only a short while together, Bridget suspects that Mark may be cheating on her, and Mark seems embarrassed by all the social faux pas Bridget commits while in public.<br /><br />Even before the opening credits had ended, I had a premonition that this film might be a stinker when I noticed that no fewer than four people were credited with having had a hand in the screenplay - a sure sign of trouble if ever there was one.  And I wasn't wrong, for "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason" stinks to the high heavens.<br /><br />And what did these four talented, highly paid writers come up with for all their efforts?  A patchwork mess consisting of preposterous situations, boneheaded dialogue, and thoroughly unappealing characters, that`s what.  Frumpy, shrill, desperate and wracked with insecurities, Bridget comes across as the kind of needy, high maintenance girlfriend that would send any reasonably self-respecting man racing not for the altar but for the exits.  It's amazing Mark puts up with her for as long as he does, yet, in all honesty, he`s really no more appealing than she is.  All they do is fight then make up, bicker then reconcile for nigh unto two hours with no rhyme or reason to any of it.  Every moment in the film feels pre-fabricated and arbitrary, with no connection at all to the real world or recognizable human emotions.  In short, as romantic partners, the two of them are so insufferable that I kept wishing that they would put their relationship out of its misery before some desperate soul in the audience did it for them.<br /><br />Renee Zelwegger and Colin Firth are annoying and grating as the ill-fated pair, and Hugh Grant sleazes his way through the part of the slime-ball news reporter, Daniel Cleaver.  All three actors deserve much better than being mired in a hopeless misfire like this one.  Instead of giving us believable characters in believable situations, the filmmakers pile on scene after scene of inane, embarrassing slapstick routines:  Bridget jumping out of an airplane, Bridget racing uncontrollably down a ski slope, Bridget getting drenched by passing motorist, Bridget getting arrested for cocaine possession in Thailand etc.  Then, in order to cover up for the emptiness of the screenplay, the filmmakers ladle on an endless series of golden oldies to fill up the soundtrack.<br /><br />"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason" is about as bad as a romantic comedy can get.  Let's hope some merciful soul over there in Jolly Olde England has the decency to toss Bridget Jones' next diary into the nearest incinerator before it can find its way to the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Something happened between this film and the original that I just cannot put my finger on. Was it the actors feeling like they were too comfortable in their roles? Maybe. Was it the unchallenging story that fell too clearly into a clich&eacute;d moment than a fun film? Maybe. Was it the random exploits of our character that pulled us away from her and into a world that we were unfamiliar with? Maybe. Was it the lackluster music that filled my ears with pain instead of enjoyment? Maybe. It could possibly be one of these options or all of them, but when I walked out of the theater, I didn't feel the same excitement as I did when I walked out of the theater for the first one. Bridget had changed (or maybe it was me, but for the sake of argument I will say Bridget), and it wasn't for the better.<br /><br />Let me explain my four points from above a bit clearer to see if anyone can help me discover what went wrong in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. First, the comfort level of the actors. To begin, did Renee look bigger in this film. In the first film she was plump-cute, in this film she seems just plump-plump. She seemed to just stroll through her lines not giving us half the emotion or excitement as she did in the original. Instead of building upon Bridget Jones, Zellweger just gave us a recycled version of the original Bridget Jones, jokes and all. She was just the same as the original. Nothing new was created, but more was destroyed. Firth was equally as bad (GASP for me to say that), but he just never came out of his shell. In the original I wanted Jones to be with him by the end and in this film I just didn't care. He felt and seemed cold-hearted, even in all of his emotional moments. I wanted his character to be over-the-top instead of under-the-weather. Finally, there was Hugh Grant, so literally just didn't care about this film at all. There was no passion in his eyes or any magic in his words. Together this troupe made an unfunny film where they attempted to pull everything back from the original. The book was not the same as the original, so why should this be?<br /><br />This leads me into my second point regarding the unchallenging story. It seemed and felt as if Zellweger was falling her paces instead of leading her character. The events that surrounded her seemed so surreal that I never really felt as if they were happening to her. Somewhere near the center of this film we go from personal story to fantasy. The fact that the director could only tell us with Darcy did for Jones proved that money and creativity were lacking in this sequel. The director obviously did not have a very good grasp on this film, and it was obvious from the beginning to the end. The entire Rebecca moments were laughable and unemotional. I needed a dramedy instead of a silly-goofy film. Who felt as if the fight between Darcy and Cleaver was two men looking to get paid instead of act. Why was this scene even in this film? I can tell you why, it is because women love Firth and Grant fighting and the studio executives wanted to pull those same women back into the audience. Well, couldn't we be more original and find someone else to fight? Apparently not as we are forced to uncomfortably sit through two hours of repetitive motions that we had already seen from the original. URG!<br /><br />Third and I know this is something that we probably couldn't avoid because it was in the book, but the change of scenery was pointless. I like Jones in her environment, London, it allows her humor to come from inside instead of from her 'wacky' expeditions. The ski trip moment was horrible. I even felt awkward throughout it. It just showed me that there was more money and more ability to travel. Did anyone else seem to notice that the prison seemed awfully glossed over? This is built another level to disappointment that I was already feeling from this film. Why did we have to butcher a great character with sight gags? Bridget Jones is not a sight gag person, it is her uncanny passion that makes her funny, not putting her butt in pig feces.<br /><br />Finally, there was the music. In the original the music complimented the film. In Edge of Reason, it only detracts us from the film. It is the most random chaotic choices encountered in a film. From classic oldies to modern pop, Bridget Jones changed before my own eyes as a wanna-be music video and platform for those that want to get ahead. If it was going to be a repetitive film like the first was, where was 'It's Raining Men'. That would have at least made me chuckle. Instead, there was some American-ized Christina Aguleria/Pink wanna-be blasting her song in this very British film. Chalk this one up to yet another disaster brought about by this director. Did she even see the original? The music failed in this sequel, causing a distressed viewer run back and rewatch the original.<br /><br />Overall, this was a horrible remake. Jen seemed to feel the same, but still found it enjoyable to purchase when it is released. I felt as if there was something missing. Bridget Jones is not one that needs to change for a new generation, and I felt this is what director Beeban Kidron did. She tried to make her perkier, plumper, and hipper. Bridget Jones is a character that is supposed to speak to women in the audience by her awkward behavior and passion for love, but instead what I witnessed (and I think the women will agree) was an actress packing on more weight than needed to gain the sympathy of anyone in the audience. She put no emotion behind her character, nor did anyone else involved. This felt like a painful sequel, and it was obvious that nobody was fully behind it.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>The first thing that crossed my mind at the end of Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is that I hope that they don't make another one. This is an absolute disaster of a movie - it makes the first one look like an absolute masterpiece. What were Renee, Colin, and Hugh thinking? The first movie was quite delightful - fresh and new, with an energy that exemplified a wholly British sense of humour.<br /><br />But this movie - obviously made to cash in on the first one and on Renee's A list star power - suffers from strained and forced characterizations, a story that goes absolutely nowhere, a rehash of old jokes, and plot twists that strain credibility so much that they become downright ridiculous.  Bridget has unfortunately morphed from plump, kindly, and neurotic sweetheart, to a fat, gross and downright insufferable pain in the neck.<br /><br />This installment picks up a few weeks after the first movie left off. Bridget is still going out with the dashing, adoring, and a tad bit stiff barrister boyfriend Mark Darcy (an embarrassed looking Colin Firth), and she's absolutely wrapped that they're still having "great shags" in the bedroom. But lately Mark has been seeing a lot of Celia (Una Alconbury), an attractive fellow lawyer.<br /><br />The relationship is obviously just professional, but Bridget, with her low self-esteem, and her annoyingly vacillating self confidence, begins to think that she's not good enough for Mark and that Celia is having an affair with him. After all, she's just a tacky television journalist who gets her kicks by skydiving into pig manure, while Mark is a high-flying enormously ambitious lawyer who is out to impress his peers. To make matters worse, the cheeky, rakish, horny, ex-fling Daniel Cleaver (played by a tired looking Hugh Grant), is sniffing around Bridget again, and just itching to get into her knickers.<br /><br />The problem this time around is that Renee plays it so forced and unattractive, that by the end of the film her character just is reeling off a bunch of infuriating stock insecurities. To make it worse the plot is stretched so tight and the story development so desperate; that you know there's a problem when Bridget, accidentally convicted of drug smuggling, ends up in a Tai prison where she teaches her fellow inmates how to sing Madonna songs. It's pretty much the low point of the film, and the scene, rather than funny, is just plain embarrassing.<br /><br />The real hero is probably Mark, who has the stamina and audacity to put up with Bridget's endless round of sitcom antics - from speaking out of place at a lawyers dinner, to falling from rooftops while spying on him, or accidentally bursting into rooms full of foreign dignitaries to make declarations of love. Bridget is just a series of gimmick-driven sequences of musical montages and cheap sight gags.

Bridget, Mark, Daniel and the rest are in for another year of heartbreak and adventure.  This sequel could have been a disaster in the making. The Thailand angle could have broke the film.  The difference were the performances of Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant.  They give plausable performances and this film probably would have failed with someone else.  Though not as great as the original, it's still fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>The original "Bridget Jones Diary" is one of my favorite recent comedies . . . I can say that even though I'm a guy.  Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant led a stellar ensemble cast that was as committed to pitch-perfect little moments as it was to broad laughs and big romantic scenes.  All in all, the original "BJD" is right up there with the most charming of English comedies.<br /><br />But you know what happens with Hollywood and good ideas - if there's a nickel to be made, then nothing is sacred.<br /><br />Somehow Zellweger, Firth and Grant let their "people" talk them into making this absolutely soulless shell of a sequel.  On the Sequel Scale, with "Godfather II" at the top with an easy 10 and "Caddyshack 2" a zero, "Bridget Jones:  The Edge of Reason" rates about a 1.5.  The concept is stupid - Bridget is still dizzily in love with Darcy (Firth), and he does nothing at all wrong except be just too darn perfect for words.  But we must contrive some conflict, so Bridget concocts stupid sins on his part that even she realizes are stupid, but they are sufficient to create some distance between the two.<br /><br />Look, in romantic comedies we expect a certain amount of cliche and coincidence - it comes with the territory.  But this sequel just isn't true to Bridget.  She learned in the first movie that Darcy really loved her, and she is a smart enough girl that she would never do the idiotic things she does in this movie.  That's one of her most endearing qualities - Bridget is smarter than the thin people in her world realize.  Stupid Bridget just ain't that interesting.<br /><br />In this closed universe of profiteering, the filmmakers are so completely bereft of ideas that no sooner has Darcy left the stage in a semi-huff that Hugh Grant oozes back into Bridget's life, looking for a return to Bridget's arms.  This makes absolutely no sense - here's Grant (it makes no sense to refer to his name - he's playing Hugh Grant), jet-setting around the world for a fun TV show, apparently still sleeping with supermodels, and yet his number one goal seems to be to seduce Bridget.  Whaaaa?  If Grant's purpose was to get revenge on Darcy, then perhaps the movie might have been funny.  Not even Hugh Grant's charm can make this ridiculous character work.<br /><br />We also get lots of contrived scenes demonstrating how the lovable Bridget gets herself into trouble.  When Bridget thinks she's pregnant, not only are the filmmakers content to fall back on the old "Let's watch the terrible skier fly down the mountain at top speed, leaving a trail of destruction while narrowly escaping death and screaming 'Whoooo!'," but they have her glide into a pharmacy (yes, a pharmacy) at the bottom of the slope (pretty prime real estate for a pharmacy), where she requests a birth control test, only to realize that she is in the one store in a German tourist town where nobody speaks English.  Hardy har nope.  There's more exercise of similar "wit," including most tastelessly some completely shameless scenes in a Thai women's prison, where the filmmakers think the prisoners can be made to forget their cares and woes with a little Madonna sing-a-long and some lingerie.  Nice.<br /><br />Save your money - do not buy this film.  At best, this movie should be seen by potential filmmakers and storytellers as a cautionary tale of the bad things that can happen to a great idea.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>The first Bridget Jones movie was a perfect little human comedy.  Although absurdly unlucky, Bridget remained a consistent and logical (in her own way) centre to the film.  The humour grew organically from her "logical" reactions to the absurdity happening around her.  And we had a nice, romantic happy ending.  The same praise cannot be given to this sequel, "Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason."  Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film in a superficial way, at least while I was watching it.  Unfortunately, it's entirely unecessary, except as a money-making grab by the studio.<br /><br />The plot: Mark Darcy is seen in the presence of another woman.  Bridget assumes he is cheating on her and is then assigned a job in Thailand with Daniel Cleaver (the "ex").  Therein lies the main problem I had with the film: the entire story is built on misunderstandings that could be cleared up with the tiniest application of logic on any one of the characters' parts.  Similarly, actions are not driven by the nature of the characters, but rather the requirements of the plot.  For example, almost immediately after starting the relationship with Mark Darcy, Bridget's friends are advising her to dump him.  Why?  I have no idea - I guess because the screenplay told them to!  Similarly, if Bridget is thrown in a Thai jail while on assignment for her TV network, wouldn't someone at that network notice that she had gone missing?<br /><br />Am I applying logic where none is required?  Probably.  But a sequel should be able to build on the characters rather than making them more two-dimensional (or making their actions arbitrary).  I should be asking is the film funny?  Are the actors good?  The answer to both questions is undeniably "yes!"  I applaud the idea of building a comedy around the question, "what happens after happily ever after?" Unfortunately, the film bails and gives us a series of silly little scenes that work on their own, but never add up to anything worthwhile.<br /><br />On the plus side, Mirimax has deigned to give us at least a few extras on the DVD.  There are some deleted scenes, the most welcome being the infamous "Bridget interviews Colin Firth" scene from the novel.  Obviously, it became impossible to put this in the movie with Firth playing Mark Darcy, but they filmed it anyway at the end of a day's shooting and stuck it on the DVD as a treat to those who have read the book.  There are also some scene breakdowns and a director's commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>While watching the second 'Bridget Jones' film, about 15 minutes in, I realized that the sequel is not going to be the same kind of romantic comedy.  In short, more comedy and less romance.  Not that the film is bad; it's surely amusing to see it, but in a very different way.  Though the actors are as energetic as ever, slapsticks take the place of the original's character-driven story.<br /><br />When the film starts, we see happy Bridget.  Good for her, but then we remember another Bridget of the original, so miserable in her family's annual Christmas turkey curry buffet.  And then, because of her misery so convincing, we related to her character immediately.  It was a magical touch, which the new film fatally lacks.  Instead, the second film gives us a parody of one classic musical, and a sketch of Bridget's awfully botched TV report among dirty pigs in a dirty pigsty ... oh dear.<br /><br />I am not saying the film is not funny (people were laughing in the theatre, I can tell you).  There are many funny moments in this new 'Bridget Jones' film.  I'm just saying that the film has nothing to add to the original's story that ended four years ago.  Why did they have to make this film anyway?<br /><br />Actually, if there is a good reason to make this sequel, it's to see again perpetual womanizer Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and listen to his devilishly sweet and hilarious talk, which is, he is clearly aware, total nothing.  Hugh Grant has a strange talent of giving irresistible charms to very empty words, which cast a spell on us too.<br /><br />Compared  with him, the love story of Mark and Bridget are not very intersting.  The film shows, Mark and Bridget must overcome another misunderstanding, but that's exactly they were doing about four years ago.  The writers couldn't find anything new to write about in this new diary, and the film fails to produce the original's natural and spontaneous feelings between them.  And the idea of "Bridget in Thailand" and the 'Brokendown Place'-like story is never the right material for the heroine whose delectable personality is most effective when coupled with the British middle-class values, not on the tropical beach.<br /><br />The second 'Bridget' is not all slapsticks -- thanks to four screenwriters including Andrew Davies ('Pride and Prejudice') and Richard Curtis ('Love Actually'), and sure, the dialogues become sometimes lively, but just sometimes.  You probably will notice Richard Curtis's touch, when Bridget mistakes 'Iran' for a person's name.  But witty jokes and intelligence are hard to find in this (unwittingly) ironically titled 'The Edge of Reason.'<br /><br />The film is funny to some extent, but that's because Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and especially Hugh Grant are doing good job.  The unkind camera often captures the chubby face of Bridget and that's done tactlessly, but thanks to Renee Zellweger the scenes remain watchable.  The gifted players keep the film rolling, and as romantic comedy 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' is entertaining, but not as much as the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>Some of this movie does feel like a re-hash. But that's okay, since the movie was great the first time around, I don't mind seeing some of the same stuff again. This time around, we join Bridget, as she's right in the middle of her relationship with sexy lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). She's still at her TV job, making a fool of herself (remember the hilarious fireman's pole thing from the first??!! Similar situation in this one...).<br /><br />Bridget is getting worried because it seems that Mark might have a love interest at work. Of course, Bridget is just jumping to all the wrong conclusions. She gets pretty low, then gets a job to go to Thailand and film a sort of tourist guide. Guess who is working there too? And at the same job and company because her boss told her that they needed a male personality? That's right. Daniel (Hugh Grant). Unlike Mark, Daniel really is a skeez. Will she go back with Daniel, who feeds her compliments and tells her what a fool he's been? Or will she get back with Mark? Obvious answer. The movie got a little weird for me (I actually thought she had to be dreaming at first because I couldn't believe it) when Bridget is sent to a Thai prison. Yeah.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a funny movie. It'd be fun just to take a Saturday night with your girlfriends and watch both movies in a row, feeling bad, then happy, bad, then happy right along with Bridget. I don't care if I've seen some of this movie before in the first. It was funny the first time. Why wouldn't it be the second time?? RECOMMMENDED!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Oh how we love to cry "not as good as the first movie", but in truth very few movie sequels capture the freshness, or spirit of an often inventive and new idea like an original. Sadly, that is also the case here when comparing the first and infinitely better Bridget Jones Diary, but there are a few saving graces to make this at least mildy entertaining. The story picks up 4 weeks after the end of the first movie (although 3 years have elapsed in real time) and we find ALL the main characters reprising their roles. Bridget is still oozing the giddy romance and, likeably bumbling naivety of a 30 something schoolgirl, alongside Colin Firth's stoic, but gentlemanly romantic lawyer Darcy, and all seems well despite some nagging incompatibility issues between the two. The clash of class cultures between them continues (albeit in some very contrived scenarios) until doubt, envy and the adjustment of two single lifers suddenly sharing, looks set to send things off the rails. Enter at this point dashing bad boy Hugh Grant as Daniel, stirring up old memories, and mixed emotions, and conveniently now working for the same TV company as Bridget and we are set hopefully for some light entertainment. Problem however, is that none of the engaging aspects of Bridgets character from the first movie, or the concern or sympathy that were previously generated is here, and most of the original cast (nice to see as they are) are just minimally sprinkled in the plot for the purpose of continuity without any real inclusion. I kept asking myself why a sequel was necessary (as I often do, despite the obvious money spinning aspect) when the first picture was so complete, making this a reheating of old material to a large extent. There is enough charm to keep the picture moving, and the characters are all played excellently, but the script is limp overall, some parts being often less than funny completely (especially the Thai prison scenes). The occasional nice dialogue and one-liners try but fail to lift this picture out of the doldrums, and the cringe aspect of most of the embarassing situations Bridget falls into is painful at times. If you liked the first movie, chances are this will amuse you, but it's not in the same league unfortunately. There are some nice extras on the DVD including some funny interviews with the leading characters, deleted scenes, and the usual director comments etc. My best advice? rent before you buy. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is the sequel to the popular Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) that conveys Bridget Jones' (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary.  This time the audience is introduced to her new diary, which opens with the happiness and joy that Bridget experiences through her love life.  Everything seems to be perfect, as her boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a human rights lawyer, provides the most delicious escapades in the bedroom, at least according to Bridget, who willingly shares this with her diary and people she meets.  This sharing of secrets becomes a little repetitive as the film moves along.<br /><br />Preoccupation with obsessive dreaming of Mark affects her life, as she thoughtlessly steps into trouble and embarrassment.  This embarrassment further increases her already strong insecurities.  Insecurity then leads to situations where she begins to question Mark's honesty, loyalty, and love for her through assumptions that she makes based on information inflamed with jealousy.  She could be a poster child for insecurity, as she continuously questions Mark's integrity and in the end only hurts herself.<br /><br />In the middle of her predicaments regarding her relationship with Mark she once again meets the sly womanizer Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who is the anchor for a TV travel program called "The Smooth Guide."  The TV station that Bridget works for wants to make the program more accessible for a wider audience and suggests that she becomes a co-host on "The Smooth Guide."  Initially Bridget refuses, but as expected, she gives in.  Their first episode together is to be shot in Thailand, and Bridget brings one of her friends to help chaperone her.<br /><br />When they arrive in Thailand Daniel turns up his charm and tries to sway Bridget to give him a second chance, however, Bridget is cautious as she was once hurt before.  This happens while Bridget's friend hooks up with a younger man who asks her to bring home a gift from England when they are about to leave.  The na?ve Bridget thinks she is going to be helpful, but she has evidently never seen Bangkok Hilton (1989), Return to Paradise (1998), and Brokedown Palace (1999), which would make her a lot more cautious.  Just as in these other films there are drugs in the item that she is to bring to England, and she is sent to a Thai prison.  Who could help her get out of prison?  Well, that might not be a surprise to the audience, as they will see this film unfold.<br /><br />Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason delivers a cinematic experience full of obvious stereotypes that are turned into slapstick moments.  Furthermore, the film attempts to make fun of Bridget's lack of knowledge and insecurities, which occasionally work, but frequently lead into awkward and confusing moments where the audience does not know whether to feel sorry for Bridget or to laugh at her.  As if it was not enough, the film uses clich&eacute;s that have been seen in similar films many times before throughout several decades, and this enhances the predictability of the story.  Ultimately, this sequel falls way short of the accomplishments made in the initial film.<br /><br />As mentioned, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason falls short compared to the first film, yet the film has its funny moments.  Those who are Ren&eacute;e Zellweger fans might want to see this film, as her performance is actually remarkable.  However, overall this film is only a mediocre romantic comedy that is worth renting on an evening when the audience feels that they need to put things in perspective in regards to relationships and love.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is absolutely adorable as Bridget Jones. She is funny and completely believable with her english accent. Renee's Bridget is "Every Women" - and I can certainly relate to her.<br /><br />Colin Firth is amazingly sexy and handsome in this movie. He was the best thing in the move. Every Woman's Dream man.<br /><br />I loved the sequel, and I hope they continue making more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Audiences who enjoyed "Bridget Jones' Diary" (2001) had the good sense to avoid this unnecessary follow-up. "The Edge of Reason" is a cynical "romantic comedy" with no laughs, poignancy or motivation. Another pathetic example of Hollywood's creative bankruptcy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>The Edge of Reason was painful to watch for me, as I enjoyed the first Bridget Jones film quite a bit. But here there were so many requirements lacking that I nearly nodded off. A plot would've been nice (instead of wandering around from a skydiving incident to a jail in Thailand); I don't consider a "misunderstanding" about a woman a viable plot device. Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth, whom I thought had a sparky relationship in the first film, have been turned into screenplay robots, reading their lines as if directly from the page.<br /><br />The only saving grace in the story was Hugh Grant (and believe me, I'm not a huge Hugh Grant fan). When he finally showed up in the picture he immediately added some much needed dialogue-infused comedy to the story. And he delivered his lines as if he MEANT them.<br /><br />The sad part for me, too, is that I really like Mrs. Zellweger and Mr. Firth as actors. Renee was excellent in the musical "Chicago"; and Mr. Firth's crowning achievement ("Pride and Prejudice") has yet to be rivaled for a period piece in my humble opinion.<br /><br />I feel that this film was simply a money-grab by the movie studio, trying to benefit off of the success of its predecessor ...and failing miserably.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>I considered this movie to be a worthy follow-up to the first one. Its a very charming and undemanding movie where Bridget tries to take her relationship with Mark Darcy to the next level. The sequel proves to be just as laid back as the first movie and I enjoyed the comic talents of all three stars involves, Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Yes, Grant as back in his usual role from the first movie, trying to "change" but remaining the same wormy self.<br /><br />There are some uneven spots along the way which may distract from the overall story. A good example of this would be the subplot of Bridget's friend and her involvment with a younger man which get Bridget thrown in Thai prison where she bonded with all these Thai women who really had bad relationships; making Bridget realized how lucky she was with Mark. The entire scene, charming as it is, was bit off tangent from the general tone of the movie.<br /><br />Zellweger managed to master her English accent pretty well this time around and her perky demeanor and high spirit carried the movie pretty well. Her skills as an actress also improved as well. Both Firth and Grant provided very good support as well. Firth had more screen time then Grant this time around and Bridget's "friends and family" also got less screen time as movie worked around the relationship between Bridget and Mark. A good all around comedy that I thought to be pretty entertaining and enjoyable to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL: WE TREAD OVER OLD GROUND: BUT FOR WHAT?<br /><br />We had the impression, based on the well-played characterizations of the first film, that Bridget Jones' life was settled after the original film, "Bridget Jones' Diary". Were we that far off? After all, Mark Darcy just did not seem the type to be suddenly hemming and hawing over whether he was going to make Bridget a permanent fixture in his life. Wasn't that supposed to be settled after he gave up his fiancee in the first film for Bridget?<br /><br />WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS ----<br /><br />Bridget Jones in supersize mode, literally and figuratively. Everything that worked well in the first film seems to be repeated just for the sake of cheap comedy, but at the expense of the plot and the main characters' believability. If there is a difference, it is that Bridget has been changed into a caricature and in the process has lost a great deal of her charm which, of course, is the heart of the film.<br /><br />ABOUT THE LEAD ACTORS: NO SHORTAGE OF TALENT HERE BUT ....<br /><br />With a different Director and four Screenwriters, this sequel seemed bound for failure.<br /><br />Ren&eacute;e Zellweger  - Bridget Jones [nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy]<br /><br />Hugh Grant  - Daniel Cleaver [scene stealing cad]<br /><br />Colin Firth  - Mark Darcy [good guy but too stiff]<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />Excellent transfer of both video and audio. Loads of features, but who cares if the film isn't that compelling?<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Worth seeing, but hardly the classic comedy that the original "Bridget Jones' Diary" has become.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>I went with a friend to see this movie.  And I was relunctant because I had not seen the first one and disliked the book. But alas I went and actually suprised myself--I liked this movie.<br /><br />I love Grant and Firth in other movies I had seen them in.  And usually love Zellwegger but something about her accent turned me off.  Once I started the movie I was extremely thankful that they gave an overview of the first movie so I didn't feel lost and I thought all the characters clicked well.  I also loved the fact that she had gained weight for the role and honestly she looked better--but she waddled.  Annoying.  She was hillarious as she reminded me of my friends and I in her quest for love.  Something always seems to go wrong.  Which turns into a good movie plot.<br /><br />I think that if you were relunctant to see this you may want to give it a try you might be suprised like I was.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Those who loved the prequel, "Bridget Jones's Diary" will, undoubtedly, be disappointed by this sequel, as it lacks much of the charm of the original, as well as its rapier sharp and witty script. Instead, the viewer is set upon by a bloated script that lacks intelligence and charm. Even the main character, Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger), our formerly lovable every woman, seems to have lost some of her winning ways, as what previously seemed effortless, now seems too contrived. Quite frankly, this film simply does not reach the heights of excellence that the prequel did. So, those viewers who loved the original film will be disappointed.<br /><br />The direction of this film seems ham-handed, with a screenplay that simply tries too hard to be all that the original was.  Unfortunately, it fails in its execution, hampered with too many sub-plots that are simply not funny. Colin Firth (Marc Darcy) and Hugh Grant (Daniel Cleaver) reprise their original roles and manage to hang onto their charm, but their dialogue rings hollow, as they struggle with a script not worthy of them. Ms. Zellweger also struggles with her role, as at times it calls for her to act totally stupid, something that the original screenplay did not require. The screenwriters obviously confused stupidity with naivet&eacute;.  It is a shame that they were unable to come up with something worthier of the wonderful talent in this film. While there are some funny moments in the film, they are few and far between. In fact, some of the film is downright painful to watch. Still, those moviegoers who viewed the first film should see this sequel and judge for themselves. They should, however, rent rather than buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>The essential problem with the second Bridget Jones film is that the best parts remind the viewer of parts of the first film that were done a whole lot better.  It is a pleasant enough movie, but not so pleasant that I would recommend it over taking a risk on any other film or doing something safe like rewatching an episode of BUFFY.  I haven't read the book upon which the second film is based, so perhaps it is to blame for the relative blandness of the sequel, but something is to blame for the fact that while the original was charming and entertaining, the sequel feels tired and derivative.  But even if the book is to blame, it is incumbent upon anyone making a sequel to try to find some way of making the second film in some way new, instead of merely recycling the first.  In this regard, the movie fails.<br /><br />An additional problem I had with this movie is that it took some of the weaker aspects of the original even further than it had done.  For instance, one of the sources of the original was Bridget's penchant for making a bit of an ass out of herself.  Despite this, she constantly manages to come across as cute and adorable, but in the second film she merely looks ridiculous.  The first film presented Bridget as a sympathetic character, but she was much harder to love in the second.  Again, the fault may lie with the source material, but it is important for any filmmakers, when confronted with a weak source, to make it stronger in the rewrite.<br /><br />As with the original, Renee Zellweger is delightful as Bridget, and she remains the main reason for watching the film.  She is one of my favorite contemporary actresses, and someone who hasn't done the range of performances that I would have liked to see her take on.  I miss the days when she did small, independent films like THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.  She looks a bit plumper in this one than in the original, and it is interesting that one of the more celebrated non-anorexic characters of reason years would be played twice by one of the thinnest actresses in the movies.  On the other hand, I didn't like either Colin Firth or Hugh Grant as much in this film as in the former.  The interesting thing about Mark Darcy (just as with his namesake from the BBC production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE-not a slip on my part, because Ms Fielding acknowledges that the model for Darcy was Colin Firth's performance in the six-hour BBC production of the Jane Austen classic) in the first film was in gradually learning about his true feelings about Bridget.  There was no such mystery in this one.  Likewise, knowing from the original that Daniel Cleaver was a deceptive, manipulative creep made him a pretty uninteresting character in the sequel.  The guys too as good a job as is possible given the limited possibilities of character development, but their roles are too circumvented to allow of much interest.<br /><br />So, do I recommend this or not?  I really am on the fence.  I guess I'm glad I saw it, but if I hadn't I would have been able to preserve more fully my respect for the original.  Sequels can often mar excellent originals (think of the MATRIX movies), but still leave an overall surplus of enjoyment.  I guess I liked seeing this one OK, but I can't say now that I would have regretted never having seen it at all.  I suppose that there is no harm in seeing this one, but I would warn anyone who really liked (as I did) the original, that this one falls far short of that superb film.</p></br></body></html>

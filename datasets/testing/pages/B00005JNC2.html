However, sheer earnestness, a keen ear for dialogue and a strong cast prevent this movie from going through the trapdoor of Braff's eccentric, heavily stylized view of his world. Inspired in part by his own life, Braff's movie tells the story of Andrew Largeman, a struggling television actor/waiter who returns to his hometown in New Jersey for the funeral of his mother. He is nearly catatonic with denial about his estrangement from his family and in particular, his father. He also reunites with some of his old friends, notably his grave-digging stoner buddy, Mark, and most importantly, meets and falls in love with Sam, a motor-mouthed Holly Golightly-type, who helps Andrew find himself again. It turns out that Andrew's psychiatrist father has been prescribing medication for him to stabilize his mood swings, one episode of which accidentally caused a deep and what seems to be an irreparable rift with his parents.<br /><br />The film moves fluidly between humor and pathos, and fortunately Braff knows when to avoid making the story more heavy-handed than it needs to be. At various times, the film gets lost in its own visual style (such as the use of fast motion surrounding the static protagonist) and heavy use of symbolism (for example, the ark on the edge of a crater), making it feel a bit more contrived than it should. And the alternative rock soundtrack, while terrifically evocative, also creates that aura of creeping irrelevance. But Braff is smart enough to know to focus primarily on his characters, and that's the film's saving grace and greatest strength. Quite a remarkable cast has been assembled for such a small film. British acting stalwart Ian Holm is oddly cast as Andrew's father, but he is briefly effective in spite of the fact that most of the footage explaining his character's remoteness ended up on the cutting room floor (as seen in the deleted scenes). As pot-smoking, guitar-strumming Mark, Peter Sarsgaard proves again what a fiercely intelligent and versatile actor he is. It's hard to believe this is the same actor who played the conscientious magazine editor in "Shattered Glass" or the beguiling sex researcher in "Kinsey". Jean Smart has a funny cameo as Mark's blowsy mother, and they have a hilarious scene around the breakfast table talking to Mark's brother about his medieval castle job and speaking Klingon. As Sam, Natalie Portman is charming throughout, even though her character's random eccentricities constantly threaten to overwhelm her appeal. Braff himself seems less assured as a leading man perhaps because he sets up his character to be more of an observer until he comes to life in the concluding scenes, yet he does create a sense of good will that makes you want to know what will happen to him throughout the story.<br /><br />Some of the plot strands do not work as smoothly as one would hope, for example, the burgeoning love between Andrew and Sam seems a bit jumpy in treatment and the reconciliation with his father feels fairly pat considering the painful history that preceded it. But on the plus side, Braff captures his childhood environment and adulthood angst with pinpoint emotional accuracy. At its best, the movie will remind you of the sense of isolation Benjamin Braddock felt in Mike Nichols' "The Graduate".  There is a good making-of documentary included in the DVD, as well as a series of deleted scenes that actually do help fill in some blanks left in the final film. A promising debut, rather flawed but still highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>Who knew within the confines of Zach Braff's mind rested such a beautiful, moving script as Garden State. And who knew he had within him the directing skills to pull off such a powerfully quiet performance and movie. Garden State takes off with a vision of quirkiness, and lands nearly perfectly on its two feet at the end.<br /><br />Braff, who wrote, directed, and starred in this movie, plays Andrew Largeman, a one time California actor who's forced to return to his childhood home after the untimely death of his mother. Landing in New Jersey, zombie-like Largeman is placed in the middle of his many issues, having at once to begin to deal with them. In the mix, Natalie Portman plays Samantha, a seemingly bizarre girl who's the most refreshing wind in Largeman's stale life. They meet, and a fairly predictable story ensues.<br /><br />However, the beauty of this script lies not in the story, but the quiet craziness that Braff inhabits in the movie. Nearly every scene revels in something bizarre, be it a shirt that matches wallpaper, or Samantha's hamster-loving house. Never once is this quirkiness exploited, but unfolds as naturally as Braff's performance as Largeman. You can trust Braff's unpredictability throughout the movie, because it's rich and gentle at the same time. There are too many moments in this film that are memorable, and visually stunning.<br /><br />It's only the ending of the film, which I shall not reveal, that somewhat betrays the rest of the tone of the film. Sure I was pleased with it, but it all in all felt somewhat false and forced on us. Many people I'm sure love the ending, but I wasn't convinced with it. That being said, it wasn't enough to ruin any part of the rest of this film.<br /><br />If this is the world that Braff inhabits in his imagination, the world is in store for more beauty from him in the near future. In the meantime, sit back, relax, and enjoy spending time with the oddness of New Jersey in Garden State.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I think "Scrubs" is a terrible show, so I had no desire to see Zach Braff's movie "Garden State" when it was released. I heard a lot of good things about it, though, and the soundtrack rocks, so I finally decided to watch it when it was on cable, and OH MY GOD! This is SUCH an amazing movie! Braff wrote the script as well as directed and starred in the film, and he did a fabulous job. Braff's character, Andrew, is a small-time actor in L.A. who returns to his home state of New Jersey following the death of his mother. Andrew's emotions are in high gear and he passes the time by hanging out with some old school buddies (including the very talented Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Mark) and beginning a tentative relationship with a slightly crazy girl (Natalie Portman) who somehow brings him comfort.<br /><br />Braff, Sarsgaard, and the rest of the cast of "Garden State" are amazing in this film, but Portman steals the show with her hilarious performance as Sam. This movie is very touching but also very funny, and I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in a row! It's a wonderful story about seeking out what you want in life and making the most of it. I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>Now this, as opposed to smarmy, Nutrasweet, cookie-cutter Hollywood gumball chick flicks is what I would dub "a real romance."  From the initial meeting of Portman and Braff up to the very last scene, every moment is authentic and true.  One cannot help cheering for them both.<br /><br />For a director, Braff's acting is quite good but few actresses are capable of putting forth a performance like Natalie Portman.  In fact, I can't think of any. She is utterly amazing and by far the most compelling character in the movie. Portman is an idealization of the pleasant, playful, penetrating coquette we've all read about but rarely meet.  Frankly, it's a joy to have  her on the screen.  I read online that Portman's father was a fertility specialist--I should say so! I don't know how any man could resist her, particularly in this alluring role.<br /><br />Garden State is a movie about love, friendship, life, and family and its effect is total gratification.  I'll go out on a limb here and say that this one's now lodged into my lifetime Top 10.  I'm shocked the cumulative rating is only four stars as I'd give it a 9.5 on a ten point scale.  Thank you, Zach Braff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>In a nutshell, this is a very worthy rental even if it doesn't quite live up to the odes hailed by critics. In fact the general tempo of Garden State is reminiscent of a recent film with similar idiosynchratic tones, The Station Agent.<br /><br />But director/writer/actor Braff's ability to underplay his befuddled stance in the midst of wacky comedy without appearing silly himself, is quite impressive. His sublime sensibility permeates the entire film as our protagonist visits his mother's house after a patch of nine years to attend her funeral, in the process reuniting with his old high school buddies as well as his family.<br /><br />The characters are interestingly quirky, some less hokey than others, but I couldn't help leaving with an intense personal disdain for Natalie Portman and her incredulous antics.<br /><br />The humour is endearing and generally clever, plus we get a certain "detour" that turns out to be thematically quite relevant. Much of the film's fizz wears out by the tail end though.<br /><br />A word for the soundtrack: it is stellar, throwing into the fray some cool chill-out inputs from Zero 7 and Coldplay. I recommend it more than the film itself, get a copy if you like your music relaxed and downtempo.<br /><br />Overall, Garden State is a likeable little charmer with incidental pleasures, but it's not quite the cinematic Eden that critics promised. Recommended rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>You know the story--a young, numb, marginally successful Hollywood actor returns home for his mother's funeral, leaving his anti-depressants--a truly impressive array--behind. In the space of four days he revisits his friends--all losers in their own way--, finds the love of his life, kicks his mind-numbing therapy and forgives his father for severly over-medicating him for some 15 years. I can see how this appealed to younger movie goers, but I couldn't quite swallow it all. Andrew's ability to overcome these obstacles almost instantaneously was unrealistic, and I thought the movie lacked a point of view about the events around him--particularly about the father, whose conduct was grossly unethical, and Andrew's despicable friend Mark. I guess you have to be twenty-something. . . . .</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Garden State starring Zach Braff and Natalie Portman is somewhat entertaining for the first half hour but the movie shifts and suddenly becomes a silly comedy! Braff wrote and directed this film and his performance as a numb Hollywood actor is quite good but he isn't the one who messes up the acting, that honor goes to Portman. Her performance is so childlike and idiotic, you just want her to hide under a rock. The story isn't golden or groundbreaking, the film travels through too many dynamics, I don't even know how to catergorize this film, whiny drama or pathetic dark comedy. Stay clear from this "it's never too late to go back home" sometimes it is too damn late!</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>After hearing wonderful things about this movie from many people, I finally bought the DVD. Some of my friends hailed it as the best movie they have ever seen, some the most romantic. Does it live up to expectations. Well, yes and no.<br /><br />First things first, if you're expecting humor in the vein of Scrubs, don't even bother with this. It is not even remotely close, in fact it doesn't even try to be. The story is about Andrew Largeman, who is on so many drugs, that he basically sleepwalks through life. He has no emotional connections with anybody. He feels empty, that is until his dad calls him one day crying, and says that his mother has just passed away. Andrew then goes back to his hometown, Jersey where he meets some of his old friends and forges a relationship with someone new. The story then revolves around these people over a span of about 4 days. A journey of self discovery ensues...<br /><br />While the story is hardly groundbreaking, I actually fell in love with this movie, largely because of the fantastic cast and superb dialogue. Zach Braff's directorial debut is actually very good. The characters are a delight to watch. They seem so real. They have their share of good moments and self doubts, just like us. Zach Braff, who practically typifies wackiness in Scrubs does pretty much the same here, but toning it down a level and it works wonderfully. Natalie Portman, who I feel is one of the best actors of our generation (or my generation, at least) is great as Samantha. Portman has been in such diverse roles in her short career, and she pulls it off very well each and every time. Her performance here adds a whole lot of "heart" to the movie. The rest of the cast, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm and even Jean Smart provide memorable supporting performances, that stays with you even after the show. As I said, the conversation between characters are also something that drew me into the show. Watch how something you've always thought as petty, turn into something thoughtful. An example of this, is the idea of a "home". Don't get it? Watch the movie.<br /><br />Another thing I would like to comment was the cinematography and music. They went hand in hand, the shots of the neighbourhood were beautiful, fitting the story exceptionally well and Zach Braff has an ear for good music. A nice selection of songs that leaves you with some sort of emotion, for the characters and their experiences.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie that's worthy of my recommendation. Just take it for what it is and enjoy the moment. In fact, I think that's what the people behind this movie are hoping for. Great effort!</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Zach Braff's "Garden State" is a small and simple tale about a pair of lonely souls finding happiness in each other's company.  Although small in scope, it nonetheless enchants because of its ample supply of charm.<br /><br />Andrew Largeman (Braff) returns to his hometown after the death of his mother.  Andrew's father, Gideon (Ian Holm) wants to re-establish his relationship with his son but Andrew chooses to keep company with his circle of old friends instead.  One day he meets a girl named Sam (Natalie Portman) who starts to introduce him to all the possibilities life can offer him.  As their relationship develops, Andrew finds the courage to come to grips with his tragic past.<br /><br />The success of "Garden State" is due primarily to the three performances at the center of the story.  Zach Braff gives just the right touch of poignancy to Andrew and Peter Sarsgaard brings a likeable, roguish charm to Mark, one of Andrew's old friends.  It is Portman, however, that shines the brightest.  Her offbeat and touching performance gives the film its eccentric identity.  While the melodrama in "Garden State" gets a little too heavy at spots, its universal story about moving on with one's life still is told well enough to make the film worthy of a viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>Since we watched "Leon - The Professional", my wife and I have been dazzled by the performances of Natalie Portman, and continued picking up several movies just because she performed in them. When weighing whether or not to try this film, I knew that it was not the kind of story I liked, but decided to give it a chance anyway because Portman was starring. The overall result was not bad at all, since even though I did not feel strongly identified with the characters, I got to see an interesting story that is mostly driven by its well-written dialogues.<br /><br />Andrew (Zach Braff) left his parents' house several years ago and traveled to the other side of the country to establish himself in Los Angeles and start an acting career. He was relatively successful at first, but things cooled down and now he is working as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant. He has been taking medication for his depression for a long time and lives a vacuous existence. Everything is about to change though, because his father, with whom he has not talked in a while, calls him to reveal that Andrew's mother died. Now he has to go back home to New Jersey and face the world he left behind, including his friends and family. In the process, he meets Sam (Portman) who has issues of her own; but the relationship that begins delivers a thoughtful view of what it feels like to be lost in life when one becomes an adult, and how sometimes we need to shake things up to start moving forward again.<br /><br />Zach Braff undoubtedly meets expectations in his debut as a director and writer, with an engaging script and a well-filmed movie. His performance as Andrew is inspired and completely believable; but he is assisted in this aspect by the excellent Natalie Portman, who has an uncanny ability to portray extroverted girls that speak their mind. These two guys are complemented by an array of colorful characters that add spice to this film. The result is a production that is filled with funny situations and that has a considerable degree of emotions involved. Even though it was not a film that touched me, I can appreciate its quality, therefore I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Star-director-writer Zach Baff's "Garden State" is a consistently engaging film although not a perfect one.  I thought when the film started off it was a little too quirky for it's own good.  It had kind of a sitcom feel to it which I found a little inappropriate for a film about a young man returning home for his mother's funeral.  The film got it's legs when Natalie Portman's character enters the fray as the epileptic love interest to Braff's psychologically damaged actor.  The chemistry between these two is palpable and unforced.  The film's main strength is when it focuses on their relationship.  Peter Sarsgaard gives an excellent performance as Braff's gravedigger buddy.  In smaller roles some older actors shine:  Ian Holm as Braff's father, Ron Liebman as a doctor, and Jean Smart as Sarsgaard's mother.  By no means a classic but I can envision this film developing a devoted cult following.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>Garden State is a prototypical "independent film," and I mean that in a good way.  It has all the ear-marks of an independent film: quirky, funny, odd, off-beat, edgy, innovative.  Writer/director/star Zach Braff is best known as an actor on the wonderful NBC sitcom, Scrubs.  (He brings the same comedic sensibility to this film.)  However, he is an honest-to-goodness filmmaker - he went to film school and everything.  Like Kevin Smith before him, Braff has made a feature film homage to his native state of New Jersey - those of you who don't live here simply wouldn't understand.  He plays an actor/waiter in LA who has to return home for his mother's funeral.  Once there, he goes off his antidepressants and meets Natalie Portman, who gives the best performance of a Jersey Girl I've ever seen.  The movie meanders a bit and is probably better viewed at home, but still it is an impressive debut.  I hope to see more good things from Braff in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>First-time director Zach Braff also stars in and wrote the screenplay for "Garden State", 2004's most original and charming American romantic comedy after "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". The movie is a little uneven - some of the scenes do not work as well as others. Overall, though, it is a satisfying delight. And I doubt any recent movie addresses the angst of contemporary twentysomethings as well as this one does.<br /><br />Andrew Largeman [Braff] is an aspiring actor living in Los Angeles. He works as a waiter in a trendy restaurant. He hasn't been home to New Jersey in nine years, but when his wheelchair-bound Mom dies, he has no choice but to return. There, he reunites uncomfortably with his psychiatrist father [Ian Holm]. He meets up with his childhood buddies, most of who seem to have met dead ends in life. The one who has `succeeded' by making a fortune has found a dead end of his own. Along the way, Andrew meets a very unique girl [Natalie Portman]. Something in her awakens a part of him, something which, because of his very unfortunate childhood, has long been dormant. But is it too late? Can Andrew, who has survived on anti-depressants and therapy for a dozen years, break free and become himself for the first time?<br /><br />The cast is sublime and manages to override all of the mostly minor script deficiencies. The music is exceptionally appropriate.<br /><br />For everyone who has ever been estranged from their roots, then found a route home, "Garden State" is a real find.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>It seems that every few years, somebody has to make an independent, critically acclaimed version of that classic, Dante's Inferno.  Usually I lose interest once I realize where the plot is coming from, but Garden State kept me watching through a mixture of fascination with Zach Braff's soft inscrutability and a clever mixing-up of the story elements.  This is one "Inferno" that took me by surprise.<br /><br />Zach Braff  both masterminded and starred in this film about a twentysomething guy trying to find himself on a visit home to lay his mother to rest.  Through a combination of ceaseless drug "therapy" and emotional alienation from his family, Andrew has been numb for years and can't even seem to summon up tears at the funeral.  He meets up with some old school friends and tries to console himself with the same old-same old toxic remedies of loveless sex and altered states, but somehow they have lost their effectiveness and leave him hungrier than before for something meaningful. Even worse are the series of characters that Andrew encounters throughout his home town; each one is living some kind of illusion to the point of becoming caricatures of real people. Then he finds Sam (Natalie Portman), the first person in his life who has no self-delusions.  Sam is openly flawed, funny and compassionate.  She challenges him to look for truth in everything, even his pain.  It is a turning point that leads to important revelations.<br /><br />I loved the way this film was written and paced so that Andrew's feelings of being lost and confused are infectious to me, the audience, yet it never becomes morose or dark.  This same slowness did work against it at times, but there are also some genuinely funny moments and some genuinely touching scenes. It did seem to lack a little in the way of intensity when Braff makes his self-discoveries ( I was left wondering if there wasn't more to his weirdness than the mundane reason behind all his pain). Overall though, Garden State was a well-acted and well-crafted offering for the cult-classic-to-be crowd.  Besides - who *doesn't* like Natalie Portman???<br /><br />Garden State is sure to satisfy when you are looking for something more than a summer blockbuster clich&eacute;.  Generally recommended for generations Y, X and Portman fans.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka merribelle.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>This is a great film, especially considering it's Braff's first attempt at writing and direction. It has a slightly melancholic undertone to it which tends to make the relationships and storyline that little bit more poignant. It also has some funny laugh out loud moments, so you get a good mix of emotions in the one film. What's more it has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a film for ages. Well worth giving a go!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Continuing on in my `all things Sarsgaard' I'm actually getting to one of his greatest performances; yet sadly it is not in one of his better films.<br /><br />Coming off as more of a gimmick than anything substantial, `Garden State' is one of those cult films with very rabid and devoted fans as well as very cruel and hatful detractors.  I am one on the fence.  I enjoy the film, and I remember when it came out I actually loved it and found it an amalgam of jovial fun; but as the years have gone by my adoration for the film has melted away to uncover a mere toleration of it.  It remains one of those clever films that, over time, proves itself less clever and more pretentious and even superficial.<br /><br />The film follows an actor who is distanced from his former life only to get thrust back in when his mother dies.  Nine years removed from all he used to know he is know stuck in a town he wants to forget, with an angry father and aimless friends and an intriguing girl who holds the key to release his inner contentment.<br /><br />I really like Zach Braff as an actor.  In fact, even here I really like him.  In fact, to be honest, the acting in this film is rather remarkable from all parties.  The thing is, Zach doesn't understand how to make a complete story.  He was so focused on creating a visually appealing film complete with `hip' music and clever tricks that he lost focus on creating a moving STORY.  It is generic and serviceable, but it becomes overwhelmed by the visual impact of the film.  I do wholly believe that some of the best films are built around beautifully constructed sequences of memorable events, even if those events are mere images that burrow themselves in our mind and keep us in rapt attention, but where `Garden State' fails to live up is in the area of cementing those `sequences' with heartfelt purpose.<br /><br />The film winds up becoming forgettable.  I remember the pool sequence (a sublime example of `beautifully constructed sequences') but I don't know why (thus proving that it wasn't a `memorable event').<br /><br />Like I said, the acting is sublime.  Natalie Portman was nominated for an Oscar this year for her work in `Closer'.  Both her performances are vastly different and both are career highlights for her.  She is stunning here as the hyper Sam, an intriguing character with flaws and demons of her own.  To me though, this film belongs to Sarsgaard, who just shimmers in all sorts of glory as the aimlessly charismatic Mark.  He steals every scene he is in and just proves that a great performance can help carry a rather shallow film.  When you couple this with his breathtaking work in `Kinsey' it becomes clear that Sarsgaard was the man in 2004.<br /><br />How Oscar eludes him still is baffling to me.<br /><br />So, I can understand the draw for this film, but I strongly feel that the love for it is blind.  It is visually compelling, and the acting is stellar, and that soundtrack is very, very likable; but the lack of substance becomes apparent ones the glossy veneer fades away and we are left with only half the movie we vaguely remember enjoying.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>Another reviewer called this a "coming of age" story.  I think it's a coming-to-life story....something that some people never do, at any age.  I've read the staggering statisics of the number of people on medication, legal and illegal in our fair land, and it's not a pretty fact. To reduce the film to it's basic message: it's better to face the pain of life--that's where the joy is.  But it's so much more than a message film.<br /><br />This is a deceptively simple story but it's so wise and so well told that it really touches the heart.  I don't have TV so I didn't know who Zach Braff was.  Now I do!  I will look for his work in the future.<br /><br />I won't re-tell the story because it's been told enough times here.<br />I just want to add my applause to the others'.  Braff very skillfully walks the line between humour and pathos.  His character has been likened to that of Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate" but I think this is much better.  The whole cast is super.  It was great to see the wonderful Jean Smart in a small role, as the mom of his grave-robbing buddy.  Ian Holm plays his father, an unsympathetic character, in a very human way that does give the viewer the glimpse of a fundamentally decent man who is as lost in the events of his life as everyone else.<br /><br />Much of the joy and magic of the film goes to Natalie Portman who plays the wonderfully screwy epileptic girl, Sam, who helps the Braff character come back to life.  The role is well written but it could have been butchered in the hands of a lesser actress.  I just saw her in "The Other Boleyn Girl" where I didn't much like her, so I was amazed at how good she was here.  Her naturalness really made the character touch your heart.  This is the sign of a good actress and good direction.<br /><br />There's more I could say but there are a lot of excellent reviews here.  I predict this film will become a classic, 'cuz it has such enduring qualities of real humanity, humour, wisdom and warmth.  My favorite scene: the family watching the video of Sam ice-skating in her alligator outfit---so dear!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>The DVD cover hails it as a coming of age comedy, so I'll think of it that way.  It addresses the concerns I seem to recall having as a teenager, it handles everything very well, and I laughed more than once.  Yep, I can certainly see it being beloved by some teens.<br /><br />I'm knocking on 50, folks.  I saw some bits that were very effective, and some humor that worked quite well.  It seemed a bit surreal at first, but that's explained to everyone's satisfaction plot-wise eventually.  But my memory of my teen years was that they seemed surreal even as they were happening, no plot point necessary.<br /><br />So yeah, a fine movie, and I'm not even in its demographic.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>From time to time, we use to watch - thanks to the unrestricted rules of the conventional circuits - films that breath a warm poetry, a fine artistic feature, surrounded of an accurate sense of existential vertigo.<br /><br />An aspirant to actor, who lives in Los Angeles, is notified about his mother has paused away. A long time has gone since he left his birthplace; his childhood friends have grown up and have decided to undertake different professions. That sad reencounter with his family and circle of friends dates him back to his origins, but besides will allow an unexpected love.<br /><br />The film has three brilliant sequences, the first one  is when we realize the emotional burden that represented the horrid accident suffered by his mother  that affected him since his early childhood (he was nine, by then), carrying with him the enormous weight of the guilt over all those years; on the other hand the brief but memorable clash with his father (brilliantly performed by Ian Holm) and third that mesmerizing metaphor of the unfathomable abbeys in the coda of the plot, that works out as an admirable mirror image of his own existence, acting over him as a powerful device to bring him back to the lost emotional equilibrium.<br /><br />Nathalie Portman steals herself the show with her memorable acting. She looks so natural through her dialogues, absolutely identified with her role that constitutes one of the sever highlights of this unconventional portrait of what the lack of love may infringe on the human behavior and at the meantime how this same feeling brings him back to the normality.<br /><br />A film that must be seen due its ambitious proposals.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Zach Braff's directorial debut, Garden State, is the essence of an independent film.

Not surprisingly, Braff dominates while Portman gamely asks him many questions to keep things going.<br /><br />There is a second audio commentary featuring Braff, director of photography Lawrence Sher, editor Myron Kerstein and production designer Judy Becker. With his dry wit, Braff MCs this track as the participants talk about the more technical aspects of the movie.<br /><br />Also included are 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary by all the participants from the second commentary. Braff puts the footage in its context and talks about why they were cut (for time).<br /><br />"The Making of Garden State" examines how Braff put his movie together. There is quite a bit of decent behind-the-scenes footage and plenty of interview soundbites from the cast and crew. For a Making Of featurette it is refreshingly free of an excess of clips from the movie that always pad out the running time of these things.<br /><br />There is also a fairly amusing collection of blown lines and bloopers.<br /><br />Finally, there is a promo for the film's soundtrack.<br /><br />Garden State is a film bursting with ideas, keen observations on life and memorable images that make most other films look inert by comparison. There is a tendency for first-time filmmakers to throw everything into the mix on their debut because they aren't sure if the film will succeed and they'll get a second chance. Based on the strong critical and commercial success of Garden State, I don't think Zach Braff will have this problem.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I love movies like this, movies that may not have much in the plot area but more in the mental area, making you think about life and the mundane things that can take over.  My wife hated this movie because it was slow and at times seemingly meaningless but in the end I was floored at how much I enjoyed the normalicy of a plot revolving around real life and the fact that there was nothing remotly fictinal about the charactors.  These people could be my neighbors and I liked that about the film.  Andrew (Braff) is an actor hopped up on meds his shrink father prescribed for him.  His mother just died and so he's back homefor the first time in 9 years for the funeral.  WHile he's in town he hangs out with friends (Sasgard) and Sam (Portman in an amazing role for her!)  The movie is just that...4 days of Andrew being home, off meds and away from the pressures of playing a retard on TV (literally)...anyways...I thought that it was a great, coming of age film and is worth a watch by anyone interested in exploring the reality that is life, no matter how boring you find yours to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>If you normally skip "indie" films, see this one. You will be glad you did. This movie is story driven and you want to follow it to the end. It is hard to believe that Zach Braff wrote, directed and stared in this film. Why is he wasting his time on TV? The writing is top notch, acting superb and photography well done.<br /><br />Zach Braff comes home for his mother's funeral after years of being away. Of course coming home brings up all the reasons he left and never returned before. And he has to deal with and resolve these problems. That is both perceived and real. His portrayal of going home and meeting old friends and family seem very realistic to me.<br /><br />Eventually we have the ever-beautiful Natalie Portman enter into his life and she starts to accompany him during his last days with his friends of his youth. Her character as well as some quirks she needs to work through.<br /><br />The characters in this movie have their own unique ways about them. And get just enough screen time to fill out the story line and seem real. The movie takes us through a range of emotions. And yet there are a couple of classic scenes that you will find yourself laughing at.<br /><br />The soundtrack of this film is as enjoyable as watching the film was. A mix of golden oldies and fresh indie-pop, this is a mellow sweet collection. The sound track stands on its own merit. But the beautiful music of "Garden State's" soundtrack serves as a poignant reminder of the movie.<br /><br />Unlike other's who have written bad reviews I think that this quirky movie stands on its own and is worth seeing. Watch it with a date.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>I was genuinely surprised by Zach Braff's _Garden State_.  To be honest, I did not think I was going to like it and the first five minutes of the film seemed to confirm it.  I found his character dull and uninteresting.  But as the movie developed and the character's dullness was revealed to be an extension of his sedated state (both emotionally and physically), the film really took on a new shape.  Unlike many who have commented that the film is not a comedy, I certainly think it is.  I found myself laughing my ass off at a few lines in particular and thought the entire movie was delivered with a nice touch of humor.  Moreover, it is a comedy in the sense of the overall arch of the main character.  However, I suppose that if one's definition of a "comedy" is a film done in the style of a SNL production, then this film will probably not please.  This is not _Old School_--it is a bit of a dark comedy about reconnecting with the world again.<br /><br />There are a few scenes in this film that are superbly well done, parts where the script connects with the audience and everything comes together.  Fortunately, there are enough of them to make up for any awkwardness in the pacing that results from any movie attempting to balance itself between humor and emotional intensity.  This film is certainly worth a rent and even purchasing if you can find it for a decent price.  With wonderful acting, a great oddball script and premise, and what is quickly becoming acknowledge a stellar soundtrack, _Garden State_ delivers exactly what it promised and much, much more.  Be sure to check out the documentary on the making of the film included on this DVD version.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>I rented this because I had heard so many good things about it and after watching it a couple times, it certainly did not disappoint.  Zach Braff has done something remarkable for a debut film project, and its an achievement he should be very proud of.  This film works on several levels, but mostly, its a relevant film for the younger generation that is too often assigned to take drugs to solve whatever problems their parents don't want to deal with.  The numbing of the emotional pains of life doesn't lead to a life fully lived, and in a sense, we are turning our children into emotional zombies.  This film is a wake up call...get off the drugs and experience life the way its meant to be experienced.  Emotional pain is a burden everyone has to work through and deal with, and finally accept before moving on.<br /><br />The great thing about this independent film, as in many independent films, is that it doesn't follow the standard Hollywood formula.  You are taken in with the character and experience his life over the course of four days, as Andrew (Zach Braff) returns home to attend his mother's funeral after a nine year absence.  At home, he avoids his father and hooks up with friends who seem to all be stuck in dead-end jobs (some, quite literally).  Andrew is the only one trying to make something of his life, as a struggling actor in Hollywood who's claim to fame was playing a mentally handicapped football player on a TV show.  He meets the lovely and quirky Natalie Portman at the doctor's office.  Some people have doubted her abilities as an actress after seeing her in the "Star Wars" prequels, but make no mistake...see this film and "Closer" and you will be captivated by her range.  I loved her performances in both films, but she especially has unique charm in "Garden State"...helping Andrew come to terms with his long-delayed grief over an incident that happened when he was much younger, guilt that he put aside for years.<br /><br />There are many quirky characters in this film and a couple of them seem caught up in some pyramid schemes.  My favorite small performance is by Method Man, who almost steals the film by his very brief, but hilarious scene.  Perhaps the only person who seems out of place in a film like this is Ian Holme, whom I can't view in any film without thinking Bilbo Baggins!  He often appears like a ghost in this film by his wardrobe choices, and his role is small (his most significant scene is cut and on the deleted scenes special feature) and he just doesn't resemble Zach enough to convince me that he's his father in the film.  It was a minor distraction and what I think is a serious miscast of that role, but not enough for me to subtract a star from the rating.  That's because the overall message of the film is simply powerful and one we should all take to heart.  We should live a life that's uniquely ours and seek moments where we attempt to do things no one else might have ever done before.  To live is to risk, and we can't truly live if we are drugging away our personal pains (whether through doctor-prescribed zoloft/ritalin, or through ecstasy and other illegal means of artificial happiness).  We control our own happiness and we can't be responsible for making other people happy.  That's the garden state of our own desires.  See this film again and again.  Its simply amazing and Zach Braff deserves huge kudos for making this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>A surprising winner in my book, Garden State is entirely likable, and also one of those films that is capable of being simultaneously deep and funny, light and fun, welcoming and imposing, all as it slips out from behind its misguiding exterior and brutally confides things to us we'd almost as soon not know. Natalie Portman definitely earns her paycheck as Sam, a charmingly weird girl who manages to love life (and inspire a love of life in others) even as she deals with problems that would send most of us into a tailspin of self pity. Writer Zach Braff of NBC's Scrubs was equally great as director and actor, playing the part of a young man named Andrew Largeman, who has returned to New Jersey after nine years of living in California, where he has won moderate fame on a TV series playing an intellectually-stunted individual. (A left-handed compliment in the movie has someone telling Andrew, "On that show I really thought you WERE retarded.") Andrew returns to his hometown to attend the funeral of his mother, whom he accidentally crippled when he was a child: something he has clearly never been allowed to forget, and which has understandably haunted him ever since. In New Jersey Andrew reconnects with a number of old friends, including one whose sudden wealth comes from having invented a form of "silent Velcro" and he stares down some old demons, including the biggest one in the form of his judgmental father. Above all else Andrew unexpectedly finds love, and it is the story of this love that gives (the almost dreary) Garden State its well-found balance. Garden State is a refreshing movie that never loses the feel of its indie roots. Andrew and Sam are the sort of people it's impossible not to root for, and the entire film has a "what will happen next" feel that's rarer than ever for any writer to accomplish.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a semi-successful actor in Hollywood who returns home to the Garden State of New Jersey for his mother's funeral. "Large" hasn't been home in over nine years and there is a serious riff between him and his father. Over the course of four days Large attends several parties, meeting up with many of his old high school chums who are working at a variety of occupations: one is a grave digger, another works as a knight at a Medieval Times, another lives in a mansion after having invented noiseless velcro.  While sitting in a doctor's waiting room, Large is introduced to Sam (Natalie Portman), a young girl with a very quirky, personal, and forceful personality.  Over the next few days the two share in a series of casual adventures and fall in love, but not knowing how to express that love to each other.<br /><br />GARDEN STATE is the directorial debut of Braff. Braff is best known for his starring role as J.D. in the television comi-drama, SCRUBS. Many people who are fans of SCRUBS don't like GARDEN STATE because the two are two completely different formats and Braff is actually a very talented actor & filmmaker and not just a lucky caricature who has a pretty face.  The film is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a great directorial debut.<br /><br />The movie doesn't really have much plot and instead tends to rely upon style, technique, and meaning.  The film has several shots that just in and of themselves are pure art; they are like moving snapshots in a virtual photography gallery. There are also several interesting filmmaking techniques incorporating throughout the picture that shake up the pace and keep things interesting. But the heart of the movie is the meaning behind it all. Large's life is like millions of people throughout the country--he has just been existing in a dream-like, drug-enhanced state since the time he was a child. Excluding the unhappy childhood, his whole life has been nothing but one moment of existence from another. All of that changes when he meets Sam. She causes him to look at things differently and tenders the desire within himself to begin living life, in all of its pain & suffering, joy & sorrow, adventure & mundane. When Large meets Sam, he stops just existing and begins truly living.<br /><br />That idea is full of all kinds of implications and could be seen as a spiritual allegory. There aren't very many experienced filmmakers who can pull together art, technique, and substance in a way that makes sense and is worth watching. Hardly any freshman filmmakers can pull off such a task, but Braff has succeeded where many others have failed. Add in a mix of a beautiful soundtrack (Braff was also the soundtrack producer) and some high-quality acting from Braff, Portman, and Peter Sarsgaard (who plays Large's best friend, Mark) and it makes for one fairly impressive directorial debut.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I think Firedancer's review hit it right on the nail.  I read many reviews on this movie and saw the trailer prior to renting.  I thought this was going to be great with everything positive that I heard.  I was wrong.  Natalie Portman's character annoyed me.  All the characters lack depth, I was completely uninspired by the film's end.  I couldn't feel anything for any of them.  I am very disappointed in this picture.  I fell asleep during the movie and had to go back and watch the part I missed, so that speaks for itself.  I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>"Garden State" is a delightful, quirky film, geared to entertain with its eccentric characters and bizarre, dark humor. A coming-of-age tale long overdue, this is a magical, edgy romantic comedy, (that guys will enjoy), with some hilarious moments, as well as a few tremendously moving ones. And the acting is excellent! I was left with a warm and fuzzy feeling for hours after the conclusion - a welcome change from the film I saw prior to this, which gave me a headache!.<br /><br />Zach Braff wrote the intelligent screenplay, directed it and plays Andrew Largeman, a twenty-six year old who hasn't had a feeling since age nine, when his psychiatrist father, (Ian Holm), medicated him with almost everything available on the pharmacological market to block anger, anxiety, and depression. (The reason for the pill consumption will be revealed in the movie). Since Andrew was always too zombied-out to consider changing shrinks, he has been on meds every since. All Dr. Largeman wanted, and wants, (so he says), is for his son to be happy. Originally from the great state of NJ, Andrew now lives in LA where he pursues an acting career and works as a waiter. He's best known for his role as a retarded quarterback in a TV series.<br /><br />Dad calls Andrew one morning to inform him his mother died, (she drowned in the bathtub), and asks him to come home for the funeral. In his heart and mind Andrew knows you can't go home again - he hasn't even tried for almost a decade. However, his mom's funeral is a worthy enough cause to justify his return to the Garden State. When he boards the plane, he leaves his pills behind.<br /><br />After the funeral, Andrew studiously avoids his dad and reunites with some boyhood friends. Almost all are major underachievers. Pal Mark works as a grave digger...who occasionally robs the dead, and is almost permanently attached at the mouth to his bong. His mom (Jean Smart) is, literally, a space cadet. Another buddy works at a medieval reenactment restaurant as a knight, and wears armor to work. The group's success story is Jesse, (Armando Riesco), who invented a silent substitute for Velcro, has made mega money, and gives great parties. Into this crazy mix comes the luminous Sam, (Natalie Portman is absolutely terrific here)!<br /><br />Andrew visits a neurologist because he is experiencing brief but acute headaches. He meets the free-spirited Sam at the doctor's office. She is totally charming, fresh, and epileptic - something she does not tell Andrew for some time. He gives her a ride home and she invites him in just in time to bury her pet hamster. He gets to attend yet another funeral, this time at the family's overpopulated pet cemetery. The combination of zero meds in his system, the knowledge that he can indeed cope without the prescription cocktail, and Sam's warmth, courage and acceptance, allows Andrew to open himself to emotion again. He is even able to confront his father.<br /><br />"Garden State" is a perfect date movie, also good for rainy days and Saturday night at home with popcorn. The scene at the abyss is memorable - something to look  forward to!<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie meanders skillfully. I do not want to reveal too much of the plot because the timely revelations about the characters are what keeps the movie interesting. The opening scene sets up the story. A man who is heavily medicated finds out that his mother just died. He flies back to New Jersey to attend the funeral. He meets some old friends and makes some new ones. The dialog is good. The friends and strangers are interesting. The movie even takes the viewer to interesting spots in Newark, New Jersey. The movie drives home the point that life is not all happiness, but that's okay. Without experiencing pain, life would be numb and worthless. Real life is in experiencing the pain and the joy.<br /><br />The movie is like a winding path through some valleys and hills. It has some nice surprises, touching moments, and small laughs. This is a very impressive directorial debut for Zach Braff.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Garden State" is a quirky Generation-Y love story written, directed, and starring Zach Braff. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral after a 9-year absence. Overmedicated since he was 10 years old by his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm) for problems that may never have existed, Andrew decides to go without his meds for the trip. He catches up with old high school friends and meets an eccentric, talkative woman named Samantha (Natalie Portman) whose unusual ways of coping with her own problems might be the perfect match for him.<br /><br />"Garden State" is one of those films that is populated with idiosyncratic characters. Fortunately, most of them are not written over the top or overplayed. Peter Sarsgaard is almost too good an actor for his role as Andrew's old friend, Mark. It's nice to see him, but his performance begs for a meatier role. Jean Smart has a couple of good scenes as Mark's mother. Ian Holm mostly creates an impression, rather than a character, as Andrew's father, because he has so little to do. This supporting cast is so impressive that it left me feeling that their talent had been underutilized. But Zach Braff's Andrew and Natalie Portman's Samantha (Sam) are the film's focus. Andrew is a quiet, introverted, slightly dweeby man who tends to view life from the outside looking in. Sam has so many eccentricities that it stretched credibility and became a little annoying. I found her childlike nature to be particularly odd and unlikely -or, if not unlikely, at least unattractive. The character is a mish-mash of too many things and would benefit from some paring down. But "Garden State" belongs to the genre of "quirky love stories", and that is what it delivers. Many of the film's best moments are found in its absurdist humor. The love story is sweet. And the characters are distinctive.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary, a making-of documentary, outtakes/bloopers, a "Soundtrack Promo Spot", and 2 audio commentaries. "The Making of Garden State" (27 minutes) is a loosely organized documentary that features short interviews with the film's producers, cast, principal crew, and even the craft service guy. I can't say that its very informative. There is more information on making the film in the audio commentaries. The first audio commentary is by writer/director/actor Zach Braff and actress Natalie Portman. It primarily discusses filming from the point of view of an actor or a director dealing with actors, not technical aspects of filming. The second audio commentary is by Zach Braff, director of photography Lawrence Sher, editor Myron Kerstein, and production designer Judy Becker. Discussion of the technical aspects of filming are in this commentary. Both commentaries are casual but interesting, without long lulls between remarks. If you listen to only one, I recommend the second, technical, commentary, which is a little more engaging and substantive. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing is available in Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is a movie that makes a good try at being "deep meaning" with a little humor thrown in but falls short.  Zach Braff plays a displaced New Jersey young man who has moved to California and when he is not playing part-time actor he is wearing "Charlie Chan" make-up in a pretentious Vietnamese restaurant.<br /><br />Zach gets a call from his father to return home to New Jersey because his mother has drowned in a bathtub accident.  The dreamy, kind of insensitive Zach feels it is his duty to go.  He kind of day dreams through the ceremony at the cemetary and then goes out partying with heavy drugs with his friends.<br /><br />Zach complains to his father about sharp headaches and his father sends him to a neurologist to get checked out.  While there, two significant things happen.  First he meets Natalie Portman who is kind of spaced out herself and then he learns that his problems are probably related to the drugs his psychiatrist father has been proscribing for him.<br /><br />Zach happens on Natalie later on and the two start hanging out together.  There relationship slowly blooms and as there relationship improves they both realize that they are not really losers.  Zach's problems relate to both the drugs he was taking and the guilt he had been carrying from a childhood incident involving his mother.<br /><br />The movie has some really hilarious parts and I understand that Zach was the actual writer/director.  Not a lot of action but an enjoyable and very different type of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>This is a hard movie for me to rate. Its probably more like 3.5 stars. I enjoyed it and thought it was very well made, especially for a first time write and director. There are some very funny moments but it is not hilarious as I've seen some reviewers say. It is a very good character piece that is quirky and odd but not too much so that it turns you off.<br /><br />Zach Braff plays an emotionally disconnected actor who comes home for the first time in 9 years for his mother's funeral. He spends his time reconnecting with old friends and avoiding his father. He meets Natalie Portman's character, an odd girl who he falls in love with. I liked the way the romance was underplayed and yet was integral in Braff's character beginning to come to terms with things in his life. I thought Portman was great in this movie, although the character could be slightly annoying.<br /><br />Overall, Garden State is funny, but not hilarious. It's very well done, if a little too slow in pace at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>While there is nothing overly wrong with this movie, there is also nothing that is particularly good about it either.  Its just another twnetysomething angst/finding love story.  It has some mildly amusing parts and Zach Braff does a good job in the lead role, but there is nothing really original in the movie.  I used to think Natalie Portman saved all of her bad acting for the Star Wars movies, but she is wooden and annoying in this one as well.  This movie is worth a rent if your're bored, but you may end up even more bored while watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>I did like Garden State the first time I watched it, but with another viewing, and it's reputation, it just became stale. I think that it's overhyped, and that it tries to hard to capture the viewer's attention, which is ironic, since the film has a exceedingly thin plot. Garden State's non-existing plot and direction by Zach Braff allows us to follow a guy we hardly know anything about as he re-connects with his high school friends and an eccentric girl he met at a clinic, who he winds up falling in love with. The film attempts to stand on it's own feet with the cast's performances and the script's dialogue alone, but ultimately, it falls over. The ending of the film is completely cliched. The fact that high school kids think it's so "deep" baffles me. It's as if they're attempting to read between lines that aren't there. The problem with disliking "Garden State" is that when you express your opinion, the emo kids and fans of the film claim that "you don't get it". I understand what the film is about, it's just that I didn't like the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Progressing from the rather limited realm of television productions to the far more expansive universe of major motion pictures can be quite an overwhelming experience for any aspiring young performer, as some have found out the hard way. The cast members of Friends, for example, with the exception of Miss Jennifer Aniston of course, have had little in the way of success making the transition - David Schwimmer has had no box office hits, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow have each at least one cult classic (in spite of both being ruined by their unnecessary sequels - when will Hollywood learn), Matt LeBlanc had the Charlie's Angels franchise (though he was never featured prominently), and Courtney Cox made the best with both the Scream franchise and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (all of this in spite of the fact that she is married to David Arquette). Is it so much a mystery now as to why they demanded so much money per episode in the final season? They knew they would not be finding much in the way of work after the show ended. Sure there are success stories, but those who take make the leap gamble their future career opportunities in Hollywood.<br /><br />The story follows a man coming to grips with who he is and where his life is going following the death of his mother. Andrew Largeman did not live a carefree childhood back in his home state of New Jersey. Following an incident when he was young where he pushed his mother, causing her to be placed in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, his father, a psychiatrist, ships him off to boarding school. He also prescribes to him dozens of anti-depressant medications which cause him to feel numb to the world around him. Now a moderately successful actor, Andrew makes the decision to go cold-turkey off the prescription drugs he has taken for fifteen years and return home to reconcile not only with his estranged father but also with himself following the death of his mother in a bathtub. In the short time he spends back in New Jersey, he reconnects with all his old friends who have each gone their separate ways in the world and meets Sam, a girl who is everything that he isn't, who teaches him how to open himself up to the world. The story for Garden State, albeit adequately endowed with the comprehensive themes relative to the condition of the human spirit and the adolescent reflections upon life its key demographic necessitates, remains lax in terms of the script's focus and direction. Braff is hell-bent on presenting to his audience every little quirk and peculiarity he can recall about the state of New Jersey, some of which were well established long before this film came out, so much so that blowback occurs where in the pacing within the more somber moments of the movie feel way off from the rest of the picture. Another fortuitous result of these eccentric occurrences is that Garden State develops this tendency toward creating transitional sequences, most notably the one in which Method Man cameos as the operator of peeping-tom business in the back of a hotel, which serve no purpose in stimulating the storyline and only adds further hindrance to the movie's moderate pacing.<br /><br />For what it is worth, acclamation should be given to Zach Braff for a valiant effort in soliciting the responsibility of acting not only as the film's screenwriter and director but its leading man as well, all of which were firsts for him with Garden State. As anyone who has ever embarked on such a cinematic challenge of the limits of both patience and ambition, even for those not in their initial effort, can tell you, achieving the proper tone and style in which to win over the audience is an intricate balancing act so rarely achieved in the modern mainstream Hollywood environment. With that in mind, Braff's efforts in the role of Andrew Largeman, the protagonist of the picture, are like those of the character himself in that they are only moderately successful. Specific scenes opposite Portman or Holm in which they are seen interacting with each other through a segment of honest dialogue successfully demonstrates his proficiency in bringing out the intensity within his character, but at the same time fails to properly illustrate to his audience the dramatic shift in emotions Andrew experiences from the beginning to the end of the movie. Not to say that he should be seen on the floor near the end balling his eyes out but at least show some variance from the insipid, melancholic countenance expressed through nearly the entire picture. Natalie Portman gleams with this illuminating radiance in the role of Sam, the romantic interest of Andrew Largeman, and is suited perfectly opposite Braff in the charming subplot of the film, though it was felt as if this portion of the screenplay could have been expanded upon earlier rather then later in the picture, but in any case it works out fine. Though this is certainly not what one would consider as being Oscar-caliber material in the sense, still if Julia Roberts could be nominated for her rather simplistic role in Pretty Woman then anything is possible - as long as you play a hooker that is, she is a treasure to watch onscreen in this film nonetheless.<br /><br />Ian Holm, the brilliantly talented British actor more commonly remembered for his recent appearance as Bilbo Baggins in the highly successful Lord of the Rings trilogy, is greatly underutilized in the role of Andrew's father, Gideon Largeman. The rather intense interactions and conversational engagements held between Holm and Braff sprinkled sporadically throughout the film are intriguing and poignantly insightful into how divergent the relationship between father and son can become as a result of elevated variant emotions in regards to a single incident involving a loved one. The lack of development within this specific element of the screenplay is truly what made the end result of Garden State all the more disappointing to witness. Time would have been better spent concentrating on the elaboration of the anguish and resentment held for each other which has brought their relationship to a head at this point in their lives, rather then the mindless quirks of the town's residents. Speaking of which, Jean Smart's Carol (Mark's mother) and Armando Riesco's Jesse (a friend of Andrew's whose newfound wealth has stemmed from his creation of the silent Velcro) are two within the film's cast of quirky characters that should have been given something more valuable to do that would have merited their time and involvement in the project or else cut out entirely.<br /><br />Overall, in regards to the emotions Garden State invokes, it would appear as though art does imitate life - the intense anguish and sadness it produces from the prospects of what might have been make it nearly unbearable at times, but when all is said and done you do not regret having taken the ride. Putting it more sincerely, Garden State is not exactly a fantastic film, but there are enough memorable moments contained in it to make it at least recommended for someone else to watch. The film's most egregious oversight would unquestionably have to be its ending, which comes off as being half-assed and anti-climatic to audience members unreceptive to ludicrous clich&eacute;s. Sensing perchance that he could not tangibly achieve the "happily ever after" outcome that both he and his audience naively desired with the direction in which the story was heading toward, Braff in total disregard to the characters he created rashly ties up all the loose plot elements instead of allowing them be who they are. Although there is nothing unethical about using maledictions and nudity in movies, within reason of course, a complexity does arise when these are used in excess of what is necessary. And what was with Andrew Largeman going completely cold-turkey on the anti-psychotic medication his father prescribed for him? Having taken what would seem to be an exuberant amount of prescriptions for over fifteen, had he never heard of medical withdrawal? This is not a huge sticking point but realistically speaking this would not have been feasible and should not be recommended for anyone on with such considerable prescriptions. Instead the larger deliberation lies in what is presumed to be Braff's assumption which is that anti-depressant medication has made people numb to the world around them and that it has done far more harm then good, admirable their intentions or not. Although one can certainly argue that the modern generation has evolved into a society which has sought quick-fix solutions to their problems through prescription medication with little, if any, risk of side-effects, it would flat-out ignorant to believe all are unnecessary. Sure, there are those who take this medication for a condition they do not have, there is always a bad apple somewhere in the bunch, but a majority of them do need these prescriptions, in combination with psychological therapy, in order to restore the balance of their lives. And yes, there are no guarantees and uncertainties do occur in which the person may be placed in a high stress environment, but these risks need to be taken in order to reclaim a role in functional society. As much as we would like to, we can not logically shun away the world whenever we are hurt emotionally, or even physically, so we must learn to overcome these hindrances and move on with life, one way or another.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>A quirky little comedy that mixes humor and drama nicely.  A very talented cast and a sharp script highlight this film.  This is a good film to watch with your girlfriend or wife since it seems to appeal to both genders.  The story follows the return of a failing actor from LA back to New Jersey to go to the funeral of his mother who he hasn't seen in 7 years.  Along the way he has to face a number of problems from his screwed up childhood to facing his father.  A bunch of off beat friends and a well played crazy girlfriend(Portman) help him out.  This is one to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>Garden State is a funny, slightly charming comedy about coming back home, finding yourself again, falling in love and letting the emotion grow where it was stopped dead by an event in your past. There really wasn't too many bad things to be said about this movie except for the fact that it was completely unmemorable and its storyline didn't seem to fit into the 102 minutes duration time of the film. After about 80 minutes I kept looking at the digital minute counter on my DVD player. So I guess what I'm trying to say was that it really dragged on.<br /><br />I'll give the movie some credit as far as interesting characters and catchy dialogue go. And there were some pretty funny parts throughout the picture. But this is just the kind of film I watch, enjoy it to an extent, and completely forget about it the next week.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>REALLY ONE OF THIS YEARS BEST FILMS!

When the phone rings he does not answer it and we here a voice that turns out to be his father who has called to inform Andrew that his mother has drowned the previous night in the bathtub.  Although it has been years, Andrew will go home for the funeral and for the experience he decides not to take any of the pills in all of the neatly arranged bottles on the shelf in his medicine cabinet.  Clearly the drugs have something to do with his mother and by not taking them Andrew ensures that he will arrive back in New Jersey in a different state of mind.<br /><br />In good time we will find out why Andrews' father (Ian Holm) has been proscribing drugs all these years.  The relationship between father and son is one of the ways we can gauge the progress that Andrew is making in the film as he finds his own voice again.  We also learn that despite being overmedicated Andrews is a would-be actor who has managed to score a gig as a retarded quarterback in some sort of cable movie.  This means that every time he runs into somebody back home it becomes clear they are going to mention the movie, comment on how long it has been since they have seen Andrew, and say something about his mother being dead.<br /><br />I keep hearing that "Garden State" is "The Graduate" for this generation, but instead of seeing young Dustin Hoffman I keep thinking young Ray Romano (heavily sedated on drugs) every time I see Andrew.  I get the idea the film is also about growing up when you do not want to, but since Andrew does not sleep with Sam's mother there are some significant differences.  One of the problems of "Garden State" is that the character arc is basically Andrew waking up.  The movie petty much has to end when Andrew gets to the point that his eyes are finally open all the way, and that is basically what happens.  The other problem is the love story between Andrew and Sam (Natalie Portman), simply because the reason Sam likes Andrew is that Zach Braff, who plays Andrew, also wrote and directed the film.  So either the relationship only works because it is simply written that way or Sam puts a lot of faith in the opinion of a dog.  You decide.<br /><br />What Andrew discovers when he gets home is that while his life is pretty sad none of his old friends and acquaintances are doing any better.  He might think that his life does not make sense, but then he runs into Kenny, Jesse, Mark and a bunch of other guys he went to high school with and it is clear he is doing better than most.  This helps him start to get his mind wrapped around the idea that his glass might be half full instead of half empty, and we await either his final epiphany or for the character to crash and burn (remember the airplane bit at the beginning?).  At least with "Garden State" we know it can legitimately go either way.<br /><br />"Garden State" is more different than it is brilliant, which is what makes it stand out as an example of Independent filmmaking.  If you do not cotton to its Indy sensibilities and sense of humor, then there is a good chance this film will not click for you.  This is a film where what is considered funny are things like ordering bread in a Vietnamese restaurant, a hamster too dumb to figure out the rolling wheel, a couple living on a boat at the bottom of a quarry, and returning knives without a receipt.  "Garden State" is a dark comedy, stopping well short of being a black comedy, but just like eating chocolate some people will find it to be to dark to enjoy.  But Braff gets major props for including "One Of These Things First" by Nick Drake in the soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>Indie formula<br /><br />Boy, did I hate this movie.  Oh, there's parts to like.  Peter Sarsgard's perfomance is particularly good, and Portman also does well in her hopeful effort to break away from wooden Star Wars roles.  But overall, what writer/director/actor Zach Braff delivers is more of what has become Indie formula.  If you `ve seen (starting with) "The Graduate," "Donnie Darko," "Napoleon Dynamite," "The Royal Tennenbaums," "Rushmore," "Ghost World" and any number of other "indie" efforts, you've seen better versions of the same.  Actually, "The Graduate" isn't really an indie, but it nailed for all time the whole detached/alienated youth thing that has been a well for indie directors to go back to again and again. (But it also had terrific soundtrack to help it along.)  And you know the story: quirky boy or girl in quirky unexpected plots filled with quirky friends, with lots of dead stares (usually one or two from a couch) suggesting some kind of existential void that will be filled by movie's end (inadequately of course, since that is Life, but recognizing that fact is itself a victory - of sorts).  It's enough to make you want to sit down and watch Kill Bill, volumes 1 & 2, just to see something happen.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>There are a lot of scenes in this movie that made me realise these are things that I have thought of as a person and never talked about. Strangely I feel everyone of us can in some way or the other relate to certain feelings of mixed emotions. I think the direction in this movie stands out and the characters are just very interesting and un-movie like. There's no exaggeration whatsoever used to describe the story. It has some really amazing music being played throughout the flick. I've seen it once and I cant wait to give it a second watch.<br /><br />I dont think Garden State can be ignored. I'm not going to say its different because nearly every movie made nowadays is different. This one stands out cause its somehow very serene and enjoyable.

The soundtrack is excellent; the cast is great, the acting is very good, the story is interesting and Braff shows he has an excellent eye behind the camera.  I would recommend this film.<br /><br />Extras include two commentary tracks, one with Braff and Portman, the other with Braff and his DP, editor and production designer; 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary; a 27-minute making-of featurette; 3 minutes of outtakes; and a soundtrack promo.<br /><br />The film can be heard in English or Spanish with English, Spanish or French subtitles.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>This is an interesting movie worth seeing.  The theme that emerges, once you get to know the characters and their history well enough to put it all in perspective, is that the main character was damaged by psychiatric drugs all his life, his father being a psychiatrist who thought he knew what he was doing.<br /><br />When he was a little boy, our hero lost patience with his constantly complaining mom, and gave her a push.  She fell over something, injured herself, and spent the rest of her life crippled.  In response, the father put the kid on prescription drugs, his way of saying that the boy was dangerous and out of control.  The "fact" is that it was just an accident, and the little boy was not dangerous or out of control.  The mother was extremely annoying, so much so that she got her son to give her a little push out of frustration.<br /><br />Years passed, and then the woman accidentally drowned in her own bathtub.  Again, the father would want that to seem like the son's fault, for that push he gave his mom so many years ago.  He wouldn't want to take the blame on himself.  Personally I think he should have had a talk with his wife way back then, letting her know how inconsiderate it is to be complaining all the time.  If he had given her enough verbal pushes, maybe the child wouldn't have had to give a physical push.<br /><br />The father is ponderous.  By the end of the movie you realize what a villain he is.  Fortunately, most of the movie leaves him out of it.  It follows the son and his friends.<br /><br />His most interesting friend is Natalie Portman, a young woman with an odd sense of humor that has her making up tall tales.  Much is made of her being a "liar", but I don't see it that way.  Is a comedian called a liar for telling stories?  Once you accept the fact that Natalie's character enjoys putting people on with tall tales, I don't see a problem with it.  I'm fine with her sense of humor.  Can you only be considered a comic if you are getting paid for it?  Is a stage the only place you are allowed to put people on?<br /><br />One drawback of this film is that since the main character is supposed to be drugged into numbness, how do you make him interesting to watch?  I think the movie had to struggle with that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y0HX12MCT6OR.html">A1Y0HX12MCT6OR</a><br/><p>Zach Braff, tired of being lively and appealing on Scrubs, decided to do a 180 in his first (and hopefully last) feature film, where an emotionally stunted waiter (who's an aspiring actor) goes home after news that his mother has died; and here we follow the exciti-mind numbingly dull adventures of a narcissistic whiner who's unhappy (cue the violin).<br /><br />Here's a summary of Zach Braff's emotional range in Garden State: =I. Actually I think that emoticon had a little more range to it but basically Zach Braff looks bored or high or something throughout his movie. The hip fanboys will probably argue that the reason Zach Braff doesn't emote much is because he doesn't know how to express himself but unless you count dressing up in garbage bags and yelling into a hole, Zach Braff never shows any emotion or revelation or whatever the movie was going for, and it seems like an excuse for him to smoke a joint or whatever during the shooting (and probably pushing his crappy music on Natalie Portman).<br /><br />In fact it's not just Zach Braff's lack of acting, the whole movie just reeks of laziness. The set designs are boring and uninteresting, the directing is bland and completely uninspired, and the writing is typical indie garbage about *slightly* dysfunctional people doing *quirky* things like crying over a pet cemetary or wearing a shirt that matches the wall; wow, that's so deep/clever/original Zach Braff, anything else to say in your bloated turd of a movie besides 'let the little stuff go'? No? Wow, it's like a 2 hour fortune cookie, how deep man.<br /><br />I think I'd rather watch Scrubs: Interns Edition that this movie again. At least Zach Braff can use his facial muscles there.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Zach Braff of "Scrubs" fame wrote, directed and starred in "Garden State."  The flick has a lot of good ideas, but at its heart there is a sodden, dull story that cannot be enlivened by copious amounts of wit.<br /><br />Braff plays "Large," a once-successful actor now reduced to waiting tables in a Vietnamese restaurant.  He returns home to Jersey when his mother dies, stirring lots of ugly family history.  Once home, Large's emotional zombie-status becomes evident, but is almost matched by the toneless muddle of high school friends he runs into.  The only spark is Sam (Natalie Portman), who for some reason falls for this sack of dull platitudes.<br /><br />The script is too clever by half, invoking hamsters, silent velcro, an abyss, infomercials on real estate, and other inanities in an attempt at edginess.  The movie feels like it was written by a hyper-depressed writer cut loose from the sad last year of "Northern Exposure."  Couple this with a too-on-the-nose soundtrack and a wasted crop of actors (why, Ian Holm, why?), and you've got "Garden State."<br /><br />Here's hoping Mr. Braff can get past the quips and into some serious storytelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2004 film is supposed to be a comedy.  But it sure didn't get any laughs out of me.  Not even a giggle.  Zach Braff wrote it, directed it and starred in it.  I guess he's satisfied.  The film did well and it even got a couple of awards.  I just can't understand it.  This film was pretentious, stupid and boring.  And that's the nicest things I can say about it.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a young man, living in Los Angeles, who comes home to New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral. He's been on mood dulling medications since he was 9 years old but he decides to give them up cold turkey before he gets on the plane.  He's an anti-hero type.  In other words he's passive and wide eyed and an observer of the world rather than an active participant.  Along the way he meets Natalie Portman and a romance develops.  But there is a aura of sadness around the whole film because of a secret involving his mother's health that has deeply affected this troubled young man.<br /><br />I hated this film and the only reason I watched it all al was because I was with a friend who wanted to see it.  And so I managed to see it all, hoping it would get better as it went along.  It didn't.  This is an awful film.

My wife only hung in thru about 10 minutes, though I encouraged her to give the rest of the movie a chance as it really picked up once Natalie Portman got involved as Braff's new girlfriend. It's nice to know that she got such a fun role after (before?) suffering through her time as queen in Star Wars the last. The whole film has a grittier feel than "Spanglish", which helped make it more to my taste. It's R-rated, but aside from a few "MF's" and some fairly substantial drug and alcohol use in the first 10 minutes, the story's probably OK for kids down to 11 or 12 (at least by my standards). The movie also has an interesting mental health aspect at its core and should appeal to those who've lived with someone who's under a psychiatrist's care.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Garden State is actually a drug trip movie in reverse.  Whereas other movies about drug addiction subject the viewer through the insanity of hallucinations, silly antics, and run-ins with the law, Garden State starts out in the doldrums of a barbiturate-induced malaise.  Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) wanders aimlessly through life, suffering from a recurring nightmare that he's on a plane that's about to crash.  While everyone screams, "Large" just turns up the air.  That pretty much sums up his life.<br /><br />The death of Andrew's mother calls him home to New Jersey (Garden State, get it), and it's only then that the pieces start to fit together.  A quadriplegic, Mrs. Largeman and Andrew have a bitter past.  It doesn't help that his father, Gideon (the magnificent Ian Holm) alternately blames Andrew for his mother's condition and coldly distances himself from his son.  The confrontation between them is a long time coming.<br /><br />Along the way, Andrew reconnects with all of his old friends in Jersey.  It's not a particularly flattering portrayal. They're all in service roles, be it outrageously offensive police officers, meandering stoner gravediggers, or knights for the Medieval Times dinner restaurant.  Okay, that last job is cool.  But the character is a jerk.<br /><br />It seems that Andrew didn't miss much.  While he was on mind-altering medication as a struggling actor in Los Angeles, his friends (and in at least one case, his friends' mom) are all toking up in the mansion of a guy who invented "silent Velcro."  And yet, with all that money, all they do is waste it away getting high.<br /><br />Thankfully, that fate is not for Andrew.  Away from his drugs for the first time in his life, he begins to wake up and the audience is encouraged to wake up with him.  The film's music, dialogue, and camera angles shift from dreamy floating sequences to a much snappier pace.  It almost makes suffering along with Andrew worth it.<br /><br />The turning point is the arrival of Sam, played by Natalie Portman.  An inveterate pixie of a liar, she comes from a wacky household where burying pets (in the pet graveyard, of course) is a sacred obligation.  Fans of Portman always knew she could act, but Garden State forcefully reminds us as she ranges from timid vulnerability to passionate love, from heart wrenching sorrow to boundless joy. She turns Sam into a living, breathing woman and a worthy counterpart to the not-quite-awake Andrew.<br /><br />In between, a lot of things don't happen.  Andrew avoids his father but visits the bathtub where his mother drowned.  The question as to whether or not her death was a suicide is left hanging--except in the special features, where the confrontation between father and son is fleshed out.  They go to a lot of parties, visit some wacky characters, and go on a quest for a treasure at the bottom of an Abyss (Braf played Dungeons & Dragons, I can tell).<br /><br />Garden State's biggest flaw is that it wants to be an art film, a tale of redemption, a coming of age story, a father/son weeper, a small town homage, and a music video.  Because Braff also wrote and directed, his artist sensibilities are perpetually at war with what makes for a good story...and it's all on screen.  The beginning is slow and meandering, but that's on purpose and appropriate for an art film.  It doesn't make for a compelling story though.  The ending is forced and more than a little odd--there's a feint at a different ending, dancing at the edge of art-house sensibilities, only to pull back at the last second.  Which is a good thing too, because otherwise we'd end up with the same kind of non-ending as Lost in Translation.<br /><br />Ultimately, Garden State is about that verdant state of being in every one of us, the child who has no idea his actions will have repercussions for the rest of his life.  Returning to that raw human condition of love, hate, vulnerability and strength, elevates Garden State to more than just a hokey hometown film.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Zach Braff is a talented guy and in creating GARDEN STATE (first known as LARGE'S ARK) he demonstrates not only a sense of the looney and surreal, but a tidy handling of the fallout of emotional isolation that plagues many of our youth, our baby boomers, and yes, even our older fugitives from life.  It is rare when a film is conceived, written, directed and acted by one person and the result is a unique and timely little treasure like this one.<br /><br />Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) lives in Los Angeles as an actor and is in a vegetative state of emotional paralysis supported by mind-numbing medications.  A call from his cold and distant father (Ian Holm) informs him he is needed at home in New Jersey to attend the funeral of his physically paralyzed mother who has accidentally drowned in the bathtub. Andrew flies to New Jersey (in a film sequence of a crashing plane that is unexpectedly hilarious) to the family and friends he has not seen in nine years.  His friends include some of the quirkiest folks you're likely to meet: Mark (Peter Sarsgaard), Kenny the cop (Michael Weston), Dave (Alex Burns) among others.  These folks are all as odd as Andrew and it is only when Andrew encounters Samantha the chronic liar (Natalie Portman) that he is able to begin to absorbs Sam's lust for living and ultimately get a grip on his aimless life, face his demons (the major one having to do with his mother's paralysis...) and commit to change.<br /><br />The action is fast, with pauses for some absolutely ludicrous events that are at once hilarious and tender.  All of the actors are superb, with Portman, Braff and Sarsgaard the most outstanding.  It may take a while to filter the storyline and process of filming through your mind: this is creative filmmaking at a new level. But the ultimate effect is a piece of work that deserves repeated viewings and serves notice that Braff is a talent to watch. Grady Harp, December 2004</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Zach Braff (television's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y856DY">Scrubs</a>) is without question an immense and versatile talent.  He directs, writes, and acts as the film's main protagonist in Garden State, a film with flashes of near brilliance.  He is no doubt worth looking out for and deserves quite a bit of credit.  However, Garden State should be judged as a film without taking that into account and although it does contain some genuinely sweet moments and some even better moments of natural humor, it just isn't consistent in how compelling it was for me.  I'm sure that experience will be different for everyone but to me it contains some very unlikely and unnatural moments.<br /><br />Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a quasi-actor and full fledge waiter who returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral.  He stops taking his medication (he was on zoloft, depakote, and lithium among many others) and begins to awaken a little bit.  He meets old friends and reflects on his family life before he left his hometown.  He then meets a new friend named Sam (Natalie Portman) who helps him realize what is really important to him.  Although clich&eacute;, the film's end is satisfying and I can't pinpoint why but I really didn't expect it from a character I didn't like very much in Largeman.<br /><br />I want to believe that Garden State is semi-biographical for Braff, and it probably is (I might write a movie where I fall in love with Natalie Portman too) but if there are scenes influenced by reality, then it seems very simple to see which ones are and which ones are completely exaggerated for the sake of comedic storytelling.  The other thing that troubled me about Garden State was how selfish every character is.  It makes it very difficult to care about characters that you wouldn't have any respect for in real life.  The only exception to this Portman's Sam who is very likeable and quirky but is probably the only character that isn't based on some degree of reality.  I don't see any real serious undertones in Garden State or any real commentary beyond reflecting some aspect of real life.  It failed to do that for me and that's probably why it comes off as pretentious.  In some ways it really is only a few steps above pure teenage comedies because it wants to be adult so bad at times and maybe that is a strength for some people, but to me the way it masks its comedic goals with unconvincing drama is almost unforgivable.<br /><br />Garden State is in the frame of a very good movie and for the most part I didn't think it was as bad as I'm detailing here, I think I just couldn't identify with it.  Performances from Portman, Braff, Ian Holm, Peter Saargard and others are genuine, at times amusing, and overall pretty solid.  The actors do struggle at times with the more ostentatious and less believable dialogue. Portman is especially enjoyable to watch but you really wonder how long she can be the potentially great actress everyone has been waiting for.  Despite what some people may suggest, this movie is not the vehicle for Portman's career defining star moment, which may or may not ever come.  She probably doesn't care though and is fine slumming it in quirky little films like this that have very little to say.  Anyway, it is worth watching if you like the talent in this movie.  It shows some budding talent from Braff and some solid actors at work. It also happens to have a smart sense of humor that I suppose I appreciated.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J58LK">soundtrack</a> was great but also felt pretty consistent with Braff's hipster-wannabe motif.  Either way, I'll keep an eye out for his next movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>When we first see, Andrew Largemen (Zack Braff), he's a burnt out LA actor with what looks like a serious drug program.

Portman eschews beauty in every scene but manages to be cute and sweet and very emotionally evolved, which I liked.  She is of course beautiful and brilliant as everybody knows, but here she tries something different.  She strives to be ordinary and slight but with great emotive power.  Nice performance.<br /><br />The sound track which reminded this old guy of something from Simon and Garfunkel, and in fact there is a Simon and Garfunkel tune on it, was the sort of sweet, nostalgia-producing, alternative rock kind of sweet angst sound that lets you know that this is what youth is all about.<br /><br />Largeman, wanna-be and somewhat successful/somewhat failed actor out on loan, comes home from the big city to rural New Jersey because his mother has died, unaccountable in a bathtub--which can happen if you are a paraplegic.

Largeman unveils his sidecar mobile--the only thing willed from his grandfather's estate--with its white star on combat green, and tools around town, parties a little and meets quirky Samantha who likes to tell lies as a kind of way to deal with the world.  I knew a girl like that, only she knew when she was lying--if somebody caught her.  Sam figures it's a tick like Tourette's, and anyway her lies are harmless.<br /><br />The movie is sweet and mildly comedic with some original shtick, and at times a bit of a tear-jerker.  More than anything it's a touching love story, which I can never resist.  And, yes, it's very New Jersey like Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi, although no songs by them on the track--not to mention Elizabeth Shue who was a classmate of Braff's in high school.<br /><br />See this for Zach Braff who put a lot of his emotional life into the film and deserves the accolades he's received.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ACLV5KPB4W.html">A25ACLV5KPB4W</a><br/><p>This movie hangs on the understated performance of Zach Braff, who travels back to his small town home after his mother dies to deal with her death and his father, a psychiatrist who has kept Andrew (Braff) on lithium since he was 9 years old.<br /><br />The emotionally numb Andrew is coming off of his medication for the first time since he was a boy, and he meets Natalie Portman, a quirky girl who seems to love him. The film basically tracks Andrew as he spends time with high school friends and tries to come to grips with his mother's death.<br /><br />This sounds like a depressing movie, but it's really not. The emphasis is on the eccentricities, and unexplored corners, of small town life.  Something about this set of offbeat small-town characters is more realistic than the traditional Hollywood paean to the wackiness of rural life. Everyone has problems, and there's nothing cute or empowering about a grave-digging buddy who makes a habit of making off with the jewelry of the corpses he buries.<br /><br />The dialogue is particularly well done, with lots of unfinished thoughts, interrupted conversations, "likes" and "you knows" combining to make the interactions seem very real.<br /><br />For all the serious subject matter, this is actually an uplifting movie, with plenty of very funny comedic scenes that make and happy spots to make us feel good. One scene in particular, featuring a Medieval Times Knight who romances his friend's mother in Klingon, is very funny.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that abounds in independent film, but which has combined art and realism with the commercial value and production value that make it viable for a major studio to get behind it. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I had intended to see GARDEN STATE when it was in the theaters, but for some reason I never got around to it.  Then when it came out on DVD, I kept intending to see it, but for whatever reason didn't, until now.  As they say, better late than never, and I'll add that this ends a personal losing streak of seeing one disappointing movie after another<br /><br />The movie is basically about a struggling actor in Hollywood who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral.  Like so many movies involving a trip home, this one becomes a journey of self-discovery and renewal, as Andrew Largeman confronts the shape life has taken since the moment he caused a serious accident his mother suffered when he was nine.  Heavily medicated for most of his life, he resolves to get off the host of drugs he is on.  Meanwhile, just as he is determined to get off anti-depressants so that he can feel again, he meets a charming yet quirky girl who has her own set of problems.  For whatever reason, they click and embark on their own romance.<br /><br />Plot in a movie is not the same as execution, but luckily the film is executed marvelously, maintaining a perfect balance between funny but quirky weirdness and emotional authenticity.  The film is full of laughs, but it is much more than just a collection of laughs.  All in all, it is a very impressive movie.<br /><br />You have to love what Zach Braff did in this film.  Few have pulled off the triple feat of acting, writing, and directing as well as he did here.  What is remarkable is how well he managed all three.  As an actor, he is a performer of immense likeability.  I think if he manages to stay within the range of that fundamental likeability as an actor, he is going to have a remarkable career.  The general feeling is that next year will be the last for SCRUBS, which while a great vehicle for Braff is probably keeping him from the movie career that beckons.  I hope that at some point he returns as well to both writing and directing.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is enjoyable in her role as Sam, the epileptic girl he meets and falls in love with.  She is an actress.  I mean by that that she performs roles, she doesn't just play herself in films.  This isn't one of her most impressive performances to date, but it is further evidence of her considerable talent.  Unfortunately, much of her time was eaten up in recent years by the lamentable STAR WARS trilogy.  I'm very anxious to see what she does from here on out.  Her character gave me a bit of a pang because of the way it reminded me of a major ex-girlfriend of mine, who like Sam was a compulsive liar (as with Sam, she would lie on all manner of incredibly small--as well as big--things) and who also like same carried about the tattered remnants of her "blankey."  A definite moment of deja vu for me.<br /><br />GARDEN STATE contains one of the most celebrated soundtracks of recent years and it isn't an accident that it has enjoyed considerable success on its own.  In addition to all else that he did on the film, Braff picked out all the songs on the record.  It is a very well chosen selection.  I've often wondered how much of a role, if any, he plays in the music selection of music on SCBUBS, which has some of the best music of any show on TV.<br /><br />All in all, this is a superb movie.  If you like intelligent, serious yet eccentric comedy, you will almost certainly enjoy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>First off, for anyone thinking about getting this movie, go do it!! No matter what anyone has told you already about the film. I notice a lot of people writing that they didn't like Garden State and that's fine, I personally thought it was great. To me it was real life on film, and within that real life there are very different people. Unfortunately not everyone wants to see movies that remind them of reality, and I guess not everybody reality is the same as mine.<br /><br />After seeing this movie last night, it kept replaying in my mind for some reason. It reminded me of the movie "The Graduate" (no slight praise) for many reasons, not the least of which was the soundtrack which included a song by Simon and Garfunkel. I mean, why include an old song by S&G in the middle of a host of contemporary artists - it must have been done on purpose - right? And the pool scene, although different than Hoffman's, still serves to illustrate Andrew Largeman's alienation.<br /><br />Much like the " The Graduate," it was the little things that got to me. The escalators heading in two directions at the end, the making of a completely original dance, the touching of the father, the arc on the edge of the abyss, the silent Velcro...I could go on.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is a great actress and  I enjoy watching her on this films and others that she previously done. Playing the role of a goofy, epileptic but cute, hometown girl, she steals the show. She hits all the right notes. She is responsible for the death by tread-wheel of a loved one, she habitually lies, and she's slightly crazy, but Andrew and we can't help falling in love with her.<br /><br />Even so "Garden State" is well worth watching, if only to remind us that the comatose state most of us live in is only temporary, and the joy of a life well lived is forever. Movies like this are either rare or one of kind. I hope Braff (star, writer, and director) has a few more like this in him.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Garden State is a romantic comedy starring Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. Although the acting is quite good and the cinematography is excellent; you're going to have to like romantic comedies to enjoy this flick. Look also for a good performance by Ian Holm.<br /><br />When the action starts, a young man named Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral after being estranged from his family for nine years. Andrew has been moderately successful as an actor in California; but he is largely tormented by the pills his psychiatrist father gives him to keep him calm, or, as Andrew puts it, "numb." At the funeral (and after) Andrew meets up with some old buddies Mark, Dave and Jesse (Peter Sarsgaard, Alex Burns and Armando Riesco, respectively). They have some mildly fun times; but things go in a whole new direction for Andrew when he meets Samantha (Natalie Portman).<br /><br />Samantha and Andrew befriend each other and slowly Samantha's warmth and natural charm make Andrew feel true emotions again; this is helped in part by Andrew's going off his medication for the first time in many years. Although Andrew feels some pain and there are ups and downs with Sam, he slowly begins to trust her and they being together as friends.<br /><br />Of course, things get more complicated. What would happen if Samantha and Andrew start a romance and Andrew decides to go back to California? After all, he's only been in New Jersey four days when he has to return to his job in California. In addition, Andrew and his father (Ian Holm) have unfinished business to clear up between them--how will that work? And what about Andrew's guilt about an accident with his mother? No plot spoilers here, folks--get the movie and find out!<br /><br />The DVD comes with deleted scenes, "blooper" scenes, a running commentary by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman, the "making of" extra--and more. That's very good.<br /><br />Garden State is truly a film for those of us who like romantic comedies. I'm not especially wild about this genre; although I will admit that Garden State is one of the better romantic comedies out there. The acting is quite convincing; Natalie Portman shines on the screen. In addition, Zach Braff should be commended for writing a solid screenplay.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Sometimes a bit too cute and quirky, Garden State succeeds not because of its gallery of strange supporting characters, but rather because of the sweet and appealing (if somewhat predictable) romance between Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.</p></br></body></html>

But my excitement quickly faded when I saw what they had done to my favorite TV series.  C'Mon!  After all those years, THIS is the BEST they could come up with???  Well I almost skipped 'The Wrath of Kahn' altogether, but boy was I glad I went to see it opening night!  This started the whole craze of 'Only the even numbered Trek films are good'.  <p>What a GREAT idea to take a snippet from an earlier original episode and I believe they chose very well when they made 'Space Seed' the one they went with.  I have to admit, Ricardo has held up well over the years, and his acting and madness is well portrayed as Kahn.  From the best special effects (I believe) in the Trek films (yes, even the newer ones aren't any better) to a slam-bam plot that moves at warp speed, 'Kahn' is arguably the best of the Trek movies.  Despite the death of Spock, which is dealt with in Trek III (so so in the Trek world of theatrical movies) my ONLY gripe with this movie (and see if you don't agree) is in the final moments before the Genesis Device goes off in the Nebula, the ONLY thing I wish HAD happened that DIDN'T was Kahn died believing that the explosion would at least kill Kirk...wouldn't it have been great to see Kahn's reaction when the Enterprise goes to warp JUST BEFORE the device detonated? Aside from that minor complaint, this is definitely one of the all-time great Sci-Fi movies and like I said, arguably the best Trek film-to-date (with Trek VI coming in a close 2nd).  <p>Rush out and grab this on DVD, although as one other reviewer mentioned, it did NOT have the added bonus footage that was shown on ABC back in the 80's (I kinda expect this sorta stuff in the DVD editions...) and that left me wanting a bit, but other than that, a well made film and well directed by Nicholas Myer (who also was at the helm of 'The Undiscovered Country'). Trek fans rejoice, this is about as good as it gets.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>The most literate and character-driven Star Trek film, this second outing takes the series to a level not yet repeated. An aging Kirk goes head-to-head with old nemesis Khan (played with convincing wrath by Montalban) in a multi-layered story that ultimately forces him to confront his own flaws and mortality. Moreover, secondary characters, particularly Spock, shine in moments that may actually bring a tear to your eye. Superb special effects, a suitably nautical score by Horner, a wonderfully subdued tone marred only by occasional corniness, and a bravo performance by Shatner make this one a must-see. Although the DVD lacks extra scenes (strangely, shown on TV several times), the widescreen view allows your eye to savor details, even director Meyer's typical anachronistic ones (check out the "no smoking" sign and obvious 20th-century fire extinguishers.).</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>Good picture and sound, no extras other than a trailer. I hoped for a little more from this DVD. One I have in my collection because it's my second favorite Star Trek film. I might wait for a special edition version.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>Even those viewers who dislike Star Trek about as fervently as Trekkies love the show can enjoy this episode in the movie series...  I have never liked Star Trek, not even when I was a young kid, but I have to admit that  this stirring adventure movie had me thrilled.  This is the only ST movie  that I would recommned to the casual viewer, it combines human drama with  interesting special effects and (for once) interesting characters...I will  definately be adding this to my DVD collection</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI.html">A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI</a><br/><p>When "Star Trek: the Motion Picture" was released, fan reaction was mixed. Although eagerly awaited by Trekkies, the results were mediocre; the special effects seemed to be the true star, not the crew of the Enterprise. Nevertheless, the initial film did incredibly well, offset by the fact everyone were just plain happy to see the return of Kirk, Spock & Co.<br /><br />But no one was satisfied; not cast or crew or fans. Enter writer/producer Harve Bennett. He wanted to "build a better beast". And so, he got back to the original series' roots, screening all the old episodes. No ideas, that is, until he came across "Space Seed". Then he said, "That's it! We're bringing back Khan!" And that's how "Star Trek II" was born.<br /><br />TWOK (The Wrath of Khan) brings the Trek saga back to story & characterization, with a smattering of morality. The film explores the passage of time: growing old while still playing a "young man's game"; the contrast between seasoned crew members and their young trainees; sacrifice, death and hope; and how vengeance can be all-consuming.<br /><br />The latter statement, of course, refers to Khan, reprised with delicious zeal and double-dyed villiany by Ricardo Montalban. If done wrong, his role could have come off as laughable (his wig and garb make him look like an aging 80's metal rocker!). But instead, Montalban turns in an amazing performance, portraying a tyrant seething with rage and revenge for the past 15 years. An opportunity lands in his lap to exact revenge on Kirk, and he does not hesitate to take it.<br /><br />Most controversial was the demise of Trek's beloved Vulcan, Spock. The death scene is played beautifully between Nimoy and Shatner, and the eulogy is very touching: "..Of all the souls I've encountered in my travels, his was the most..human..of all."<br /><br />The dogfight inside the nebula, in which both ships "fly blind" with no sensors or shields, was well-staged and exciting.<br /><br />Fine supporting turns from Bibi Besch (Kirk's former lover, Carol Marcus), Kirstie Alley (Lt. Saavik, Alley's first film role), and Merritt Butrick (Kirk's son, David; sadly, Butrick died young in 1989), as well as the original crew.<br /><br />"The Motion Picture" may have been their first screen adventure, but TWOK is definitely the best; for it set the legend on the right course and cast the mold for future films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"I have been & always shall be your friend. Live long & prosper."<br /><br />"Of my friend..., I can only say this. Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels. His was the most- .... human."<br /><br />- Captain Spock says goodbye to his close friend while Admiral Kirk honors the fallen in "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan".<br /><br />After 22 summers (to the day) "Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan" is still the movie that "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" wanted to be and after ten films in the "Star Trek" saga, "II" is still the film that all other "Trek" films are measured up to (for me personally, this one is tied for first with "Star Trek: First Contact").<br /><br />Admiral Kirk and the crew of The Enterprise face an old enemy (Khan Noonian Singh) from the television series (see the episode entitled "Space Seed").<br /><br />Simplistic plot, but, what makes the film work so well is:<br /><br />1. - The crew act there age & try not to be the young crew they tried to be in "The Motion Picture".<br /><br />2. - Admiral Kirk has a mid-life crisis as his past catches up with him in the form of the son he hardly knows.<br /><br />3. - Khan seeks revenge for the death of his wife (the Enterprise historian from the T.V. episode). Wouldn't you?<br /><br />4. - Aside from the senior staff, The Enterprise crew is made of cadets, giving the film an extra element of danger(the plotpoint w/ Scotty's cadet nephew is one of the extended scenes in the film).<br /><br />5. - The senior staff, unlike in the T.V. series, is expendable (Scotty gets a bout of radation poisining, Checkov becomes Khan's hostage, and Spock, ..., well you know. I won't give that away for the 2 people who haven't watched the film).<br /><br />6. - The Genesis Project is one of the most dangerous of all "Trek" weapons, yet, it was never meant to be one.<br /><br />7. - The battle in the Mutara Nebula is classic "Star Trek" all the way (the Nebula is featured again in one of the episodes from "Star Trek: The Next Generation". I think, it might be The Best of Both Worlds Part I).<br /><br />8. - Cherish what you have before its gone and a renewed sense of purpose is never a bad thing.<br /><br />Quite a lot of detail was put into this film.<br />Gone are the disco style uniforms from the previous film. In its place, are the now classic, military/naval style uniforms complete with rank pips and badges.<br />The effects are a lot better than in "TMP". The first digital effects featured in a film are of the Genesis Proposal and were made by Pixar (the company would go on to super success with, the 1995 film, "Toy Story").<br /><br />Origianlly titled the "Undiscovered Country", but, was replaced by the title "Vengeance of Khan". It was retitled to "The Wrath of Khan" when Paramount found out that the last "Star Wars" film would be titled "Revenge of The Jedi" (that would be changed to "Return of The Jedi").<br /><br />This 2 disc extended edition of "Star Trek II" has everything but the kitchen sink thrown in (its lightyears ahead of the drab first DVD release). What I like most about these special releases is the triva track option that can run at the bottom of the screen without blocking out any of the screen itself.<br /><br />This version of "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan", is a 2 disc set that will live long & prosper. Steady as she goes, Mr. Sulu.</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>What makes Star Trek 2 truly exceptional is the menacing, scene-chewing villainy of KHAN himself. This character, and Motalban's performance, saved the Trek franchise from oblivion.<br /><br />For me, the greatest sequence of the film is Khan's introduction on Cetti Alpha 5. He is absolutely magnetic, as you watch him piece together the entire sequence of events in a brilliant work of exposition. James Horner does a wonderful job of culling themes from the old series to underscore the drama. From this point on, the film jumps to life whenever Khan is on screen.<br /><br />As for the rest of the plot -- it's vintage Trek, a tad earnest, but solid. The infamous scene at the end is very well played, but becomes a bit over the top with Amazing Grace pumping etc. Nicholas Meyer's tendentious sentimentality and curt dialogue, Moby Dick references and the rest make for fast-paced, snappy scenes but frequently lapse into hokum. See "The Undiscovered Country" for much worse abuses.<br /><br />But to get back to Khan for just a moment. For any fan of "The Space Seed" is bound to be disappointed. In that 50-minute episode Khan is given about twice the screen time that he is here. The entirety of his background, his temperment, his psychology is delved into. He has some magnificent clashes with Kirk and turns a woman into a simpering slave. In Star Trek II, Khan and Kirk do not even confront each other in person. This is a major disappointment.<br /><br />Yet I give the script credit for taking a situation directly out of the Trek universe and turning it on its head; Kirk finally cannot cleverly escape the clutches of a determined enemy. Khan is too unrelenting; he is the engine of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a big disappoint for me. I found the story boring and slow.  But, this isn't about the first Star Trek movie.  This is about the improved sequel, The Wrath of Khan.  And so begins the curse of the Star Trek movies.  The Curse--as everybody knows--is that only the even-numbered Star Trek movies are good ones.<br /><br />  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan shows no signs of the previous movie.  It has colorful uniforms and a good villain.  And it has William Shantner's "KHAAAANN!" yell.<br /><br />  It's the 23rd century, and Kirk is now an Admiral.  An old enemy of his comes back for revenge.  Khan, a superhuman from the 1990's, is angry with Kirk for leaving him on a planet.  Of course, Kirk defeats Khan, but Spock dies at the end...or does he?</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>A good rule to remember with the Star Trek motion pictures is to watch only the even numbered ones (2, 4, and 6) and avoid the odd numbered ones (1, 3, and 5.) Taken all together, this is the best Star Trek to be released on motion picture. It offers a pleasant recap of unfinished business presented in the original TV series and, it has all the requirements for a great film in terms of direction, script, and cinematography.<br /><br />  The film addresses the uncertain fate of Kahn (Ricardo Montalban) and his minions who first appeared in the original episode titled 'Space Seed.' Kahn is a product of the past when the Earth was embroyled in a eugenic war. Kahn and his followers were banished from Earth and sent to roam empty space in their ship, The Botany Bay, in cryogenic freeze. After running into the Enterprise and coming out of his slumber, Kahn sought to take over Kirk's ship but his plot was foiled: Kahn and his crew were placed on the uninhabited planet of City Alpha 5 to spend the rest of their days in exile. The film starts at a much later period where Federation men accidentally run into Kahn's colony. Kahn escapes and seeks vengeance on Kirk for having abandoned him on a desolate planet. With guile and cruelty, Kahn seizes a new machine that can be transformed into the most destructive weapon the Federation has ever seen. Will Kirk and his crew stop him in time?<br /><br />  Ricardo Montalban is definitely the shining star in this movie. His expressions of rage and obsession are quite impressive. The rest of the cast (Shatner, Kelley, Nimoy, etc.) perform their usual Enterprise routine pretty well. The film has a fast-moving plot with a good script and great special effects. This is truly the gem of all Star Trek motion picture films.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The success of Wrath of Khan caught Paramount by surprise. The budget was scaled down after the expensive ST:TMP and expectations were down as well. Nicholas Meyer and Harve Bennett made the right move; they went after a classic Trek episode (Gene Coon's &quot;Space Seed&quot;)and recognized a great villian to play against Kirk in Khan. <p>Admiral Kirk has stepped down from &quot;the chair&quot; yet again and is involved in Star Fleet's Academy training. Captain Spock's latest class will be training on the Enterprise and Kirk's going along for the ride along with McCoy and the core of his seasoned crew. <p>Meanwhile, on planet Seti 5 Chekov has transported down to a barren, desolate world racked by sand storms strong enough to strip skin from bone. He and the captain of a Federation science vessel are checking for life on the planet. It seems that Kirk's ex Carol Marcus and her son David have designed a terraforming &quot;bomb&quot; that literally creates life from destruction; it changes any planet it strikes into a thriving planet with living plants within a matter of days. This revoltionary approach has drawbacks; any planet &quot;Genesis&quot; strikes will produce life but it will destroy any pre-existing life forms. So Chekov and his captain are forced to investigate the planet to rule out any chance that there is life.<p>Unfortunately, the only life forms on Seti Alpha 5 are ghosts from Kirk's past. Khan, the genetically engineered superhuman Kirk encounter twenty some years before, was deposited on the planet with his followers. Evidently, Seti-Alpha 6 the planet they were marooned on by Kirk was thrown into a new orbit when one of the other planets exploded. It changed the atmosphere from paradise to poison. Khan's ticked off and wants revenge. He sees &quot;Genesis&quot; as a means to an end--it will be bait to lure Kirk to him and allow him to kill his enemy at the same time.<p>While traveling with Spock on the cadet training mission, Kirk gets a desperate call  Carol Marcus. Marcus received a message from Chekov that Star Fleet intended to take Genesis away from Marcus and her research team before they've had a chance to try it on a planet wide scale. She had been told this was done at Kirk's command. Kirk, perplexed, tries to reason with her but communication is lost. Suddenly, the Enterprise and her crew are going to be thrown into harm's way with a madman waiting for them.<p>Meyer's only previous movie was the strong time travel film Time After Time. He wasn't familiar with Trek. That was his advantage. His take on Trek was Hortiao Hornblower in outer space. Meyer, Bennett and screenwriter Jack Soward moved action back into the Trek universe with a tale of revenge and rivalry. Wrath of Khan stands as one of the best Trek  films produced.<p>This Director's Special Edition features the extended version that Meyer had wanted to release originally. It includes many new scenes and a couple of minor subplots (such as Scotty's nephew surviving on the Enterprise which gives a new meaning to one particular shot near the end)restored to the film. The beautifully transferred DVD is in anamorphic widescreen (which basically means that the way it was transferred allows for more resolution and better clarity particularly for progressive scan DVD players and widescreen televisions). There's very few problems with the picture and the sound is stunning particularly when compared to the earlier laserdisc and DVD versions. The first disc also includes a fascinating running commentary from Meyer and Trek factoids that appear on screen. They range from interesting to funny as heck. The text display is particularly interesting after you've watched the movie the first time to capture all the action. They provide interesting tidbits about the production of the film itself as well.<p>The second disc features all the extras with the exception of Meyer's commentary track. There's a number of great featurettes that provide a wealth of background on how the film came to be, Meyer's involvement and the cast &amp; crew's take on the finished product. There's also a section devoted to the ILM optical effects, publicity materials and trailers. <p>There's also a booklet listing the chapters, special features and a nice picture of the original cast included (something Paramount neglected to include for Star Trek VI--shame on you Paramount!). Although there are some minor science errors, they're easy to overlook as the action and entertainment value of the film exceptional. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>I like this one better than the first one, although I'm not sure my reasons are fair ones. When the first movie was made, they did not know how the public was going to react. By the time they got to this one, they'd already had millions of fans screaming "More! More!" and they knew it would sell. So they could afford to spend a bigger budget, including for script writers.<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban is Muy Macho as Khan, a criminal who had been been born in the 20th century, was frozen for long enough to emerge in the 23rd century with his band of genetically altered hippies (OK, maybe they are not quite like hippies, but that's what I kept seeing). Fifteen years ago, by Federation time, Kirk had pronounced sentence on him and marooned him (with adequate supplies) and his crew on an apparently barren planet. [Anyone remember the episode? Can you write the title and a brief synopsis in the comments?]<br /><br />Meanwhile, Spock is in command of the Enterprise, and out on a training mission with a bunch of inexperienced recruits, including an attractive female Vulcan who, for some reason, is consistently referred to as Mister. But when word comes that Space Station Regula One, which is commanded by an old girlfriend of Admiral Kirk's, is in trouble and they need to respond, Kirk takes over as commander of the ship and Spock goes back to being science officer.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Chekhov has been assigned to another ship, apparently second in command to an elegant black captain whose name I unfortunately cannot recall. Their ship is captured by Khan, who takes them over as puppets with the aid of the larval form of "the only natural life form" on the planet. A nasty thing, it enters through the ear and renders the victim a puppet to be controlled by Khan. So they are running the other ship for Khan, and of course Kirk trusts Chekhov and so believes what he says in communication.<br /><br />That's the set-up; just in case you haven't seen it, I won't give anything much away. Suffice it to say that you should keep your eye on the chief scientist's son.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>I only own the old trek movies, none of The Next Generation Movies. The great thing about this movie, is they took a great villain from the old T.V show. And Brought him into the present, I've always thought this movie was the best in the entire series. We get to see Kirk find out he has a son, and briefly reunite with his ex. Plus Spock's sacrafice at the end to save the ship, now I know the next generation tried to recapture this magic in "Nemesis". But failed to recognize, what this movie does. There was history between Khan and Kirk, Kahn was marooned by Kirk on a planet, after he tried to take over the enterprise. But was defeated by Kirk, years later. A scientific expadition, finds Kahn and what's left of his group. He steals the ship, and heads out for revenge. Ending in a head on battle with Kirk, not just once, but twice. And both times being outsmarted by Kirk, a very awsome movie</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Wrath of Khan" is my favorite "original cast" Star Trek movie and it was the one I used to introduce the series to my kids after having them first watch the episode "Space Seed", which the movie was based on.<br /><br />No spoilers from me: The story starts with the search for a suitable planet to test an new Federation funded science experiment entitled "Genesis" that ends up encountering the survivors of the "Botany Bay", lead by Khan(Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n) who was (in the "Space Seed" episode) marooned by Kirk. While this was happening, Admiral Kirk was helping to train a new crew of mostly cadets on the Enterprise and, as fate\writers would have it, happened to be in the area when Khan takes an interest in the Genesis project. From there we learn more about Kirk's past, get introduced to new characters (Lt. Saavik), here Kirk yell "KHHAAAAAAANNN" (love that), and get the plot device to make the next movie.<br /><br />Despite several liberties taken with the previous story line, like Chekov being recognized by Khan when he was not cast in "Space Seed", this gets most important elements right and is a good representation of the Star Trek franchise.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>In fact, one of the best SF movies they've ever made.<br /><br />Very few people are fans equally of Star Trek and Star Wars.  You may like both, but at some point you prefer one over the other.  This is movie is so good that, if you're one of the Star Wars partisans, you'll consider converting.<br /><br />Brilliant pacing, brilliant script, brilliant villain, brilliant ending.  I love to complain about movies but am drawing a blank on this one:  what's not to like?<br /><br />As just one example of how good the script is:  the movie starts off with the vaunted Admiral Kirk effin' up.  And it's a royal f-up, too.  You just wanna smack him, but that's what makes the script so excellent.  If he had put those shields up as per Starfleet regulations, he would have been boring and predictable, like Aeneas.  As it is, he's human and believable, and that failing draws you into the film.  Definitely the best moment in a movie filled with great moments:  when Kirk fails to say "shields up".<br /><br />Wish all these Star Trek films were as good.</p></br><a href="../users/AFLQGO7CJVK50.html">AFLQGO7CJVK50</a><br/><p>Star Trek is too boring compared to Star Wars, some say. This changes that. This movie is about two ships and two captains battling for their lives in a duel to the death. Nemesis is the same concept. This focuses more on battle than drama. If you like a more action-packed form of sci-fi, this is for you. All-star cast including Ricardo Montalban(Fantasy Island.etc.) and the usual Star Trek original cast. Easily a better Star Trek choice along with Nemesis.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>All the other Star Trek films (including the recent reboot) are thin soup compared to this film. Nuff said.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>So I originally posted this review with 3 stars, going into great detail and complaining about how incompetent a villain Khan was.  And then it took some time and thinking to realize the film isn't about Khan---it's about revelation and realization, that terrible sensation that is a common trope in any adventure series featuring close friends: the moment where one realizes that they are not invincible.<br /><br />Admiral Kirk has gone through the vast majority of his career smoothly, a stalwart hero as likely to resolve a conflict with words as with fists, and always able to rely on his trusty friends.<br /><br />And he's bored.  He's old, he's bored, and he can't stand it.<br /><br />His career-long invincibility was actually a crutch to him, as he had glided through for so long, always having an escape plan or a secret option to escape from defeat.  The Kobayashi Maru "no-win scenario" running plot-MacGuffin is in no way a Red Herring---it comes back around and smashes Kirk in the face when he realizes his refusal to accept a no-win scenario worked for him in the past, but it will never truly work out in the end.<br /><br />Spock dies.  That's not a spoiler; it's a forgone conclusion.  Spock's death isn't just a tacked-on "SHOCKING SWERVE~!" thing I had originally called it in my review.  Spock's death was in no way something to justify Khan being considered such a fiendish villain.<br /><br />Spock's death was that moment, that revelation.  It was the moment Kirk realized there IS no cunning solution to the Kobayashi Maru.  It was the moment Kirk realized he is NOT invincible.  Indeed, Khan (at least until movie three) did exactly what he wanted to do to Kirk---he hurt him.  And he made sure Kirk would go on hurting, for a long while.<br /><br />Kirk himself states at the end that he "feels young".  In fact, he does.  Having lost his best and closest friend, he is suddenly shown that he is not immortal, and he cannot loll through missions and commands expecting everything to work out in the end because it's "Star Trek".  He has cheated death all his life through all his missions, and death finally strikes him, not where it could do the most damage, but where it could HURT him most significantly.<br /><br />Khan is still a lackluster villain to me.  Ricardo Montalban is magic with his acting talent, and brings an epic, operatic quality to Khan Noonien Singh.  But that's about it.  There's a huge multitude of parallels with Khan, the character and the movie, involving "Moby Dick" and "Hamlet" and "King Lear", and spectacularly executed with Khan's mirroring of Captain Ahab, blindly chasing his quarry, to the death and destruction of himself.<br /><br />Above all, it's worth mentioning this is NOT an action movie.  It's an insult to this movie and it's dramatic, operatic quality to call it as such, especially when comparing it to "Star Trek: The Motion Picture".  It's a common barb of fans of The Motion Picture to claim people like Wrath of Khan more because it's more action-packed.<br /><br />No, it's not.  People like Wrath of Khan more because of the STORY and the depth and skill by which it is told, with deep themes on weighty issues such as death, aging, rebirth, and revenge, that resonate through all time, and are handled in a highly complex manner which most people would completely miss from their first viewing of the film, likely due to the stigma of "geekiness" and "goofy garbage" that Star Trek has.<br /><br />"The Motion Picture" was an adaptation of a failed TV series pilot featuring the original crew.  It involved a 30 minute story dragged out to nearly 2 hours, with blatant padding all around, from a FOUR MINUTE UNCUT sequence of just Kirk and Scott looking at the Enterprise while SLOWLY flying around it in a transport pod, to EVEN MORE SEQUENCES EVEN LONGER of the crew just staring into V'Ger's cloud, and arbitrarily cutting back to people's faces as they stare out the window.  "2001" Star Gate sequence this ain't.<br /><br />The Motion Picture was full of long periods of nothing, and a very powerful theme of obsession---that of Kirk with command of the Enterprise---that was childishly "resolved" not by any character development or revelation, but by having the one person opposing his command (Decker) conveniently exit the picture without really dying, but more or less dying.<br /><br />Wrath of Khan does not avoid any weighty issues or themes.  There is no quickfix solution to anything.  Kirk can't just have Khan's ship explode, then shield the Enterprise in some kind of Nebular vacuum spot where he can survive the Genesis explosion.  Kirk can't just blast Khan out of the sky and fly home victorious.<br /><br />In some way, Kirk has earned redemption in this film for all the swaggering and slickness of his days of youth in The Original Series.  He is hurting, and he will go on hurting...<br /><br />At least until Star Trek III: Search for Spock.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" is the superior sequel to the turgid Motion Picture. It outshines its predecessor with its galactic adventure, and an ancient feud. Adm. Kirk learns his ex-wife (or ex-girlfriend? It's not clear) and their son David are making the Genesis device, capable of making new life. It terraforms. There's some family drama. Kirk's ex is still angry about her abandonment; David is a wimpy mama's boy. What threatens to become As the Galaxy Turns becomes adventurous when Khan Noonien Singh (a wonderfully villainous Ricardo Montalban) is awakened. Khan is a genetically engineered superman; will he finally have his revenge on Kirk?<br /><br />"Wrath of Khan" has some powerful moments- from Montalban as the stylish villain to the spectacular worldmaking powers of the Genesis device. Khan sticks a particularly gross worm into Chekov's ear (you don't SEE anything,but the implications are hideous enough) Mr. Spock sacrifices his life for the crew.<br /><br />"Wrath of Khan" is one of the superior Star Trek films.

Lots of memorable lines.<br />*Strong themes about life and death, birth and rebirth, and growing old.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A few bloody bits (mostly involving alien bugs that burrow into people's ears); probably not for young kids or the extremely squeamish.<br /><br />Definately the best of the "Star Trek" film saga.  It does away with the dull space-opera elements of the first film and provides a smashing extravaganza of space battles, epic story-telling, and intense character conflicts.  The writing is totally awesome, and presents loads of great lines and dramatic acting.  It's a classic in every sense.<br /><br />The original one-disc release has okay video and sound quality, and includes a trailer.  The newer two-disc set has good quality and sound, and a bunch of fascinating featurettes and trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Despite the fact that the first Star Trek motion picture rekindled an interest in the show, there existed a disconnect between the style/feel of the Original Series TV show and the style/feel of the first movie.  In The Wrath of Khan, however, the focus shifts back to what made the show a success in the first place: great acting and character developement, subtle humor, action/adventure scenes, and some thought-provoking concepts.<br /><br />In this film, a few members of the U.S.S. Enterprise stumble across an old nemesis from the TV show...Khan, a ruthless dictator who will stop at nothing to get his revenge on Captain Kirk, the man who imprisoned him.  At the same time, Kirk is struggling with his advancing age, coming to terms with the fact that he will not be a starship captain forever.  The final showdown between Kirk and Kahn will have you on the edge of your seating, rooting for the swashbuckling Kirk more than ever before.<br /><br />This movie also does a great job of showcasing the "auxiliary" characters (Uhura, Chekhov, Sulu, Scotty, etc.), who more often than not got the short end of the spool in the TV show.<br /><br />For devoted fans of the show, the final scene is likely the most gut-wrenching of any movie or TV episode, as fan-favorite Spock must make a split-second decision that will alter his life forever.<br /><br />To conclude, if you are just beginning your voyage through the Star Trek universe (and don't have time to watch all the episodes), this is the film you want to start with, as it remains true to the ideals/concepts that made Star Trek such a cultural phenomena.  For those of you who watched the first Star Trek film and were disappointed, take heart, as this film will have you running to your local video store to check out the next installment in the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Star Trek: The Motion Picture was the first time Star Trek hit the big screen.  The movie was a visual feast (for its time) and was a success at the box office.  But when it came down to it, it lacked a certain punch and was labeled as "just boring and too long".  Plans continued for a sequal, and director Nicholas Meyer was brought on board for Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan.  He was one of the many who agreed that The Motion Picture was lacking and was boring.  He had a new vision, and created a very different Star Trek movie.  The Wrath of Khan worked off a much smaller budget, but in return, gambled the Trek franchise with a very dark approach and cetainly a strong punch.<br /><br />One of the great things about The Wrath of Khan is that its a story that continues from an early TOS episode titled "Space Seed", where a gentically engineered superhuman from the 1990's named Khan failed in attempt to capture the Enterprise.  He and his men were sent to a planet known as Ceti Alpha V to begin their own desired life.  In the Wrath of Khan, we learn that the planet has nearly been destroyed, and Khan's people barely survived.  Khan blames Captin Kirk for not checking on their progress, and has a heart filled with hatred and revenge for the good Captain.  Certainly, seeing Space Seed will allow this move to make more sense, but honestly I saw this first as a kid and I still loved it.<br /><br />Khan is the main villain and the center of the plot, but there are various subplots in the film that keep the interest at high levels throughout the story.  There is a device known as Genesis that can practically create life onto dead planets.  A controversial matter is the least to worry about, since Khan is interested in obtaining this device - in addition to obtaining the life of Captain Kirk.  There is another subplot of the character development of Kirk.  He is an admiral, and is uncomfortable with the position.  It makes him feel old and worn out.  Kirk is looking for something to give him refeshment again.  Then there's Spock, who claims the good of the many outweighs the good of the one, and folows up on that with action in the film's conclusion that is shocking and moving.<br /><br />Wrath of Khan is different than the Motion Picture in every way possible.  Overall, the film has a dark tone, and that is justified with lighting and camera work.  Even the uniforms and bridge have obtained a more refined look.  There is actually some violence this time, and a creepy scene with critters known as Ceti-Eels driving themselves into human ears.  The Enterprise gets blasted like never before in spectacular space battles throughout the film against the USS Reliant (which Khan and crew have taken over).<br /><br />Just when the franchise was in trouble, a risk was taken with the production of this film, and it was a tremendous success.  Obviously, since another 8 movies have folled (and another one in production today) and another 4 television series.  Wrath of Khan shows a darker side of Trek, yet still keeping the classic feel there in the mix.  And in the end, Khan is arguably one of the finest Star Trek villains ever to hit the screen, with a must see performance by the extremely underrated Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />This director's cut includes deleted/extended/redone scenes that were not included in the original.  Trek fans will want to makes sure they own a copy of this for the distinct differences.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Ever Since I saw the press for this, I have been meaning to get the version here.As for the rating, if this is the Directors cut, then there is no way this should be PG-13;Personally I would like to see more options in these genres for unrated( especially when Adults make the principle purchase).That having been said, I still think that this film is very family friendly, even more so than most news casts.<br />I suspect that most people buying this will know the story, however some may not know that some edits were made, and this cut restores some.Anyways, the film has the most amazingly great audio and video.In 5.1 this film is superb.from start to finish this is a great ride.Wether you have never seen this film before, or if you are wanting the collectors cut, this is a gem.<br />THE DVD.<br />The Commentary.I am always ambivalent about Nicholas Meyers' commentary, however here he has come as close as he seems able to come to a balanced commentary, that is... informative and entertaining.The Second disc extras are great...a bit conflicting ( Shatner now compared to Shatner in 82 with his Attitude about the plot points), and the coverage of the Star Trek Universe... well, I guess Hard Core Trekkies wedge in some-how, and I could care less about that part of the bonus, but thankfully the WRATH OF KHAN is overall a great collection. Hopefully I can complete my set of these DVDs before  the series sells out.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>After a sluggish, bloated first "Star Trek" movie, director Meyer steers the franchise back to more familiar and exciting territory with this entry.

Wrath of Khan is not just a STEP up, it is a LEAP up.... it is LEAPS AND BOUNDS above its predecessor and dare I say the movies that followed.<br /><br />None of the series of movies had this level of conflict, tension and emotion.

It is an especially windy barren desert.  They find a cargo ship and inspect it inside.  Chekov (Walter Koenig) begins to remember a few items when suddenly he recalls Botany Bay.  He quickly warns Captain Terrell that they must leave now.  They are captured by a crew.  The leader unveils his face protection.  It is Khan! Khan (Ricardo Montalban) recognizes Chekov and decides to hold both men hostage.  Khan explains that their were 70 of his crew on Ceti Alpha 5, but when Alpha 6 exploded, it sent Ceti Alpha 5 off course.  Kirk never bothered to check on Khan's progress.  Khan shows the men an overgrown earwig that killed his wife and other crew members.  He puts a young earwig into Chekov and Terrell's ear as it wraps around inside to grow causing excruciating pain and madness.  Khan demands to know how to find James T. Kirk.  Khan wants revenge.<br />  Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch) who is creating a new planet surface called, Genesis, also has another surprise for her former boyfriend of 20 years ago, Kirk's son, David (Merritt Butrick).<br />  All of the original cast members are present including John Winston as "Kyle" who also appeared in the first STAR TREK tv series (1966-69).<br /><br />  We have known Ricardo Montalban from his films and the "Fantasy Island" tv movies, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AO9D5E">Return to Fantasy Island</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8IA3U">Fantasy Island - The Complete First Season</a> tv series (1977-84).

What happened to the "Star Trek" saga, well Nicholas Meyer directed only a few of the "Star Trek" films, and maybe thats why some of these film are horrible. I hate "Star Trek" now, they replaced Admiral James t. Kirk(yes I said his full name) with Patrick Stewart, who plays a different captain, what were these guy's thinking(I think it maybe Patrick Stewart, I haven't kept up). "The Wrath Of Khan" quotes the most famous line of them all,"Revenge is a dish best served cold." I love that line, it should be in the hall of fame of famous lines, like that line in "Titanic" "I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD."<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />It is the 23rd century. The Federation Starship U.S.S. Enterprise is on a routine training and Admiral James Kirk(William Shatner) seems resigned to the fact that this may well be his last mission of his career. But Khan is back.<br /><br />This is a very good film, but it doesn't even compare to "The Search for Spock", that is my favorite "Star Trek" film.</p></br><a href="../users/A16YCLRKOU0EV3.html">A16YCLRKOU0EV3</a><br/><p>What makes this movie great is the conflict between Kirk and Khan and the fact that it's a sequel to an episode of the show.

But ST2, ah ST2, that had Ricardo Mantalban giving William Shatner's scene chewing a run for it's money.<p>In fact, Shatner is relatively subdued for the better part of the movie. His Captain Kirk is feeling his age and faced with an estranged son that would prefer to remain estranged. Lost love and missed opportunities, and a tight reign from director Nicholas Meyer (Time After Time, ST6), help keep Shatner in check.<p>Also marks the screen debut of Kirstie Alley as Lt.

It certainly did a lot more to please long time fans and draw in new ones, than did The Motion Picture.  Drawing on a very powerful character from the original episode, Khan Noonien Singh. Ricardo Montalban delivers a powerful performance.  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForrest Kelly and all the other original characters do a wonderful job of bringing their characters to life in this film.<p>The Director's Edition is a true joy, containing everything that should've been put on this DVD when it was originally released.  Being an avid fan of the Star Trek books, the feature with Greg Cox (one of the best trek authors) and Julia Ecklar (half of the LA Graf writing team) was a pure joy.  Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is a pure Sci-Fi, genre masterpiece and the Director's Edition DVD is a must for your collection!</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>MY REVIEW.  Rank #1 of 10.  A sequel to a TV episode.  How often does a bad movie have a sequel that is a vast improvement over the first movie.  Well it happened here.  In fact the second ST movie is my number 1 ST movie ever, though first contact was a temping alternate choice.  But, if WOK had been a second dude, would that have been the end of star trek?  I am glad we will never know.  Shatner is great in this and Montalban may have had his best role as khan in this movie.  We also learn the secret of kirks success in &#65533;cheating&#65533; death.  He CHEATS DEATH by the book.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>"Now, this is more like it!"<br />So wrote film critic Janet Maslin in June of 1982 when Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan opened nationwide.<br /> You see, even though millions of Star Trek fans had flocked to see Star Trek: The Motion Picture in December of 1979, the reaction was, shall we say, mixed. Oh, sure, fans were happy to see Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest of the crew back in action. Yes, the redesigned USS Enterprise was impressive, as were all the visuals. And that Jerry Goldsmith score was just fabulous.<br /> Yet, for all that, Star Trek I was also a big letdown. And even though the attempt of the producers to make an intelligent, non-Star Wars science fiction story was laudable, the first of the 10 feature films did not fire up the imagination. Wags, according to David Gerrold in his book The World of Star Trek, dubbed it Star Trek: The Motionless Picture and Spockalypse Now.<br /> However, Paramount's accountants and executives did see good, if not Star Wars-sized, box office rentals, and they decided to give the franchise another chance. So they called in Harve Bennett, a well-known television producer, and asked him to take over from Gene Roddenberry as executive producer for the next Star Trek feature film.<br /> Bennett took a look at most of the 79 Star Trek television episodes, seeking the formula that would make a second Star Trek movie soar and take audiences where "no one had gone before." Yet, ironically, the concept Bennett and co-writer Jack Sowards came up with was to make a sequel not to the first film, but to an episode which aired in 1967 "Space Seed."<br /> In another brilliant stroke, Nicholas Meyer was hired to direct. New to the Star Trek universe, Meyer decided to start over almost as if the first feature did not exist. Although he would use stock footage from Star Trek I (which saved the studio tons of money), there would be new costumes, a new approach, and even a new score by James Horner.<br /> Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (originally titled The Undiscovered Country, a Shakespearean reference to death) is a Horatio Hornblower-like story of Admiral Kirk's midlife crisis - at 52, he is now a flag officer and faculty member at Starfleet Academy in 23rd Century San Francisco. Unhappy at his desk job, he longs for command of a starship. His former ship, the Enterprise, is now a training ship commanded by his former first officer, Captain Spock.<br /> It is also the story of Khan Noonian Singh, a tyrant from the late 20th Century who fled from Earth in the year 1996 after the Eugenics Wars (funny, we must have missed those on Fox or MSNBC) and was found by Kirk and Co. in the 2260s aboard SS Botany Bay, a sleeper ship. Revived - in one of those well-meant gestures by our heroes, Khan reverted to type and tried to take over the Enterprise. Only the triumvirate of Kirk, Spock and McCoy enabled the Enterprise to resist Khan and his followers, and he - along with Lt. Marla McGivers and his band of "supermen" - was exiled on Ceti Alpha VI.<br /> Alas! For one of the neighboring planets exploded six months after Khan's exile, and the result was catastrophic. Khan's world was laid waste, and many of his people, including Lt. McGivers, died. And for 15 years, Khan bided his time, until a Federation starship on an unrelated mission arrives.<br /> Star Trek II then becomes a classic revenge tale as Khan takes over the USS Reliant and battles Kirk for possession of the Genesis Device, a missile which can reconfigure entire planets. Starships duel, explosions flare up on screen, chaos ensues. Khan, of course, is thwarted, but not without great cost.<br /> Of course, 21 years after the fact, we know Spock gets killed. We know, also, that this movie started a story arc that continued with The Search for Spock and The Voyage Home and that, at least for Spock, death is only temporary.<br /> The Director's Edition of Star Trek II is subtly different from the theatrical and first - barebones - DVD versions. The story is the same....but this is the slightly longer edition seen originally in its ABC-TV network broadcast premiere in 1984. In this version we find out that the engineering cadet Peter Preston is Scotty's nephew. There are also bits of dialogue that are changed slightly, and some shots presented differently. There is also a great Director's commentary from Nick Meyer. He is a great speaker and very witty, at that. The text commentary by Mike and Denise Okuda is also informative and sometimes even funny. As in all DVDs with extra features discs, there are trailers, featurettes, and interviews with cast and crew.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>As a viewer that prefers the original cast films (and TV shows), I am unapologetic about calling Star Trek II the greatest Trek film, and with the passing of Deforest Kelly, it will remain the greatest.  It has everything Trek fans could want: a great villain, space battles, morality conflicts, humour, and, of course, William Shatner chewing up the scenery.  <p>The best "Original Series" shows contained a mixture of philosophy and action, both of which are readily apparent here.  The story: The exiled Khan escapes by hijacking a starship, then sets out to revenge himself on Kirk.  Along the way he learns of the Genesis Project, basically a super-fast terraforming process that would render lifeless worlds habitable in mere days.  The problem - if used where life already exists, it would wipe out that life and rearrange it to fit its new pattern (this is why the Klingons come after it in ST III).  The action follows Khan's parallel schemes to kill Kirk while stealing the Genesis device.  The philosophy arises from Spock and McCoy's debates on the merits of the Genesis Project, as well as Kirk coming to terms with aging (he gets reading glasses and meets his now-adult son who hates him).<p>The acting is what you'd expect from the likes of Ricardo Montalbahn and William Shatner - emoting galore!  But it works because director Meyer has arranged the film as a melodramatic space opera.  Meyer also includes some nice touches, such as piping aboard flag officers, standardised uniforms, and other naval touches.  Curiously, the two antagonists never meet in the flesh (and therefore the actors never worked together); perhaps this is more realistic: after all, Villeneuve and Nelson never went 1-on-1 at Trafalger.  Thus, Meyer's fusion of age-of-sail naval fighting with science fiction has a neat feel of authenticity.  Finally, the score is probably the best of the ST films.<p>This DVD edition is certainly worthy of the quality of the film.  There are numerous extras, from documentaries on the effects and set designs, to the fascinating text commentary by Jan Okuda.  Meyer lends some nice insight in his audio commentary as well, although he sounds more like a scriptwriter (which he also does, but not on this film) than a director.  With a cost that is little more than a normal DVD, it's also great value.  But the absolute highlight is the suit that Leonard Nimoy is wearing in the extra "Original Cast Interviews."  It has to be seen to be believed!</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>"The Wrath of Khan" is definitely one of the best of the series.  It has everything going for it: A first-rate plot with exciting space battles (the final confrontation in the Mutara Nebula is very suspenseful).  Great acting & character development.  Fantastic special effects.  A superb soundtrack by James Horner, one of the greatest film composers of all time.  It folds out as no less than a science-fiction triumph.<p> "The Director's Edition" DVD is one of the best DVD's I own.  Like the Director's Edition of "The Motion Picture", (but with far superior picture quality) it sprouts new transfer and sound.  And it also has about five minutes worth of new/expanded scenes.  The interviews with the cast and production crew are interesting and very funny.  The other documentaries are also very worthwhile.<p> HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!

With magnificent battles, thrilling special effects, and the superb acting of Ricardo Montablan, THE WRATH OF KHAN is a thrill-ride from start to finish. I also liked seeing Kirstey Alley as Lt. Saavik, and she does a surprisingly nice job as the curious and charming Saavik. And Berritt Mutrick does a splendid job as the son of Kirk. <p>THE WRATH OF KHAN deals with the story of Khan's return, and his plans to snag his hands on the Genesis Project for his own deadly plans, and when he hijacks the USS Reliant and its crew, Kirk and the crew must stop him before it's too late. The battle scenes, especially in the Motara Nebula, are brilliant, and well done. You'll find yourself satisfied after you watch this movie, and left with a feeling that it got more than just it's job done for all the Trek fans.<p>THE WRATH OF KHAN also concludes with the "temporary" death of Spock, who gave his marbles to McCoy so that it would be possible to revive him in the next movie, THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK. Exhilirating, fast-paced, and with great savvy intelligence, this is one Trek you'll want to watch again and again! Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3P121GNV5QYIN.html">A3P121GNV5QYIN</a><br/><p>I've been a Star Trek fan since I saw the movie back when it came out in 1982,I was only a year old,but I really got into it.Like father,like daughter and like how Star Wars was to him back in 1977,that's how ST2 was to me.That scene when the Enterprise left the spacedock(which was way better in this then in the first Trek movie)was like the stardestoryer comming out of the side of the screen in Star Wars.ST2 is a sequel(or kind of)of an episode of the original series called Space Seed,with the character of Khan(played wonderfully by Ricardo Montalban)stealing the USS Reliant,to find and destory Kirk for what he did 15 years earlier.The DVD was great,the new scenes were cool and I loved the trailer which was so campy.ST2 is a very beautifully made picture which outdoes the first Trek movie.One of my favourite scenes is the first battle between the Reliant and our beloved Enterprise.I believe it was the energtic and beautiful score by James Horner,brillient characters and a great story to go with it makes ST2 The Wrath Of Khan one of the best of the Star Trek movies.All the even numbered Trek flims are the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Kahn (Directors Cut) this is a fantastic DVD. Thanks to the genius that is Nicholas Meyer. He took the time to make a really great commentary and it is not your normal commentary either. He speaks of working with various types of actors, he speak with reverence at those who have established careers and he also gives praise to his technical wizards that made this film possible. Director Meyer is a very smart and obvious talented man.<p>The movie itself is my second favorite of all the Star Trek Movies. (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is my favorite.) And the best one for watching adventure. (The Voyage Home has the better story and a lot of humor - by the way Nicholas Meyer also is credited as one of the co-writers on that film too!) <p>Meyer will tell you himself that being a `story teller' is a big responsibility and he wanted to bring, reality, color, detail and a sense of humanity to this story. Also credit is due to Producer Harve Bennet for picking the story and getting the cast together to do this film. Most weren't interested in doing another due to the first film being not so critical success - although it was a big financial success.<p>Kahn was marooned on a planet back when the original series aired. He is back with a vengeance in this one. And he is mean. I won't tell you much more. Let's just say Kirk, Spock and McCoy have their hands full. There final battle scene is the best I have ever seen and the innate humor very real. This edition also contains many scenes that were not in the original.<p>Other extras on this DVD include interviews with the cast and crew and they are very specific, detailed and funny. There are even interviews that were done in 1982 when the movie was actually made. Also the screen menus are some of the best I have every seen. The only thing that is a little boring is the Star Trek Fan Writers - although noteworthy - not something I would have put on the disc.<p>This is a must for every sci-fi fan and a MUST for every Star Trek fan. This is two DVD's too! I hope they do this for the rest of the TEN films. Write me and let me know what you think!

As the crew of the Enterprise face an uncertain future together and career-wise, they find out about an even bigger problem than all of that.  An old enemy, a former tyrannt named Khan, has managed to launch an attack against the Enterprise during a rather routine training voyage with a crew of cadets.  What follows is a tense cat-and-mouse game between two adversaries that will ultimately end in sacrifice and death.  Setting the seeds for future installments of the series, "Khan" still works as a solid piece of sci-fi entertainment.  This special edition boasts commentary from the director, a text commentary pointing out flaws and even trivia about the film.  The "making of" specials explain a lot about the making of the film (including the then shocking finale), the visual effects, and the costume designs that influenced the "Trek" films that followed.  All in all, a solid purchase for the "Trek" fan.  Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AZDVOFC2MTIM5.html">AZDVOFC2MTIM5</a><br/><p>Coming after the successful yet overbloated TMP,TWOK was a leaner and no less meaner film that really kick started the Trek we know and love today.No other villian(well maybe DS9's Gul Dukat)commands your attention like Khan.Where he was set on conquering on Space Seed,he's hellbent on revenge which makes him an even effective villian.Kirsty Alley's Saavik injects a dose of new blood into the veteren crew, and the battle scenes(a far cry from the cheap opticals and camera shaking of the original series)are very effective and even the newer offspring(TNG DS9,VOY)have taken their cue from this film.Regarded as the best Trek film,Wrath of Khan has yet to be toppled,though it has come close(The Voyage Home,First Contact).</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>"The Wrath of Kahn" is by far one of the best "Star Trek" films ever made.<p>The film begins at Star Fleet Academy where a young Vulcan officer, Lt.

Its the only one i will review as i would give them all a 5* rating and in truth this one is most likely the only one deserving of such (except maybe for III and IV). Khan is alive and on the loose. His heart is full of hate for Kirk and he will stop at nothing to destroy him and perhaps the universe as we know it. If you buy only one of the original crew Star Trek movies this is the one.

The return of series' villain Khan Noonian Singh, consumed by his obsession to exact revenge on Admiral Kirk for the death of his wife, resulted in a TREK that was bolder and more dramatic than ever before, (or since -- take note, Rick Berman!) Key to the rebirth was the hiring of director Nicholas Meyer, an admitted novice to the STAR TREK phenomenon who nonetheless drew an astounding, best-ever performance from Shatner and created a taut, tightly-paced adventure in the tradition of the series' finest episodes. As usual, DeForest Kelley steals scene after scene.<br />From the very beginning, Paramount has lead the charge in packing their DVD's with supplementary materials, and this disc doesn't disappoint. For starters, there are two VERY cool behind-the-scenes documentaries: STAR TREK: RECAPTURING THE MAGIC explores the effort that went into ensuring the film FELT like STAR TREK, while the second documentary, IKE EISENMANN: FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN TO THE MILKY WAY, examines in exhausting detail how the actor went from child star at Disney to his tour of duty aboard the Enterprise in KHAN. Both shorts are interesting and informative, and above all, fun. But the studio didn't stop there; in addition to the documentaries, we get a pristine transfer of the film's original theatrical trailer, a generous collection of TV spots, and a rare, seldom seen teaser trailer created expressly for the Polish market. But the real jewel of the extras is the inclusion of an entire taping of The Merv Griffin Show from 1982 featuring Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley, just prior to the release of the film. That alone would have been sufficient to make the disc a must-buy, but Paramount ups the ante by giving us not one, not two, but 25 audio commentaries!!! This treasure trove of extras, combined with the dynamic picture and sound of the film transfer, will have TREK fans everywhere rushing to beam this one up!</p></br><a href="../users/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ.html">AQ8DU6XVA3USJ</a><br/><p>From 1982, this is by far my choice for best Star Trek. The story is interesting, it's exceptionally well written, and  William Shatner looks mighty fine.<p>What makes this film special and worth 5 stars, is my all time favorite screen villain, Khan. Ricardo Montalban is absolutely fabulous. There are subtleties in this performance that make it a joy to watch repeatedly...his expressive, beautiful hands, his amazing voice...&quot;Let them eat static !&quot;. This is not a one-dimensional character. He is smooth, evil, and even sympathetic at times. What a stupendous bad guy !<p>I must add a personal anecdote about the man behind this marvelous villain. Mr. Montalban is the kindest, most giving soul I have ever met. I'm sure he had no idea, nearly 40 years ago, what a huge impact his humanity had on my life. Thank you Ricardo, for being a guardian angel on this earth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>One thing that many serials use to great effect, but is surprisingly missing in the original series of Star Trek, is the recurring villain. They had a sense of that with the recurring Klingons and Romulans, but we never got to see the same people playing the roles in more than one episode. The only antagonist that ever recurred throughout the entire three year run was Harcourt Fenton "Harry" Mudd, and he was a bit of a joke at best.<br /><br />However, as much as you may want to laugh at the idea of Mudd as a "villain", the recurring role allowed the character to become more real. Thus his problems and motivations were more real to us.<br /><br />On the heals of the commercial success of the critically decried "Star Trek: The Almost-No-Motion Picture", director Nicholas Meyer was determined to prove that Star Trek could be a successful and well reviewed movie franchise. Herein came the great idea: use a villain that the audience already knows.<br /><br />Like all original series villains, Khan Noonian Singh was in only one episode. Yet brilliant writing and Montalban's portrayal of the genetically engineered superhuman created one of the greatest episodes of the entire series. By bringing him in to the story, they not only firmly establish that these movies are the continuing voyages of the crew that started out in the sixties, but the audience could now see the results of one of their most favorite episodes ever. Rarely do we get the rest of the story. Here we see it in larger-than-life effects and played out superbly by the inimitable Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />His hatred of Kirk was believable before he ever mentioned the (then) Admiral's name. There was a terrifying restraint to his deliberate actions, but his eyes always told us that there was much more power and emotion than we were being allowed to see. Shatner gave a wonderful performance in this showdown with a foe he thought to have left behind, but it was Montalban who truly shone through.<br /><br />Superb movie and a wonderful DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>If you haven't heard this quote, &quot;The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few or the one&quot;.

Also, although not confirmed, expect some redone Special Effects shots much the same way some shots were redone in TMP:DE.<p>This 2-disc set will include several featurettes including: the CAPTAIN'S LOG featurette (includes new interviews with Meyer, stars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Ricardo Montalban and writer/executive producer Harve Bennett), the DESIGNING KHAN featurette (includes interviews with Meyer, Bennett, graphic designer Lee Cole, costume designer Robert Fletcher, production designer Joe Jennings and more), The VISUAL EFFECTS OF STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN  featurette, original interviews from 1982 with the cast and crew (including the late DeForest Kelley) and THE STAR TREK UNIVERSE - A Novel Approach by Authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox featurette (interviews with Trek novelists).<p>Star Trek II has been considered by Star Trek fans to be one of the best Star Trek films ever.  However, I'm impartial to Star Trek VI myself.  But that being said, Star Trek II had some very memorable scenes and plot lines.  The basic plot is a genetically enhanced superhuman from the late 20th Century has been found after exile from the original Star Trek episode "Space Seed" by the name of Khan.  He has commondeered the Federation Miranda-class starship Reliant and steals a new Federation experiment known as the Genesis Torpedo.  The Genesis Torpedo is a device that can terraform a dead planet into a living and breathing planet.  However his ultimate mission is to exact revenge against Cpt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk for abandoning him on the planet Ceti Alpha V.  Khan pursues Kirk and the Enterprise around the system in some very exciting ship to ship combat akin to 18th Century naval warfare.  The battle ends in a climatic battle in the Mutara Nebula.  However when the battle ends, the Genesis Torpedo ignites and creates a planet out of the nebula.  Something that it wasn't supposed to be able to do.  And then we see the result of that in Star Trek III.<p>Nicholas Meyer was given the reigns of Star Trek II, and he wanted to transform the look of the Star Trek franchise.  Instead of the pajama style uniforms from TMP, he gave them Red Jackets with an open-fly type collar and Black Trousers and Boots.  This style of uniform remained with the series all the way through Star Trek The Next Generation in the episode "Cause and Effect" where the Enterprise D encounters an old Miranda class ship from Kirk's time.<p>But as for future Star Trek films in Director's Editions, Star Trek III is supposedly soon to follow.  Possibily before the end of the year, however I wouldn't hold my breath, being that it's taken almost a year to get this one out after TMP:DE.</p></br><a href="../users/A1URXSRV6WDHVY.html">A1URXSRV6WDHVY</a><br/><p>The Wrath of Kahn is , simply put, a classic.  I have watched this movie more than 100 times since it's release in 1982 and it just keeps getting better with time.  So many quotable lines for Trek fans too.  There is nothing I do not like about this movie.  On this special edition you do get a few extra and extended scenes.  The die hard purist in me thinks they interfere somewhat with the pacing, but hearing Spock say "Fascinating" (in a comic drone) after Kirk tells him about his son is priceless.  The included extras are all very cool.  Personally I would have wished for a bit more about the making of the special effects but even THAT part is pretty darn good!  Ace direction by Nicholas Meyer, and simply THE BEST score EVER for a Star Trek movie by James Horner help make The Wrath of Kahn the de facto standard for Star Trek movies and one that STILL has not been topped!  The price is so low they are giving it away and the dvd transfer is top notch.  You can NOT go wrong with this film!</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Now 25 years old, this movie still holds up very well.  I remember how delighted we fans were when we heard that Star Trek was going to be made into a movie.  The first film was mixed for most fans.  We were glad to see the characters on the screen, but the feel of the film was too big and the story was off somehow.  This movie was the second film and everyone cheered because it was a Star Trek story through and through, with even some of the characteristic inconsistencies (Khan remembering Chekov when he wasn't even part of the crew in the TV episode), the just in time miracles, and much more.<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban is spectacular as the genetically altered Khan Noonien Singh that Kirk had left on a lush planet fifteen years before.  Kirk is now an admiral who is uncomfortable with old age and leaving his starship, a new crew is being trained to take over the Enterprise, and Chekov is on an expedition on the Reliant with Captain Clark Terrell (well played by Paul Winfield).  Terrell and Chekov set down on a waste planet and discover evidence of Khan's existence on this planet and try to flee, but it is too late.<br /><br />The rest of the film is Khan drawing Kirk into an obsessed confrontation much like Ahab and Moby Dick.  You can pretty much guess that it is just as unlikely to end well for Khan.  It is the path the confrontation takes that is so interesting for Trek fans.  And the famous denouement is either quite moving or an impossible hoot, depending on how seriously you take these stories.  I was moved by the way they played it.  It was the next movie that we all had to swallow hard to believe, but it got us back to where we needed the story to be.<br /><br />Hey, at least they didn't make it a dream or something from an autistic child, right?<br /><br />We watched this with my teenage son last night, and he enjoyed it a great deal, so new generations continue to become fans of this series.  As well they should.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>Director Meyer had to win over a lot of jaded trekkies after the first Star Trek movie sharply divided them into two camps: those that liked the movie and those that did not. However, Meyer fought through the muck not only to reunite the trekkies, but also impress and win-over many non-treksters as well with a mix of imaginative special effects, gripping suspense while never losing people with over-elaborate dialouge or indulging in techno-dweeb fascinations. All this works to move an intricate plot, which in a nutshell is a being with superior intelligence named Khan (An inspired, gleefully maniacal Richard Montalban who gives the movies' best performance) who was imprisoned by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) years ago on a desolate, deserted planet. Khan escapes seeking revenge on Kirk as well as getting his hands on the Genesis device, a machine that can basically turn lifeless matter in to something that can sustain life (imagine a moon and turning into a living planet). Kirk runs across Khan while training a new crew for the Enterprise and their battle of wits and weaponry insues. Caught in the middle between Kirk and Khan is the team that created Genesis, which includes Kirk's son and former lover. Meyer skillfully builds the movie to its unbearably suspenseful climax in which Khan and Kirk are hunting each other in a nebula, blinded by the forces within the nebula itself.<br /><br />A skillful blend of action, suspense and tragedy, "Star Trek ll: The Wrath of Khan" is an amazing cinematic milestone.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>After the thoroughly unegaging original movie "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" succeeded at the box office, though it still blows my mind how it achieved so much money, people must have seen a different movie than me, I wasn't surprised that Paramount was keen for a sequel.  Even though I hated the first movie, I am thankful that it did well at the box office, because thanks to its success movie audiences were treated to the cinematic goodness that is "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan".  Fans of the original series were ecstatic to learn that the genetically engineered superhuman known as Khan, that last appeared in the original TV series during the episode "Space Seed", would be returning to cause trouble for Captain Kirk and company after his exile at the hands of Kirk.  Though the level of hype surrounding this sequel was incredibly high, one still had to wonder about a few things regarding the movie.  One, can "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" truly capture the spirit of adventure that was found throughout the TV series, yet was lacking in the first movie.  Second, would the story of Khan's return be engaging enough to carry a feature film, and how could Khan return due to his exile on a deserted planet with the rest of his genetic superhumans.  And third, can Ricardo Montalban still carry the malice required to ensure that Khan is still one to be feared (this worry was due to Montalban's recurring role on the TV series "Fantasy Island).  So, did the movie achieve box office glory and lay all fears to rest, or did it fall victim to its own hype?  Read on through the movie synopsis to find out for sure.<br /><br />15 years after being exiled on a deserted planet by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and the rest of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise, genetic superhuman Khan (Ricardo Montalban) is seeking a means to escape the planet so that he may exact his revenge on the despised Captain.  After a mishap lands members of the Federation on the planet Khan and his superhumans are inhabiting, Khan commandeers the starship and by controlling the minds of the crew makes contact with a Federation science vessel that is housing a machine known as the Genesis device, whose sole purpose is to rejuvenate dead planets making them viable for living beings again.  Khan knows that with this device at his command he can take over the universe, though the device creates life, if used upon a planet that already is thriving with life, it would effectively kill anything alive in order to start things over anew.  When word of Khan's attack on the science vessel reaches Starfleet, the powers that be, bring newly promoted Admiral Kirk back to action to face his old nemesis, but Kirk can't stop him alone, he'll need his entire crew back for this mission, along with his old ship that just so happens to be under the command of Kirk's former science officer the Vulcan known as Spock (Leonard Nimoy).  With the crew of the Enterprise reassembled and time quickly running out, Kirk and company head off to do battle with the most cunning and powerful enemy they have ever faced, and this time there will be dire consequences for the Enterprise and her crew.<br /><br />So, in response to the question I posed prior to the movie synopsis, did the movie achieve box office glory and lay all the doubts and fears to rest?  The answer would have to be a resounding "YES!"  With the release of "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" it was clear that the creative minds behind this franchise were clearly firing on all cylinders, and that the fiasco of "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" could be overcome.  This movie featured everything the first film should have had, from gripping drama involving all of the characters, special effects work that was astounding back in the day, but still holds up fairly well even now, an excellent villain with Khan, and plenty of humor, suspense, and action to please even the most jaded of fans.  Written perfectly by Harve Bennett, this movie pleased fans of the genre on so many levels, and the ending was so crafty and shocking that it left you begging for more, as any good movie should.<br /><br />As I said before, I absolutely hated "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", and I know that many hard-core 'Trekkies' would love to string me up for that statement, but I offer this peace offering, as much as I hated the first film, I loved "Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" to the same degree.  If you were, or still are, a fan of 'Star Trek' whether it be the various TV series' or whatever, but was turned off to the series because of the first film, please do yourself the favor and watch the sequels, you won't be disappointed..<br /><br />"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan" is rated PG for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>"Star Trek" has legions of fans, spawned numerous television incarnations, and inspired ten feature length movies.  It even is responsible for adding the word `trekker' (which, obviously, refers to fans of Star Trek) to the official English language, courtesy of the Oxford English Dictionary.  It is not hyperbole to say that "Star Trek" is a true cultural phenomenon that has reached into many corners of society.  The second full-length feature film "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" may be more responsible than any other production (television or film) for the series' widespread popularity.  To call it only a science-fiction movie would not do it justice.  After a dull predecessor that tried to hard to be like "2001" and appealed only to die-hard Trek fans, "...Wrath of Khan" reintroduced fans, new and old, to the great space opera that is Star Trek.  What enabled to transcend its genre and reach mainstream audiences was that it contained elements that spoke to most movie goers.  It is a tale of revenge in the same vein as "Moby Dick"; a tale of dealing with growing old and trying to recapture youth; it is part "Star Wars" and part "Run Silent, Run Deep"; and, most of all, it is a tale of supreme sacrifice.  All of those elements combined to make this the most successful "Star Trek" movie to date (both critically and at the box office) and enables the power of this film to resonate more than 20 years after it first premiered.<br /><br />After suffering the effects of a stiff story and sluggish fan reception for "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", producer Harve Bennett went back though all the old episodes of the original series to search for a storyline that would be most worthy of a sequel.  An episode called "Space Seed" which introduced audiences to the genetically enhanced super villain, Khan Noonian Singh, or more simply `KHAN!' (as Captain Kirk so eloquently put it in this film).  That choice produced one of the finest science fiction films to grace the silver screen.  In addition, the producers also did away with the clinical sets and pastel uniforms in favor of a cozier Enterprise bridge and uniforms more befitting a space navy.<br /><br />Khan (played with delicious melodrama by Ricardo Montalban) was a character that would have special reason to seek revenge against Captain (now Admiral) Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the Enterprise.  After defeated by Kirk at the end of the "Space Seed" episode, Khan and his cadre of genetic super humans were exiled to a planet that soon became an ecological wasteland, killing much of the crew (including Khan's wife).  Fast forward 15 years and Khan is presented with a golden opportunity to exact revenge when an ill-fated scientific mission by the USS Reliant stumbles upon his planet in an attempt to find a lifeless planet to test the Genesis Project, a new experiment that can produce life from lifelessness.  Khan manages to capture the investigative team (which happened to be the ship's Captain and its first officer, Chekov, from the original series) and use mind controlling parasites to take command of the Reliant.  Once in possession of his own starship and free from exile, Khan begins his quest to exact revenge upon Kirk while also seeking to possess the dangerous power of Genesis.<br /><br />"The Wrath of Khan" provides some of the most gripping moments of drama this genre has to offer.  The twists and crests in action are frequent, natural, and spectacular.  It's fascinating to watch the horror Kirk's face when he realizes that the man behind the surprise attack on the Enterprise is Khan.  When Kirk, and the damaged enterprise, abruptly turn the tables on Khan as he prepares to finish them off, a rush of adrenaline courses through the veins of all who are watching.  The cat and mouse battle in the Mutara Nebula reminds many of the submarine warfare from "Run Silent, Run Deep".  Then, there is the tragic sacrifice at the very end.  All of this made this film such a spectacular mainstream success in 1982 and continues to give it amazing strength today.<br /><br />The Special Edition Director's Cut restores a few scenes that have been absent from most of the past video versions, most notably two scenes that show what the connection is between Scotty and the young midshipman who dies during Khan's first attack.  In addition, the special features disc provides insightful interviews with cast members that shows the creative process and inspiration that brought "The Wrath of Khan" to existence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>This is Star Trek's finest hour.  Realizing the missed opportunities of the plodding Star Trek:  The Motion Picture, the superior sequel is non-stop excitement from the get-go.  Digging Khan Singh out of the classic Trek catacombs was a masterstroke, and Ricardo Montalban's performance as the revenge-crazed renegade is splendid.  Many fans also remember this film as Kirstie Alley's debut feature, and with good reason--her Saavik is an enchanting combination of elfin beauty and barely restrained Romulan fire.  Naturally, the cast of Trek familiars all perform admirably, and the special effects bring the myriad fantasy sequences (including alien brain eels and brilliant starship duels) to pyrotechnic reality, all the more effective because they highlight so many dramatic characterizations.  And James Horner's score is the best of any Trek film so far.  Parallel to the main revenge plot are two well-handled subtexts:  age and mortality.  On top of it all, Captain Kirk is reunited with an old flame and meets the son he has never known, only to suffer the heart-wrenching loss of his closest friend.  Well-conceived, written, and directed, Star Trek II is a relentlessly suspenseful and engaging sci-fi extravaganza, and clearly the standard against which all other Star Trek features must be measured.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>this is the one,the one that saved the series and made the other shows possible.<br /><br />  after the boxoffice hit of the first one,they roled out this second,and much cheeper budgeted second one and hit gold!<br /><br />  acting like the first one never happened,this one starts with cadets training to take over the ship and kirk is going on the training run with them. enter khan(ricardo montalban as the villian he played on the original show) a superman from the past that kirk beat and left on a far off world. it seems that starfleet has a new weapon,the genesis weapon,it turns dead planets into live ones,killing everything to make the world able to suport life. the planet khan is on is to be used as a test site.khan takes control of the ship sent for the test and goes after the bomb and kirk! the action comes fast and gets better as the movie goes on.<br /><br />  the dvd is great and has all the extras you could want. a great set,beam it up!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>This is the movie that the Star Trek motion pictures should have started with.

Montalban gives an excellent performance even though quite a few years have gone by since he orignated his role and he's obviously kept himself in good shape despite his chronic back problems.<br /><br />The acting is much better here than TMP.  Everyone actually looks as if they are glad to be on the set.  And why shouldn't they be?  One little t.v. show has brought them more dough than they ever thought they'd see.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this one.

All perfomances, even William Statner's were incredible. Spock and McCoy were finally Spock and McCoy. The Enterprise finally had color and lights and the unforms were more space fairing then the pajamas in the first one.<p>Nicholas Meyer, who I met shortly after this production in the 80's, described this as an adventure will characters moving the story and drama not the special effects.

While the first movie seemed desperate and unending (and downright stupid at times) ST II was a joy to behold. The plot was solid, it had the best villian, and the special effects were wonderful by 1980's standards.<p>The story is basically a sequel from an old Star Trek TV episode called Space Seed. In it Khan (played magnificently by Ricardo Montalban) is a leader of a small genetically engineered group of &quot;super-beings&quot; who had been left in hibernation for 200 years drifting in space. After trying and failing to take over the Enterprize he and his group are left on a deserted planet to build anew. The movie starts 15 years into the future. The planet had experienced an enviorement disaster, causing all life to perish. All that is left is Khan and his dwindling group barely surviving. By sheer luck they are liberated by a starship, which they take over, and Khan is unleashed to seek his revenge. The film plays out almost like a chess match. The battle of wits between Kirk and Khan goes back and forth, leading Khan deeper and deeper into madness.<p>The highlight of this movie is quite simply: the cast. Of course all your favorite Star Trek crew members are here. The supporting cast include the aforementioned Ricardo Montalban, Bibi Besch as the old love interest of Kirk, Paul Winfield as the Captain of the U.S.S. Reliant, and a VERY young Kirstie Ally.<p>I would HIGHLY recommend this to not only the Star Trek Fan, but to any sci-fi movie fan. It's action-pack from start to end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>When I was young 'un (back when I was about 8 or so), The Wrath of Khan was actually my least favorite Star Trek film to date. Having seen it again on TNN recently, I'm not sure why I disliked it so much, and while I won't call it the best Star Trek film (that honor lies with First Contact), it's an entertaining adventure highlighted by good performances, memorable special effects, and two tense, if also somewhat underwhelming, space battles.<p>The Wrath of Khan is a sequel to the episode, "Space Seed", where evil genius Khan and his gang were exiled on a planet. Khan and his group escape, hijack a starship, and plans vengeance upon Kirk. Then there's the genesis device, a machine capable of creating new life, but also has the potential to destroy those the living. It all leads to a tense showdown between the two biggest egos in the universe.<p>There are a lot of things about The Wrath of Khan that still bug me. For one, there's the slow as snails pacing.  Director Nicholas Meyer often said this film was inspired by the nautical adventures of Horatio Hornblower, but I distinctly remember two things that place such works (as seen in, say, the recent Master and Commander) above Wrath of Khan: 1) watching two big spaceships blasting away at each other isn't nearly as fun as seeing two big 19th century warships firing cannonballs upon each other on the high seas and 2) Hornblower often boarded enemy ships, but seeing as this never happens in Wrath of Khan, we're back to the concept of watching two spaceships duking it out.<p>I can't really quite begin to emphasize how small-scale space battles aren't my cup of tea. Not helping that problem is the fact that the Enterprise never actually feels like it's in any genuine danger, not necessarily because you expect that most of the crew will make it through the situation alive, but because it just seems like a far more powerful ship than the Khan-controlled Reliant.  <p>Then there's Khan and his gang of marauders themselves, who look more like rejects from a He-man audition than genuinely menacing villains. Matter of fact, most of Khan's men do little more than stand around and "pose."  They also look a little young for a group that's been marooned for fifteen years, but maybe that's just the side effect of genetic tampering.  This, however, still doesn't explain why Khan himself looks particularly aged from his last encounter with Kirk, and I don't think something as simple as stress caused by survival responsibilities could explain it.  He may be the leader, but if everyone is also as potentially strong and as intelligent as he is, I see no reason why they couldn't care for themselves.<p>The plot generally lacks any sense of urgency.  Even in the thick of the action or in apparently dire situations, the film does little to generate any building suspense.  The Wrath of Khan simply doesn't find the right balance between action, science fiction, and characters.  The only genuine sci-fi on hand (aside from all the space travel and the like) is the Genesis project, and even that takes a backseat to the Kirk/Khan rivalry.<p>Other complaints:  though certain tracks of Horner's score (especially the "prepping for battle" scene) are rousing, too much of the music is just grating and certainly can't hold a candle to Jerry Goldsmith's famed Trek score.  Meyer's camerawork is also rather flat, lacking a sense of true rhythm or energy.  Even Robert Wise's direction in The Motion Picture felt slicker than this.<p>With those criticisms out of the way, there was some stuff I enjoyed about the film. William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban make for an effective protagonist/antagonist duo, with the former delivering a genuinely good performance and the latter chewing the scenery with aplomb. Leonard Nimoy is excellent as Spock, as always. <p>The most memorable scene of the whole film is the emotional climax, which features the death of a major character. This represented the first time that Star Trek could not only engage the mind and rattle the nerves, but also touch the heart (and put a lump in your throat). The Wrath of Khan appears to be the series fan-favorite, and I can see why, but too much of it doesn't click with me. Still, it's somewhat recommended to those looking for a space opera with the occasional dose of action and pathos.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>Watching this movie made me a fan, although not a trekkie, of the Star trek series.  Within this movie we find an internal struggle and outward struggle between Khan and Kirk. An intresting plot line that continued for two more movies afterwards.  A great start to a trilogy of movies in a series of Star Trek movies!</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>With a great cast and an enemy you just love to hate this one just keeps on ticking.  Kirk and his old enemy Khan butt heads over a device that can create planets called "Genesis".  The only part I didn't like was when Dr. McCoy got all religious about the creation of planets.  I know that he is a country doctor and that this is the point, but I just don't think it adds to the character.  I only write this review knowing that if you don't know this already you are not a Star Trek fan.  If this is the case I urge you to reconsider this movie is wonderful strictly for its entertainment value.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>The &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies were all originally released on DVD with only the bare-minimum treatment- the &quot;special features&quot; were theatrical trailers and widescreen options.  This upset me, especially since the second &quot;Star Trek&quot; film- &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;- is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Finally in late 2002, &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; was given the treatment it deserved, and was fully loaded with special features.  These further enhanced a film that actually didn't need them too much anyways, because it was so good.<p>&quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; is my favorite &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, and is arguably the best film that the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise could ever be expected to deliver.  It isn't a perfect film, but I still give it five stars because of how enjoyable it is.  William Shatner- whose acting has never exactly been heralded- gives his best performance here, showing the right amount of leadership, arrogance, and tenderness.  I won't say much about Ricardo Montalban's performace, since it can just be summed up as the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; villain ever.  He hams it up like there's no tomorrow, and he's terrific to watch every step of the way.  The returning &quot;Star Trek&quot; regulars all fit into their roles comfortably.  Director Nicholas Meyer injected some much needed life into the series with this entry, as he added the right amount of humor, action, and emotional bonding.  The ending when a major character dies is surprisingly wrenching, even over 20 years later.  The only part where the film missteps is with Merritt Butrick's performance as David- he's really not very good (he would improve in the next entry).  Other than that, this is one &quot;Star Trek&quot; film that will appeal to all sci-fi fans, not just Trekkies.<p>Ironically, this was easily the cheapest &quot;Star Trek&quot; film made, even when adjusted for inflation.  The special effects do look somewhat dated now, and some people may object to the film's occasionally hokey tone.  However, I think that this is simply a wonderful viewing experience, and was the peak of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.  If you want to see just how the &quot;Star Trek&quot; magic works on its fans, look no further than &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Many - both Star Trek fans and others - regard "Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan" as the finest in the "Star Trek" film franchise. Nicholas Meyer crafted an exciting tale that remains true to the spirit of "Star Trek", paying homage to C. S. Forrester's "Hornblower" saga as well as Gene Roddenberry's vision. This edition restores scenes that were cut from the theatrical release, adding additional depth to the characters of Kirk, Spock, and especially, Scotty. The film works not only as a great episode of "Star Trek", but also as a fine science fiction film and military thriller.<p>Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) realizes that he is getting old, after watching a group of cadets lose the "Kobayashi Maru" scenario which he unexpectedly passed as a Starfleet Academy cadet. He decides to take one last voyage on the USS Enterprise, now a training vessel commanded by Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy), in the company of other old friends such as Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Chief Engineer Montgomery "Scotty" Scott (James Doohan), Commander Sulu (George Takei) and Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols). Meanwhile the USS Reliant commanded by Captain Clark Terrell (Paul Winfield) - with Commander Pavel Chekhov (Walter Koenig) as Terrell's first officer - is on a top-secret classified mission, surveying the Ceti Alpha solar system, as a possible testing site for Starfleet's secret Genesis Device. Soon the two Starfleet officers are captured by a group of humans led by the enigmatic, manical Khan Noonian Singh (Ricardo Montalban). Khan abducts the Reliant, and proceeds to the secret Starfleet base Regula I, where Kirk's old flame (Bibi Besch) is supervising the construction of the Genesis Device, setting the stage for a classic, fateful confrontation with Admiral Kirk and the Enterprise crew.<p>This splendid film is a sequel to the classic "Star Trek" episode "Space Seed" which introduced Khan to "Star Trek" audiences as among the original series' most intelligent, most charismatic villains. In addition to excellent performances from Nimoy, Shatner and Montalban, it is noteworthy as the film debut of Kirstie Alley in the role of the Vulcan/Romulan lieutenant Saavik. James Horner also contributed the first of many excellent film scores to this movie, giving a vast, nautical grandeur befitting a cinematic "Hornblower in Space".</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>The Star Trek films are among my top favorites in the science fiction genre, and the Director's Edition release of The Wrath of Khan tops my list as my favorite Trek film of all time.  Conceived as a sequel to the Original Series episode &quot;Space Seed&quot;, The Wrath of Khan is a story about the adventures of Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and the rest of the Enterprise crew as they attempt to stop genetically engineered 20th-Century madman Khan (played by the ever-delightful Ricardo Montalban) from using a stolen top-secret device called Project Genesis to ignite universal Armageddon in his quest for revenge against Kirk.<p>The thing I enjoyed most about the Director's Edition was the inclusion of several scenes that had been filmed for the movie, but which were cut in the theatrical release.  One of these is a scene between Kirk and Peter Preston (Ike Eisenmann) that serves to define the relationship between Preston and Scotty (James Doohan).  While it was ultimately deemed unnecessary to the plot, it helped clarify certain reactions from Scotty later in the film.  There are also some extended scenes with Dr. Carol Marcus (played by the late Bibi Besch), her son David (the late Merritt Butrick), and the crew of Space Station Regula One which serve a similar purpose.<p>I also liked the fact that the Director's Edition had enough extras to warrant the inclusion of a second disc, which is a rarity from Paramount.  The Feature disc has a spoken commentary by director Nicholas Meyer (while I'm not normally a fan of these types of commentaries because they distract me, I enjoyed hearing what Meyer had to say about the film) and a text commentary by Star Trek Encyclopedia author Michael Okuda.  The Special Features disc includes some very insightful interviews with Meyer, Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and writer/Executive Producer Harve Bennett, as well as two featurettes (Designing Khan and The Visual Effects of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan), original interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and the late DeForest Kelley, and plenty more.  For those who have enjoyed Star Trek as long as I have, this DVD set is definitely a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>&quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; remains the best of the Star Trek movies. Yes, &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; was more fun, but the franchise is never going to be able to top the emotional impact of Spock's death. &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; is what we would have called a first-rate &quot;B&quot; movie in the old days. This is William Shatner's finest performance, helped by the fact that there is a telling subplot about Kirk worrying that he is growing old. Consequently, the character is given some significant depth whether he is dealing with having to put his spectacles on in front of the bridge crew or trying to come to terms with suddenly confronting a son who wants nothing to do with him. I also think Shatner's performance is helped by the fact that Kirk has to solve problems by thinking rather than by slugging anyone. In fact, Shatner won the Saturn Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA for his performance (director Nicholas Meyer won as well). <p>The emotional impact of the death of Spock is something that was set up from early on in the Star Trek television series where it became clear that despite their vast differences the Captain and his First Officer had become friends. This is a theme that has been touched upon by various television episodes as well as in some of the better Star Trek novels that have dealt with the formation of that friendship. The symbolism of the plastic shielding that separates them at the end, a physical manifestation of the psychological barriers required by the Vulcan part of Spock, is certainly not lost on us. With all the &quot;Buddy&quot; movies Hollywood has produced, I cannot think of a more emotional declaration that &quot;I have been and always shall be your friend.&quot; Yes, it was something that was so well understood that it never needed to be said, but it was still worth hearing.<p>Both the direction and the score are first rate and I am especially fond of the sequences where the bridge crew is waiting helplessly for Genesis to detonate. The camera moves in on each character as they discuss their impending deaths and the music matches the pace only to turn ominously when the scene cuts back to the dying Khan. However, I must note that director Nicholas Meyer used the same series of jump cuts to pull away from the Reliant before Genesis detonates that he did with Kansas City when the nuclear missiles hit in &quot;The Day After.&quot; I also think composer James Horner deserves credit for setting the tone with the marvelous opening fanfare and heroic theme. Even before we get to the Kobayashi Maru sequence, you know this is going to be a good flick. <p>The only thing that really bugs me about this movie is that Khan keeps quoting Ahab. Obviously his obsession is reminiscent of &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; but if you were a super genius would you really want to have Ahab as your role model? I understand how the allusion fits from the perspective of the director/writer/audience, but not from the perspective of Khan's character. Then again, besides &quot;Moby Dick&quot; one of the other books that Khan had on Ceti Alpha VI was &quot;King Lear,&quot; which also features a main character with mental problems. Remember, this is a guy who quoted Milton at the end of &quot;Space Seed,&quot; so I do not think he should suddenly be going off the deep end with his literary references. Ricardo Montalban's flamboyant performance as Khan not only works as he chews up the scenery with such delight, but because I think it is another significant reason that Shatner toned down his performance, thereby creating a nice contrast between the two characters. <p>With regards to the disappointing DVD version, which contains nothing extra besides the trailer despite the fact &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; aired on ABC with additional footage (e.g., establishing Preston as Scotty's nephew). I believe we are being sandbagged and that once they sell out on this initial run of Star Trek films on DVD we will suddenly get Director's Cuts or Special Editions that will suddenly provide all of the things Paramount should have put on these DVDs in the first place. Caveat Trekker.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>pehaps because it is closest to the original series.  It is like one long episode, a continuation of the TV story, and it works very well like that.  There is the evil Kahn - genetically engineered and hence an alternative human race line - and the devious Kirk, who relies on his team to defeat him.<p>The other films were often too ambitious or over-burdened with pretention.  (In the first one, Spock sums it up by saying &quot;we may have witnessed the next step in our evolution&quot;.  I mean, sheesh!)  But this one just tells a good yarn.

They happen to be aboard his old ship, the Enterprise, and the crew includes most of his key past crewmates.  In another part of the galaxy, former crewman Chekov and his new captain are investigating a planet that may be used for Project Genesis, a device that could literally give new life to a planet.  What Chekov and his captain actually find is a man hungry for revenge:  Khan.<br /><br />Having been exiled years ago and blaming Kirk for the death of his wife, Khan puts a plan into action to bring Kirk back into his clutches in order to get revenge.<br /><br />Falling for Khan's trickery and with an inexperienced crew in tow, Kirk takes the Enterprise to Regula One, home of Project Genesis.  He hopes to find out who used his name in order to get their hands on Genesis.  Instead, he finds an ex-wife, an estranged son and one of his greatest enemies waiting to strike.  What happens next is, simply put, a wonderful blend of drama, suspense and humor as Kirk and Khan battle each other to the death.<br /><br />For a film released in 1982, "Khan" has excellent special effects.  Granted, there are a few miscues, but the story more than makes up for them.  Director Nicholas Meyer paces the film with perfection, utilizing the musical score and the individual performances of the players in order to build tension on the screen.  He guides the games between Kirk and Khan with precision.  All of the original crew do superb jobs, but I must point out that William Shatner gives his best performance ever.  Ricardo Montalban's over-the-top performance as Khan makes this film worthy of five stars.  Kirstie Alley makes her first big screen appearance and adds quite a bit of sex appeal to the film as Lt. Saavik.  That's a tough job for a person playing an emotionless Vulcan to do.<br /><br />As for the DVD, this two disc set makes up in quality what it lacks in quantity.  The digital transfer of the film is excellent.  It's one of the best transfers of a film including the original cast.  Only "Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country" has a crisper looking transfer.  The sound is also very good.  There aren't as many special features included with this set when compared to the other films in this series, but they are some of the best extras you'll find.  Highlights include original interviews with DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, Shatner and Montalban as well as new interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, Meyer and executive producer Harve Bennett.  There's also an interesting segment involving "Star Trek" authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox.<br /><br />Fans of "Star Trek" have most likely viewed this film already.  For those folks who haven't or for people who aren't fans of science fiction, I highly recommend "Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan" for its drama, wonderful suspense and overall story.  For fans of military films, the calculated tactics of both Kirk and Khan should keep them interested.  These are just a few of the reasons that have made this film one of the most popular of the "Star Trek" pictures.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>Here, we have the cast of the original Star Trek Series on yet another adventure into the universe.

The original crew appear to be back in pretty much top form. I felt they were a bit rusty in the first film as far as acting together as a group. There are also some key new characters added that bring a whole lot to the film as well. The overall plot is much better than that of the first film too. It was brilliant to bring back a character from an episode of the orginal series, Khan, and really make it work. If you're just a casual fan of the Star Trek series and haven't watched many of the original episodes, you might want to get your hands on the "Space Seed" episode. You, by no means, NEED to watch this episode before viewing this film to understand it, but it might make you aprreciate it a little more in the long run. But if you're a fan to begin with, its basically like watching one of your favorite Star Trek episodes, except on a greater scale. In my opinion, if you're looking for the definitive Star Trek movie, this is it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>'The Wrath of Khan' is arguably the most famous out of all of the Star Trek movies to date. Ricardo Montalban returns once again to reprise his role as Khan, the villain from the original series episode "Space Seed". As expected, Montalban exceeds in this role that he has established as one of the greatest villains of the Trek universe. He looks different, a little buffer and more grey, but he is still the same evil character we have all come to hate.<br /><br />This movie features a lot of interesting and very famous moments. This was also the first film appearance of Kirstie Alley. The story is very compelling and the characters/actors work so well together, you can feel their friendships and hatreds between each other. If you notice during the movie, they do give hints by things they say and do of how the movie will end. The script is well written and has me in tears every time, no matter how many times it is watched. This is a must have for lovers of Trek and sci-fi, you have to see this movie at least once in your life time. After that, you will want to see it again and again. It is just that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Oddly enough I have not seen a single original series Star Trek episode.

So on a whim and since everyone says II is the best, I blind bought and it was a good purchase.<br /><br />Apparently(like I said, didn't watch original series), Captain Kirk banished genetically engineered Khan to a desolate planet for 15 years. A little snafu accident with Chekov and his new ship's captain finds himself face to face with Khan. His plan? Why revenge of course. Using mind control bugs he takes over the ship and surprise attacks the Enterprise leaving it a bit crippled.<br /><br />Turns out there's another thing Khan wants: the Genesis program, which can actually create life on lifeless planets. It has the reverse effect on life already there: it destroys it so the new life can thrive. Perfect annihilation weapon, no? So Captain Kirk and his crew, including new recruit Saavik(and also film newcomer Kirstie Alley of Cheers fame).<br /><br />What makes II work is that it's quite action packed. It builds up slowly until Khan takes over the ship then the fight begins. It's the 80's so everything was pre CG with motion control shots and cloud tank effects for the nebula at the end but you wouldn't care anyways. Also a quite significant event happens at the end and it's handled particularly well.<br /><br />As for acting, everyone is of course top notch in their character. No Oscar caliber but come on, we're just happy Spock acts like Spock right? Known for...his...overracting...and...pause-y speech, William Shatner is quite a surprise on here especially his infamous "KHHHAANNN!".<br /><br />I'm kind of torn between this film and First Contact as the best Star Trek(Granted I've only seen 7-10 and this) but so far it's definately up there as the best Trek adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUZOJZM9008Y.html">A3TUZOJZM9008Y</a><br/><p>The even movies in this series are the &quot;real&quot; Trek movies. ST4 had the whales. ST6 had the last of the old crew. ST8 had the Borg, ST10 had the Romulans and a clone. But ST2, ah ST2, that had Ricardo Mantalban giving William Shatner's scene chewing a run for it's money.<p>In fact, Shatner is relatively subdued for the better part of the movie. His Captain Kirk is feeling his age and faced with an estranged son that would prefer to remain estranged. Lost love and missed opportunities, and a tight reign from director Nicholas Meyer (Time After Time, ST6), help keep Shatner in check.<p>Also marks the screen debut of Kirstie Alley as Lt. Saavik.<p>The DVD package is put together very well. Once Paramount decided to start doing a good job with DVD special editions. They took it all the way to the bank.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>To this day, &quot;Star Trek ll: The Wrath of Khan&quot; is still the best Star Trek movie ever made, thanks to superb direction by Nicholas Meyer, Richard Montalban's masterful performance as the revenge-filled Khan and a script that is intellectual, but never delves into the world of dweebiness.  <p>Director Meyer had to win over a lot of jaded trekkies after the first Star Trek movie sharply divided them into two camps: those that liked the movie and those that did not.  However, Meyer fought through the muck not only to reunite the trekkies, but also impress and win-over many non-treksters as well with a mix of imaginative special effects, gripping suspense while never losing people with over-elaborate dialouge or indulging in techno-dweeb fascinations.  All this works to move an intricate plot, which in a nutshell is a being with superior intelligence named Khan (An inspired, gleefully maniacal Richard Montalban who gives the movies' best performance) who was imprisoned by Captain Kirk (William Shatner) years ago on a desolate, deserted planet.  Khan escapes seeking revenge on Kirk as well as getting his hands on the Genesis device, a machine that can basically turn lifeless matter in to something that can sustain life (imagine a moon and turning into a living planet).  Kirk runs across Khan while training a new crew for the Enterprise and their battle of wits and weaponry insues. Caught in the middle between Kirk and Khan is the team that created Genesis, which includes Kirk's son and former lover.  Meyer skillfully builds the movie to its unbearably suspenseful climax in which Khan and Kirk are hunting each other in a nebula, blinded by the forces within the nebula itself.<p>A skillful blend of action, suspense and tragedy, &quot;Star Trek ll: The Wrath of Khan&quot; is an amazing cinematic milestone.  Not only is it easily one of the best science-fiction films ever made, it deserves to be on the same bench as &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still,&quot; the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy and &quot;The Matrix.&quot;</p></br></body></html>

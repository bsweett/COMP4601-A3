He spent his own childhood in Poland, and escaped from the Krakow Ghetto, although his mother, and other family members, perished in the Holocaust. Polanski makes this his most personal and powerful film to date, and deservingly won the Academy Award Oscar for Best Director.<p>"The Pianist" is the agonizing story of Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's survival of the Nazi's destruction of Polish Jewry. The film begins in 1939, with Szpilman playing Chopin on the piano for Radio Warsaw, as the Germans bomb the city, and finally force him to stop playing. History has documented well what happened in Warsaw over the following two years - the Jewish ghetto was constructed and settled, racial laws were written and enforced, people died of starvation, illness, or Nazi murder. Then the "resettlement" roundups began. Szpilman was waiting at the Umshagplatz to be deported to Treblinka, with his family, when fate seemingly intervened, and he was spared. His survival story is a different kind of hell than others that I have seen or read about. Szpilman watches the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, and subsequent destruction, from the outside, looking in. Usually, accounts of the Jewish uprising are from former fighters, or survivors, who were inside the ghetto at the time. I can only wonder if Szpilman longed to join his fellow Jews and fight the Nazis, rather than remain in his solitary apartment overlooking the ghetto, with his own end unknown. <p>The story is told from a uniquely unsentimental point of view. I felt at times that Szpilman, brilliantly portrayed by Adrien Brody, had distanced himself from all emotion, except for the periods when he played the piano in his imagination, and listened to music in his head. Perhaps this detachment was the mechanism that allowed him to survive emotionally. <p>The well-written screenplay, by Ronald Harwood, was adapted from Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoirs published in 1946. During some of the movie's most emotional parts, there are amazing camera shots of snow falling, or leaves blowing across an empty street, or the snow covered ghetto ruins that look like the end of the world, with the only sound - Chopin's piano music. These film takes add emotion to the film, compensate for, and contrast well with Szpilman's emotional isolation.<p>There is a haunting scene, near the film's end, with Szpilman and a German officer, that still moves me to tears when I think about it.<p>The film is a remarkable in its sensitivity, and portrayal of one man's struggle to survive.  I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>When Adrien Brody received the Academy Award for best actor in a leading role earlier this year, I was at first surprised. (I had expected Daniel Day-Lewis to be elected because of his incandescent portrayal of William "Bill the Butcher" Cutting in Gangs of New York.) Then I began to think again about The Pianist and realized that Brody's character -- Wladyslaw Szpilman --  was the focal point of that film from beginning to end...and that most of his portrayal was non-verbal. (Some may assert that the Warsaw Ghetto, not Szpilman, is the main character. They have a point.) Directed by Roman Polanski who also won an Academy Award -- as best director -- and deservedly so, this film examines a five-year period during World War Two when Warsaw was invaded and occupied by German and then Allied forces. <p>For me, the defining moment in this film occurs when a bomb exploding in the studio drives Szpilman from the piano and ends the broadcast of his performance. His obsession with creating art seems to exclude from his consciousness any deep concern about his family (parents, two sisters, and a brother) or about the brutalities amidst German occupation, especially in response to Jewish resistance. I have not read Szpilman's memoirs, first published as Death of a City (1946) and then as The Pianist (1998). All I know about him is based entirely on Brody's portrayal in the film. This detachment from the world around him is evident again later, as when Szpilman, in hiding, silently moves his fingers across a piano keyboard, lost in the creation of music only he can hear in that situation but which the film's soundtrack effectively provides.<p>Polanksi's film obviously celebrates human survival during one of history's worst periods. I realize that comparisons and contrasts of Szpilman with other characters in other films is probably a fool's errand. However, at the conclusion of the The Pianist, I thought about Sol Nazerman (played by Rod Steiger) in The Pawnbroker (1964) who, at that film's conclusion, unleashes a silent scream of unspeakable pain. For whatever reasons, there is no such indication that what Szpilman has observed (if not experienced) has similarly affected him. The war ends. Life continues. Szpilman's career resumes. Perhaps, just perhaps Szpilman's own emotions can only be expressed through the creation of great art. It remains for others to express theirs in other ways, perhaps with a silent scream.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film begins with an old film of a street in 1939 Warsaw. Next a man plays a piano for a radio program. Explosions interrupt his performance. At home his family packs clothes (September 3, 1939). German troops march into town. How to hide their money? Oppressive regulations follow. All Jews must move into a district of Warsaw. Goods are sold cheap. A wall restricts access. Misery follows, the film shows the hardships. A man tests coins by bouncing them on marble (silver rings true). Underground newspapers are distributed to the people. Smugglers throw bags over the wall. Some are caught and killed. People die from hunger. A raid by German troops kills people. Hunger affects people. The lucky get Certificates of Employment. Others are sent east to resettlement camps.<br /><br />People are rounded up into the courtyard and selected for transportation in 1942. They are loaded into cattle cars. Someone pulls Wladek out of the crowd. Workers are marched out of the Ghetto to work. Some are shot in the street. People are sent to Treblinka but never food. Only young people are left in the Ghetto.  Arms are smuggled into the Ghetto to prepare for resistance. Wladek slips out the gate. He finds a refuge with friends. A change of clothes is his disguise, he will be hidden at another flat. On April 19, 1943 the Jewish Resistance began their war against Nazi oppression. They hid in the empty apartments. The survivors were shot after it ended in May. Would the Poles rise next?<br /><br />There is bad news: the Gestapo captured some of his friends and he must leave. There is more suspense. Wladek finds a new refuge. Will he be as quiet as possible? Wladek hears about the invasion of France and the Russian advance (1944). On August 1, 1944 the Warsaw uprising began. The water supply was turned off. Wladek finds another refuge. The film shows the destroyed buildings. Will someone discover hime? Wladek plays for the German officer, who brings him food. "`Spielman' is a good name for a pianist." A sound truck plays a Polish song, the Germans are gone. But there is drama at the end. "I'm cold." At the end Wladyslaw Szpilman plays the piano at a concert. He lived 88 years. The German officer who helped him died in a POW camp in 1952.<br /><br />This story is about life in conquered Warsaw during WW II. It is educational as any true story can be. It skims over the events from 1939 to 1945 to present the highlights. Warsaw was completely destroyed after the 1944 rising, it was all rebuilt after the war. One suburb, Praga, remained undamaged and was used in filming. The ruins came from another country. One lesson is that disarming people is the first step on the path to oppression. They always claim this is done "for your own good" or for "national security". After the Caesars came to power they also disarmed the Romans, and you can find other examples in history.<br />[The book "On Both Sides of the Wall" will tell you more about life in occupied Warsaw.]</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>This film is very effective in portraying what I imagine was an utterly horrible time in history. And it really is all thanks to Adrien Brody who was utter perfection in this. He never overdid it and his performace was gut wrenching. Everybody should see this movie.

His role is the focal point throughout most of the action--so perfect in his characterization that he makes the story an unforgettable and deeply moving experience.<br /><br />His confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights. Nothing, it seems, is pictured in terms of black and white. All the gray areas are visible. This scene alone was justification for Brody's Oscar.<br /><br />Roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.<br /><br />An inspired, thought-provoking piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving. Not since SCHINDLER'S LIST has the brutality and epic sweep of World War II been captured so accurately.<br /><br />Highly recommended for mature audiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A37B3O457INKEA.html">A37B3O457INKEA</a><br/><p>THE PIANIST is a very fine movie about the survival experiences of a Polish pianist during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw in World War II. The film contains many memorable scenes reflecting both the worst and best of humanity under extremely trying conditions. One such scene shows German soldiers bullying and mocking elderly Jewish refugees and another depicts a Russian tank blasting a building in which the pianist is hiding. In contrast, there is a scene in which a German officer finds the pianist playing the piano in an otherwise vacant building. The German officer seems mesmerized by the music and grateful to be able to experience such a pleasant interlude in the midst of the horrors of war. Immediately a bond is struck between the two men. The role of the pianist is played by Adrien Brody. Also in the cast are Thomas Kretschmann, Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox, Ed Stoppard, Julia Rayner, Jessica Kate Meyer and Michal Zebrowski.<br /><br />THE PIANIST was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. Oscars were won by Adrien Brody for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Roman Polanski for Best Director. Ronald Harwood won an Academy Award as well for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. In addition, Polanski won a Golden Palm for this motion picture at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB.html">A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</a><br/><p>Roman Polanski's "The Pianist" tracks the incredible struggle for survival of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist in 1930s Warsaw. As the film opens, Wladyslaw is recording on Polish radio, but a bombing raid forces him out of the studio and into the panicked streets. We soon meet his family: a headstrong brother, gentle sisters, and aged parents who are aghast at the more and more extreme measures taken to dehumanize Polish Jews: wearing armbands, not allowed to walk on sidewalks, not allowed to sit on benches in public parks or eat in Gentile establishments, and finally, the move to the Ghetto. Wladyslaw's tight-knit family struggles to stay together as conditions become more and more dire.<br /><br />The film traces the disintegration of order in Warsaw from 1939 to 1945. Wladyslaw's life goes to new lows as the Ghetto is evacuated to the work (death) camps, and he must go into hiding, his situation becoming more and more dire as he is forced to flee from place to place and scrabble for food. He is taken advantage of, nearly dies from jaundice, and is nearly killed several times, but throughout the music in his head, heart and fingertips still burns brightly. Towards the end of the war, a single act of kindness by a Nazi commander proves that there is still decency in humanity, and finally Wladyslaw is once more able to give the world his musical gift over Polish radio.<br /><br />This film, while perhaps not on the same level as Schindler's list (there is very little dialogue for much of the film, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it becomes an almost Cast Away tale of solitary survival at its rawest), highlights the indignities perpetrated against European Jews. Dead bodies litter the streets, and the Nazis indiscriminately kill or humiliate whoever they so desire. Human dignity has no worth. The film's violence serves to underscore how much like animals humans can become, filled with primitive blood lust, or like the Jews in the Ghetto, forced to survive on an animal level: an old man attacks an old woman to steal her food, and as the mush splashes on the filthy pavement, he hungrily stuffs it into his mouth off the ground. This is powerful filmmaking, based in part on some of Polanski's own remembrances. (Rated R for graphic violence).</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This film may be well the sublime masterpiece of this gifted director .<br />The deep emotional impact and the introspective atmosphere of the movie allow us to watch the artist before the opression , the struggling presence of the Nazis in Poland and through the obstinate bars of the mercurial , epic and granitic Chopin Ballade No. 1 Op. 28  , Adrien Brody will built his own shield against the enemy .<br />But in the middle of this moral misery this fact will become the weird vehicle which links two refined souls . One of them is clear , but the another is seriously disturbed , between his internal wishes and the outside demands and imposed rules. This encounter will open an invisible gate for those men who will share far beyond his beliefs and points of view a warm and effective reason to forget though for brief moments the crude surrounding reality that involves them .<br />There is film dated from 1979 titled Roads in the night and casually directed by Krzystoff Zanussi, a polish filmmaker too in what we watch the clash culture between a Polish countess listening Chopin prelude op. 28 No. 15 best known as Teardrop and the curious impossible romance with a aristocratic nazi young officer due the obvious political obstacles .<br />As you see both films are close related but the Pianist differs from that one in its inner epic aspect .<br />The heart of the craft will never be under the war miseries , seems the prevailing statement of this excellent movie a real Cannes winner and much more received in Europe than America even it suffers of certain steadiness along its development .<br />Towering acting for Brody who won the Academy Award as best actor.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>When I finished watching this movie I was pretty much speechless.  This is a movie that, I think, everyone should see.  In some ways, it's similar to Schindler's List but The Pianist follows one person as opposed to a large segment of people.  At times, it's a difficult movie to watch because of the atrocities that occured.  I found myself comparing The Pianist to Schindler's List quite a bit.  In the end though, I prefer The Pianist because it seemed more real.  It must have been awful to feel so alone in the world after being split up from your family and not knowing what will happen to you or them.<br />The movie is about a man, Wladyslaw Szpilman who, in the 1930s, was known as the most accomplished piano player in all of Poland.  At the outbreak of the Second World War, Szpilman becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the Germans. By the start of the 1940s, Szpilman sees his world go from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, while Szpilman is conscripted into a forced German Labor Compound. At last deciding to escape, Szpilman goes into hiding as a Jewish refugee where he is witness to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw City Revolt in 1945.  This is truly a movie that must be seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>This monumental retelling of real events from 1939 Warsaw through the end of World War II is now atop my list of favorite films, joining "The Godfather", "A Clockwork Orange" and "All The President's Men" on that pinnacle. There is little in my existence that presents a more shattering, emotional and involving real life story than this astounding film.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it (poor you!), it's a nearly three hour review of events that occurred in Poland from the time of the Nazis invasion and occupation in 1939, through the development of the Warsaw ghetto, to the trains hauling people away to concentration camps, to the resistance fighting to regain their country, to the Russians eventual arrival in 1945. In an afterthought, it appears everything ends well...although we all know Stalin and the USSR put Poland under its thumb in 1945.<br /><br />The film tells the real life story of a Polish pianist, a national treasure, that was hidden during the war. The first hour of the film is told through his family's travails; the rest through his life. His story is told in remarkable vignettes of battles in the streets of Poland with some of the best war footage ever created for the screen. It won exceptionally well-deserved Oscars for Adrien Brody and director Roman Polanski and the adapted screenplay from the book by its subject, Wladysalv Szpilman.<br /><br />The score to this film, available on a remakable Sony CD, is not only a generous offering of music from the film but one of the better Chopin collections of recent years, very well-played by extrovert pianist Janusz Olejnicak. It includes one of Szpilman's own Chopin pieces, circa 1948.<br /><br />My one complaint: Can someone explain to me how the little entertainment "Chicago" beat out this film for best film of 2002 as judged by the Motion Picutre Academy? What a travesty! Here is a once in a decade film and surely the best World War II story since "The English Patient" and better than that flick! Adrien Brody at least won the Oscar for best actor. Maybe he deserved that but this film surely deserved best movie. It is probably the best film of the new century.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>I did not like &quot;Schindlers List&quot;. That movie was too Hollywood driven. &quot;The Pianist&quot;, on the other hand was detailed, richly engaging and incredibly sad.<br />Adrien Brodie was the perfect choice as a Holocaust survivor in this true story of the horrific nature of WW2. Only Roman Polanski could make such a film. Over 3 hours in duration, but you will not notice because the film is so engaging, if not difficult to watch at times.<p>The DVD itself is a must-own, along with &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>One of the most magical aspects of movie making can be found in the rare occasion when such a dramatization of a best-selling book results in an equally spellbinding film.  Of course, the fact that it was Academy Award winning director Roman Polanski chosen to direct the project was a critical choice in bringing this shattering story of a man who found his humanity in classical music even in the midst of the Nazi takeover of Poland during World War Two to the screen. Given Mr. Polanski's personal experience as a Holocaust survivor, he has an exceptionally well-hewn capability to recreate all the sights, sounds, and sensibilities of the times to the movie with loving accuracy. In so doing he has created a modern masterpiece along the lines of such similar treatments of the period as Stephen Spielberg's "Schindler's List". <p>Yet, while Spielberg apparently was striving to paint a broader-brushed treatment of the period and the horrific excesses of the Nazi treatment of the indigenous Jewish population during the war, Polanski concentrates much more exclusively on the personal journey of a solitary human being, in this case a pianist so singularly focused on his art and its centrality to his existence that he is often almost schizophrenic in his ability to ignore or block out all the mayhem, chaos and destruction that surrounds his every move.  Against such a backdrop of the momentous events transpiring from the German army's invasion of Poland in September of 1939 through the end of the war is the pianist's story so marvelously told. His survival through the most barbaric of conditions imaginable is a testament both to his good luck and his hardy strength of will to survive for the sake of his blessed classical music. <p>Young actor Adrian Brody, in an Academy Award winning performance, both accurately and amazingly portrays the almost unbelievable events experienced by author/pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman as he makes his tortured way through the brutal gauntlet of the Nazi killing machine bent on the systematic extermination through the combined strategies of enforced work regimes, slow starvation, and murder in the death camps. The protagonist survives through a combination of his own wits as well as through the unexpected and strictly forbidden assistance of others, many of whom literally risked their own safety and lives by reaching out to aid him.<p> Polanski puts a human face on the Germans as well, showing at one point how in the midst of the unspeakable horror many of his colleagues were visiting on the Polish Jews and gypsies, even an officer in the Wehrmacht could be willing to risk his own safety to assist the pianist. The cinematography is remarkable, with a superb depiction of the massive destruction that modern war brings in its wake. The overshots of a totally destroyed Warsaw is a graphic demonstration of such total devastation on a scale so unimaginable that it would be otherwise difficult to grasp either intellectually or emotionally. This is a film that belongs in any serious film fan's library, and one I can heartily recommend for all but the youngest viewers. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2 "The Pianist" is a bit like "Schindler's List" as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile - Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with "The Pianist" since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew - the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.<p>This is not to say that "The Pianist" is a better film than "Schindler's List" - far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option - having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto - Szpilman flat out declines the offer.  This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes "The Pianist" seem frustratingly superficial at times.<p>Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, "The Pianist" is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost "reportorial" objectivity.  As in "Schindler's List," people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways.  Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  "The Pianist" doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  "The Pianist" brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.  <p>Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb.  Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.<p>"The Pianist" is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains "The Shop on Main Street," the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what "The Pianist" is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  "The Pianist," by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Polanski had to make a film about the tragic past of the country whose name he carries. He had to concentrate on the primal historical "crime" committed by cosmic time and the war in 1939-1945, the extermination of the Jews by the Germans with the vast complicity of the Poles. The film is brilliant in its dense darkness because Polanski does not concentrate his tale so much on the community but on one particular Jew and his family he will be the only survivor of (it is a true story). He does not choose a Jew that would represent money or work, but a pianist, an artist representing cultural, universal and human talent that has no ethnic color whatsoever. And yet he moves further. After showing the ghettoization of the Jews in Warsaw, then their enslavement and extermination, then the escape of this pianist and his clandestine survival in the hands of non-Jews, some honest resistant fighters who put themselves in danger because of their political action, some (at least one) making a personal profit out of their help, the pianist also sees the meaningful and significant upheaval of the Jews when the ghetto is nearly empty. Pathetic but too late. He sees the doomed upheaval of the liberal resistant fighters and this time too early so that the Germans can exterminate them. Note here the film never really concentrate on the SS as the evil doers and the others as submissive followers. All Germans are concerned. The sacrifice of these resistant fighters leads to nothing since it clears the way for the communists to be the only ones to profit from the arrival of the Russians. Polanski even pushes one step further and there the film becomes a gospel about the shiny side of humanity. That pianist will survive the last few weeks thanks to a Wehrmacht officer who will accept to hide his presence and to feed him through to the end , and even give him a coat - that could have been tragic when the Russians arrived - before leaving. The officer had been convinced to provide this help by some music played on a piano by the Jew in the middle of ruins and on the eve to the final defeat. Music as the universal humanistic language beyond barbarity. Beautiful. Inspiring. A real salvation and epiphany for us all. That is exactly where pathos is discarded and love comes into the picture. A love that can transcend hatred and reach cosmic time in the smallness of human historical if not purely existential time. And If the pianist survive up to 2000, the German officer died in captivity in the USSR in 1952. Irony of irony, it is nothing but irony.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>This movie stands out due to the excellent acting of the lead character and how well it manages to reflect on the lives of Jews(especially) and others caused harm by the war.

This is a well-directed Holocaust movie by Roman Polanski, and the stellar acting by Adrien Brody [who deservedly won an Oscar for his role] makes "The Pianist" a truly memorable viewing experience.<br /><br />The story is based on the real-life experiences of Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman [played by Adrien Brody] during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw in WW II. The movie follows him from his piano playing days at Polish Radio, through the restrictions imposed upon the Jews by the Nazis, the move by Szpilman and his family to the Warsaw ghetto,how he is saved from deportation [whilst the rest of his family gets deported to Treblinka, an extermination camp], his role in the Jewish resistance movement, and finally his struggles in hiding on the Aryan side of Warsaw till war's end.<br /><br />The brutality of the Nazis is very effectively portrayed in this movie without being over-the-top - scenes of Nazi violence against the Jews are usually portrayed in brief but potent scenes, leaving an indelible mark in the viewer's memory. One particular scene still haunts me - the Nazis have selected a group of Jews for deportation [including four members of Szpilman's family] and a young woman innocently asks the SS officer in charge where they're being taken. His response is a shot to her head - just like that, and her only crime was to speak up. There are many poignant scenes that are heartrending in their portrayal of human suffering - a grieving young mother who is beside herself as she smothered her own child to death to prevent the baby's cries from being heard, bodies of Nazi victims including young children, and also one particularly disturbing scene where an old man in a wheelchair is picked up by the Nazis [for being unable to stand up when the Nazis stomp into his family dinner] and thrown off the balcony. Though the scenes may appear random, the viewer is well aware that there was nothing random about the Nazis' intent - that of decimating the Jews.<br /><br />Adrien Brody as the pianist Szpilman effectively portrays a man who is tortured by his circumstances, yet bears all his suffering in silence - witnessing the atrocities around him, being separated from his family and learning of their tragic fates later, and being forced to endure the agony of incessant hunger whilst trying to stay alive. His indomitable spirit shines through in many scenes, especially the scene where he is asked by a German officer to play the piano - even in the midst of great hunger, and with fingers gnarled by sickness and starvation, Szpilman is able to play an achingly haunting piece that would have done a concert pianist proud.<br /><br />"The Pianist" is definitely a memorable Holocaust film - it even shows that not all Germans were monsters as exemplified by the humane German officer who helped Spzilman when he was in hiding. Though the movie evokes the horrors of the time it also captures the resilience of the human spirit under the most harrowing circumstances.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Seeing the name Roman Polanski has become quite common nowadays, but that attention is focused more on his private life than the films he has directed over the years. The Pianist is one of his most celebrated films, winning 3 Academy Awards including one for Polanski as Best Director. It also won the Palme d'or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002. The Pianist is a Holocaust film, based on the autobiography of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Roman Polanski survived the Holocaust and this was obviously a personal project for him; I think his personal history is (for once) relevant to the film, because his background makes him very aware of the Holocaust and the horrors that accompanied it.<br /><br />The film begins in Warsaw, 1939 as Great Britain declares war on Nazi Germany. Wladyslaw "Wladek" Szpilman, a highly lauded pianist and his Jewish family see their happy existence crumble around them, as Germany's invasion of Poland is well under way.. They're required to wear armbands identifying themselves as Jews and soon are evacuated from Warsaw into a Jewish district.<br /><br />There's not much more that needs to be said about the plot. Unlike many Holocaust movies, The Pianist gives a very in-depth look at the day-to-day life of Jews in the Jewish ghettos. What makes this so impactful is the way Polanski lets the story unfold. We know where the story is going, while Szpilman and his family do not...Yet, we're just as shocked as they are when things go from bad to worse. Don't think from what I've said that The Pianist is just another history lesson...There's a deeply human, intriguing story that draws you in and can be quite suspenseful.<br /><br />The film itself is incredibly well-made and I applaud Polanski for re-visiting the unspeakable horrors that he lived through. There are scenes that are shockingly horrifying and they are filmed with an unflinching honesty. Polanski almost always keeps his camera detached from the action, making the audience feel like a helpless onlooker. In one of the film's most devastating scenes, Wladek is separated from his family as they're put on a train to what will be certain death. It's not only fantastic on a cinematic level, but an emotional one as well.<br /><br />Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Academy Award for his performance as Wladek and he really did deserve it. He gives a believable, low-key performance completely without ego or bravado. Its perfection and power come from how human it is and his ability to never seem like he's acting. Brody IS Wladek Szpilman in this film.<br /><br />Movies don't come more powerful than this film. It's a beautiful, heart-breaking, suspenseful film with one of the decade's greatest performances and one of the world's greatest directors.<br />There's a scene towards the end that is one of the most profound and powerful in the entire film...And it's just a man playing piano. It's a perfect example of how thoroughly Brody portrays Wladek, but also a testament to what an amazing director Polanski is. The Pianist is one of the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust, but it's also one of the greatest films ever made. It's an absolute triumph that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>This film is about the characters survival in tough times, and is told in such a way that it really has a realistic element, captured on film. In other words we see exactly what the character had to go through in order to survive, and it truly is an amazing story. Similar to Polanski's own story, of survival in Poland during the Nazi Occupation during World War II. Also, noteworthy is the cinematic elements used to tell the story, such as expressive, but realistic use of camera, lighting, color and sound.

He clearly has the playing skills of Chopin and he's totally focused upon his art until WW II intervenes... thus, the viewer can anticipate his forthcoming experience(s).<br /><br />This film is a bit of a sleeper -- at least I've never heard folks talking about it much... certainly not to the level it deserves.

It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.'<br /><br />In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence:<br /><br />Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...<br /><br />Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup...<br /><br />Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...<br /><br />Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, "I wish I knew you better."<br /><br />Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...<br /><br />Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...<br /><br />Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...<br /><br />Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...<br /><br />Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head...<br /><br />Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..<br /><br />Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...<br /><br />Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss...</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Winner of the Golden Palm, should have taken home the Oscar, `The Pianist' is, in my humble opinion, the best film of 2002.  It's one of those films that truly speaks to me on so many levels and resonates with me long after I'm done watching it.  Adrien Brody's masterful performance was rightly rewarded during that years Oscar ceremony, as was Roman Polanski's brilliant directing and Ronald Harwood's excellent screenplay.  The heart of this film, of course, is found in Adrien's performance, a tour'de'force as they call it.<br /><br />Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous pianist who is on the cuff of fame when the Nazi's invade Warsaw and he's forced into hiding.  `The Pianist' chronicles Wladyslaw's perilous journey and sheds light on those who helped him along the way, those who put him up, provided for him and even those who left him to die.  One reviewer noted that this is merely a story of one man's survival, and they alluded to the fact that that was a bad thing.  I disagree for it's a wonderful testament to the will to survive, that will in each and every one of us.  Just because Wladyslaw may not have done anything overly important with his life doesn't mean that his heartbreaking and uplifting story needn't be told.<br /><br />`The Pianist' helps the viewer to realize the horrors of the holocaust, the fact that more than what you think you know happened.  An example of this is found when a group of Jews are stopped while they are marching to work.  They are all lined up and a few men are randomly selected from the group and executed.  This is an act I never gave to much thought to.  I think for the most part when we think about the holocaust we think about the concentration camps, which were awful in themselves, but even outside those walls these people were treated horribly.  Even just the constant mocking and random beatings are a true testament to the atrocity that was that dark time in human history.<br /><br />As a side note I wanted to mention that, while he's only in a few minutes of the film, Thomas Kretschmann pulls out such a moving performance towards the end of this epic film.  As Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, Kretschmann shows so much emotional weight in his few frames as a man who feels pity for Szpilman and his condition and helps him the best he can.  There's one scene in particular when both Brody's and Kretschmann's eyes alone speak volumes.  Just after they meet Hosenfeld tells Wladyslaw to play something for him on the piano.  That scene alone carries the emotional crutch of this film, for in Wladyslaw we see this fear and pain as he begins that slowly transforms to this remarkable release and in Hosenfeld we see this admiration and concern that comes over him.<br /><br />Other supporting actors that must be recognized are Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman who play Wladyslaw's parents as well as Ed Stoppard, Julia Rayner and Jessica Kate Meyer who play his siblings Henryk, Regina and Halina respectively.  Michal Zebrowski, Ruth Platt, Ronan Vilbert and Emilia Fox, among others, show beautifully that some humans do indeed care for more than just themselves as they play a few of the people that try to help this man survive.<br /><br />I don't understand how anyone couldn't be touched by this remarkable film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>As many other people I was avoiding seeing this movie.

Here you have a concert pianist, who with his family, ends up in the Warsaw ghetto, but by one of the Capo guards pulling him out of line, Spillman was able to escape the fate of many other Jews during that time. What surprised me is the Nazi Officer's compassion towards him(probably thinking that it was too late in the game to shoot him or send him off),even to the point of giving him his coat(which almost got him shot when the Russians came to Warsaw),but still a great film just the same.

Adrien Brody's unforgettable performance is nothing short of stunning as he plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist caught up in the Nazi's war against the Jewish in Poland during World War II.  This extraordinary film wouldn't have been as nearly successful without the exceptional performance given by all the supporting actors in this film as well who all deserve as much praise as possible for their parts.<p>Strangely enough, this is the first film I've watched that was directed by Roman Polanski, which is a mistake that will be corrected.

Billed as a making-of featurette, "A Story of Survival" transcends that reliably lightweight genre on the power of Polanski's words and vivid recollections. <p>The director tells his personal story clear-eyed, almost matter-of-factly, but with heart. As he speaks, images from Nazi camera crews are intercut with nearly identical clips from "The Pianist," showing how the director used WWII film archives to ensure authenticity of the movie. The making-of includes recent footage of the real-life Wladyslaw Szpilman playing a Chopin nocturne (the pianist died in 2000). <p>Polanski says he chose the autobiography of Polish musician Szpilman because it was written right after the war, when the memories were fresh. The book's detail of the Nazi occupation was "vividly true to me, a child of the same period," Polanski says.  <p>"The Pianist" looks fine, up to major studio standards. Audio is generally OK, in DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1, with a fairly tame mix that makes little use of the rear sound stage. Center-speaker dialog is noticeably muffled at times. The DVD opens with the studio's usual ads for upcoming films, particularly obtrusive given this film's subject matter and tone.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Based on the book by real-life pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, the film traces a single man, surviving on wits and luck through dark, cruel years of World War II Poland. Szpilman is a classical pianist whose middle-class, affluent Jewishness is not much of a liability until the Nazis arrive. From that point on, he and his family endure the slow tightening of the Nazi noose -- yellow armbands and petty restrictions -- leading up to the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto and the deportation of his family to the death camps.<br /><br />Like many Holocaust films, "The Pianist" fails to serve up the raw terror of the times. We are asked to view terrible scenes of mad cruelty, but as viewers, we are too detached to actually feel the unending sense of dread that must have been part and parcel of everyday life. It may be too much to ask a film to do this for us, but they must at least try.<br /><br />"The Pianist" is quite true to its namesake book. Both serve up hellish ad bizarre images that if they were not witnessed, would not be believed. The Polish partisan shot in the back and slumping to her knees in the street; the communion-like division of a tiny dime-candy among 6 doomed people; the Bizarre Waltz forced by bored Nazi guards on Jews waiting to cross a barred street; the young lad beaten to death trying to crawl through a storm drain; starving elderly Jewish workers fighting over a pot of beans. These are powerful images that convince because of their relative insignificance. The Holocaust and resistance were a compendium of such small yet telling moments of horror.<br /><br />While Adrian Brody well deserved the best-actor Oscar for this film, "The Pianist" is an extraordinary ensemble movie. Szpilman's family is very real -- by turns bickering, calming, worrying, sharing. Thomas Kretschmann, who plays German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, is extraordinary in his depiction of a man torn between duty and humanity. The Pianist brings to the screen the memories of a man who survived two of the most extraordinary events of the war -- the liquidation of the ghetto and the Warsaw uprising. It's a testament to the thousands and millions who played their small parts in a gigantic drama that shaped the last century.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>I happen to disagree with David Denby's review.

While the basics of the film have been covered in the reviews, what struck me was that this protagonist is not some superhuman hero type, but merely a highly talented man trying to survive - he avoids fighting, relies on his elite contacts, and ventures out only when he can't avoid it.  Lots of his time is spent in solitude, waiting fearfully and introspecting.  This made him a kind of everyman, with whom I for one could identify far more than some otherwordly figure like Martin Gray, whose story of survivaly is as intimidating as it is fantastic.  This film reveals how most of us would have gone about trying to survive:  it required pluck and courage, but also luck and avoidance of danger.  The acting is also perfect.<br /><br />Also, the extra of Polanski speaking aobut his childhood - and how he survived a near-identical situation, is incredibly moving and fascinating.  This film is perhaps his most important, for himself.  One wonders what his career would have been like had he stayed in Hollywood.  I must say that, given the repertoire of films he has done since then, such as this or Tess, his first-rate talent was not diminished.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

A film based on the true life of Szpilman with an incredible screenplay, magnificent direction, first class acting, and great cinematography all combined together by Polanski's brilliant skills as a director.  This film deserved every Oscar it received.<br /><br />Not only does the film bring out the atrocious reality Poland encountered in WWII under Nazi occupation but it also shows the subleties of human nature in times of privation and war.  It shows that even in the bleakest of moments the human spirit is deprived indeed without art or music.  The film shows that human suffering is not merely a product of political ideology such as Nazism but more of individual evils that are not particular to race, nation, or religion.  Polanski demonstrates that Poland's misery was caused just as much by spineless Jewish and Christian collaborators as it was by the Nazis themselves.  The story also shows that many German officers were not the setereotypical Nazi thugs as shown in Spielberg's films but men of conscience trapped into an insanity that had gone beyond anyone's control and that could only be resolved through total war.<br /><br />This is simply a triumphant presentation by an extremely talented director.  Polanski's recreation of the Polish uprising is outstanding and shows the horror that Poland suffered throughout the war.  Few people realize that although approximately 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis, half of them were Polish and Poland lost an additional 2-3 million non-Jewish citizens making Poland equal in its losses than the Jewish peoples as a whole: Warsaw was virtually razed to the ground during the uprising!  I give my complements to him for depicting this little known fact with subtle yet powerful imagery.  Again, this is simply an outstanding film and certainly one of the best dramas on WWII and the Nazi atrocities in Poland in particular.  The film is a powerful vehicle in depicting a man's will to survive and his retaining both his humanity and hope through his love of classical music and the piano.

At first the restrictions placed on Szpilman and his family don't seem so bad, but as time goes on they are forced to move into the Jewish ghetto, where they are eventually loaded onto a train bound for one of the concentration camps.  As Szpilman is waiting to board the train with his family, however, he is pulled from the crowd by one of the ghetto police, Jews who are working for the German officers in hopes of better treatment, and told to run away.  From that point on his life becomes a struggle for survival, working for the Germans until they liquidate the ghetto, then being smuggled from one safe house to another until he is finally discovered in the bombed-out ruins of a flat by Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, a German officer who is so moved by Szpilman's music that he decides to keep the secret of the pianist's survival until the Germans retreat from the city.<p>Adrien Brody played the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman with great sensitivity, showing Szpilman to be a man of deep feeling who is witnessing the horrors of the war all around him, but doing what he must to survive.  Adrien Brody was able to make the character of Szpilman so believable and human that I found myself near tears several times during the course of the movie.  Thomas Kretschmann was also very good as Capt. Hosenfeld, the young German officer who provides aid and comfort to Szpilman after hearing him play the piano.  While I was watching this particular scene I could actually see Hosenfeld being torn between his duty to his Motherland and doing what he knew to be right as a human being, and Kretschmann played it just right.<p>In the end, The Pianist was a wonderful movie, and one of Polanski's greatest achievements.

After a series of disappointing films, director Roman Polanski came back with a vengeance with this personal tale of survival during the Holocaust. Winner of several Cesars and Oscars for Best Director & Best Actor (Adrian Brody), Polanski's dispassionate tone is just right for this film, never falling into sentimentality the way Spielberg did in "Schindler's List" (the only flaw in that Oscar winner) and Brody himself is consumatively excellent in the title role (he stated that he lost weight, his apartment & his girlfriend but kissed Halle Berry!!).  I am planning on acquiring the HD DVD version of this superb film which also touches on the irony of war.  The episode involving a Nazi officier (Thomas Kreutzman, who later reteam with Brody in "King Kong") befriending Spilzman is touching.

REcreated scenes, will stay with the viewer, like a young woman being shot in the head for asking the Nazi guard where the Nazis are taking them, a mother holding a small boy who is dying of thirst, and begging for water for her child.<br />A little girl, holding an empty bird cage, and crying because she cannot find her family.<br />Roman Polanski has showed his flare for directing once again, and brilliant acting by Adrien Brody as Wladyslaw Szpilman, Emilia Fox as his gentile female friend Dorota, and Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.<br />A story of one man's quest for survival, among the cruel genocide of millions.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>There are moments in this film that I have never seen before, and many other scenes reminiscent of "Schindler's List."  The major difference between this and Spielberg's gem is that "Schindler's List" is more objective, and "The Pianist" is subjective.  In this film a rapport develops with Szpilman and you see the horror through his tired eyes. The direction is astounding, and I pity anyone who did not see this on the big screen. There are many shocking scenes, most of which happen so fast that they are indigestible before the next horrifiying sequence.  This may leave some people feeling cold, but the technical filmaking in this movie is superb.  Roman Polanski richly deserved the Oscar for Best Director. This is a moving film with many unnerving scenes that linger long after the lights have come up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>Adrian Brody is in the role of a lifetime. He certainly deserved the Oscar for his acting performance in The Pianist.<br />Very moving and touching. This historical film will go down as one of the greatest films in history.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Directed by Roman Polanski, this film recounts the true life story of the Polish Jew and classical pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, and how through sheer luck and gritty determination he survived the Holocaust.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this film.  I heard the reviews and Oscar nominations, but I had no idea what I was going to experience when I popped this into my DVD player.<p>What makes the film so oddly compelling is Adrien Brody's silent performance.  There are long sections of the film that smoulder on the screen with an eerily noisy silence.  Combined with the constant uncertainty of what will happen next, the film places the viewer unnervinngly on edge...for two and a half hours!  While it was undoubtedly the director's intent to convey the sense of imminent danger to the audience, much of the film involves Adrien Brody crawlingly silently through the rubble of ruined buildings. I can't help but to wonder if the film could have been shortened considerably with some careful editing of some of these long pauses, which ultimately do not provide much in the way of exposition or character development.<p>Also interesting to me as a music lover was the subtext of music transcending race and nationality, even between a Nazi and a Jew.  A commendable piece of filmmaking, although ultimately not quite as powerful as Schindler's List.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>You think you have it hard in life ? Look at this film and it will make you appriciate every breath you take. If you are against all odds, would you give up or keep on fighting for your life ? This is what the man in the movie did. He fought and never gave up. Brilliant movie, cast, story. A real tear jerker. Get the tissues and soak it in. Adrian Brody deserved the Oscar. A MASTERPIECE INDEED</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>I realize it is fashionable to rave about this film, but I found it dull.  It is well acted and well photographed, but the Brody character is just not very interesting.  This guy escapes the holocaust through the efforts of a series of other people, does very little to help himself other than scrounge for food, does essentially nothing to save others and shows little gratitude towards the people who help him.  There are seemingly endless scenes of Brody sleeping or staring out a window.  This is a yawner.  There must be a lot of politics behind all the awards this film got.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>Some films are simply beyond criticism.  See this movie.  Nothing more to say.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>After it was garlanded with awards and so much critical acclaim I decided I had to watch The Pianist, even though with war movies you never know whether you'll get something honest and affecting or trite and clich&eacute;d.  Polanski's movie definitely belongs to the former.  Charting the life of the Jewish pianist Szpilman (Brody) against the backdrop of war in Poland it's a powerfully emotional piece that, once you've seen the end especially, makes it well worth sitting down for two and a half hours to watch.  Interestingly, rather than show us a view of the Polish resistance or an inside view of the harrowing concentration camps, this is all about one man, and all the better for it.  The Pianist achieves a kind of intimacy with its subject that other similar films cannot boast.<p>Beginning with the bombing of the radio station where Szpilman plays to Polish listeners, his family are rapidly dispatched to the Jewish ghetto.  I've heard a few reviews stating that the parts of the movie involving Szpilman's family life are clich&eacute;d.  In a way this is easy to see, with stereotypes being made of various figures such as the brother who refuses to be put down, the valiant sister and the elderly father being used for the sympathy vote.  However, the movie is told in such a brilliant manner that you forget all of these clich&eacute;s (especially since it's based on a true story).  There are some scenes that are very difficult to watch - people being shot point blank or tossed from windows - but it's this kind of emotional intensity that make it all the more worthwhile.  It was certainly a wise choice to stay out of the concentration camps, in part because the looks on the faces of the Jews being herded into cattle trucks to be sent to their deaths is enough to affect any viewer, and also because it might have been too harrowing for the viewers.  Significantly, it is when Szpilman is alone in the bombed down city streets of Warsaw that the movie really scales down to the intimate and where Brody's performance stands alone as one of true excellence.  Admitedly these parts can get a little slow, but they're worthwhile for the conclusion, which couldn't have come about without these parts and it's certainly brave of Polanski (and typical) for him not to flinch at any part of Szpilman's memoirs.<p>The final moments though, are just sublime.  Starving in an abandoned house Szpilman is finally discovered by a sympathetic German officer, and these scenes really burn a deep impression into your memory.  Acted with humiliation and sense of what's lost, culminating (inevitably) in Szpilman's uplifting/depressing performance of Chopin, it's the emotional core of the movie.  Put simpy, this deserved every award it won, and then some.</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>Why live in a make believe world when the real world is so much more intriguing?<p>This film tells the story of a pianist who struggled for survival during the Warsaw Getto Uprising in WWII.  I was glued to my seat.  The book from which this film was adapted is more of a journal than a novel.  It was written just after the event, so the memories depicted are fresh.<p>The bonus menu is also strong.  The film peaked my interest to learn more and the bonus specials filled in the missing gaps, complete with shots of the main character in old age and film clips and photos from the Warsaw uprising.<p>This is not a "feel good" movie.  You won't smile, but you will come away a little richer.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>As all viewers would have known, this is a great movie.  It is a personal movie for Roman Polanski as much as "Schindler's List" to Steven Spielberg.  It's not for me to say that which one is better than another because I don't believe a comparison is needed.  Rather, I would rather treat them as two different entities.  Whilst their cores are different, one depicting how one soul is saved by reluctantly saving countless of lives, the other is about surviving the hardship during the occupation of Poland during World War 2, both of them attempted to convey  the potential evils that we humans could become.  From this movie, I learnt of the ghettos, the walls that separated the Jews from the others not unlike the Berlin Wall, the kinds of humiliations & indignities that Jews needed to live through during those oppressive periods.  I also learnt that there was a disunity among Jews during that time.  Some were Germans lackeys & some totally opposed to them.  There were many poignant moments.  Out of those hard time, we were also shown the generosity & compassion that came from people from all walks of life & race (including a high up German officer) to assist Brody's character despite the danger that they might brought to themselves.  The movie never rushed & it gradually revealed itself like a great story book.  We rejoiced & elated for the survivors when the world was all over.  It's about triumph of human spirits.  I guess if we believe much in ourselves, we shall conquer all adversities.  This movie is just the right reminder for us all.  A beautiful movie that's "enjoyable" to watch.  Highly recommended.  In terms of technical information, the DVD set comprises of two CDs, one a feature movie & the other, a documentary depicting how the movie is made.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NVW4NUXPOSJB.html">A1NVW4NUXPOSJB</a><br/><p>I guess we have all tendencies to compare this movie with the Shindler's list.This movie is certainly very close to the reality and as a matter of fact, it's really well done. I will mostly compare this to the movie serie named HOLOCAUST filmed in the 80's with Meryl Streep<br />You become easily like involved in the story.If you want to compare with the Shindler's list, I will say the Spielberg's work was more telling about the period, the fate of most of the jews. Polansky tells about the fate of just one character walking in what Spielberg described.<br />The pianist is someone who will have a lonely journey and it for sure makes the story,not less interesting, but flatter or quieter than the Shindler's list.Adrien Brody is simply excellent and it's an actor I'd like to see more often.<br />Last thing, please try to get and watch Night and Fog, it's a french 30 minutes documentary by Alain Resnais. In it, no actor but real pictures, real people and I can tell you, It will certainly be the more horrible thing you have ever seen on a screen making very weak everything you saw about the subject.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>The Pianist is an amazing film on all counts and could well be the best film from Polanski and his most personal work to date. The best way to describe The Pianist is by sticking Robinson Crusoe in the middle of a Nazi Holocaust.<p>Holocaust films are always striving to get at you emotionally by creating good guy bad guy type scenarios. The truth is that The Pianist is not really concentrating too much on delivering a Holocaust movie. Instead it aims for telling the tale of a feeble piano player trying to survive Polish Nazi occupation. The premise is a simple one. The Pianist is not like his brothers, sisters or friends who are all actively seeking ways to rebel against the Nazis. Instead he is just trying to stay alive in order to engage in his one passion in life - playing the piano.<p>Basically the film starts with Wladyslaw Szpilman (An amazing Adrian Brody!) learning with his family that the Nazis are making decrees against the Jews. You see the elevating intensity of a rich family suddenly being relocated to a confined Jewish district and then the horrors start to build up from simple street provocations to full out mass murders in public view. The buildup is powerful and horrifying. The things you see in this film will make you angry and mad, but the Holocaust is not really what is at the heart of this film.<p>Wladyslaw is just a Piano player and can do very little to stop what is going on. He does not wish to join any revolution and tries to stay out of the way being hospitable and polite when he can. As the world collapses around him he finds his life spared from the concentration camps only to be catapulted from the frying pan into the fire as he tries to survive in solitary either with the help of Jewish sympathizers or by living among the rumbled ruins in search of food. Seeing the world through the eyes of Wladyslaw is what this film is all about and Brody gives his best performances when he is alone with nobody to talk too or anything to say. Just seeing him stagger around in search of food is like nothing you have seen before or will see again.<p>Sure the encounter with the Nazi commander at the end is a little hard to believe and it does border on the fantastic as if to create a musical plot twist for our pivotal character but then again it is based on a true story and these things did happen so it is believable in an unlikely sort of way. <p>At its core, The Pianist is a survival movie about one man trying to last among the rubbles and ruins. At times it is surreal and at others it is devastatingly emotionally potent. This is one of the best films of the 21st century and you should certainly not miss out on seeing this drama. The set designs, plot, script, costumes, acting and action sequences are all on top form. For realism it is simply unparalleled by any film of its kind.<p>Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>I admire Polanski for taking a broader look at the Holocaust, showing the divisions within the Jewish community in Warsaw and the help some got through the Polish underground.  Of course, it helps to have such a compelling figure as Szpilman to wrap this complex story around.  <p>One gets a very strong impression of the devolution of Jewish life in Warsaw, as Szpilman's family is forced to reduce itself to increasingly more appalling conditions. Polanski takes in a large panoply of characters, showing just how difficult the situation was for all those involved.  The Germans are by and large faceless officers who carry out random killings.  The Warsaw Uprising is touched upon.  Szpilman seemed to have an angel on his shoulder, able to keep one step ahead of the Germans.  <p>The situations are tense and unsettling but the film is perhaps a little too clean in terms of depictions and gives a little too glossy and account of the horrors of war.  Adrien Brody turns in a fine performance.  He seems to capture Szpilman's early disillusion and eventual degradation through the course of the war. Szpilman was a survivor, which contrasted sharply to the nihilistic views of his brother.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>"The Pianist" is one of the top 10 best films of 2002.  It was rightfully nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, going on to win three: Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.  Its true story of world-famous pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who struggles for his life during the Holocaust is very powerful, yet brilliant.  The hardcore drama begins the moment his passionate music career becomes threatened by Hitler.  Its material is close to as graphic as the actual conditions, which is how it should be displayed.  Such intensity, which is never lost for a second, guarantees an emotional reaction.  All the emotions in the scenery and through the characters are heartpounding through Szpilman's entire unfortunate journey.  The immense research of these events is present.  The writer's own heart and soul was written in every word.  This project was wonderfully led by Roman Polanski's brilliant vision.  His directing talents answer why he deserves his legendary status.<p>The set scenery is as accurate to the actual buildings and living conditions of Europe in 1939-1945.  The hard work through the construction paid off, adding extra living intensity.  The clothing worn in the movie adds the necessary emotional value that keeps audiences watching.  All other physical details in this film are also flawless, namely the make-up and the dirty scenery (dirt, burns, blood, etc.).  The musical score was composed beautifully, blending perfectly with every scenes' particular mood.<p>The performances from all the actors are beyond words.  Adrien Brody beautifully portrays Szpilman in his career-launching role.  His every drop of heart and soul are obviously presented through his character.  This is one of the best Holocaust movie roles in cinema history.  His talents prove that he'll be around for many more years.  A few other actors could have received Oscar nominations for their supporting roles without critic complaints.<p>"The Pianist" is a great movie for entertainment and education.  This future classic is sure to please many audiences.  Those looking for more perspectives on the Holocaust should also watch "Schindler's List", which offers a more graphic look.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>How much shame? No more than we deserve, all of us. How much guilt? Not yet quite enough, I fear. Obviously we crave more grief in atonement for the atrocities of the foulest century of our history, since we eat up films and novels that depict it. Do you, esteemed reader, feel guilt and shame at the genocides perpetrated by your species against each other? If not, you're unworthy of something we call humanity.<br /><br />W'adys'aw Szpilman, the "pianist" of the film, was not a hero. He was a survivor. Perhaps that's the best any of us can claim, to be survivors. But then, there's the phenomenon known as "survivor's guilt." I've known several Holocaust survivors; in fact, I'm related to some by marriage. Some express guilt, some express gratitude, but I've never heard one boast of survival. In any case, Szpilman was a real person, whose post-war memoir attracted little notice until decades after the events it described. The first film based on it, made in Poland in 1949, was suppressed by the Communists. Szpilman's son republished the memoir in 1998, first in German and then in English. Szpilman died in Warsaw in July, 2000 at the age of 88, two years before the release of this film directed by Roman Polanski.<br /><br />The first three-quarters of this film are agonizing. Horrible. Plausible. My wife couldn't handle it. She went off to bed to read a new "Parker" novel for relief. The acting, to be honest, isn't brilliant, but the cinematic portrayal of the brutality of the Nazis in Warsaw obviated any need for character development. Then came the escape. The survival despite all odds. Battle scenes, flight across roofs, the wry humor of near starvation assuaged by a can of pickles. And at last, One Just Man, one German capable of pity. That German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, really did appear in the memoir; his identity was later confirmed, and it's known that he died in a Soviet gulag. I suppose the end of the film is intended as a statement of comfort and optimism, possibly as a signal of reconciliation. From the moment Szpilman is discovered in hiding by Hosenfeld, music swells in the film. Hosenfeld orders Szpilman to play the piano, and director Polanski gives us quite a long concert view of the Pianist's hands on the keyboard. The Russians arrive, the war is over in a few quick edits, and Szpilman is at the keyboard again in a rebuilt radio studio. The end of the film shows Szpilman performing a concerto with a full orchestra. He survives. Music survives. Human decency survives. That's the message I think the film delivers, but I'm not persuaded. Not even music can redeem us. That's a powerful statement of grief and guilt, coming from me, a person who lives for music.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>This is undoubtedly one movie that will stay with me for a long time. Adrien Brody's performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman was definately oscar worthy. The story is a touching reminder of what humans are capable of acheiving when fighting for survival. The fact that the film is directed by Roman Polanski who lived in the nazi 'era' made the story all the more real to the viewers. I also liked the way the story was told in that there were good and bad Jews, Poles and Germans. Often in the past one side was 'all bad' and the other side was 'all good.'</p></br></body></html>

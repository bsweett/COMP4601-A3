(although a solid minority of critics went for it too).<br /><br />Just as experimental as 'Requiem' and 'Pi', but with a more complex,<br />humanistic, metaphysical message, here all Aronofsky's visual pyrotechnics<br />(and the film does look amazing) feel like a means to an end not an end in<br />themselves.<br /><br />A love story that takes place in 3 time frames (the 1500s as a<br />conquistador hunts for the source of life, the 'fountain of youth', the<br />present where the same man, now a scientist tries to find a cure for<br />cancer before his beloved wife dies and 500 years in the future, where<br />the same man again is with his love, who is now a tree, still looking<br />for eternal life.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weitz are terrific, and the score is creative and<br />effective. Ultimately a very moving look at the nature of life and<br />death. Yes there are a few pretentious moments, but I'll take slightly<br />flawed grand ambitions to explore something in a new way - ala '2001'<br />over the same old, same old every time.<br /><br />(possible spoilers ahead)<br /><br />The fact that the past and future segments are part of a fairy tale<br />book started by the dying woman and finished by the scientist seemed<br />very obvious to me, but seemed to leave a shocking number of critics<br />scratching their heads,confused as to which story is 'real'. I can see why,<br />if you miss that, the film could seem confusing and arbitrary, but<br />it's laid out pretty clearly along the way.<br /><br />The blu-ray is pretty gorgeous looking, but the regular DVD is quite<br />watchable.  But this is case where the film is primarily a visual<br />experience, so if you can see it on a large screen, from the<br />blu-ray, that's the way to go.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky definitely made a pretty film -- the play of light and dark, shadow and substance (aka Rod Serling) create a real Twilight Zone. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5U5EE">Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collection</a>  The film begins rather haphazardly and makes the viewer wonder what the heck is going on.  After rewatching the beginning again and paying a bit more attention (vital skill for this film) you see (a) the beauty of the photography and (b) the metaphysical theories of life and death.  Death being a journey to "awe", some Mayan mysticism <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587369982">Time & Transformation: A Novel of Mayan Mysticism</a>and some grief.  Some impossible purposes (finish the book, conquer death) and some interesting characters and chemistry.  Having Hugh Jackman <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CMLIJ6">X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a> here was an interesting choice:  never seen a man cry so much.<br /><br />Be prepared to wonder at the beauty of this film.  No other word for it;  pretty, aesthetic, almost steals the show.  Jackman plays three people at once; a conquistador in the 16 century, a medical practitioner in the present century and some far off future he's a shaman in a bubble (reminiscent of the plants-in-a-ship from "Silent Running") heading towards Shaballa, the nebula worshipped by the Mayans and now reincarnated Jackman (Tommy) becomes First Father and recreates the Mayan creation myth -- uhm, I think so anyway.<br /><br />Many conclusions, keeps you thinking, nearly as esoteric as 2001: A Space Odyssey <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> in a lot of ways.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>Director Darren Aronofsky (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKD2">Pi and Requiem for a Dream</a>) has created a niche for himself in the film industry. Much like filmmakers David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and Vincent Ward, Darren Aronofsky explores the realm of dark drama, where dreams and fantasies flow into everyday reality. His film The Fountain is an ambitious science fiction/fantasy film with a strong metaphysical undercurrent. As always, Aronofsky utilizes his keen visual sense of storytelling while focusing on characterization and maintaining an emotional momentum. What really brings the film together is the unique narrative structure that combines three different timeframes. This storytelling device can partly be accredited to Aronofsky, though most of the praise should go to the film's under appreciated editor, Jay Rabinowitz.<br />Another crucial element of the film is the haunting music by Clint Mantell, which will stay with the viewer long after the film is over.<br />The film stars Hugh Jackman as Tomas Seville / Tom Creo and Rachel Weisz as Queen Isabel / Izzi Creo. The talented supporting cast features Ellen Burstyn, Mark Margolis, Stephen McHattie, and Cliff Curtis. Still, there's no doubt that it's the performances of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz that propel the story forward.<br /><br />In the year 1,500 A.D. Queen Isabel of Spain suffers under the reign of terror that was the Grand Inquisition. She turns to her most valiant warrior, Tomas Seville, to save Spain from bondage and in return she will give him her hand in marriage. The queen believes that the Tree of Life grows in New Spain (or South America), and that whoever drinks the sap from this tree shall be given immortality. This, she believes, is her only hope of saving herself and her country from the wrath of the sanctimonious grand inquisitor, Silecio. So Tomas gathers together the bravest of the conquistadors and travels to New Spain in search of the fabled Tree of Life... but the dangers that await him may prove too great even for this noble warrior who faithfully serves his queen.<br />In the year 2,000 A.D. a doctor named Tom Creo searches for a way to save his dying wife Izzi, who has an inoperable brain tumor. But as Izzi's health declines she finds a spiritual awakening in the legends of the ancient Mayan culture. These legends revive memories of a past life and inspire Izzi to write a novel that will help Tom cope with her inevitable death. All the while, Tom is consumed with grief and obsessively continues his research with an enzyme found in a rare South American tree.<br />In the year 2,500 A.D. Tom travels through space with the tree he planted over Izzi's grave. Haunted by images from their past, he meditates on loss and what it means to live and die. As Tom drifts ever closer to Xibalba, a dying star that is enshrouded in a nebula, he learns the truth about immortality. Most importantly Tom learns to let go and understand the importance of physical death.<br /><br />In the end (if there really can be one), The Fountain is about a love shared between two soul mates, a love that transcends life and death, time and space.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W46I">Somewhere in Time</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G8NXZK">Brazil</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALZ2">12 Monkeys</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007GZR5">What Dreams May Come</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOBI">Donnie Darko</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKJA">Mulholland Drive</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Y4TWE">Riverworld</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Aronofsky's FOUNTAIN plays with the Fountain of Youth myth that the Spanish Conquistadores were so infatuated with, throws in a liberal dose of Eastern mysticism, a smattering of ever-lasting-love ( a thousand years ), and on top of that, a few interruptions in space, and time. One might expect the result to be a turgid, incomprehensible mess. In a lesser director's hands, such probably would have been the case, however, I found this particular sci-fi to be effortlessly lyrical, heartbreakingly poignant, and artistically on a par with Jeunet, and Caro's CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, and Burger's THE ILLUSIONIST.<br /><br />Jackman (as Thomas), and Weisz (as Isabel-Izzy) are both superb as lovers caught on the wheel of time, reincarnated, and adversely fated to suffer the same misfortune for a thousand years. Thomas' quest for the 'Tree-of-Life' to save the love of his life, and Isabel's staunch belief in him even in the face of her own death(s) are touching, and as magical as the Bubble-ship that the twenty-sixth century version of the then mad Thomas travels to Xibalba in.<br /><br />On the whole, there is more Shakespeare, and Marlowe in this film than science. The camerawork, lighting, and sets were phenominal.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Where does one begin with a film such as the mind-boggling '06 film `The Fountain?' After viewing this extremely esoteric, non-linear journey through time and space one is left in a vague stupor, experiencing feelings of deep spirituality and unfathomable profundity all wrapped in a timeless universe of eternal beginnings and endings. Either that or one is bored out of their mind.<br /><br />Fortunately for me I fall into the first category. Director and writer Darren Aronofsky has graced us with a masterpiece work that will most likely never receive the acceptance and audience it surely desires, but it will have a following that will always adore this film.<br /><br />I guess it's time to sit down and re-vamp my personal list of all-time favorite films. I certainly have to find a spot for this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Without a doubt, Darren Aronofsky has subtly crafted the best film of the year.  With this film, he has introduced a brave new paintbrush, a canvas that would be unpopular with the amateur cinefile, but over time will be considered an independent classic.  Like he has done with such powerful films like "Pi" and "Requiem for a Dream", Aronofsky, with "The Fountain" has entered into the ranks of such budding directors as Richard Kelly and Christopher Nolan.  While his work may never be seen as mainstream, his thoughts are continuous, his sentences are bold and detailed, and his worlds are pure imagination.  This, "The Fountain", simply defines what a movie-going experience should be like.  He forces the audience to think, use the visual clues throughout to tell us the themes without making our antagonist speak them loudly for audiences to hear.  He designs outside the lines, and his film are considered too "thinking" for the average viewer, but to me, this was a movie, simply put, about love.  "The Fountain" is one of those broad scoping epic stories that felt eerily Kubrik-ian with its style, but purely Aronofsky with its imagery.  This is not a story for the weak of heart (or mind for that matter), but simply a story about a never aging love pushed through the heartstrings of immortality.<br /><br />To begin, Aronofsky has designed a beautiful cast to represent this story.  In several interviews, he talks about his desire to make a science-fiction film, and at first I was skeptical on how well "Van Helsing" himself could voice Aronofsky words, but coupled with Rachel Weiss, the two are magic.  Hugh Jackman is phenomenal in the role of conquistador, scientist, and finally explorer.  His expressions are Oscar worthy, and his projection of honesty is empowering.  He devours each of these three segments with enough force that accolades should have come his way.  Coupled with the way Aronofsky framed this film, the two work hand in hand.  There is little told of Tommy's love for Izzi, but what Jackman creates through his characters transforms this from a mediocre missed sci-fi romance to something bolder, and more determined.  Jackman with Weiss create another fold in this story all together.  From their initial meeting, the symbolism of the ring, the connections between the decades were subtle, but the two create chemistry with their whispers, their body language, and their obvious passion for this project.  This was not simply a Aronofsky film, but a story that all actors, visuals, and gaffers embraced.  From the opening shot you could tell that we were unprepared for this ride that Jackman wasn't going to be "cute", but instead determined and sad at the same time.  We were ready for the science fiction, but the history, the honest love, the religious symbols were exciting and fresh.  Again, Kubrick would have giving Aronofsky a standing ovation, his lessons have been passed to a new generation, and they don't believe in dumb blockbusters.  This was a science fiction film second, a love story first, which reminded me further of Kubrick's "2001" - perhaps this was a bit of an homage to that.  This was a project of passion and all the cast embodied it.<br /><br />Aronofsky's storytelling abilities continue to impress.  From "Pi" I was immediately hooked and with his honest adaptation of "Requiem for a Dream", he proved that he could tackle anything from the absurd to the taboo.  Science fiction wasn't going to stop him, but it wasn't going to be your average story.  This was going to demonstrate the longevity of love and the secrets of our universe.  His choice of edits, quick cuts, and powerful angles are more than impressive.  He constructs a story that spans eras, but still feels grounded in one specific moment.  It felt like listening to a remake of a classic song, while the beats may be different - the same message was being sent.  His attention to detail was magnificent.  I love cinema that forces you to remember other moments from earlier, small symbolic items, or details that may seem unimportant at the time, but as the focus becomes concentrated, it becomes clear.  This is more than just a film, but an experience similar to that of fighting for the love of your life.  To me, that is what transformed "The Fountain" from your average sci-fi experience to something larger.  Aronofsky created an emotion, not just a visual reference, and you experience the film for the themes he created.  This isn't a sit-back-and-relax film, but an emotional roller coaster of truth and honesty.  Kubrick has done it, Aronofsky just expanded the premise.<br /><br />With such praise for this bold new image, a comment should be made that it wasn't perfect.  The small blemishes were nearly hidden by the epic scope of this story.  The blemishes could be the lack of decibels during the whispering moments.  Aronofsky creates the unknown when Tommy whispers into the tree or to his wife, clues that will bring us full circle soon, but I found myself using the subtitle button to ensure that I found the words correctly.  The other small blemish could be the other characters surrounding Tommy and Izzi.  Aronofsky brought a couple back from his other films, but their emotions were staged and wooden.  They added very little to this story and the overall sensation of "The Fountain".  While I see the value of them being around our characters (to build the world), this could have simply been a story about two people, their love, and their quest.<br /><br />Overall, "The Fountain" was a fresh new film experience for me.  With the downtrodden nature of the Hollywood recycling bin, I was beginning to give up hope that imagination would still be used in today's releases.  As always, audiences were not as forthcoming with this film, and a quick release to DVD was inevitable.  This is a movie that is beautiful, poignant, and symbolic all at the same time - it forces you to think, use your mind, and find the hidden clues throughout.  This is not a film for all, but many should experience it.  The acting was superb, possibly the best we will see from Hugh Jackman, and Aronofsky's style and image stood on their own two feet.  This was a well-rounded film with slight blemishes that would never been seen by the amateur film watcher.  It took you all over the map without pity or remorse.  "The Fountain" was like watching a disciple of Kubrick announce his final project.  Aronofsky continues to impress with his films.  They have huge depth and range, yet easily forgotten through the course of the year.  "The Fountain" should have won awards, and in time I think it will, but for now it needs to be watched and recommended.  This is one of my favorites of the year.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>The dark filming really took away from this with details<br />lost to the lighting.  15th century Spain is lost in dank shadows.<br />The forests the the new world are in deep shadow.<br />The medical experiment lab is swallowed in ....<br />The love and ascension of the good Doctor is the major light<br />in this dream drama.<br />It is very well written as a fountain of youth parable<br />about the immortality of man in his many generations.<br />Religion, myth , Mayan legend and medical experimentation<br />as the new religion of life leave one wondering if<br />there may be a better way to live and to love?</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>If you believe life goes beyond our current existence, perhaps you will fully appreciate the spiritual meaning to this movie. Ground in real world cancer research to stop the death of a loved one and the death of Spain at the hands of the inquisition, we understand there is no way to deny it in the end. But if you take from the grace of acceptance of death then you will see it is but a journey to another life in the plants and animals. Then you may realize you knew the answer all along, you just didn't acknowledge it. The reason I found this so much more entertaining than "Pan's Labyrinth" is I wasn't beaten about the head with gore, injustice, and controllism.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky is a very talented writer & director. His previous two films "Pi" and "Requiem for a Dream" rank as top favorites for many cinephiles and are even more impressive when you realize how low-budget they are. Yet those films contain many haunting images and some innovative camera work. Give Aronofsky a budget and some big-name actors, you get "The Fountain." This film has haunting images, a haunting score, good performances, and is one of the most beautiful films I've seen. Too bad, it lacks that brilliance in plot. The film stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz as two lovers over the course of 2000+ years. First Jackman is a conquistador of Spain who is sent by the Queen (Weisz) to find the tree of life. Then, in the year 2000, Jackman is an animal surgeon whose wife Izzi (Weisz) is dying of cancer. He has samples of the tree of life and he's used them on monkeys to great success, but it may be to late to test it on his wife. Then there's the final segment, the one that transcends explanation. The only thing I can tell you about it is that Jackman is bald and Weisz is a tree. Plot-wise, this is Aronofsky's weakest film...Visually, it's his strongest. Even with a modest budget he was able to produce fantastic visuals (the visuals are one of the reasons few people forget "Requiem for a Dream" when they see it), but here he outdoes himself. I'm about to start ranting, so prepare yourselves. Aronofsky had an actual budget now, which gave him a certain level of artistic freedom. This film is absolutely, unequivally visually arresting. It's a film that is incredibly beautiful to look at, even if you're not entirely sure what it is that you're looking at. The final scenes will keep your eyes glued to the screen, whether you've enjoyed the rest of the movie or not. The performances are good, Jackman gives an under-praised performance here. He puts a chameleon act on the film and manages to brilliant disappear behind each version of the character he's playing. Weisz looks stunning, but her character(s) are one-dimensional and thefroe hard to really feel for. "The Fountain" has had a mixed reception from critics, but on a purely visual level it deserves 5 stars. Since I actually paid attention the weak plot and one-dimensional Weisz character, it gets less. However, if you open your mind and just let the images take over than you'll find a very haunting experience awaits you. The film co-stars Ellen Burstyn ('Requiem for a Dream') and Ethan Suplee ('My Name is Earl').<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>Three stories. One love. Hugh Jackman as a Spanish conquistador, a modern scientist, and a future astronaut. Rachel Weiz as a queen, a woman dying of cancer. He must rush to save her from cancer as it tears away the fabrics of their relationship and he devolves himself into finding the cure. shows that love can last in every generation.<br /><br />When I walked out of the movie, I had feelings of weirdness simmering all over my body after I watched a remarkable film. The film was simple yet made complex with the imagery and the hidden meanings. The meanings don't damper the film, it makes the film all that better, it makes the audience think, about what they just saw. Movies these days don't make you think. They apply the same motions to you and they expect you to clap and cheer for that movie, but no, this movie in itself is not like that. It leaves the audience, with a sense of confusion when they leave because the film bombards you with breathtaking things and multiple meaning imagery. The director wants you to figure out what was going on, and how you would interpret it because this film doesn't have just one meaning applied to the same situation over and over again. It has multiple meanings that are constantly changed based on your viewing experience. The meanings vary from person to person.<br /><br />The acting in the film was not all the best. Hugh Jackman delivers the most avant garde performance of the film, going all out and showing more range than he has as Wolverine or any other film roles. He takes his role seriously and he earns my respect as a dramatic actor because he certianly has proved that he can be a damn good one. Ellen Burystn, of Requiem For A Dream fame, is really underused in the picture. She really doesn't provide anything new to the movie and didn't really spark my interest in the performance. Rachel Weiez, the wife of Aronofsky, was good for what her role provided her. She took the role and tried to make it her own, and she looked beautiful in the process.<br /><br />The directing aspect of the film was top notch. Using the bacteria patterns for the 2026 scenes or whatever future year was perfect and spell binding to me. Also, I noticed that he used natural light opposed to artifical, I liked it, it gave the movie a more gritter feel to me in the past and future sequences. Also, There were some excellent shots, for example, Hugh Jackman walking towards The Tree of Life, and the whole futuristic sequences were outstanding. Although Aronofsky has been known for making really long films, the films length, over a hour and 30 minutes, was perfect for it as the imagery didn't get tiring and stale. He hit you with enough of it to stick in your head.<br /><br />When you make a film that can possibly have a audience love or hate it, and it sticks in your head and you discuss it and have conversations about the hidden meanings in the film, then it is a fine film for what goes through your thought process and the film maker's job is done when it leaves you with that feeling. I have a weird feeling that I am going to thinking about this movie for days to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>Wow.  Well then.  I still am not sure if I really liked this movie, but thats the way I'm leaning right now so it gets 5 stars.  I'll start off with the easiest thing to review.  The effects.  I was blown away by the shots of Thomas in the bubble with all the golden fragments falling down from the sky, that was great CG.  Actually it was done by photographing different stuf under a microscope(Don't expect me to be Mr. In depth:)<br /><br />The direction was either great OR not so great, like I said earlier I'm leaning towards great.  Hugh Jackman is very good in his 3 roles as is Rachel Weisz, I did like Hugh better in The Prestige, but thats just me.  This is a kind of movie you have to see more than once to fully appreciate it.  I know that this movie divides audiences.  The person I went with loathed it.<br /><br />Overall if you like to have everything explained to you and to not have any loose ends by the time the credits roll I suggest you go out, rent a Tom Cruise movie, and enjoy.  Of course theres nothing wrong with enjoying a Tom Cruise movie(I own a few of his myself) I'm just saying that by the end of this movie you will have to think about it and come up with your own  interpretation of it.  Some like that, some don't, but if you go into The Fountain with an open mind you'll at least have a chance to love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>I read the graphic novel extracted from the brilliant mind of Darren Aronofsky, who previously directed Pi, Requiem for a Dream.  He mentioned how The Fountain almost never made it to the big screen because it was a big budget project that lacked mass public appeal.  I know I was flabbergasted when this artistic masterpiece was pulled from my local theater after one week.  Alas, I had to wait for the DVD, but was glad it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />This is a romantic sci-fi journey that explores the existential constraints of the human spirit.  The story orbits around the present day, stretching ostensibly into the past and the future.  It floats around through time and space, spreading throughout the millenium that engulfs us.<br /><br />It involves three seperate stories from three different eras.  Each adventure is connected by the same character, Hugh Jackman, in which his bodily form apparently is reincarnated.<br /><br />In each tale the protagonist is obssessd with the pursuit of immortality.  Each quest is geared toward the "Tree of Life" from the Garden of Eden.  Jackman plays a 16th century conquistador, a present day cancer researcher, and a 26th century astronaut.<br /><br />This movie is imbued with all sorts of dazzling, imaginative special effects that give it quite a surreal feel.  It's both intellectual and emotional.  It raises a glaring question about our humanity, which seems to be defined both by our life and especially our death.  If death is taken out of the equation, would we lose our humanity?<br /><br />Parts of this movie can be confusing and hard to follow.  But I have an interpretation that makes sense to me, although it might not be what is intended.  I view the entire movie as if it takes place in the present day, and the leaps backward and foward in time are merely the imaginary story that the ailing wife(Rachel Weisz)is writing as she is dying from cancer.  I really like that idea, but I might be way off.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a beautiful movie, strongly reccommended if you're looking for something different.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>The first thing my wife said about The Fountain on the way out of the theater was that the film looked a lot like 2001: A Space Odyssey.  There is a definite feel of  Stanley Kubrick in The Fountain from the visual effects, particularly the scene set as Hugh Jackman travels in space.  The story is set over 1000 years covering a16th century Conquistador Tomas who is searching for a way to save the Queen of Spain, a doctor, named Tommy, trying to cure his wife Isabel (Izzy) of cancer and Tom, a 26th century space traveler heading toward a nebula that will explode to give birth to a planetary system and new life.<br /><br />The three stories cut into each other, a task that must have been difficult in a film with such an abstract story, and there is interaction between the stories.  Izzy writes a chronicle of her 16th century life and Tomas' quest for the Tree of Life but does not finish her manuscript; that is left for Tommy to do.  Tommy, ironically, in searching for a cure for Izzy's cancer tries an experimental drug on a monkey named Donavan, whose fatal brain tumor not only shrinks but grants immortality.  However, this was not the cure that Tommy wants, at first; Izzy is dead before Tommy realizes that he could have saved her.  In the 26th century, Tom is traveling with a slowly dying Tree of Life to Xilbalba, the Mayan underworld where in destruction life is reborn.  Viewers who demand that a story to be told chronologically will probably be disappointed at the way the film cuts back and forth between stories.  The Fountain is a spiritual journey into immortality; our search for a cure for all our physical maladies until we conquer death itself.  I found myself drawn into the ideas of the film as it progressed; it is a film that provokes thinking and discussion<br /><br />This film truly belongs to writer-director Darren Aronofsky  who spent seven years making the movie, a road with a lot of bumps along the way.  Hugh Jackman turns in a magnificent performance displaying a full range of emotion from joy, sorrow and ecstasy.  I found myself accepting him completely as the people he was playing.  This has been a good year for him with his excellent performances in The Prestige and The Fountain.  If one enjoys being challenged by imaginative filmmakers, then ignore the inane comments made about "Donavan's Brain" and see The Fountain.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>If you can tell them apart, then you are going to miss something in this movie that really matters.<br /><br />Let's start with the easy parts. It's beautiful, even if it tends towards a gold-sepia monochrome and big-face closeups. It manipulates your emotions, but does it well. More important: once the movie grabs your attention, it gives something grand in return. Remember how many art spectacles don't, then understand why that matters to me. It's beautiful, and it inspires sentiment that's more than a paperback-cover deep.<br /><br />If you can't feel why Jackman's scientist mourns in the lab, then you've missed most of the movie. I've felt that, a little, so I've glimpsed the uniquely human emotion being portrayed: hard, shining intellect driven by white-hot emotion. That feeling takes both; if you feel the need to argue, then you've never been taken up by that frame of mind. I think I understand a little about the conquistador, too: dying-deep love of queen and country, and personal bravery in every moment. None of that precludes art, including the devotion to a work that has to go beyond death. The work has its own life, and the human workmen must sometimes pass the vision on.<br /><br />"The Fountain" is baffling and nonlinear. It cloys and it brutalizes. It's just beyond belief. It's probably the most involving and evocative movie I've seen in the last twenty years. It engages emotions that I have never been able to share with anyone, not in my whole life. Maybe, just maybe, you've spent a lot of your life all alone with feelings like mine. As of now, you're not alone any more.<br /><br />For all that, I'm still not sure whether it's a good movie. It's great, but I don't know whether it's good. Greatness is good enough for me.<br /><br />//wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Ambitious but deeply flawed attempt from Darren Aronofsky, who fared better with PI.  Hugh Jackman did the best he could with the confusing, slow, dull script, without much help from the miscast Rachel Weisz.  Apparently she had a brain tumor and he was trying to find a way to save her--but then it turns out she's writing a novel with the same title as the film, and it spans the lives of two similar people from 1500 AD to 2000 AD to 2500 AD. And there are Mayan things and a star and a fountain of youth tree, and ......I don't know.  Who cares?  I can usually follow convoluted plots, but this was just too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>ok,1st hes (h jackman) a captain battling mayan indians in the 1600's.then he gets killed.then hes some bald yoga dude in a bubble in outer space getting his freak on with a tree.then hes in present day america as a veterinarian working on a cancer killing cure.hes working hard because time is running out on his wife ( r wiesz).she is an author whos dying of brain cancer.<br /><br />her last request is that her husband (i wasnt too interested in this so thier charactors names escapes me) finishes her book.this is where all of the time flipping comes in.in the book,she writes of a such situation where the secret of eternal life lies in sacred place.<br /><br />theres alot of crying going on in the meantime.....he cries,she cries,they both cry,she dies,he cries some more.the monkey is just glasd to get screen time.<br /><br />yes,its original and beautifully filmed.its downfall,to me at least,is aronofskys ''message'' is whatever we want it to be.i disagree that a movie cant tell its audience what its about or make message less objective.while its not a terrible movie,its one i wont be watching again or buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>This movie grabbed me right from the "git go", and it kept my attention right to the end.  The end, however, did not provide any closure at all, and for people who are "closure freaks" this is bound to be rather annoying.  This is much like the movie 2001: the ending means whatever it means to you.  If you like talking about movies, this one will give you several lattes worth of material.<br /><br />So, kudos for the stunning visuals, music score, Hugh Jackman's intensity and Rachel Weisz's adorability, and the mythology that ties the three threads of all this eye and ear candy together.  But, seeing it once I doubt I'll ever want to see it again.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>That is the message that came through to me in Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain which goes about as deep as your imagination wants to go.  Aronofsky is one of the most ambitious and creative of modern filmmakers and writers, and The Fountain is one ambitious and touching project.  Other creative and ambitious directors/writers that come to mind in the same class are Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind) and the new Mexican wave of directors Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (Children of Men), Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu (Babel), and the great Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth).<br /><br />As I said this film could be analyzed and go as deep and as personal as you like, you can literally make this film your own.  For me it was about searching for time and what your missing while you search.  What better actor then to cast in such a role then Hugh Jackman who in 2006 appeared in 6 films including The Fountain, Happy Feet, Flushed Away, The Prestige, Scoop, and X-Men the Last Stand.  Jackman in that year brought himself to a new level, how busy must he have been, what was he missing out on while working so hard, maybe that is why he delivers such a real and touching performance.  Another perfectly cast role is Aronofsky's wife Oscar Winner Rachel Weisz in a story where she is someones wife and dying, she was powerful in this and I'm sure it hit home with such topics and only having to look over her shoulder to see the love of her life and imagine him in Jackman's role.  Jackman is unable to accept her dying, he is in a position to make a change being a scientist, he is so close and time is running out.  He misses the walk of the first snow with her due to working for a cure, he is not at her bedside when she needs him, so while he is busy trying to have more time with her he is losing the time he could be having.  Weisz's character is writing a book "The Fountain" where a conquistador goes on a mission to find the fountain of youth while in the process all of Spain's men are slain.  She leaves the last chapter for her husband to finish.<br />This could apply to anyone who puts in too much overtime to provide for their family or is so into there career and getting more and more that there missing out on their kids childhood and that you can't get back.<br /><br />Another point as brought up as he died so we could live, in the process of trying to save his wife he makes an amazing discovery which could help many people, so because of her illness she inspires him to find a cure and if she dies her death could have saved countless others.  And you could keep going and analyzing this bold tale of life and death and choices.<br /><br />I gave this 4.5 stars as 10minutes before the end I found the film to lose itself for a time being, however I might have just been lost, I still found it to be a powerful and touching  film.  The theory of a person being buried and growing into a tree and death is life, and the sole lives on, like those messages this movie for me evolves and transcends beyond a film and into a message and a feeling.  Even if I forgot the film's specifics and the characters names over time, to think of the Film I would still remember the feeling it gave me and the message I took from it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>The fountain is a movie which does take a lot of risks - and for that alone it deserves our attention.. Not quite as perfect as we would have liked it to be - the movie takes a rather direct look into the mouth of death - and our obsession with forstalling the inevitable.. it also seems to be a spiritual quest of sorts.. It seems that there is a sort of transcendence in the end which was really the only way to pull the story together in a way that would be pleasing.. I have to say i enjoyed the movie despite of its shortcomings.. Most of all i admire it for its uniqueness..</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>First of all this movie is all set in the present time, at least I thought so, the rest of it is just a manuscript from within the movie. Looking for a way to help his dying wife a brilliant surgeon discovers a miracle drug that seems to reverse aging. His wife dies before he can administer the drug. He consequently suffers a mental/nervous breakdown. Finally through a ?"Dream sequence " the doctor is enlightened and discovers that death is just the transformation of the journey,  just another vehicle like the body, only without form. He becomes the Buddha or the enlightened one in the end, sitting underneath his Bodhi tree, understanding that you can not cling to life or anything, because it is only a journey, not a destination, he becomes one with universe. The visual effects of the movie are stunning, and the subliminal messages are many. Overall it kind of reminded of VANILLA SKY, beautiful film wonderfully done. If you enjoy a thinking film I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Earlier this year, I had the opportunity (or misfortune) to watch Shortbus, a sexually frank film that was meant to be a huge study and deconstruction of people's perceptions of sex but really, it was just a message film with a bad story attached to it. The Fountain was most likely made to be an art film; a film that was meant to be studied and dissected and debated about a la 2001: A Space Odyssey or the Matrix. While these films are meant to be admired for the amount of attention and passion put into it, that doesn't automatically make it a film that deserves heaps of praise or at least from everyone.<br /><br />In the first of 3 of interconnected storylines, Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is a medical doctor and researcher looking to cure brain tumors. This is an extremely personal case since his wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz) suffers from a brain tumor. Izzy is writing a book entitled the Fountain, a period piece about the Conquistador Tomas who is sent on a mission by the Queen of Spain to find the Tree of Life in the Mayan civilization so she can use it to restore glory to Spain since an evil Inquisitor has been causing trouble. In the third storyline taking place about 400 years in the future, a bald Jackman is travelling through space in a bubble which houses a tree as he travels to a dying star, said to be the gateway to the Mayan underworld. Shifting back and forth, we see the passion and determination of how far one goes for love.<br /><br />Now I have to give props where it's due: this is one lush and gorgeous film. Probably the bulk of that praise goes to the future segment done largely by macrophotography. Even though the idea of a bubble spaceship will elicit laughter, it just looks fantastic and was probably quite a sight on the big screen (our stupid theatre never showed it here). The rest of the film is as good from Spain and Old Spain with the present day segment looking the most "normal". The problem is, like how I felt about 2001, is that the film seems too...cold, kind of clinical as if the character's emotional journey is an important one but the way it's presented as a detached quality. Some will definately disagree and say it is but that's the basis of the film: everyone will walk away with different ideas of what they just saw which becomes a slight problem.<br /><br />The problem is that this film wants to be important and studied that it almost has a calculated approach, like they know they're making an important film and this is something for people who truly get it. This is meant to create discussion. "Is there a Tree of Life? Does love last forever? Is the Spanish segment Tommy and Izzy's past life? Did Tommy find the Tree of Life and is travelling through space? All in his head? Can 2 and 2 really equal five? Dude." I thought Requiem of a Dream was a technically better film than it was emotionally. The Fountain isn't as bad as that but some might walk away feeling like they saw a technically outstanding film but a little bit too pretentious for its own good.<br /><br />Even if you might have conflicting views about its story, you got to admit the acting is pretty spot-on. While best known for playing Wolverine in the X-Men films, Jackman is practically on fire here playing his character with such emotion and drive that it reaffirms this guy is one to watch. And while probably the more subtle, Weisz is excellent as Izzy and Isobel (the Spanish Queen) and you really believe someone would hunt to the ends of Earth and Space to be with her again. The rest of the cast, namely Ellen Burstyn, are good but you don't really know much about them and probably will forget their names. But ultimately this is Jackman and Weisz's movie and they deliver in spades.<br /><br />Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with a negative or positive review, this is a film everyone should at least see once.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Make no mistake, this one of Aronofsky's greatest works of art. The way he unfolds all three stories (past, present, and future) into one coherent whole is something that we don't regularly see in films these days. The overall vision of The Fountain reminds me of Stanley Kubrick: I'm not saying that Aronofsky is nowhere near as good as Kubrick (who is one of my favorite directors), but Aronofsky does seem like the new Kubrick of our generation. I'm hoping he continues to make these sorts of films so that they could dazzle us straight through.<br /><br />The only problems I had with the film were the extreme closeups of Jackman and Weisz. They were so close to the camera that I sometimes had to look away. But nonetheless, Jackman and Weisz gives astonishing performances. Jackman especially knows how to look and act like an obsessive man who will stop at nothing in finding eternal life. He should've been nominated for an Oscar, or at least a Golden Globe.<br /><br />So mix in Aronofsky's visual creativeness, Jackman and Weisz's great acting, Clint Mansell's minimal and often meditative music score, and you've got a visual masterpiece. I think it's time for me to watch "Pi" and "Requiem for a Dream", too.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Warner / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 1:36:34<br />Movie size: 15,35 GB<br />Disc size: 21,95 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 18.75 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 23<br />Subtitles: English / English SDH / French / Spanish<br /><br />No Lossless (HD) audio<br /><br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br />Version: U.K / Region B<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />MPEG-2 BD-50<br />Running time: 1:36:55<br />Movie size: 28,63 GB<br />Disc size: 44,04 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 33.31 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 20<br />Subtitles: English SDH / Danish / Dutch / Finnish / French / Norwegian / Swedish<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  4036 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 4036kbps (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 1536kbps)<br /><br />#Deleted scene: Life On Ship (4:28 min)<br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br />#Featurettes - Inside The Fountain: Death and Rebirth (63:39 min)<br />--Australia (7:38)<br />--The 21st Century (10:19)<br />--Spain - 16th Century (13:27)<br />--New Spain (9:57)<br />--The Endless Field (7:08)<br />--The Future (15:10)<br />#The Interview (Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz) - (13:09 min)<br />#Theatrical trailer<br />#High Definition Bonus features:<br />--Peter Parks Bonus - Macro Photography Loop (4:46 min)<br />--Behind The Story<br />--VFX Step By Step (8:43 min)<br />--Inside The Director's Mind - Scene To Storyboard Comparison (15:32 min)</p></br><a href="../users/A2XMBWQL0LGNJD.html">A2XMBWQL0LGNJD</a><br/><p>I was utterly moved to tears by this film. The Fountain is a breathtaking sentimental masterpiece in the vein of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66J1M">2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray</a>] as it boldly seeks to answer the great mysteries of life, love, death and re-birth transgressing the metaphysical boundaries of the universe. It's epic non-linear narrative spans the centuries with Hugh Jackman delivering an absolutely unforgettable performance as Tomas, a Spanish Conquistador in the 16th century who pledges his loyalty to Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz) to find the mythical Tree of Life so that Spain will hold the key to the Fourth Paradise, Immortality, denounced as heresy by the Grand Inquisitor. Tomas' quest is interleaved between three converging narratives across time and space. As a modern-day neurosurgeon, Tomas struggles to find a cure for a tumorous disease that threatens the mortality of his beloved wife Izzi who is writing a fable called "The Fountain" chronicling the odyssey of their 16th century quest which can be interpreted as either a fictitious or biographical account of Tomas and Izzi's lives who have endured the centuries together or simply as mythical characterizations of Izzi's unfinished allegorical manuscript symbolizing her husband's obsessive quest to find a cure for her terminal ailment that she has left for him to finish (the past representing Izzi's tale and the future representing Tomas' as he struggles to "finish it") both of which could be argued with equal measure. One of the beauties of The Fountain is its open-ended narrative construct left to speculation and interpretation and can be viewed from entirely different perspectives with each consecutive viewing. Tomas' quest ultimately takes him to the distant 26th century where he has projected himself and the dying Tree of Life across the great void of space in a transcendental bubble to reach Xibalba, the name of the Mayan underworld given to a dying nebula that brings the creation of new life from the wake of its destruction like the yin and yang of the cosmos beyond the confines of this mortal coil. "Our bodies are prisons for our souls. All flesh decays... death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul... "<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky's poetic film blossoms with rich cultural, biblical, mythical and spiritual imagery that speak the common language spoken by all religions and cultures that have asked the boldest philosophical questions about our place in the universe since time immemorial. For anyone who has ever looked to the heavens and stared in the face of mortality and beyond, The Fountain holds all of the answers to life like a profound epiphany radiating from the heavens. Drink from The Fountain and achieve the knowledge of truth and spiritual enlightenment on the road to Awe. One of the truly great cinematic masterpieces of this century and last, The Fountain will transcend the test of time and eternity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>This film is a artistic masterpiece. Its graceful beauty is does not permit debate. It will be an exquisite experience for any lover of art. The sheer visual originality will transfix the viewer. It is without pretense . . . its message is universal.<br /><br />Here is the caveat: you need not be "educated" in film to understand this work . . . you need not be a Ph.D. holder to enjoy its majesty . . . you need not have any background in Early Colonialism to follow Aronofsky's thoughts . . . but you do need to be patient. You need to prepare yourself for a visual experience that rivals Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. You need to surrender yourself to Aronofsky's vision. His non-linear approach may initially confuse the viewer . . . his metaphors may initially frustrate . . . . his repetition may initially annoy . . . but try to understand these aspects as essential to the film's glory. Trust Aronofsky to guide you through the film . . . the more you resist his approach, the less you will be inclined to enjoy it.<br /><br />Some label this film a "tear-jerker" . . . this is a terrible misnomer. Aronofsky's work did not steal one tear from my companion or me. This is not as much a work about two people, but is allegorical. So, if you are concerned that this film is a "romance," you can dismiss those fears entirely.<br /><br />This film is similar to neither Requiem nor Pi . . . that is Aronofsky's genius. He is gifted with uncommon range. Moreover, this is not the Hugh Jackman with which many are acquainted . . . his acting is sensitive to detail and strikingly stark. Rachel Weisz enthusiasts may be equally surprised . . . but hopefully in positive manner.<br /><br />Here is the bottom line: this is neither X-Men nor The Mummy, it is neither Pi nor Requiem . . . this film is as innovative as it is spectacular. Nonetheless, if you need a linear plot, if you must have explanations, if you have limited patience, you will find yourself frustrated. But, if you find yourself bored with contemporary film, tired of its predictability, exhausted with its pedestrian qualities . . . if you simply yearn to view a challenging work of art, allow The Fountain to work its uncanny "magic" on you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky has never made movies that were easy viewing. Examples? Just watch "Pi" and "Requiem For a Dream," and you'll see why this underrated director has made one of the most astounding sci-fi movies in ages.<br /><br />"The Fountain" is basically a sprawling tale that is half "real," half outside the mind -- love, immortality, death, grief and a tangled plotline that may take a few viewings to get right, but is exquisite in its simplicity. Not satisfied with depth, Aronofsky also makes it an absolutely stunning visual experience.<br /><br />Research oncologist Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cancer cure by animal testing, so he can save the life of his dying wife Izzie (Rachel Weisz), including an unsanctioned test from a mysterious tree. As she hopes for a cure, Izzie has been writing a book about a Spanish conquistador who is seeking the immortality-granting Tree of Life.<br /><br />As we see in other flashbacks, that conquistador is a version of Tommy (and Izzy as Queen Isabella). And far in the future, Tommy still struggles with his wife's loss, as he travels to a distant nebula to revive the tree. But as he finally gives in to his wife's last wish, he becomes enmeshed in a mysterious rebirth that stretches through the ages.<br /><br />"The Fountain" got a royal whupping from critics, and was even booed by test audiences, who presumably couldn't understand the three storylines -- or rather, one non-linear storyline, in which the lines between reality and imagination are blurred. Perhaps all of it is true, or perhaps Tommy's mind is creating the 1500 and 2500 scenarios to help him cope.<br /><br />As befits a movie that tackles so many deep themes, Aronofsky weaves mythology, creation beliefs, religion and the fear of death together, and binds it together with the universal theme -- love that even death can't overcome. The dialogue tends to be more spare than the story, rather than loading it down with unnecessary ponderings.<br /><br />And he does it beautifully and surreally. The whole movie is tinged in gold -- gold light, gold costumes, gold Tree of Life, gold nebula, gold deserts. The camerawork is filmed poetry: there are sweet moments like planting a seed in a grave, the Tree lit by the sun, and the sight of Tommy inside the nebula. The most exquisite moment comes when Tommy kneels before Izzy, under the Tree, with drops of golden light falling around them.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly Jackman's best movie, making us feel Tom's love and sorrow for Izzy ("There's no hope for us here. There is only death"), and the lifelong struggle against death. Your heart really breaks for him. Weisz is sweet and wilting as Izzy, and the chemistry between the two leads makes their time-busting love seem entirely reasonable.<br /><br />Aronofsky has made a story that is pure art, exquisite in theme, and while you might have to watch "Fountain" a few times to really "get it," but you won't regret the experience. Even if you don't like it, in an era of bland popcorn movies, its ambition is worth praising.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>An epic film (at a non-epic length of 96 minutes), Darren Aronofsky's ambitious science fiction parable "The Fountain" demonstrates that the director wants to continue to make dense, emotionally complex films that require audience involvement. Although it isn't flawless, "The Fountain" is an enjoyable film that moves along at its own leisurely pace. Although "The Fountain" was critically attacked when it was released (it was booed at Cannes), it's an ambitious worthwhile film for those who have the patience and aren't expecting a explosion filled Summer blockbuster kind of movie. Aronosfky serves a different slice of "pi" here in trying to tackle the subject of mortality, reincarnation and the afterlife. It's a fascinating film even when it fails to reach beyond the rudimentary topic at hand.<br /><br />The different strands of this interlaced triptych have different success rates with the story involving the Conquistador's search for the Tree of Life that a Franciscan Monk (Mark Margolis) friendly to the Spanish throne may be able to find. If the Conquistador (Hugh Jackman) can find it, Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz)may survive the expanding inquisition. The present day story with Jackman as Dr. Tom Creo struggling to find the cure to his wife's cancer (she's writing a book called The Fountain which details the first part of the story about the Conquistador and his search. When Tom "reads" the story he's reading a metaphor about what is happening to his wife, his efforts to save her, etc.) all the while running into unintentional roadblocks from his boss (Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar nominated performance) is along with the first, most successfully. The last segment set in the 26th Century while visually dazzling is the most cryptic much as Kubrick's ending for "2001: A Space Odyssey" was cryptic in tackling the concept of mortality and "rebirth". Again, it could be seen as Tom's efforts to save his wife from his perspective and his ultimate surrender to fate and the acceptance that he may not be able to save her in this life but can join her in the next.<br /><br />While Arononfsky's ambitious story may leap out of his grasp, there's much to admire in this visually stunning film. It won't be for everyone but like Kubrick's "2001" it will speak to a specific audience and the skill with which it is made will insure that its reputation (both for good and bad) will grow with time. In fact Aronofsky's film probably has more in common with the two versions of "Solaris" more than Kubrick's film with their consideration of life, death and how they impact those we love.<br /><br />Linking all six characters that Jackman and Weisz play is an interesting idea that might confuse those expecting the film to be literal. On the other hand, one could rationalize why they are in all three stories since it touches the attempt by Jackman's character in all three stories to try and defeat death allowing him to stay with the women he loves. Perhaps in some way they are the same "characters" constantly struggling to defeat death to stay together. You decide. Aronofsky takes an almost literary approach to the material eschewing the action-adventure approach of most film science fiction.<br /><br />For those interested in the DVD extras we get a six part featurette that can be viewed all at once that covers everything from the genesis of the project (when it was entitled "The Last Man") and the discussions that Aronofsky had with a Ari Handel (who co-wrote the story). They had many discussions about life, death and fate all of which were fed into this compelling film. It's amazing what Aronofsky gets away with given the low budget of the film. At one point the film went into turnaround when Brad Pitt and Cate Blachett pulled out of the film. Originally budgeted at $75 million, the production saw its budget sliced in half after Pitt left the production (reportedly due to creative differences with Aronofsky). Aronofsky lost his sets (they were auctioned off when Village Roadshows pulled out of the production as well)<br /><br />The fascinating, beautiful visual effects were achieved using micro-photography of chemical reactions on Petri dishes vs. with CGI and looks just as good (if not better) than some of the visual effects for similar films that have used CGI to portray a star about to go nova. We also get the original theatrical trailer. While that's nice, a good commentary track would have been a bit more revealing particularly during some of the more symbolic and over-the-top sequences of the film.<br /><br />Is "The Fountain" for everyone? No. Some will consider the film to be a pretentious hodge-podge of romantic/spiritual sci-fi and homage to Trakovsky's "Solaris".  "The Fountain" has more in common with Tarkvosky's "Solaris" than "2001" (although Tarkovsky's film is about a man trying to deaden himself against the living memory of the woman he loved). In that regard, "The Fountain" is a fine companion piece to both films (if a bit more esoteric and cryptic). I personally like "The Fountain" but it will take some patience to stay with the overlapping often intersecting storylines and absorb the ending of the film. "The Fountain" is thoughtful, emotional science fiction something of a rarity in today's bigger, louder, faster science fiction films. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ATIX">Solaris</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006L92F">Solaris - Criterion Collection</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ASUM">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The Fountain is an interesting movie, and for much of it, quite confusing.<br /><br />When the movie begins, you are treated to a variety of events that unfold in a very confusing way, and you begin to wonder if it's possible to catch up to everything going on.  However, after a while, all the events seem to come together and flow with the story.  It's one of those movies that takes a lot of time and patience to understand.<br /><br />It's a story about living forever.  Or rather, trying desperately to find a way to live forever, through a series of fairy tale events and strange happenings.

Past examples include Somewhere in Time, The Lake House, Timeline, Bicentennial Man, and maybe even the Sixth Sense.  This is probably the weirdest of them all, but also the most intriguing.  The movie is actually three stories wrapped into one, all of which feature three characters, Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz, and a tree that gives life.  The three are intertwined and revolve around a man, played by Hugh Jackman, trying to save his lover, played by Rachel Weisz, using the power of a tree.  All are OK stories in and of themselves, but meshed together the whole is more than the sum of the parts.  The same music theme is used for all three stories, which is unfortunate and repetitive.  Both Jackman and Weisz act well, and the story is interesting enough.  It just jumps a little too much, and the story that takes part in the future is not fleshed out that well.  The title of the movie refers to a book being written by Weisz's character, and my guess is that it refers to the Fountain of Youth.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>Director Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain was overall just too slow and ambitious to make it a huge Box Office hit.<br /><br />We found it a beautifully crafted film, with a touching storyline with themes like timeless love in past, present and future all shown in such a magnificent way, albeit so slowllllly, made The Fountain at times hard to keep the viewer interested.<br /><br />But we applaud the director's eye for film-making, both in visual style and all the drama he captured from his two major stars - Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz - who do an outstanding job with the roles given to them.<br /><br />Bradd Pitt walked off the set of The Fountain, purportedly to play Hugh Jackman's character, placing Aronofsky's movie in dire trouble of ever being made. But Hugh Jackman stepped in and saved the day.<br /><br />With the mass appeal of this film, with the unfortunate slow script that made it more of a sleeper than a thriller, The Fountain reverberates with visually stunning scenes of life, death, and time-jumping sequences that at times were spellbinding.<br /><br />This would have been a much bigger major hit if the movie would have had more of the adventure feel that the beginning of the film began with, tantilizing filmgoers into hoping for a more balanced film with both drama, love, AND major adventure. Unfortunately the slow pacing of the film taxes the moviegoer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>The Fountain<br /><br />I'm reminded of what I believe was a Charlie Rose, or maybe it was a magazine article, where either a doctor or a futurist made a reference to western culture's fixation on curing death, as if it were a curable disease like any other and not an inevitability.  That this potentially poisons ourselves and through extreme fear & grief impedes our ability to be in-the-now is something eastern cultures seem to have come to grips with long ago.  I found the subject matter heartfelt and do not have a problem saying "This film moved me."  Because it did.<br /><br />Thank goodness The Orleans Casino had a gal who knew what she was doing with the projector.  There was some problem with the shutter not opening all the way at the beginning of the film, but eventually we got it worked out and the bottom half of the print became fully lit in all its glory.  Those efforts were well rewarded.  I found The Fountain visually stunning and did not at any time find it to be silly, though it has quite a few moments of abstract and open-endedness to it.  For instance, why is the nebula bringing life back to this tree?  Maybe I missed a part during the efforts to fix the shutter, but it seemed as if we are simply left to assume the power of the tree and the nebula are connected.  The tree's life-giving abilities have been nearly used-up by this doctor who obviously has taken advantage of them and stayed alive far, far into the future.  So far, in fact, that his space ship appears to us as simply an elastic, transparent bubble that is capable of making new bubbles (space ships) around him at will.  We have no idea how it works, but it clearly does...at least to those viewers who allow the film to be what it is and make an initial and respectful suspension of disbelief to allow its own rules to be established and worked within.  I think a caveman would say the same for my computer screen.  So we are cavemen to this futureman.  The technology is so advanced as to be, not to be redundant, literally and figuratively totally simple, elastic, and transparent to its end-user.  Neat concept.  Can any of you think of a better way to illustrate the ultimate technology of the far future?  I can't.<br /><br />Interestingly, because this new tree was planted on her grave, she is somehow now a part of it.  This is a call-back from an earlier set-up accomplished by a story she previously told.  Through eastern meditation and consuming of the bark, he appears to be reliving the elements of his past, reminiscent of Wim Wender's meandering and overly-long Until The End of The World.  As in that film, this virtual living in the past is a kind of egotistical black hole of stagnation.  Here I think it works better, since we as the audience are brought along on the narrative by his re-experiencing of the events from the very beginning, rather than it being a secondary structure at the end.  Quite a number of people seem to think the conquistador thread was an actual historical past for the film characters, but forget that it is Izzi's book as "visualized" by Tommy as he reads (or read), and who injects he and his wife into the central characters.  This historical allegory of unfinished novel, the past when he was a doctor, and the present-future are all three intertwined.  The futuristic returning to the Garden of Eden to partake of the Tree of Life creates a new Adam and Eve, I think, both immortal in different ways.  By doing so he has lost his perspective, though.<br /><br />I found the duality curious that eastern meditation was both the key to exploiting this endless reliving in the first place with the Izzi-tree and the means to bring himself to end it, by finally visualizing a suitable ending to his wife's book.  In order to re-attain wisdom and appreciate once more the true reality and, indeed the past-nature of, that beautiful relationship once more outside of this clouded, emotionally-distorted & fixational abyss of immortality, there is only one thing the doctor can do: partake of the Tree of Wisdom, which is death.  In this way, just as the novel took on characteristics of their lives, life also takes on characteristics of a story, which is one way to find solace in mortality if that is something you are willing to accept, where life has a beginning, middle, and an end, yet is perfect in its own completeness.<br /><br />Viewing The Fountain is not a passive experience, intellectually or emotionally, and you no doubt will bring a great deal of baggage on its subjects of love, death, immortality, consciousness, and eastern thought.  I suspect the strongest feelings will oddly enough be on that last item, even though it is only a tool and framework to explore the rest.  I can see quite a few people being turned-off seeing a bald Hugh Jackman floating in the lotus position to his literal and figurative finale.  Is it silly?  I don't think so.  Gene Siskel once leaned over to Roger Ebert during their first screening of Fargo and whispered, "This is the reason I go to the movies."  The Fountain made me remember why I go to the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>This movie is visually stunning but it is not intended for those who need constant action.  After a confusing start this movie bloomed into something incredible.  Really hard to describe in words it had such strong spiritual overtones than anyone who has faith will feel more enlightened.<br /><br />This journey begins in 1500 A.D. as the main character is a Spaniard in Ancient Mexico in search of Eternal Life.  It is said a tree possesses this power.  Although you are not really given that information at first it becomes evident how beautiful the cinematography is.<br /><br />The Fountain focuses around 2000 A.D. and the story of a doctor who is fighting to keep his beautiful wife alive.  It is not necessarily her physical beauty but that of her spiritual presence that makes her an amazing character.  Full of energy and life despite being stricken with cancer.  Her husband cannot accept this journey she is on.  Instead he continues to focus on some way to keep her alive.<br /><br />I watched the Blu-ray edition.  This movie is chock full of special features making much more of an experience for those who want to watch.  The picture is not superb as compared to other Blu-rays I have seen.  The audio for the most part is also average.  I believe all versions include the same special features.  I would say if the DVD version is much cheaper to get that one and watch it on an upscaled DVD player.<br /><br />The movies visual appeal also makes it confusing at times as The Fountain continually switches from past, present, and future.  The stories begin to meld make it more understandable.  What is left is an understanding over what life is really about.  This movie is not intending for everyone.  Those who may enjoy are probably spiritual and open minded enough to accept different theories of life.  It may be a tough movie emotionally for those who lost someone close in their life.  I loved the movie and somehow feel more enlightened after going on this wonderful voyage.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Leave it to me to love this often trashed film even more than Aronofsky's strong<br />'Requiem for a Dream' . (although a solid minority of critics went for it too).<br /><br />Just as experimental as 'Requiem' and 'Pi', but with a more complex,<br />humanistic, metaphysical message, here all Aronofsky's visual pyrotechnics<br />(and the film does look amazing) feel like a means to an end not an end in<br />themselves.<br /><br />A love story that takes place in 3 time frames (the 1500s as a<br />conquistador hunts for the source of life, the 'fountain of youth', the<br />present where the same man, now a scientist tries to find a cure for<br />cancer before his beloved wife dies and 500 years in the future, where<br />the same man again is with his love, who is now a tree, still looking<br />for eternal life.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weitz are terrific, and the score is creative and<br />effective. Ultimately a very moving look at the nature of life and<br />death. Yes there are a few pretentious moments, but I'll take slightly<br />flawed grand ambitions to explore something in a new way - ala '2001'<br />over the same old, same old every time.<br /><br />(possible spoilers ahead)<br /><br />The fact that the past and future segments are part of a fairy tale<br />book started by the dying woman and finished by the scientist seemed<br />very obvious to me, but seemed to leave a shocking number of critics<br />scratching their heads,confused as to which story is 'real'. I can see why,<br />if you miss that, the film could seem confusing and arbitrary, but<br />it's laid out pretty clearly along the way.<br /><br />The blu-ray is pretty gorgeous looking, but the regular DVD is quite<br />watchable.  But this is case where the film is primarily a visual<br />experience, so if you can see it on a large screen, from the<br />blu-ray, that's the way to go.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>After watching The Fountain, I have to say that it's the ultimate love story. True, it's very complicated to understand, and you need to have to your smart brain switched on. Since I don't have one of those, I just watched it and really enjoyed the love story unfolding before my eyes. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz were absolutely amazing characters, and I have to say Rachel did a brilliant job, but more about that later.<br /><br />The reason why this film can come across as complicated, as it spans centuries! Get your head around this: in 16th century Europe, Hugh plays a Spanish explorer searching for Incan magic; in the present day he plays a doctor desperately searchng for a cure for his dying wife, and in the far off future, he plays a hairless (!) space traveller, seeking a way into the afterlife.<br /><br />Rachel's character appears in nearly all of the scenes with Hugh, in different periods of time. The present day character she plays, is dying, possibly from a brain tumour (?), and Rachel really manages to throw herself into it. An extremely brutal haircut/wig really helps her pull it off.<br /><br />Hugh is a bit of a strange character in this, particularly in the present day segments again, his wife his dying, yet he keeps throwing himself into his work, suffering deep inside. But then he reads her unfinished novel, called The Fountain. Only she tells him to complete it after she dies. In the future, he appears almost completely hairless, which really freaked me out to begin with. He really didn't suit being bald, whether it was a skull cap thing, or he did actually shave it all off.<br /><br />It's a very strange, but moving movie ultimately, and there's not much to say about it, except see it! You might not possibly understand it, I definitely needed the ending explained to me! But it does all work, just might need a second viewing. Oh, and don't watch it alone - I figured if I'd watched it alone, I probably would have cried from beginning to end! I was nearly crying at the chimps/apes. But it's an excellent movie, and needs to be part of your collection. Now.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Quite a telling image with Hugh Jackman resembling a cross between Timothy Leary and Buddha in the scenes of him as a 26th century explorer. The Fountain is Sci Fi meets epic romance and I'm really glad Hugh Jackman was in this role rather than the original actor cast for the part - Brad Pitt. Jackman is Tomas, Tommy, and Tom in 1500, 2000, and 2500 in a relentless search for a cure to save his love Isabella, Isabelle, Issy. The trio of characters all play into one another but are still distinct. Jackman is an international film star in his own right but his more private relationship with the papparazzi allows his thespian gifts to shine in a more opaque light. Jackman melts into the different personalities that are weaved together in The Fountain. We see his role not his celebrity life clouding a stellar performance. Being a trained actor skilled in singing and dancing makes Jackman a belivable cast of Tomas, Tommy, and Tom in a psychedelic twist of karma and fate across the centuries. He melts into the role with his muse Isabelle/Issy/Isabella whom he spends centuries trying to save. The timing of this film released at the height of Brangelina is poignat because had Brad Pitt stayed in the lead it may have been unbelievable to audiences of the character's mad devotion to stay with his wife. This is what makes the film work.<br /><br />Jackman emotes well and plays a Spanish conquistador, American medical doctor, and space age explorer all in one without seeming like the same character each time. Cris crossing between three different lifetimes over a millenium to save the woman he loves The Fountain plays on karma, reincarnation, and endless love and its quest to conquer death. The ending is odd because you don't know whether he succeeds or not and it heartbreaking since it isn't clear if the lovers unite. A well done film that blends distinct story lines into a captivating tale that concludes in a unique way. I'm impressed albeit confused. All that said, mark my words, one day movie trailers will promote Academy Award Winner Hugh Jackman in films he stars in. It's evident in The Fountain that, pretty soon, fellow Australian Russell Crowe won't just be sharing the land down under with Jackman, but also an Oscar trophy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I really wanted to love this movie. I really did. And it's far from terrible ... in fact, aesthetically, it's a gorgeous film, beautiful shot and art-directed, with a haunting musical score. Hugh Jackson and Rachel Weisz give great performances and have good chemistry. But something was just missing. I'm not even sure what, but it just didn't draw me in. I was hoping to be moved, provoked and inspired by this film, but I just wasn't. It certainly wasn't insincere, schlocky, or trite. It just didn't make the leap from interesting to resonant.<br /><br />I'd call this a bold, ambitious effort by a talented director who will surely produce more great films (like "Requiem for a Dream") in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This film a pretty original take on an old story line, the search for immortality, and the lengths that one will go for love.  This story weaves in Myan and Catholic beliefs into one giant tale of a man who's wife is dying from brain cancer, and his search for a cure.  She is also a writer, and is writing a tale of queen isabelle of spain's search for a "tree of life", much like De Soto's actual quest for a "fountain of youth".  The tric to the tale that the wife is writing is that her husband has to finish it.  Watch this film, set back, enjoy the effects, and see what comes in this quest for eternal love.  Worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The story behind Pi and Requiem For a Dream director Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain is almost as interesting as the film itself.  Originally conceived a few years back, with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the feature roles, along with a much larger budget than the end result, The Fountain was put on indefinite hiatus thanks to nearly every party involved backing out.  Shortly there after, Aronofsky adapted his story into a graphic novel for DC Comics' mature readers imprint Vertigo, and soon enough, the film would be resurrected to be what we have now.  And be glad it was.  The Fountain is, for lack of a better word, a triumph of modern film making.  Hugh Jackman stars as Tom in this metaphysical love story spanning a thousand years.  Beginning as a Spanish conquistador, continuing as a present day desperate doctor, and finally as an interstellar traveler, Tom tries again and again to cheat death and ensure an eternity with his dearly beloved Izzi (Rachel Weisz), only to lose her time and again as well.  Aronofsky's theme and look at the inevitability of death is powerful to say the least.  It's no secret that Aronofsky doesn't present the film in the most accessable manner, nor is that his intention.  This is not a film that one can just walk into and know what to expect: The Fountain is a slow moving and heart wrenching journey that isn't easy to take, but for those that do, they will find something that is truly special indeed.  Jackman gives the absolute best performance of his career, and that, as well as the amazing special effects (mostly done without CGI!) are worth the price of admission alone.  Simply put, The Fountain is a masterpiece of modern film making; but be forewarned, this is not a film for all tastes and audiences.  If you do check it out and are not sure what to make of it, give it a second viewing, and above all, give it a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In the 1500s, Queen Isabel (Weisz) of Spain sends a Conquistador (Jackman) to find the Fountain of Youth in New Spain.  In the 26th century, a man (Jackman) is on a trip through the stars with a tree.  In the present, Tommy Creo (Jackman), a drug developer, is trying to cure his wife Izzy (Weisz), who has an inoperable brain tumor.<br /><br />While this is a vague description, to tell more would be to give away too much.  All the story lines are related in some way, and director Darren Aronofsky does a good job bouncing back and forth between the three.  Jackman and Weisz are the emotional core of the movie, and both do very good jobs in their multiple roles.  At its heart, "The Fountain" is a love story, albeit not a love story for everyone.  It is worth a view if you are looking for something a little different.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>It took a second viewing for me to finally understand and completely fall under the magic spell The Fountain leaves on its audience.  Like most people, I was confused but this film possesses an aspect most cannot comprehend at first (which is why I recommend watching it once or twice again before throwing judgement)--instead of presenting a straightforward plot (beginning, middle, end), The Fountain uses an intellectual, but confusing story focused on two love-entwined people throughout time.  The acting is superb and extremely moving, and the blazing nebula finale is sure to be written down in the books for being one of the most beautiful film creations to date.  The music, composed by Clint Mansell, adds to the magic of The Fountain, especially at the end in which Tommy From The Future finally reaches the rebirthing nebula somewhere far in the galaxy and is reborn with his love Izzy, represented here in the form of a dying tree (I know, it sounds bogus but watch the movie!); this startlingly lovely scene, combined with the music, will bring anyone with a soul to tears.  Sure, The Fountain might not be the favorite for everyone, but as far as fantasy films go it definitely holds its ground.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>By the end of the movie you can pretty much figure out what is going on or be able to tell what the filmmaker is trying to convey to the audience, but until then the movie is just a jumbled mess with three storylines...and each story itself jumping around different time periods, with many scenes being played 3-4 times over again.  It's hard to tell what is real and what may be fiction and is very confusing, very boring....but is visually appealing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky has never made movies that were easy viewing. Examples? Just watch "Pi" and "Requiem For a Dream," and you'll see why this underrated director has made one of the most astounding sci-fi movies in ages.<br /><br />"The Fountain" is basically a sprawling tale that is half "real," half outside the mind -- love, immortality, death, grief and a tangled plotline that may take a few viewings to get right, but is exquisite in its simplicity. Not satisfied with depth, Aronofsky also makes it an absolutely stunning visual experience.<br /><br />Research oncologist Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cancer cure by animal testing, so he can save the life of his dying wife Izzie (Rachel Weisz), including an unsanctioned test from a mysterious tree. As she hopes for a cure, Izzie has been writing a book about a Spanish conquistador who is seeking the immortality-granting Tree of Life.<br /><br />As we see in other flashbacks, that conquistador is a version of Tommy (and Izzy as Queen Isabella). And far in the future, Tommy still struggles with his wife's loss, as he travels to a distant nebula to revive the tree. But as he finally gives in to his wife's last wish, he becomes enmeshed in a mysterious rebirth that stretches through the ages.<br /><br />"The Fountain" got a royal whupping from critics, and was even booed by test audiences, who presumably couldn't understand the three storylines -- or rather, one non-linear storyline, in which the lines between reality and imagination are blurred. Perhaps all of it is true, or perhaps Tommy's mind is creating the 1500 and 2500 scenarios to help him cope.<br /><br />As befits a movie that tackles so many deep themes, Aronofsky weaves mythology, creation beliefs, religion and the fear of death together, and binds it together with the universal theme -- love that even death can't overcome. The dialogue tends to be more spare than the story, rather than loading it down with unnecessary ponderings.<br /><br />And he does it beautifully and surreally. The whole movie is tinged in gold -- gold light, gold costumes, gold Tree of Life, gold nebula, gold deserts. The camerawork is filmed poetry: there are sweet moments like planting a seed in a grave, the Tree lit by the sun, and the sight of Tommy inside the nebula. The most exquisite moment comes when Tommy kneels before Izzy, under the Tree, with drops of golden light falling around them.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly Jackman's best movie, making us feel Tom's love and sorrow for Izzy ("There's no hope for us here. There is only death"), and the lifelong struggle against death. Your heart really breaks for him. Weisz is sweet and wilting as Izzy, and the chemistry between the two leads makes their time-busting love seem entirely reasonable.<br /><br />Aronofsky has made a story that is pure art, exquisite in theme, and while you might have to watch "Fountain" a few times to really "get it," but you won't regret the experience. Even if you don't like it, in an era of bland popcorn movies, its ambition is worth praising.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Beautiful film, but very bizarre.  Jackman and Weitz are fantastic as usual, but the story is very strange.  It oscilates between three different story lines that converge.  It's a tribute to the director and the talent that this works at all.  I had read that Brad Pitt had been slated to star it this film, but that he had to bow out because of the long pre production, though im sure Pitt would have done and interesting turn in this role, I really can't imagine anybody but Jackman making this metaphysical script work:  thanks Brad for following Angella all over Africa and letting the role fall by default to the singular Jackman.

Certainly, it's gorgeous to look at, and the past and present episodes were quite good, but the future segment totally escaped me. Clint Mansell's score won awards, but I thought the new-age sound was quite unexceptional and repetitive. The cast was fine, especially Rachel Weisz, and the brief but effective appearance of Ellen Burstyn. Hugh Jackman handled his very complicated roles admirably. I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. The DVD extras provide some insight that the production was plagued by shut-downs and delays. With budget cuts and other hang-ups, I'm sure the result isn't the film that Mr. Aronofsky set out to make.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky is a visual genius.  All of his movies are packed full of wonderfully-composed shots.  He is a true photographer/cinematographer, and most productions would be lucky to have him in that capacity.<br /><br />The problem, to me, is the story or lack thereof in which that great visual art is in service.  "Requiem for a Dream" was an afterschool special.  And "The Fountain" is simply a muddled, manipulative mess that will have you reaching for the fast-forward button.  "The Fountain" moves so slowly that it makes "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" seem like "Die Hard."  The story and plot are nonexistent, which allow you the viewer to project any plot onto it that you like.  If you're into that sort of thing, that's cool.  Hey, I decided to pretend that the whole movie was the post-death "moving toward the light" experience of that guy who died near that beginning - it's "Carnival of Souls," if you will, but with 10,000 times bigger of a budget and 1% of the entertainment.<br /><br />Many reviewers below contend that if you don't like this movie, you're stupid.  Au contraire - if you don't like this movie, you simply demand some level of coherent plot in your motion pictures.  If you're not a plot person, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Those viewers who loved "2001: A Space Odyssey" may enjoy "The Fountain."  Others may wish to avoid, or to rent it and watch with one finger over the fast-forward button and one over the eject button.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>2006. Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky. I'm not at all convinced by the film but I bow down in front of the originality of the screenplay. In a few years, we'll remember this film as a curiosity. Nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is one of those complex films that, if you want to, is very fun to see over and over and contemplate its meaning.  In this respect, it is very much akin to 2001, though focuses on the love that a couple shares across time and space.  The first time frame is colonial Spain, right smack in the worst excesses of the Reformation.  A brave aristocrat (Jackman) is sent on a mission by the beleaguered queen (Weisz), on a mission to find the tree of life that has been hidden by Mayan priests; this tree is said to offer eternal life in the mythologies of both peoples, but in different ways.  The second time is the present, when a research doctor is searching for a cure for the cancer that is killing his wife, a writer whose story covers that of the Spanish and the next one, the quest of a man flying to a dying star, in accordance with Mayan prophesy; he is transporting the tree, which is failing, and lives with the memory of his wife who is long since dead.<br /><br />From the film, it is impossible to tell what is real, what is imagined, and what it means.  The tree appears in all 3 sequences, as do the characters, who may or may not be the same individuals.  The themes - of love, loss, and hope - are present in all times, where the link of new life to death is apparent and mysterious.  During the entire film, I was able to forget my real life and wonder at the questions and ideas that the film offered, which is an extremely rare experience for me and marks the film as a great success.  The grief and struggle are very moving, the images of merging into light, of killing, of rebirth, are spectacular.<br /><br />According to the extras, this was toned down from the original, which was supposed to have Brad Pitt (one of the most over-rated actors, IMHO) rather than Jackman; Weisz replaced Cate Blanchett.  This version is completely successful, with a consistent mood, quality images, and excellent acting.<br /><br />Recommended for those who enjoy thinking about scifi, who delight at letting characters and concepts gain a place in their imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This movie was based on the ideas of immortality, afterlife and Zen<br /><br />(I'm not 100 percent sure of the last idea).

I highly recommend seeking out the entire review for anyone who enjoys insightful writing.<br /><br />"The Fountain" moves along at a snail's pace throughout, but it is also frequently mesmerizing and thought-provoking.  I saw this in the theater with a handful of moviegoers, and by the end, the credits rolling, absolutely no one moved to get up and leave.  We all sat transfixed in thought by what we had just seen.  While I don't think this film is genius, it is beautiful to look at and experience if you have the patience for poetic, non-linear storytelling.  The acting is solid, and the production value is pristine and often gorgeous to behold.

Just watch "Pi" and "Requiem For a Dream," and you'll see why this underrated director has made one of the most astounding sci-fi movies in ages.<br /><br />"The Fountain" is basically a sprawling tale that is half "real," half outside the mind -- love, immortality, death, grief and a tangled plotline that may take a few viewings to get right, but is exquisite in its simplicity. Not satisfied with depth, Aronofsky also makes it an absolutely stunning visual experience.<br /><br />Research oncologist Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cancer cure by animal testing, so he can save the life of his dying wife Izzie (Rachel Weisz), including an unsanctioned test from a mysterious tree. As she hopes for a cure, Izzie has been writing a book about a Spanish conquistador who is seeking the immortality-granting Tree of Life.<br /><br />As we see in other flashbacks, that conquistador is a version of Tommy (and Izzy as Queen Isabella). And far in the future, Tommy still struggles with his wife's loss, as he travels to a distant nebula to revive the tree. But as he finally gives in to his wife's last wish, he becomes enmeshed in a mysterious rebirth that stretches through the ages.<br /><br />"The Fountain" got a royal whupping from critics, and was even booed by test audiences, who presumably couldn't understand the three storylines -- or rather, one non-linear storyline, in which the lines between reality and imagination are blurred. Perhaps all of it is true, or perhaps Tommy's mind is creating the 1500 and 2500 scenarios to help him cope.<br /><br />As befits a movie that tackles so many deep themes, Aronofsky weaves mythology, creation beliefs, religion and the fear of death together, and binds it together with the universal theme -- love that even death can't overcome. The dialogue tends to be more spare than the story, rather than loading it down with unnecessary ponderings.<br /><br />And he does it beautifully and surreally. The whole movie is tinged in gold -- gold light, gold costumes, gold Tree of Life, gold nebula, gold deserts. The camerawork is filmed poetry: there are sweet moments like planting a seed in a grave, the Tree lit by the sun, and the sight of Tommy inside the nebula. The most exquisite moment comes when Tommy kneels before Izzy, under the Tree, with drops of golden light falling around them.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly Jackman's best movie, making us feel Tom's love and sorrow for Izzy ("There's no hope for us here. There is only death"), and the lifelong struggle against death. Your heart really breaks for him. Weisz is sweet and wilting as Izzy, and the chemistry between the two leads makes their time-busting love seem entirely reasonable.<br /><br />Aronofsky has made a story that is pure art, exquisite in theme, and while you might have to watch "Fountain" a few times to really "get it," but you won't regret the experience. Even if you don't like it, in an era of bland popcorn movies, its ambition is worth praising.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>I don't know what this movie was about. I doubt even the director got it! It seemed like they put it all in a pot and shook it up. The end being a movie called the fountain. Don't waste time or money!</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>[Noticing the substantive, thoughtful, even passionate responses that this film has elicited from many reviewers, I retract any elements of my own review that may sound dismissive, patronizing, presumptuous.  Obviously, numerous viewers find the film provocative, innovative, mysterious, profound and deeply moving in terms substance and form, meaning and creative use of the medium.  Any film these days that's able at once to challenge, enthrall, and motivate viewers to become alert and "active" spectators deserves no small amount of commendation--and most likely another look (at the very least) from this reviewer.  I would take issue with the notion that the film is sentimental or pretentious--or that either of those words is necessarily pejorative (Griffith was certainly pretentious but no less of a giant; "It's a Wonderful Life" is as sentimental as it is dark, but not even the anti-sentimental '60s and '70s could suppress Capra's neglected but vibrantly alive American "basic text" for long.  Still, as informative and healthy as informed discussion can be, we will never (thank god) escape the fact that many of the medium's greatest accomplishments will not get their just due, and that one viewer's "Citizen Kane" will be another's "Star Wars: The Latest Sequel."]<br /><br /> D.W. Griffith needed six hours ("Intolerance," original release) to tell four simultaneous, closely interlocked stories separated in time by 2500 years.  The result was one of film's noblest failures.  Chris Marker, on the other hand, required less than 30 minutes ("La Jetee")  to tell an unforgettable story about humankind's fear of death, desire for love, and the ensuing but inescapable struggle with the past, the present, and the future to conquer death and aloneness.<br /><br />At about 90 minutes, "The Fountain" succeeds in fascinating us with its surrealist, psychedelic imagery, and if it fails to convince some that it has something significant to say or its meaning as clear as some would like, it's not for lack of trying.  In fact, everything about this film all but shrieks at the viewer "important allegory," "vital parable," "deep, profound, thought-provoking cinema."  Doesn't matter if it's a flower bud, a finger, a ring (the latter are certainly overworked symbols, especially after Dante and Wagner rung from rings just about all the meaning they're capable of yielding, though admittedly that didn't discourage Joseph Campbell, whose monomythic circle representing the hero's journey has become the frequent formula of no small number of the screenplays we see these days)--it's all deeply, profoundly, evocatively significant.  And lest we have the least doubt, the score bleats at us non-stop with throbbing strings italicized by spiritual soprano choirs--somber minor key modalities and thick textures relieved occasionally by new-age piano light rays. In fact, it's the kind of score that, unlike the reactionary constructions of a John Williams', takes us further away from the exemplary work of a Bernard Herrmann or Hugo Friedhofer.<br /><br />Of the three stories, only the one in the present--of the doctor desperately seeking a cure for his beloved's illness (cancer, but in the terms of the story, death is the "illness")--has any humanity, any semblance of "life" (though even here, the acting seems at times a bit stiff and "operatic," a hostage to the symbolism of the story, orchestrated by the camera and effects.)  The other two stories are narrative "frames," occasionally shedding some illumination on what is one of the darkest films (literally) I've ever seen (including hundreds of film noir examples along with most of Bergman).  Despite the inevitable pretense of the genre, there are the best of intentions, one suspects, behind the film, and young viewers who are taken in by it sufficiently to watch it again and work out its symbolism are undeniably apt to be rewarded, especially compared to the viewers of a "Titanic," "Forrest Gump," or any number of more childish (not merely sophomoric) "fantasy genre" movies (again, not a negative so much as a mere observation--certainly the inclusion of Clarence is sufficient to qualify Capra's seasonal classic as "fantasy" genre).<br /><br />Moreover, visual-architectural enthusiasts will have much to admire in the match cutting (from faces to symmetrical and luminescent correlatives, both man-made and natural, and the camera angles (those overhead aerial shots!), which often play more like music than the music does.  But were I a fan of a more hard-core, cleverly-engineered and artfully designed fantasy (I won't belabor a definition here--though Dante's Comedia and Wagner's Ring, despite sharing similarities with the genre, are as much its antithesis as is, say, "Tokyo Story."), I'd be more inclined to study the script and mis en scene (which even a movie like "Donnie Darko" can repay with insights not sighted after a mere two screenings).  Time is precious, and I'm grateful the filmmakers of "The Fountain" elected not to overextend their welcome.  Nonetheless, two hours of "There Will Be Blood" strikes me as a movie more worthy of close study than "The Fountain" if only because, as Dr. Johnson required of dramatic art and found so readily present in Shakespeare's, it "holds the mirror up to nature" (film's verisimilitudinous strong suit) so that we can see it, as if for the first time.<br /><br />A quick interpretation, maybe more Mishima than Buddhist: You can't "have" the Tree of Life because you ARE the tree.  To have it, to obtain it, to acquire or possess it, is to "objectify" it--in other words, to rob it of life.  Only the subject is alive: the object necessarily dead.  Once we recognize our relationship to the tree of life, we are eternally alive, immune from mundane materialistic understandings of death. There is no taking away from us what we never actually  "had" because the tree is what we "are."  Coming into "possession" of this understanding, or state of blessed "nothingness," requires undergoing the quest of the conquistador, doctor, scientist, lover in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>New Age fairy tale, `The Fountain,' taps into our most primitive regions by transcending space and time to seek the antidote to man's mighty enemy--Death.  Drawing upon a hodgepodge of religious imagery, the movie intersects four time frames, including ancient times and the biblical Tree of Life; the trappings of Medeival Spain when ascetical practices were sometimes severe, and the Inquisition made "heresy" contraband; today, and the future when mankind potentially can reap the benefits of science and meditation.  In the middle times, the conquistador seeks the cure to death with a pilgrimage to Mayan civilization where the pyramid of life can be found and brought back to his queen.  In today's time, that same conquistador is scientist, Tommy (Hugh Jackman), seeking a cure for his terminally ill wife, Izzi (Rachel Weisz), through an experimental rhesus monkey.  The future looks good if only the past times can be linked together in one healing swoop. A plethora of myths connect the story and time differential. The book 'The Fountain' and an eaten lotus make portals to each place and time.<br /><br />Philosophically, there are no enemies in the movie but death.  In medieval times, Franciscan friar, Fr. Avila, lives in a time where he states, "Bodies are prisons for our souls."  In today's time, Tommy says "Death is a disease, and there's a cure, and I will find it."  Nice stuff.  Who can argue with the idea that death robs us of loved ones, ruins our plans, and creates muddying mystery beyond our imagination?  The movie tries to construct archetypes that pull for our desire to have everlasting life on earth.  Meaningful, the movie is great escapist fare that is cathartic--even if it has to take itself seriously enough to work.<br /><br />`The Fountain' demonstrates effectiveness in ways that Shymalan`s `Lady in the Water` failed to accomplish.  Each scene is shot with easily pleasing panoramic views, and Darren Aronofsky's direction gives the film an essential urgency.  Handled with good, performances by Jackman and Weisz, and an excellent performance by Ellen Burstyn as Tommy's lab supervisor, 'The Fountain' takes the edge off what could have been a disasterous fairy tale gone too fluffy and soft in the head.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>I have no doubt that this film had good intentions with the message it presents- but nonetheless by the the middle of the film I had already lost interest. And no it's not because this wasn't a two hour packed action film- that has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />It for the most part at least for me had to do with Jackman and Weisz's relationship together in the film- their relationship was so bland because I definitely didn't feel any chemistry between them at all which can badly hurt any movie. Not to mention Weisz's character, although supposed to be so inspitational, I instead found very annoying. The rest of the cast refused to make any memorable impression on me as well.<br /><br />The story itself though fell flat long before it ended. Instead of building up to some amazing conclusion it instead left me amused and definitely not impressed.<br /><br />I give it one other star because of its very beautiful scenes and again it's good intentions. That's about all I can say positive of this film. And while a bunch of people will highly recommend it- I will not.<br /><br />2/5</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>when i saw the preview to this movie i thought it would be excellent, but i was wrong it was boring and on top of that it was confussing for me.

The movie is a collage of scenes of an artsy film. There are a lot of repeated scenes apparently in an attempt to keep the audience on track of the story and in which direction the flick is moving. Needless to say, that the trailer seemed to promise something different and therefore my expectations weren't met at all.<br /><br />The acting was very good and that's why I give this film 3 stars, because otherwise it would be less than that. I don't think Aronofsky as a director did a very good job of telling the story - it's a lot of going back and forth with some boring scenes, ... confusing with New Age junk mixed into it. In a sense it's like an unfinished cinematic painting, and the soundtrack is kind of annoying after a while. And whenever a scene reaches a climax and there's an expectation for a surprise, nothing happens and it's a letdown. To me it was like an experimental film or a project as the final exam of a student to graduate from film school. There are lots of closeups - too many if you ask me.<br /><br />If you do want to see this film in the theatre, you must hurry, because I don't think this film will survive more than a week on the big screen - the theatre I went to was almost empty while the other flicks there were filled to capacity.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Either "The Fountain" is one of the most nonsensical films ever made, or I'm simply too dense a person to have understood it. I honestly don't know how to feel about it anymore; I saw this film with my mother, and when we left the theater, I saw she had tears in her eyes. "This is a beautiful film," she said quietly, wiping at her cheeks with a shriveled tissue. I was completely at a loss for words. How is this film beautiful, other than because of some moments of impressive digital effects? To say this story is cryptic would be a colossal understatement, and I just can't understand why it had to be so alternative that it alienated any sense of reason. This has to be the most aimless movie I've ever seen, going passive-aggressively from scene to scene with virtually nothing holding its individual moments together, save for a couple of weak narrative links.<br /><br />Now, you may be asking yourself, "What is this film about?" Well, that's the catch: I have absolutely no idea what this film is about, and I can't even begin to describe a cohesive plotline. The best I can offer are vague snippets of information, ones that make sense in and of themselves but have no structure when put together in the same movie. The most prominently featured motif is the idea of birth, death, and rebirth, physically represented at times by a mythical tree of life, at others by Rachel Weisz as both Queen Isabella of Spain and a modern-day cancer patient. What any one image has to do with the other is anyone's guess; there are three individual narratives in the film, each separated by several hundred years, each randomly weaving in and out of each other. They had little if any connection, other than the notion that one could live forever if he or she looks in the right place.<br /><br />One narrative takes place in the 1500s during the Spanish Inquisition. Hugh Jackman enters the film during this segment as a devoted conquistador willing to sacrifice himself for the salvation of Spain; apparently, a power-hungry inquisitor (Stephen McHattie) is slowly taking the country over, and he's about ready to attack the queen in a final display of torture. But according to the unrealistically calm queen, there is hope for their beloved country. As stated in Mayan legend, a miraculous tree resides deep within the jungles of New Spain (modern day Central America). Anyone who drinks of its sap will live forever. With such reliable information, the conquistador is sent to this land with a monk in order to find the tree. Exactly how going about this task would in any way, shape, or form help an oppressed country is beyond me. It would have been nice if some kind of an explanation were given, even if it was an unrealistic one.<br /><br />Another segment takes place in the present day. Jackman now plays Tommy, a doctor obsessed with finding a cure for cancer. His current patient is an ape named Donovan, who unfortunately has a brain tumor. When Tommy sees that Donovan is slipping further and further away from life, he decides to take drastic measures. With a quick rummage through an assortment of files, he finds what he's looking for: an organic material taken from a special tree found in Central America. Maybe an injection of this stuff will help the poor little simian recover. And sure enough, it does; his vital signs improve beyond anyone's expectations, and his head scar heals much more quickly than normal. Unfortunately, the tumor itself remains unscathed. This is incredibly distressing for Tommy; the whole point of doing this medical research is to help his wife, Izzi (Weisz), who's brain cancer is progressing to the point of diminishing her tactile sensitivity.<br /><br />This segment description may make it seem as if it's the most structured one of the film, but the reality is that it's just as out of place as the previous one. Consider the loss of Tommy's wedding ring; we see this object continually reappear throughout the film, originating as a charm on Queen Isabella's necklace. It must have been some kind of symbol, possibly the classic symbol of unity and commitment. But then why did it have to be lost in the first place? It only added another layer of drama to a story that was already overflowing. And then there's Izzi's book, which documents the life and death beliefs of the ancient Mayans. All but the last chapter is finished, and it's her wish that Tommy finish the book. He continually says that he can't, that he doesn't know the end, and that he doesn't know how to reach the end. Finally, one of the characters expresses what I've been feeling throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />The third segment is probably the most baffling one. It presumably takes place in the distant future, a time when people float through space in giant bubbles. This is the way we find a now bald and barefoot Hugh Jackman, trapped inside his own snow globe with a hair-covered tree. The unabashed strangeness of this segment can only be indicative of a spiritual mind excursion, so much so that any form of explanation would be pointless. Apparently, this bubble is heading for a nebula, one that surrounds a dying star. This dying star, according to Mayan legend, is the place where the life/death exchange takes place. Interestingly enough, Izzi had already identified this nebula during the present day segment by viewing it through her telescope. It also served as the basis for her book.<br /><br />As this futuristic Tommy floats through space, he hears voices, has fleeting hallucinations of both Izzi and Queen Isabella, and periodically cuts off a piece of the tree's hairy bark to chew on. He even tattoos himself with a fountain pen (which started in the present day segment after Tommy lost the ring). Like many other aspects of this movie, I can't explain the significance of any of it. That's probably why I disliked this movie; it's a visually stunning work, but the story is so convoluted and so mysterious that it prevents the viewer from understanding anything about it. I don't mind when a film relies heavily on visual material, but it should at least be part of a story that's actually about something.<br /><br />But even as I say this, I think back to my mother, who found the story so touching and meaningful that she was reduced to tears. I don't deny the possibility that I completely missed the point of this film, that I'm too mainstream a viewer to be entertained by this kind of narrative. Nonetheless, I can't recommend "The Fountain"; I see it as nothing but a gigantic mess, so loaded with abstract ideas that don't add up to anything comprehensible. If any of you reading this still intend to see it, I, of course, have no way of stopping you. Maybe it's just as well; you just might manage to get more out of it than I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>And he commanded him, saying:  Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:<br />But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat.  For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.<br /> -  _Genesis_ 2:16 - 7.<br /><br />_The Fountain_ (2006) is a movie directed by Darren Aronofsky which combines themes from various religions and science fiction concerning the fact of mortality.  Unfortunately, the movie combines these themes into nothing more than a syncretic neo-Gnostic porridge and thus fails to achieve any sort of redeeming message.  The film has three strands of development which make it difficult to follow, tracing the activities of a scientist as he attempts to discover a cure for his cancer-striken wife.  While the movie features themes from Roman Catholicism, the religion of the ancient Mayas, and Buddhism, it should be noted that the underlying message is ultimately Gnostic in origin - featuring the age old conflict at root in the Garden of Eden and behind mankind's Faustian quest for knowledge.  The film shows a Catholic inquisitor opposing the quest for immortality and makes the case that such figures are reactionary.  (We can see such conflict between moralists and those who support the diaboleries of the scientifically managed state today.)However, the film fails to note the contrast between earthly life and the promised life in the world to come.  The film also fails to appreciate the true meaning of the Fall from Grace in the Christian faith.  As such, the movie enters into the realms of the heretical Gnostics who sought to create God's Kingdom here on earth.  Christian philosophers have long warned against such attempts to "immanentize the eschaton" as Eric Voegelin put it and have repeatedly noted how such attempts have led to the various totalitarian political religions of our age.  (Such attempts are also at root behind the utopian urges that have given rise to the scientifically managed state.)  In his quest to achieve immortality for his wife, the scientist/conquistadore turns his back on the traditional Christian understanding of the human soul.  As such, this movie can only be seen for what it is, as a profoundly anti-Catholic film.  It should also be added that the blending of religious traditions makes for a disconcerting effect, with no clear-cut boundaries between each such tradition.  In this respect, the film reduces all such traditions to ultimate meaninglessness and thus fails to achieve anything ultimately lasting or worthwhile.  This of course is to be expected however given the fact that Aronofsky is an admitted atheist.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This movie deserves 0 stars because for the first 45min, nothing happens. After that, I fell asleep. Then I woke up and some really weird stuff was going on. This movie was so stupid and boring. It couldn't have ended soon enough.

Beyond horrible.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>There is something going on here. If I were to say that I knew what everything in "The Fountain" is supposed to mean, I'd probably be a liar. That said, I feel that I got the general idea. Many people have compared this film's esoteric, pseudo-intellectual appeal to something like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I think this is a wrong claim to make. There are many moments in the Fountain in which the story is too desperately being explained to us. Rachel Weisz is an amazing actress but half her lines in the movie feel like she's just spoon-feeding us important information. It took the joy away from a movie that should (though mostly does) communicate on an emotional level more than anything else. Even if you don't really know why, The Fountain has the ability to provoke some powerful emotions. Unfortunately, it does not do much else.<br /><br />The plot is in three parts: the first of which chronicling Hugh Jackman's 16th century conquistador Tomas' journey into the heart of the Mayan empire to locate the mythical Tree Of Life and reward himself and Queen Isabella with eternal life so as to escape from a dying Spain, the second is set in the 21st century and sees Tommy as a scientist trying to cure his wife of her cancer and, with help from a strange South American tree, stumbling across a potential cure to ageing. Ageing, but not death. The third plot sees a futuristic Tom escorting a dying Tree Of Life (who would have thought that the Tree could die?) into the heart of a dying nebula where both the tree plans to be reborn. The relationship between the plots is blurred and certainly open to interpretation. There is however certain constants throughout each act as it were. Not counting the obvious themes of life, death and love, there are repeated elements of tragedy and noticeable splashes of shared dialogue, imagery and color (especially gold) throughout each different time period. The romance between Tommy and Izzy, particularly in the 21st century time period, is an heart-breaking portrayal of love and loss.<br /><br /> If you were to remove the entire concept of past and future from the movie, you'd have a story of a man with a love so intense for the woman he lost; he would never, ever recover. Since we do get the other, more wondrous aspects to it, The Fountain becomes a more memorable, unique film, and has a beautiful sense of hope to it. It is a very one-sided love story though. It is mainly about Hugh Jackman's character's experiences. Aronosky's wife, the lovely Weisz, has to play a character that is never fully realized, and is degraded to an object of affection and goal for the main character, and someone who lays down all the important information to get the plot rolling.<br /><br />The film is very much a heavy film if you were for its message and visual experience. It isn't a clear cut adventure film, but one which forces viewers to think. I found out that Brad and Cate was suppose to star in this film but apparently went off to do the equally over-ambitious but infinitely superior "Babel."  Based around the Biblical Tree of Life described in Genesis, I think it is one of the most original pieces of artistry I have seen in quite sometime, but in the other hand is not as clever or deep as it thinks it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Aronofsky is NOT the Kubrick of his generation. Repeat: Darren Aronofsky is not the Kubrick of his generation. There is one Kubrick and no director working today is as talented as him and nor do any film directors work the way he did. Maybe a problem is that there is too much wanting to copy the master going on with some of these younger guys? (I read an interesting article in EW awhile back that went into that topic.) But anyway, look, this film is bold, highly original and credit is to be given to the director for having guts. But IMHO it just doesn't work. As for the look of the film, it felt....I don't know how to put it--I want to say "stuffy" and plastic. It felt like I was in a Christmas store in the mall or something. In anycase the effects didn't take my breath away. What the movie is about is obviously death and fear of death and how life is here, now. OK, message received. And I guess we're supposed to try to come to terms with the three Hugh Jackman/Rachel Weisz stories or at least be interested in how they relate and what it all means.

I for one loved the experience; it took my mind to places very very few movies have or can, and that in itself makes it a must for those who love to watch their own mind at work, as well as that of an increasingly masterful filmmaker.<br /><br />Clearly Aronofsky is in both categories, and what a mind his is to watch. His grasp of symmetry, both visually and conceptually, peaks in this film. Pi is farther out but The Fountain is deeper, the work of a much more emotionally mature man than Pi or Requiem, and miles afield from his recent breakthrough The Wrestler. I'm betting this guy has a film or two in him that will stun the world into submission, at which point his oeuvre will be reexamined and gasps of awe will issue forth over this little gem.<br /><br />Orrr, maybe not. It is indeed amazing that this was followed by The Wrestler, as two more disparate films are hard to imagine. I for one think this is a much finer film; maybe if Mickey Rourke had made his comeback in The Fountain it would be the one with all the acclaim.<br /><br />In any case, this is a truly unique and gorgeous movie, with many shots of breathtaking beauty and classical symmetry. DA sure can frame a scene, and I didn't notice the camera itself once during the flick, a rare event, expecially for a movie as concerned with cinematic perfection as this. The plot lines, such as they are, are also driving towards the cores of human existence: dealing with death, wishing for ever more time with those we love, and luxuriating in the moment before it and we are whisked away into the void.<br /><br />Speaking of which, there is a perfectly luscious visual moment with the tree of life and the stars and Jackman (who gives a very strong performance, as usual) during which the missus and I were sitting on the sofa, engrossed in the spectacle (this movie makes blu-ray and a nice big flat screen make perfect sense), when our dog suddenly started having a dream on the floor behind us. You know how they quiver and yip and move their paws like they're chasing God's own squirrel through the celestial meadows in Dog Heaven? I love the sound she makes when she's dreaming, and as I sat beside my human sweetie, holding her hand, eyes on the sumptuous montage of realities onscreen depicting and ears on our pooch off in her own little dream world--a place I often wonder about but will never see in this lifetime--I realized very clearly that I was in the midst of my own perfect little synchronistic moment in space and time and soaked in it with a smile, feeling the love and ease as deeply as I could and knowing that one day this moment will be like manna that I can enjoy at will.<br /><br />Any movie that can help raise one's consciousness of self-awareness like that while simultaneously creating a field of knowledge which demands your surrender (plot junkies take note) must perforce be something special. Thanks and praises to Darren Aronofsky for even trying to make movies devoid of profit motive, let alone getting them made with this much love and precision. If Leonardo Da Vinci and Terence McKenna ever meet upstairs, The Fountain will be playing at the local art house rep theatre, on a huge screen lush with golds and greens, surrounded in all directions by inky blackness. I hope I can be their usher.<br /><br />PS As an added bonus, this movie points out that living forever might not be the cup of tea one likes to imagine.<br />Embrace the entropy; it's beautiful too...perhaps even perfect.<br /><br />And besides, maybe this is all just a dream our dog is having.</p></br><a href="../users/AOPQ0KA1B7BFD.html">AOPQ0KA1B7BFD</a><br/><p>The plot is much simpler than anything I've read in the reviews.  A woman is dying of cancer so she writes a book about death being the necessary step to a new birth.  She wants the love of her life, her scientist husband, to understand what she has learned while researching history and the cultural and religious perspectives of life, death, and the journey beyond.  To ensure he reaches her goal for him, she gives him the manuscript and a task, a task he is reminded about constantly throughout the film.  Her perspective was the past.  His perspective is the future and a completely different cultural, religious frame of reference.  Does he complete the task?  Watch the movie and the answer is obvious.<br /><br />The magic in the movie is the way the story of her book and his attempt to complete the task is interwoven into the reality of their life.  It's not so mysterious; it is beautifully expressed and it will touch all those who know the power of two loves evolving over time into an inseparable oneness.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>A movie that grew on me while I slept `The Fountain' may actually be one of the best films of this past year.  It's smart, entertaining, thought provoking and elegantly paced with enough frustration, grief and sympathy to grab hold of the audience and their emotions and exploit them to the full.  If you are willing to give yourself over to `The Fountain' then you will find one of the more fulfilling movie going experiences in years, but your enjoyment will hinge fully on your willing participation.  If you easily off put by the strange side of science fiction and don't like movies that refuse to answer themselves then this may not be the movie for you, but if you readily become absorbed in cinema and relish in films that leave themselves ambiguous and up to personal interpretation, demanding the viewer think and rethink the plot hours after the credits have rolled searching for some kind of solace then this is definitely a film for you.<br /><br />At heart `The Fountain' is a story about love and the lengths one will go to maintain and preserve that deep rooted feeling of love.  While `The Fountain' may consist of three interlocking stories the main solitary focus is that of prolonged love.  Tomas, played brilliantly by Hugh Jackman, is a neurosurgeon whose wife Izzi, played effortlessly by Rachel Weisz, is dying of a tumorous disease.  Izzi is free spirited and strong in her position and tries her hardest to shield her husband from her worsening condition to spare him any added grief, but Tomas still struggles to find a cure for her condition even if it means pushing all other away from him.  This is the foundation for `The Fountain' and while our two main characters alternate between present time, 16th Century Spain and years into the future it all keeps coming back to the present life changing events that prove a catalyst for everything before and after.<br /><br />The film is deep and moving and its mood and atmosphere are added to by the impressive cast.  Jackman gives the performance of his career here, delving into three sets of emotions and unlocking three characters with enough subtlety that it appears like a natural progression.  Weisz may have won the Oscar for her previous years work but here is where she proved to me she was worth that little golden man.  Her performance is so natural and effortlessly breezy that you can't help but be drawn into those deep pools she calls eyes.  The bathtub scene is especially effective for both these actors' cases and brought tears to both my wife and I.  The supporting cast is strong despite their lack of screen time, the legendary Ellen Burstyn standing out among the crowd, but its director Darren Aronofsky who truly commands and conquers here.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Aronofsky since his brilliant work in `Requiem for a Dream' and was equally impressed by his vision in `The Fountain'.  He's a uniquely driven director who truly puts his heart and soul into his work, giving it a special touch of devotion that helps settle the experience upon the audience.  He's invested in his work and you can tell he believes in it.  Aronofsky directs his cast with such dedication and fervor and it shows and it pays off delivering a one of a kind experience.  So, this may not be a film for everyone, but if this film is for you then it will move you, embrace you and attach itself to you for the long haul.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky has never made movies that were easy viewing. Examples? Just watch "Pi" and "Requiem For a Dream," and you'll see why this underrated director has made one of the most astounding sci-fi movies in ages.<br /><br />"The Fountain" is basically a sprawling tale that is half "real," half outside the mind -- love, immortality, death, grief and a tangled plotline that may take a few viewings to get right, but is exquisite in its simplicity. Not satisfied with depth, Aronofsky also makes it an absolutely stunning visual experience.<br /><br />Research oncologist Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cancer cure by animal testing, so he can save the life of his dying wife Izzie (Rachel Weisz), including an unsanctioned test from a mysterious tree. As she hopes for a cure, Izzie has been writing a book about a Spanish conquistador who is seeking the immortality-granting Tree of Life.<br /><br />As we see in other flashbacks, that conquistador is a version of Tommy (and Izzy as Queen Isabella). And far in the future, Tommy still struggles with his wife's loss, as he travels to a distant nebula to revive the tree. But as he finally gives in to his wife's last wish, he becomes enmeshed in a mysterious rebirth that stretches through the ages.<br /><br />"The Fountain" got a royal whupping from critics, and was even booed by test audiences, who presumably couldn't understand the three storylines -- or rather, one non-linear storyline, in which the lines between reality and imagination are blurred. Perhaps all of it is true, or perhaps Tommy's mind is creating the 1500 and 2500 scenarios to help him cope.<br /><br />As befits a movie that tackles so many deep themes, Aronofsky weaves mythology, creation beliefs, religion and the fear of death together, and binds it together with the universal theme -- love that even death can't overcome. The dialogue tends to be more spare than the story, rather than loading it down with unnecessary ponderings.<br /><br />And he does it beautifully and surreally. The whole movie is tinged in gold -- gold light, gold costumes, gold Tree of Life, gold nebula, gold deserts. The camerawork is filmed poetry: there are sweet moments like planting a seed in a grave, the Tree lit by the sun, and the sight of Tommy inside the nebula. The most exquisite moment comes when Tommy kneels before Izzy, under the Tree, with drops of golden light falling around them.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly Jackman's best movie, making us feel Tom's love and sorrow for Izzy ("There's no hope for us here. There is only death"), and the lifelong struggle against death. Your heart really breaks for him. Weisz is sweet and wilting as Izzy, and the chemistry between the two leads makes their time-busting love seem entirely reasonable.<br /><br />Aronofsky has made a story that is pure art, exquisite in theme, and while you might have to watch "Fountain" a few times to really "get it," but you won't regret the experience. Even if you don't like it, in an era of bland popcorn movies, its ambition is worth praising.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Okay all of you sci-fi geeks out there. It's time to drag your spouse, girlfriend, or significant other out again. They'll hem and haw about going to see "yet another" science fiction film with you, but this time redemption is at your feet.<br /><br />THE FOUNTAIN is, for all intents and purposes, a love story built around an SF theme: immortality and the future. But there aren't any magical conjurers or any time machines. The story is all too human, spanning eons as we witness the immortality of ...love. It may sound a bit offish to some SF fans, but don't let it be. There are still amazing scenes shot using bizarre methods (micro-photography of petrie dishes?) instead of the usual CGI, a remarkable coherency between the vast time scales, and some damn fine acting.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman (X-Men) stars as Tomas, a man in love with his queen (during the Spanish Inquisition), his terminally ill wife (present day), and the symbol of his wife's immortality (in the distant future). Tomas' queen/wife/symbol is none other than the amazing Rachel Weisz (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) known throughout the film as Izzi. Tomas, in the earliest time of the Spanish Inquisition, is trying to save his beloved queen by finding the tree of life (something hinted at in many religions, including Christianity where Adam and Eve eat from the tree of knowledge causing God to yank away the tree of life and hide it).<br /><br />We then jump to present day and find Doctor Tomas desperately searching for a cancer cure in order to save his wife, Izzi. Again, the tree of life plays a part as he and his research team uncover a strange piece of bark from a long forgotten tree. It's healing properties are astounding, but will the cure come in time to save Izzi?<br /><br />The most distant time is that of Tomas on an existential journey through space with a tree as his only companion. Again, the tree of life, but this time the tree is appropriately a symbol of his wife.<br /><br />Weaving the conquistador past, with present day medicine, and an uncertain future, director Darren Aronofsky has really given us a piece of poetry as art. This isn't too surprising coming from Aronofsky, the same director of such mind-benders as PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Don't expect a formulaic plot or for things to be spelled out. You know better than that if you've seen any of this director's work. But that's part of the big draw. You move along with the story rather than being forcibly dragged through it. It flows on its own ethereal plain, never stopping, never letting the viewers' eyes rest. Each scene is shot to near perfection, using dark sets, lighted doorways, and golden globes to exquisite advantage.<br /><br />But it's the love story between Izzi and Tomas that holds the entire movie together. Their dedication to one another is palpable, and when Izzi sits near death's doorstep, you can feel Tomas' overwhelming need to save her, his beloved for all time.<br /><br />So it's time to haul your spouse/girlfriend/significant other kicking and screaming into the theater again. And they'll love you for it later. Perhaps you might even "get lucky" after the film...</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>What I liked most about this film is its intense spirituality, fantastic cinematography,  moving soundtrack and the Tree of Life mythology, which is historically accurate!<br /><br />The film is essentially divided into two stories, one happening in the real world, and the other coming to life though the imagination of the author. I enjoyed the story within a story approach! I also like brave movies, which are surrealistic and leave much to the imagination, like 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br /><br />The cinematography is rich and inventive. I think Salvadore Dali would have greatly enjoyed this film!<br /><br />Oh, and the music still pulsates through my soul! It reaches deep, and I'm adding the soundtrack to my collection. The music is so magnificent, I feel it's the best part of the entire movie! It deserves an Oscar nomination!<br /><br />I was also deeply moved by the Tree of  Life theme that runs through the entire movie. It so enchanted me that I did some research. Not only is The Tree of Life a part of the rich mythology from the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is also a significant aspect of the ancient Mayan culture! I find that absolutely fascinating, so much so, that I purchased an obscure video documentary, (Tree Of Life, Directed by Bruce Lane), through Amazon.com!<br /><br />While it would be very easy to criticize this unique film for it's various shortcomings, I much rather concentrate on its many strengths. This is one of the few movies I have seen this year that actually was exciting, and I want to encourage filmmakers to continue being brave and taking chances! That's what art is all about!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky has never made movies that were easy viewing. Examples?

(although a solid minority of critics went for it too).<br /><br />Just as experimental as 'Requiem' and 'Pi', but with a more complex,<br />humanistic, metaphysical message, here all Aronofsky's visual pyrotechnics<br />(and the film does look amazing) feel like a means to an end not an end in<br />themselves.<br /><br />A love story that takes place in 3 time frames (the 1500s as a<br />conquistador hunts for the source of life, the 'fountain of youth', the<br />present where the same man, now a scientist tries to find a cure for<br />cancer before his beloved wife dies and 500 years in the future, where<br />the same man again is with his love, who is now a tree, still looking<br />for eternal life.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weitz are terrific, and I the score is creative and<br />effective. Ultimately a very moving look at the nature of life and<br />death. Yes there are a few pretentious moments, but I'll take slightly<br />flawed grand ambitions to explore something in a new way - ala '2001'<br />over the same old, same old every time.<br /><br />(possible spoilers ahead)<br /><br />The fact that the past and future segments are part of a fairy tale<br />book started by the dying woman and finished by the scientist seemed<br />very obvious to me, but seemed to leave a shocking number of critics<br />scratching their heads,confused as to which story is 'real'. I can see why,<br />if you miss that, the film could seem confusing and arbitrary, but<br />it's laid out pretty clearly along the way,</p></br></body></html>

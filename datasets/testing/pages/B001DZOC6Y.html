I've watched a lot of M. Night Shyamalan films like The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, and Lady in the Water and enjoyed them all, and I liked this movie.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: It begins in Central Park in New York, whenever a strange wind blows people stop like their frozen in time and then kill themselves. Jumping off buildings, shooting themselves, stabbing themselves, the works. Then it begins moving to small towns, roads, and eventually to even the most deserted places across the eastern states. This phenomenon is caused by plants that give off a strange chemical which causes people to harm themselves in some way because the plants are angry and wanting to get back at humans. It's mostly centered around a group of survivors from New Jersey; a man and his wife, and a little girl are the main characters who try to survive this occurrence. The story may be flawed, but it does a decent job of putting itself together, and it's definitely M. Night Shyamalan because of how bizarre the film is.<br />MUSIC: The music is great and really nows how to fit the atmosphere and mood of this movie.<br />DISTURBING FACTOR: Most of the ways people get killed in this movie are things I've already seen, but some scenes flatout shocked me like the part where the two boys get killed in the movie unexpectedly. Some of the deaths are shocking in this movie, but it's not very disturbing overall.<br />ACTING: The acting is generally good, though I did notice some sequences of cheesy acting. The dialogue is nicely assembled at least and adds to the film's creepy value.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: I don't know about you, but I found this movie to be rather entertaining and interesting. It mostly depends on how willing are you to take chances with a film that got bad reviews from critics? The acting in this movie is good, the dialogue is good, the creepy factor is good, and the music is great. A highly entertaining and underrated film.<br />OVERALL: Approach with caution, rent before buy. This film is not for everyone and there is a deep divide between people who think it's good and people who think it sucks. Be warned.<br />THE GOOD: Good acting, great music, good creepy factor, good dialogue, interesting premise for a story.<br />THE BAD: Story is flawed and sometimes stupid, some acting sequences were cheesy, and the film is sometimes too weird for its own good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>The sudden appearance of a never-before encountered disorder in the Northeastern United States - which moves swiftly through its stages to its final phase of causing the seemingly oblivious infected to take their own lives - launches The Happening.  The apocalypse has apparantly arrived in a most unexpected fashion, and it's jolting and eerily believable.  A small group of people tries to figure out what's going on and try and avoid the inevitable of becoming afflicted, as the menace quickly spreads from its point-of-origin and threatens to take on global proportions.<br /><br />  When I first saw this one, I was under the impression that the nature of the phenomenon was going to remain a big secret until the end but that wasn't the case or the intention, and the general apparant cause of all the strange events comes out pretty quickly.  I still hesitate to give it away because it IS more effective if you go into it without too much foreknowledge the first time.  I will say that with the way the filmmakers executed it; with the citing of real-life similar phenomenon on a much smaller scale; with the drawing of attention to the fact that there's still much more about the world and the universe that humanity doesn't know than it does; and with a general projection of a sense of wonder about the mystery and grandeur of the cosmos, or nature or existance or whatever you want to call it, it makes the bizarre scenario feel real, and not far-fetched or contrived.  The interactions between the characters, including ones who are total strangers when the events begin, are powerful and engaging.  Many apocaltptic movies do well focusing on the darker aspects of people emerging in the shadow of The End, but The Happening follows a different route and focuses mostly on brighter, more benevolent instincts taking over.  There's one particularly poignant moment near the very end, which may actually involve more participants than it appears.<br /><br />  All in all, a riveting, frightening, powerful movie that defies easy classification.  Highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>The nothingness of this film was painful. It had amazing promise that just fell flat. The actors were good, except the woman who played Wahlberg's wife was pretty miscast. The storyline and plot were close to  horrible.  No believable scientific explanations, a vague message of a warning, but really a lot of ambivalence and lack of passion. I was offended at the portrayal of those who lived out in the lonely countryside first as killers and then as insane wicked people. Very narrow-minded view and negative toward people who live in the country. The film neither inspires us nor frightens us. Four of us adults were watching and very often we were laughing out loud when I believe we were supposed to be frightened or horrified. The blah ending was the biggest disappointment of all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>First off, I am not a M. Night Shyamalan hater. I really loved The Sixth Sense and I enjoyed Unbreakable and Signs. The Village was average at best and Lady in the Water was pretty awful. The Happening couldn't be his third bad movie in a row, right? I'm sorry to say that this is one of worst movies I have seen this year and I've see a lot. The concept is neat and there are some creepy elements early on, but it just gets worse as it goes along. The acting is very bad from almost everyone involved and the dialogue makes things even worse. I just don't know what is going on with this once promising director. I'm glad I listened to the critic's reviews and waited for this one to hit DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Up front I have to admit that the acting in this film was HORRIBLE.  Now, getting past that, the story was an awesome blend of traditional sci-fi pulp and modern story-telling.  The complexity of the story did not transfer well to the big screen, however.  This would probably have been a bigger cult hit if it had been shipped direct to dvd and not exposed to the simple minds of most reviewers.  Not the typical Hollywood schlock...which accounts for the negative press.  Die hard MNS fans will appreciate the story...others will get lost.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"The Happening" didn't.  M. Night Shyamalan's film rested on a strange premise.  While I liked the environmental message echoed in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" that man must be a partner with nature on the planet, the idea that a substance could abrogate free will and drive masses to suicide seemed preposterous.  If the plants had decided to go on an oxygen strike and people started suffocating, that might have made more sense.  Here we have wind blowing on the grass or the wind in a tree which is supposed to be a sinister event.  Shyamalan's image of people jumping from buildings was unique as was the car crash.  However, these moments could not salvage a weak premise.<br /><br />The shaky premise was also complicated by the lack of acting performance.  This has to be a failure of Shyamalan as a director to elicit good work from most of his actors.  I did like two performances in the film.  Betty Buckley was the coach in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792839676">Carrie</a> in her first film back in 1976 & played a country singer in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005R246">Tender Mercies</a>.  She won a Tony award for "Cats."  As Mrs. Jones, she creates one of the creepiest characters I've seen in a long time, a woman who lives in the middle of nowhere, cut off from contact with the outside world with no telephone, television, radio or computer.  When she smashes her head through the glass, it is the crowning moment to a woman who slapped the girl's hand for reaching for a cookie and screamed with paranoia that her guests were trying to steal from her shabby old house.<br /><br />Another good cameo was by soap star Kristen Connolly who played a confused woman reading on a bench.  Her confusion and odd behavior sets the tone for upcoming events.  Child actress Ashlyn Sanchez as Jess did an acceptable job with the little she was asked to do.  Her stoic stare as her father abandons her has to be Shyamalan's choice.  Alan Ruck who was in the great film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RFFI">Twister</a> as well as "Speed" has a brief cameo as the principal.<br /><br />On the negative side, Colombian-born actor John Leguizamo was in a film I liked, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007W7I4W">Assault on Precinct 13 (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HRMAVS">The Groomsmen</a> now joins this film as two for which I did not care.  As the father Julian, I understand his concern over the fate of his wife.  However, his abandonment of his daughter in a stressful uncertain time was inexcusable.  And this was BEFORE he went nuts.  Leguizamo did what he was asked to do; so again the fault in conception is with the director.  Mark Wahlberg's cardboard thin performance as science teacher Elliot Moore may have one wondering if this was the same actor nominated for an Oscar for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341QE">The Departed (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  In the scene where he's separated from his wife, his level of concern was very low.<br /><br />For me the worst performance of the film, the real raspberry, is Zooey Deschanel as Alma.  This actress had received a Best Actress nomination by the Independent Spirit Awards for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZPTY">All the Real Girls</a> and was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010DR4BO">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a>.  I have no idea what Shyamalan said to her to get such a wide-eyed vacant stare as a woman who thinks she may have destroyed her marriage and faces the lethal health crisis that threatens her life.<br /><br />While the cinematography was good, the story and major performances preclude me wanting to watch it again.  Taxi!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I'm a fan of M. Night Shyamalan.  THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKBLE, and SIGNS are not only entertaining films, but the stories in those films tacks some very deep and important issues, such as love, the nature of evil, and faith.  Even though THE VILLAGE and LADY IN THE WATER were not as well received by either audiences are critics, I enjoyed both of them (in fact I loved LADY IN THE WATER--it's a modern-day fairy tale told right).  Therefore, I was quite excited to see THE HAPPENING.  Instead of having some great philosophical discussions with friends and family after seeing the movie (as happened each time before after I saw Shyamalan's films), I left thinking "What happened?" and "That was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />The film begins interesting enough and contains enough shock value to hold one's attention for the first half of the film.  It's just another day in Central Park in NYC.  A woman sits on a bench chatting with a friend when she hears someone scream.  A breeze flows through the park and then everyone stops moving.  Moments later the woman's friend removes a hair pick and begins stabbing herself in the neck in a deliberate act of suicide.  Minutes later at a downtown construction site in the city, a foreman is trying to contact a worker who won't respond when the missing worker's body plunges from the sky.  The event is witnessed by several people, but as they rush to the fallen man's aid other bodies begin falling from the sky as worker after worker walks across platforms and plummet to their deaths.<br /><br />The story then moves from NYC to a small, rural Pennsylvania high school where a high school science teacher, Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is giving an engaging lecture to his students early in the morning. At this point in the movie, as Mr. Moore pontificated about science, I was reminded of a sci-fi parody I saw a few years ago, THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA.  The hero of that movie was a scientist, too and said some of the same phrases (almost word for word) that Mr. Moore spoke.  Of course, THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA was a parody film of all of those cheap sci-fi pictures of the 1950s and 1960s and was illustrating at how absurd it was that just because a person was a scientist they could be a credible hero and save the world from its problems.  When a movie that begins so shocking, interesting, and thrilling takes a sudden detour and causes one to remember a hilarious sci-fi parody about ten minutes into the movie, it's not a good sign.<br /><br />As for the rest of the plot, Moore is pulled away from his class by his principal who informs them they are dismissing school for the rest of the day and is told about what has happened in NYC.  Most of the country assumes that what has happened (and continues to happen as the movie progresses) is a biochemical attack begun by terrorists.  Moore isn't convinced and as people begin to migrate to smaller towns to escape the "fallout" of whatever weapon was used, it becomes apparent that even small town America isn't safe.  What happened in New York starts happening across the entire U.S. Northeast.  Moore flees with his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and Julian's daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) as the try to escape the rather large effected area and reach civilization.<br /><br />I really like Zooey Deschanel. I think she's beautiful and is rather talented given decent material. It was almost painful to watch her in THE HAPPENING.  Her lines were terrible, her character had absolutely no personality, and she had zero chemistry with co-star Mark Whalberg.  I'm not a huge fan of Whalberg. He got a huge break early in his acting career because of his huge music stardom and some of the roles he has played he delivered a performance more wooden than a Pinocchio statue.  Still, Whalberg does have some talented and, like Deschanel, when given decent material, e.g. THE DEPARTED and INVINCIBLE, he excels.  THE HAPPENING isn't a movie where he's allowed to display his talents as a performer.  Instead he spends most of the time running around with a scared look on his face and saying lines that even a high-school dropout who hates reading can recognize as bad writing.  Oh, and did I mention he has no chemistry whatsoever with his co-star who is playing his wife, Zooey Deschanel.  Whalberg does a better job of trying to make the best of bad dialogue, but most of the other actors in the movie don't even try.  It's a bad script and other than a few scenes scattered throughout the movie, most of the cast doesn't even seem to be trying.<br /><br />Other than the terrible writing, there's a thing called plot that if very, very weak.  Bascially (SPOILERS AHEAD) the Earth's plants have decided to murder us.  That's it. The plants are the bad guys.  That's right. Plants. Enough said about that.<br /><br />Shyamalan's films have always had a layered subtext that seems more important to him than even the actual films themselves.  His films are full of meaning and are richly rewarding if viewers allow themselves to think about what they are seeing.  I'm sure there is some sort of subtext in THE HAPPENING besides the surface story about nature turning against man because of the destruction we've caused through things like man-made global warming.  The problem is that it's not really decipherable what that message is.  Is the movie really a comment about terror attacks and how paranoid the citizenry becomes in such events? Is it about the fickleness of the masses?  Is it about how reliant we've become upon media and technology so much so that we can no longer think for ourselves?  Or is it more like the surface story, a cautionary tale in the vein of JURASSIC PARK warning us that no matter how scientifically advanced we might think we are, nature will always find a way to outsmart us?  The movie might be trying to make all of these points, but none of it really matters.  In the past, the messages made sense because the movies that Shyamalan made were actually enjoyable to watch.  Even THE VILLAGE and LADY IN THE WATER are good movies if you watch them with a child-like wonder and accept them for what they are.  However, no amount of suspension of disbelief is going to help make THE HAPPENING a good movie.  Whatever message or messages Shyamalan was trying to make become lost and completely overshadowed because the vehicle the message is being delivered in (the movie itself) is so terribly bad.  The only good points are the shocking opening sequence and a few other well-done scenes scattered throughout the movie. And that's all that's happening with THE HAPPENING.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Ok, I'd heard that THE HAPPENING was a dog-log of a movie, but fool that I am, I watched it anyway. Oh my! Where to begin? Mark Wahlberg is a school-teacher caught in the middle of the most boring "apocalyptic" movie ever filmed. It seems that mother nature has finally had enough of the terrible human race, and has decided to gas us all w/ mind-altering suicide toxin! Now, this may sound interesting, and perhaps in the right hands it would be, but trust me on this one. It ain't! All we get are various groups of over-actors, meandering about, then running from the wind (that's where the toxin is doncha know)! There is no tension or suspense, and certainly no horror. It's as if someone had an interesting dream, and made a movie out of it as soon as they woke up, without taking the time to work out any of the important details. I rarely experience a bomb of this thudding magnitude! The fact that this is a "professional", hollywood production only adds to the overall misery, since this means that it was expensive to make as well! Dear Lord, this one's monumentally awful...</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>He has the vision and the skill, but the lack of an actual plausible plot killed this movie and perhaps Shyamalan's reputation. It is unfortunate because you can tell he really does try to make a good film. The trailers were very effective and the premise interested me, but man, what a letdown. Truthfully, the first 3/4 of the film were actually pretty darn entertaining. There was mystery and tention, just a great buildup. But then, the end happened, or uh, didn't. Simply put; one of worst endings in the history of films. No joke. It was just awful and I was so mad for days after. I felt cheated. There are no words to describe what went wrong, because I have no idea what M Night was thinking when he wrote this script. I'm just so confused. It litereally ruined what could have been a really decent flick. The rest of the film was null and void because of this atrocious ending.<br /><br />One other major thing that irked me throughout though was the acting. I was horrified by how terrible the actors were. ALL of them. Mark Wahlberg was ridiculous as was John Leguizamo. It was bizaar. Just truly bad at times, down to the laughable facial expressions.<br /><br />This was for me, easily, the worst Shyamalan film to date.(I have yet to see Lady in the Water...)</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>I will watch just about anything with Mark Wahlberg in it. I've been a fan of his for many, many years and he rarely disappoints. The Happening, however, was one of the dumbest films I've watched in a very long time! The Happening is the latest film by M. Night Shyamalan in which people mysteriously stop dead in their tracks and begin killing themselves for no apparent reason. The premise itself was kind of scary, but the other storylines and the obvious overacting by Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel grated my nerves. You always expect people to do stupid things in horror movies, but this lot acted like they had lost all sense completely.<br /><br />The only things that made this movie tense were the cringe-worthy death scenes (Shyamalan made sure to point out that this is his first rated R film) and the stupidity and loss of common sense shared by the characters. Obviously fear causes people to do strange things, but after a while I just didn't care anymore.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg should stick what he does best - playing characters out for revenge. His take as a high school science teacher was horrible. The scene at the beginning of the movie where he is in class trying to explain the (true) disappearance of thousands of honey bees recently made me want to scream. For some reason Wahlberg talks to his students, who are at least 15 years of age or older, in a high-pitched patronizing tone. While I would have loved to have had a science teacher like him when I was in high school, the way he talked to his students was extremely annoying. I'm not even going to go into the bad performance by Zooey Deschanel, who plays Wahlberg's wife. I haven't seen much from her, but if I had to go by this performance, I'd tell her to find another career.<br /><br />So, in closing, do not see this movie. It's not worth your time and I don't think you'll enjoy it very much. I'm glad I only paid $1 to rent it at one of those Red Box kiosks in the grocery store. :)</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>You cannot go see an M. Night Shyamalan film expecting to see a typical movie. His films have a different flavor to them. When you get used to that idea, when you understand that this isn't a typical Hollywood-told story, you may begin to understand the genius that is Shyamalan.<br /><br />How can I explain The Happening without giving anything away?<br />People begin to kill themselves in New York City. Authorities believe it to be a kind of terrorist attack.<br /><br />You're then introduced to Mark Walhberg's character, Elliot Moore, is a high school science teacher. He's joined by his co-worker/friend Julian (John Leguizamo), Julian's daughter Jess, and Elliot's wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel).<br /><br />The school where Elliot and Julian work decide to release the students when they hear of the attack. The main characters decide to take a train away from Philly. While on the train they hear of the attacks spreading throughout the Northeastern part of the United States.<br /><br />There seems to be no way of escaping this event. Everywhere they go, people are killing themselves. How will anyone survive?<br /><br />I'm a fan of Shyamalan's films. I enjoy his ability to tell a story. All of his films have a message to them and you'd have to be pretty slow not to catch on to what he's trying to say. And I have to tell you, it goes much deeper than "treat the earth with respect". People who jump on the bandwagon denouncing this movie as a global warming protest have simply missed the message.<br /><br />Having enjoyed the film, there are a few things that really irked me. Many critics have panned the acting. I go back to what I said earlier, this is not your average film. Don't expect your macho/hero man type talk. But I did have a problem with Mark Wahlberg's character. Maybe it was because he's always around teenagers, but every line sounded like it came from a fifteen year old. It wasn't enough to ruin my experience, it was just a noticiable irk. Second came from Zooey Deschanal. If her character was written like that, than it was just a poor choice. If it was her level of acting...I hope to avoid her films. She was the worst of the small ensemble.<br /><br />**Edit** Having thought about it for a while, I have come to the conclusion that the way they were acting: like children was part of the deeper meaning Shyamalan was trying to bring out. When you watch this movie, watch how childish these two "adults" act. And then see how they become real adults...**end edit**<br /><br />John Leguizamo was fantastic, but when is he not? I wanted to see more of him. Maybe he should have been the main character and Walhberg his buddy.<br /><br />This film is rated R and for very good reasons; Shyamalan keeps the camera on the suicide moments a second too long which create a serious feeling of dread. The other reason is because you see two teenage boys murdered with a shotgun. Anytime a minor is killed in a film, the ratings go deeper into R territory.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching this movie. Along with the sheer dread saturating the run time there were a couple "Shyamalan" moments of jump-out-of-your-seats scares.<br /><br />It is rated R so be warned - and, like I said, if you see it, see it with your Shyamalan glasses on (look for the deeper meaning).</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>First, I should say I'm a big fan of Shyamalan and think The Sixth Sense is one of the best movies ever made by an independent director, or anybody for that matter. I've liked everything I've seen until now, even though he's never come close to equalling The Sixth Sense.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie may go down in cinematic history as one of the worst movies of all time. I give it two stars just because the idea of plants attacking humans with some kind of chemical is original. There haven't been very many movies made where plants are the bad guys. Old time sci-fi fans will recall the classic Day of the Trifids, based on the famous John Wyndham novel; Little Shop of Horrors, which was more of a dark comedy; and there was an original mid-60s Outer Limits episode where flowers were zapping  people with clouds of deadly spores (although flowering plants actually have seeds, not spores), not to mention the cult low budget satire, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Those films were, however, memorable, but this one unfortunately is not.<br /><br />I note that there are at this point over 180 one-star reviews, and only about 40 five star-reviews, so I'm not the only one who thought this movie was a turkey, and I admit to being easily entertained when it comes to movies. I've hardly ever given a movie one or two stars, so if I think it's bad, it's probably pretty terrible.<br /><br />The first problem is the more than awkward script, which Wahlberg struggles valiantly with but it's basically hopeless. The relationship between him and Zooey (Deschanel) is never really developed. And although Wahlberg's performance is decent despite the mediocre material, Deschanel seems to spend most of the movie with this deer in the headlights look of stupefaction on her face which just gets tiresome after the first 15 minutes. I don't know his name, but the guy who plays the nerdy horticulturalist was good. Unfortunately, he disappears after a few scenes and isn't used again in the movie, which is too bad. The science behind the whole concept is poorly developed, despite the TV interview with some biologist Ph.D. at the end of the movie, who adds a few more scant details, but that's about it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the problem with making plants the bad guys is that they're just not that dynamic as villains. The only thing Shyamalan can do to indicate a possibly impending attack is to have a stiff breeze blow at all the people, with everyone running around frantically trying to get indoors and close all the doors and windows. With plants as the bad guys, it's hard to run anywhere since plants are everywhere, and much of the action is just these big groups of hapless survivors traipsing down roads or across fields hoping that the local vegetation doesn't yet have it in for them. This means the movie must rely more on psychological suspense (although the people offing themselves in various grisly ways does provide a macabre sort of action), which Shyamalan is usually very good at, but here it just falls flat.<br /><br />I also have to agree with the other writers here that the scene where the guy walks into the lion's cage at the zoo is just laughably bad even if it might be Shyamalan's allusion to cheesy, 50s "B" movie, horror flicks. But that scene was bad even by those standards. ;-(<br /><br />One knowledgeable reviewer here said of Shyamalan's work, "Shyamalan's movies are getting worse with every release. Sixth Sense fantastic; Unbreakable interesting; Signs entertaining; The Village ok; Lady in the Water awful; The Happening unwatchable." I think that's a pretty good summary of his career arc so far. Unfortunately, The Happening doesn't really happen at all and (to borrow a funny line from a review of another bad movie) "just wilts, flaccid, on the vine."</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>The Happening is an indefensible unintentional laugh-fest.  I'm not a fan of M. Night Shyamalan.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BRZ5J2">The Sixth Sense</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00121QGV8">Unbreakable</a> are very good movies but after that his films are hugely flawed and contain only brief moments of effective suspense.  Shyamalan really had a unique knack for directing fear in his actors at his most inspired moments, and in addition to that the writing of his first two films was also a plus.  He was a very good filmmaker for a spell.  The Happening is so much more tragic than some people have warned, but here at Amazon it seems I finally find myself agreeing with many other reviewers who I'd normally suggest are exaggerating.  One says "so bad it's shocking" and another calls the film "the crappening".  Both are spot on.<br /><br />Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher whose marriage to his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) is seemingly in some jeopardy.  His friend Julian (John Leguizamo) is aware that Alma may have been unfaithful.  Along with Julian's daughter, this group searches for safety in a world that has just been hit by a massive suicide epidemic that is never convincingly explained and never turns out to be an engaging occurrence to begin with.  I actually like all three actors in some roles but they are either left with so little direction that they don't know what to do or how to react to Shyamalan's apocalypse, or they are smiling behind thin performances because they realize they are in a bombastic failure of a film.  I lean toward the latter because by the film's conclusion Deschanel and Wahlberg really seem like they are in a comedy.<br /><br />The Happening is bad because it wants to be taken so seriously.  It has moments that should be horrifying but instead elicited several moments of laughter from this viewer.  For those who have seen the film I will just say that the scene that really sticks out for me involves a suicide at the zoo.  There are also moments of incredibly unlikely behavior; to the point where I slapped my own forehead.  I mean come on, if a lady is talking to her daughter who is vulnerable to this unknown suicide causing agent, I hardly think she would put the girl on speaker so a dozen other people can hear her die.  It's a shame because The Happening should've been good.  On the surface it is a decent story with a good cast.  Not to mention all of the pieces theoretically enhance Shyamalan's talents.  I was hoping this would take films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JU7KAE">Lady in the Water</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064LJVE">The Village</a> and promptly decrease their significance in the mainstream eye, but instead The Happening only serves to support Shyamalan's very obvious decline.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>Garbage.  Nothing else can describe this movie, but garbage (but I'll try :).  M. Night is the master of mood - think of Signs, and the incredible use of music, camera angles, etc. to create an impending sense of doom.  Or the same in The Village when the red robed human/monsters are coming.  He's typically absolutely brilliant in doing this.  And he does it very well in this movie as well, but its with absolutely no follow through.  In Signs, you get the sense of doom, then something significant happens - i.e., you see an alien leg disappear into corn...not so here.  The doom sense comes, then people just whammo die.  blah blah blah.  This is garbage, and, sadly, his movies have become progressively worse on each release.  He used to be a no questions asked opening weekend must see; now I might not even consider renting his future works.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>After reading countless negative and scathing reviews for this film, I was judgmental from the get-go.  This is one of those films you either have an appreciation for OR it will really make you hate the director all over again.  Either way, it's worth a look!  The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and on Blu-Ray it's top notch.  What a picture!  The clarity of the trees blowing in the wind and the atmospheric dread M. Night displays in this is really something to behold.  James Newton Howard's score is also something noteworthy.  Very moody, dark, miserable and looming.  Subtle and sublime in some areas and downright horrifying in others, "The Happening" puts you in a situation where you really contemplate how you would react in a situation like this.  It makes me laugh when someone judges the "acting" in this film because the characters are made to play like this is "real life," not acting.  This movie isn't aiming for acting awards.  The film is a coaster ride into something unimaginable, frightening and at the same time exhilarating and ultimately satisfying.  If one thing is true for me, I now have a deeper appreciation for this director again and look forward to his next project!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>First off, I am not a M. Night Shyamalan hater. I really loved The Sixth Sense and I enjoyed Unbreakable and Signs. The Village was average at best and Lady in the Water was pretty awful. The Happening couldn't be his third bad movie in a row, right? I'm sorry to say that this is one of worst movies I have seen this year and I've see a lot. The concept is neat and there are some creepy elements early on, but it just gets worse as it goes along. The acting is very bad from almost everyone involved and the dialogue makes things even worse. I just don't know what is going on with this once promising director. I'm glad I listened to the critic's reviews and waited for this one to hit DVD.<br /><br />The Blu-ray does offer good picture and sound quality. The extras are just standard stuff and nothing that interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>**** SPOILER AHEAD****<br />This is movie is supenseful and shocking in some scenes. For example, in the scenes where people were fleeing the city. Everybody was puzzled and did not know what's happening. I could see the anxiety and puzzlement on their faces. In another scene, it shocked me when the kid was shot in the face after he banged on the door of the house.<br /><br />The thing that let me down the most was the love between Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. There's some chemistry between them but it's not portrayed strong enough. If it had been, it would have made the movie more touching and lovely.<br /><br />Overall, it's more like a drama than a thriller. It's still worth watching once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`The Happening' is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. I hate to start any review with this kind of sentiment, but there's no getting away from how bad this film is.<br /><br />The original premise seemed pretty promising, I.e. the worlds plants feeling threatened by the encroaching human population, so it releases a neurotoxin that induces people to commit suicide, but the execution of this idea is dire.<br /><br />The writing is simply terrible, with poor story development, lack of full explanation and unnatural dialogue. The acting is terrible, with cringe making wooden performances, Zooey Deschanel is especially bad, when I`ve seen her act so well in the past. The direction is terrible, with inaccuracies (such as someone shooting themselves with a gun and then the camera pans forwards to see the gun metres in front of the person) and annoying full face to camera angles. The plot started off by being intriguing, but the ending is so lack lustre it leaves you feeling severely let down, there isn't even the clich&eacute; M. Night Shyamalan twist ending to even partially redeem this film.<br /><br />What more can I say? I think my glut of the use of the word terrible pretty much sums up my thoughts on this film. Don't waste your time and give this film a seriously wide berth.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>You know it's going to be scary when somber/scary music starts playing, then when a woman takes out her hairpin and stabs it in her neck, you must admit that M. Night takes a rather artful approach to filing somebody dieing. Of course, that rather artful scene could be the only one of the movie, as it's a stark contrast to a later scene where a man purposely feeds his arms to a group of lions. It's not bad in of itself, it just comes out like a Monty Python sketch. And this would be the story of the movie. At times it's well-done, and at times it's laughable.<br /><br />Example, the marriage troubles that's the unfortunate subplot of the movie involves the wife feeling guilty, acting like she's cheated on her husband, come to find out she only had cheesecake with him. It's at this fact, that the husband feels lied to and betrayed about. To this, he responds by conjuring a story saying he was so attracted to a pharmacist, he bought cough medicine, even though he didn't have a cough. The wife is horrified at this fact, until the husband reveals he was kidding. Yes, this subplot is pretty bad, but also delightfully cheesy.<br /><br />The Happening happens to be an attack of plants on humans by releasing a toxin that makes anybody affected to kill themselves via any means. Why are the plants doing this? Because we're poisoning our environment, which is the real horror in this movie. It's incredibly cheesy, and entertaining, even though it could have been carried out better in terms of plot/action. I mean, if NYC is killed by plant toxins, that's going to set the nation back quite a bit, not to mention the massive loss of life. Also, don't try to figure out the logistics of the toxin, or how it works, because you will be confused. It kills people in large groups, then kills a singular people without explanation.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg has seen better roles, however he carries possibly the film's funniest/cheesiest moment when he finds himself talking to a plant, trying to convince it that he means them no harm, and he only wishes to go to the restroom, come to find out the plant is plastic. With scenes like this, I'm even surprised he took the role. Zooey plays the wife who likes to keep her feelings inside, even though Zooey is known for being that energetic indie girl. Besides the fact that plants are makes people kill themselves, Zooey is still the highlight of the movie.<br /><br />Seen as the cheesy film it is, M. Night Shyamalan's first R effort is entertaining, but the type of film you'll only want to see once. Why is it not to the par of other M. Night films? Because he's purposely trying not to be himself, which kind of hurts the movie, but helps give the film its cheese. So what is the happening? The cheese is what's happening.</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>Ok, I'm going to launch in with a plot spoiler. What this about is a type of unusual hay fever where instead of suffering sneezing and runny eyes, sufferers jump off buildings and under lawnmowers and stuff. Yes, that's it.<br /><br />As ever, Walberg is so wooden in it, I'm surprised the plants didn't have him identified as a 5th Columnist, but he brings enough confusion and frowns to the show to not actually be too bad in this. I like the guy; he's a different kind of wooden to Keanu Reeves. It would be great to get them in the same film and have them chased by woodpeckers, termites and stuff, now that would be terrifying.<br /><br />I thought Zooey Deschamel was lovely and wonderful, a definite "keeper" in anyone's book, a Zooey Keeper in fact. Ho ho.<br /><br />Now I have got the puns out of the way, onto the film. The premise is ridiculous in the extreme, now, as a scientist, I am sure that there is much we don't know about plants, and yes, plants can produce chemicals to make them unattractive to potential predators, and yes, they can even communicate with other nearby plants of an attack to enable them to start producing the same chemical as well. This much is true. But the actual mechanism and effects themselves, it is just too silly. I am the first to recommend that in many cases, one should just put aside scientific realities for the sake of the film, but this just stretches it too far.<br /><br />If perhaps the chemical induced some sort of hallucinations or random psychotic behaviours, I would have gone for it a bit more. All the dramatic music and waving of grass in the breeze was just silly in the end I thought.<br /><br />Now, on to the direction. M Night Shyamalan is like a new test cricketer who started off with centuries in his first couple of matches, now; however, he is struggling to get the ball off the square. He just seems to have lost his touch and he really needs to get back to brass tacks, stop meddling too much and concentrate on getting the simple things right. There is no doubt that there are moments of tension in the film, but the overtly silliness of the plot means that you are never really fully drawn in.<br /><br />Mind you, I was never really enamoured with the director after seeing that preposterous "documentary" about him a few years back. Please tell me no one could be as self absorbed as that, please?<br /><br />And the ending, oh dear, again, lazy and contrived. Cut to the scene a few months after "The Happening" with the happy family walking down leafy streets full of plants. You can guarantee that if The Happening had actually Happened, there would have been a defoliation that would have made the whole Agent Orange thing look like a brisk whiff of "Roundup". Well, wouldn't you stamp on every blade of grass within a hundred miles if you thought the grass was going to rise up against you? Oh, just writing this made me realise the irony of the "lawnmower incident". Ho ho.<br /><br />Anyway, to summarise, could have been more, not a total waste of time though, 2 and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>I'm floored that Night keeps getting financing to make more films, with each being worse than the last.  This one really takes the cake.  You can't help laughing at the unbelievable dialogue which no one in real life would ever say, the not-scary plot twist, and the poor acting from people who would do better in other films and more likely with other directors.<br />Gather your friends, rent this thing, sit back, and do a total Mystery Science Theatre 3000 on it.  You will sneer, point, and scowl, but at least you'll have fun doing it.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>It's a B-movie.  No other word to describe it.  And as a non-intellectual throw-away B-movie, it's not that bad.  However it comes laden with expectation - it's a Shymalayan movie - so what's the hook, and what's the twist!<br />Well, the hook is that mysterious deaths start occurring in the NE of the United States.  Confusion reigns, as the news alternates between fear this is a terrorist attack, to the gradual realization this is.. well, just in case you haven't seen it yet I won't spoil the only `surprise' in the movie.  But wait, there IS another surprise - when did Mark Wahlberg become such a dismal actor!  The lines, the delivery, the timing, everything is just what you'd expect from a poorly edited 70's grindhouse movie.  Can he be doing it deliberately as an in-joke?  If so, the jokes on him because its cringe-worthy.  If you can just take it at a B-movie level, you might get some satisfaction - because there isn't anything else to enjoy in the movie.  The director has lost his flair for the gradual reveal, the careful structure, and the cinematic tools as storytelling devices.. it's a movie that is no more then the lowest denominator you might expect a movie with a plot like this to have.<br />The extras talk much about how this was the director's exciting foray into the world of an adult rating.  And true, some of the deaths are disconcerting, and yes, there is maybe one cheap shock to be had, but sadly it's all so straightforward, and lacks any impact, except the occasional moment of impact as you hit the wall with your head at the ineptitude.<br />As for the twist - there is none. It's just one of those movies that you keep thinking it will go somewhere and it goes on, and on.. then.. sort of ends.  And that's it.<br />Extras - deleted scenes are more of the same, gag reel is not as funny as some of the actual lines in the movie, featurettes are slight and frustratingly broken up into 5 to 10 minute chunks.  Perhaps the movie might have been better if it had the same done to it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>The Happening was a very fine film by Night Shyamalan and rates at least four stars with this reviewer. I never saw this movie until recently and am surprised at how poorly it did in the theaters and with many Amazon reviewers. The story was revealed with a clearly measured pace producing the feeling that the situation was going to get horribly worse very quickly. Can you imagine, this after a "possible" terrorist attack? I like Night's work (although disappointed by a couple of his films) and overall think he is a genius. I can't comment on this plot much more without ruining it, so please just see the film with an open mind.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Two women are sitting in new York Central Park.

Another unexplained force would be, considering the last good movie he made was Sixth Sense, M Night Shyamalan's popularity.  With enough pseudo-science about plant-life having self-preservation mechanism, and the ability to launch airborne neurotoxins from their spores, or something like that, this movie may as well have been the sequel to The Inconvenient Truth.<br /><br />Poor speech and disorientation are the first signs of this floral terrorist attack, meaning Bobcat Goldwaithe and drunks walking out of bars would be in serious danger.  A decent cast with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, as Elliot and Alma Moore, is the only reason to watch this film.  Given nearly nothing script-wise by writer/director M. Night, the acting is nonetheless very intense.  Seriously, the script is the stuff of bar napkins.  Better yet, graffiti scribblings on toilet walls.  If not for a series of shocking suicides, which are, admittedly, jaw-dropping, the movie serves as nothing more than environmental mumbo-jumbo.  If Shyamalan wanted to make plants and wind scary (which they absolutely weren't in this film), he should have taken a page from The Ruins or The Wizard of Oz, respectively.<br /><br />Ten reasons this movie sucks (there could easily be more):<br />1) The man vs. lion scene is atrociously done, so fake I gave myself a migraine when I rolled my eyes.<br />2) Suspense requires, well, suspense.  Telling the surprise ending at the beginning is stupid.  Why not just show Bruce Willis as a ghost in the first scene of The Sixth Sense?<br />3) When there is a lovelorn subplot involving the two main characters of the film, and it's given absolutely no depth, it should be left on the cutting-room floor.<br />4) When a train stops in the upper NE of the U.S., the reason given is that they've lost contact with, "everyone."  Given that the effects of this "outbreak" only attacked the same region, why would they stop when they could easily contact the rest of America, let alone the rest of the world.<br />5) People can't outrun the wind.<br />6) When escaping from the wind, it's wise to know that old houses have very poor insulation<br />7) The over-the-top preaching about humans destroying the planet is insufferable.  I'm going to drive my SUV through a wheat field just to spite Shyamalan.<br />8) The psychotic, reclusive yokel Mrs. Jones is a pointless addition, and if anything, should have been spared by the film's "logic."<br />9) Pointless plot insertions like a communications pipe between Mrs. Jones main house and a shed outback is sloppily inserted just for future use later.  The same goes for everyone in the film with a gun.<br />10) Aside from constantly being in the running for Razzies, this film has the distinct pleasure of easily having one of the worst ten endings in cinema history.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>Wow, M Night has released another turdbomb.

The plants are sending killer signals in the wind and mayhem soon follows.<br /><br />Pros~ Interesting premiss(probably ripped off from a better source). Decent begining (what movie nowadays doesnt have one of those ?). OK effects. It eventually had to end.<br /><br />Cons~ Where to begin...... The direction, writing, pacing, acting, music, no scares, no drama, crappy open-ended ending........ nothing in this worked at all.<br /><br />Im not a big mark wahlberg fan but he usually is reliable. Here i feel embarrassed for him. Not that M wrote anything for him to recite, but still. This will surely earn him a Razzie. Absolutely no one else faired any better than him.

Night Shymalan from himself.  For a man who insists on writing, producing and directing his own movies, he's digging an early grave for his career as a filmmaker and "The Happening" has breached the six-foot mark for his burial.  Sporting a lousy script and lousy performances to boot, Shyamalan's much talked-about first R-rated film is a travesty of filmmaking that deserves no better than a 30% rating.  If it were a tomato, it'd be pretty darn rotten.<br /><br />The film begins in the early morning hours in Central Park.  People are milling about, casually strolling, going about their business.  Two young women sit on a bench chit-chatting when one of them hears a shrill scream and turns her head in the direction of the sound.  What she begins to see after a moderate breeze blows through are people suddenly frozen in their tracks, still as statues, an act that mirrors that of a real-life coordinated event once performed in NY's own Grand Central Station (and I have to wonder whether the film was somehow conceived from that).  As she turns to her friend Claire to tell her what she sees, her friend begins mumbling incoherently and slowly removes the hairpick from her tightly wound chignon, deliberately stabbing herself in the neck.<br /><br />From there, we are taken to a construction site three blocks away at 8:39 am, only six minutes into the future from the strange occurrence at Central Park.  A body drops from a fatal height and several foremen rush to his aid, only to witness several more men fall to their death.  We are then scooted along to a small high school in Pennsylvania where science teacher Elliott Moore (Wahlberg) is giving an animated lecture at 9:45 am.  He is suddenly pulled aside by the school principal and taken to a room where the entire faculty hears of the strange events in New York.  The American media assumes at first it is some sort of biochemical terrorist attack, due to the fact that only major cities are being targeted while small towns remain safe.  This theory is quickly busted when small towns suddenly fall prey, the safe zones growing smaller and smaller as Elliott, his wife Alma (Deschanel) and fellow teacher and close friend Julian (Leguizamo) try to find a haven from this unseen and presumably unstoppable force.<br /><br />"The Happening" glows with promise in its first ten minutes but withers quickly after, leading its audience into a deep dark abyss of disappointment.  At a tight 1 hour and 30 minutes, the film is still agonizingly long, what with its laughable scientific theories and hackneyed performances.  Wahlberg and Deschanel embarrass themselves time and time again, but I have to wonder whether it's really their fault.  Is it due to Shyamalan's joke of a screenplay or his poor direction?  These actors are better than this and their other films are proof of it.  Leguizamo is the only semblance of a saving grace, making the most with what little he's got.  The rest of the cast come and go, largely unknown and largely insignificant still.<br /><br />Bottom line: There isn't much more to say about "The Happening" except that it ain't happening, if you get my drift.  Feel free to watch it and formulate your own opinion if you wish, but don't say you haven't been warned.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>OK...Umm...Uh...OK, just stall words to keep me from getting started. OK, here goes.<br /><br />First the negative: "The Happening" just is not happening as a successful film. Did M. Night really think a movie with the wind blowing trees and grasses would be frightening? Or that the addition of music as a character with the wind would be ominous enough? Perhaps it is with Mark Wahlberg that he expected the movie to be scary. After all, Wahlberg is noted for his intense acting and those serious facial contortions. One scene shows a side view of his face all screwed up. All I could think was how deeply creased his forehead would one day be! A scary movie should not allow me to think that!<br /><br />However, one of the few really scary parts occurred when the greenhouse guy was in the scene. First, he tells us that plants respond to human voices (true, long-time studies have confirmed this) and that they can respond negatively as well--deep foreshadowing! After the close-up of his misaligned facial features, I fully expected this dude to be hit with neurotoxins and go beserk. Didn't happen. Red herring!<br /><br />Another really scary part involved the old woman living in isolation, who revealed herself to be beserk without help of neurotoxins. Maybe that was M Night's point: Nature needs to help along the deletion of unsavory human beings, especially including Average Joe (the construction site jumpers--it is no telling what they have done to the plant world!!), but also the truly insane (the old woman who wisely chose to live in the safety of isolation).<br /><br />I'm going to leave the last three months alone. I could tear into the problems there, too.<br /><br />Now the positive: Some of these comments are just the reverse of my negative ones. For example, the addition of Wahlberg in the film was a plus because of his intensity. He pretty much makes the whole plant thing  believable--well, almost believable. I was even convinced his and Alma's love stopped the neurotoxins. Actually, because of the mystery entwined throughout the story, there is no reason not to think their love stopped the toxins. In other scenes the galloping fear of toxins seemingly increased the plant rampage.<br /><br />Overcast skies, wind and music, discordance between words and actions, palpable fear, Wahlberg's panic attack, the Hitchcock-like house and old woman--all lent themselves to an increasing sense of unease to dis-ease. The film does work in some ways.<br /><br />I leave further arguments to others.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>The first twenty minutes are pretty good, but folks, by the end you will witness some of the worst dialogue ever written for film. So bad, that it might give The Happening a second life as a cult film (so bad, it's good). I couldn't believe the Amazon blurb above, that said Shyamalan is a genuis with dialogue. Shyamalan's camera work is, as always, good, and he was able to stock the movie with good actors -- but you have to give those actors something remotely believable to say!  I think I read somewhere that Shyamalan said this was meant to be a B movie, only the best ever done. In his Legend-in-his-own-mind dreams!  I'll take a bad John Carpenter effort any day over this limp stuff.

STUNK!<br /><br />The reviewers who purport to be more open-minded and forgiving of this jerk M. Night Shamalaladingdong, are the kind of people who speak in esoteric terms at parties. Whatever you guys do, never travel to Filbert, Pennsylvania. You'll meet the world's worst actors reading the world's worst script. You've been warned.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>With The Happening, M Night Shyamalan straddles the line between B-movie (the trees are attacking!) psychological drama (there's something happening in the wind!) and a theatrical play, and how one enjoys this film will depend on how you view those nuances.  All the reviews here are accurate and they reflect one's own expectations.  You will either love, hate, or feel that this is a bland production.  Knowing that it was M. Night - a director who marches to his own beat - I had no expectations for anything big.<br /><br />Trademark to M. Night's style is realism. He does not rely on wham-bam special effects to amp up the action, hence the characters are key to holding the whole story together.  Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo, and Zooey Deschanel put in compelling, empathic performances as the people who are trapped in a situation they don't understand.<br /><br />(The closest parallel to The Happening would probably be Spielberg's War of the Worlds, minus the special effects and set in a small town.)<br /><br />I hadn't seen an M. Night film since the Village, but his style hasn't changed one bit.  So if you saw that, and you watched Unbreakable, well, this is in the same vein.  His characters remain mysterious and intriguing, while his story arcs need work. M. Night isn't one for a big climactic reveal either.<br /><br />So, while THE HAPPENING is average as a thriller, it actually succeeds in being depressing and disturbing for a mix of reasons - there's no solution in sight and people are powerless in this lifetime to do anything.  While touching perhaps on an existential chord but not quite pressing all the right buttons, Mr Shyamalan needs to work harder at his storytelling somewhere (Robert Mckee of Story fame would attest to that).<br /><br />He continues to be a quirky auteur in Hollywood genres, but many like me are how long he's going to last with his brand of moviemaking.  He continues to defy the formula, and I can't help feeling he really wants to be more distinct like Director Nicholas Roeg ("Don't Look Now") or Canadian director Atom Egoyan.<br /><br />His character driven pieces seem to suit a smaller medium like TV better, and he should really be directing episodes of the Twilight Zone if that series was ever revived.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>I like most of Shamaylan's movies (ok, 'Lady In The Water' was pretty weak), but this one is pretty mediocre. Mark Wahlberg is really weak in the leading role - he's not my favorite actor anyways. And the film actually even managed to make Zoeey Deschanel look slightly unappealing (whereas I think she's normally smokin' hot!).</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>We have been waiting for quite some time for Night Shyamalan's comeback with a movie that will reclaim his walk to fame.  I hate to say it, but it is starting to look as if this director's fame was purely accidental.<br /><br />Set in the northeast this film is about scary epidemic that starts in urban parks that spreads to New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  People become disoriented, and before long, they start committing suicide.  No one can escape the horror.<br /><br />Main characters are young married couple experiencing some marital tension caused by mutual indecision to have (or not to have) children.  Mark Wahlberg is simply wonderful in his portrayal of a "hapless, not too bright, but yet likable" character of a husband and a high school science teacher trying to preserve the life of his wife, their friend's daughter and his own.<br /><br />The idea of the film about plants disharging some sort of poisonous toxin in revenge for human's lack of care about the environment is bizzarre.  It's unexplained halt on epidemic is even more strange.  Note to director - next time, think through a story line first before shooting a movie.  It may just help a little itzy bitz.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>You know, I used to think that writer/director M. Night Shymalan was actually a really talented filmmaker; one who knew how to make movies that audiences the world over could enjoy. I mean this was the man that chilled audiences with his breakthrough hit "The Sixth Sense", showed us a burgeoning hero coming to grips with who and what he was becoming in "Unbreakable", and then explored faith and paranoia in "Signs". As good as those movies were, with "The Sixth Sense" being the best of them, after only three movies something began to go wrong and we were suddenly given some rather underwhelming films, such as "The Village" or the extremely dull and quirky "Lady in the Water". Even with M. Night's apparent fall from Hollywood grace due to his previous two efforts, his latest movie looked as if it might actually have what it takes to stand tall amongst the earlier work in his career. However, after watching the recently released "The Happening" I have now come to the realization that M. Night Shymalan is officially overrated and that he no longer understands what it takes to make a truly great movie.<br /><br />"The Happening" follows a science teacher, Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), as he tries to grasp what is causing some extremely bizarre events that have begun to plague the people around him. As more and more people begin acting strangely, Elliot senses that perhaps an unseen force is causing humans to do bizarre and violent things to themselves. The further Elliot tries to understand what is happening around him, the more shocking the truth becomes as it appears that humanity may be under attack from the very plants that surround us everywhere.<br /><br />For some reason I really did want to see this movie when I first saw the trailer. Regardless, of the less-than-stellar results his last two films yielded, I thought that perhaps M. Night Shymalan had once more discovered what he seemed to have forgotten that made his early movies favorites among moviegoers. However, after only getting 20 minutes into "The Happening" it was painfully clear that I was wrong, and that M. Night had once again delivered a steaming pile of crap to audiences. Now, I did go ahead and finish this movie, but I couldn't hardly wait for the 90 minute long running time to come to a close so that I could swiftly eject this movie from my player, and soon begin purging the memory of this movie from my mind; sadly I have yet to succeed in doing this completely.<br /><br />The plot for this movie is such a ludicrous concept, and obviously done in an attempt to cash in on the whole "Go Green" craze that seems to be sweeping the nation. I believe even the most ardent "Green" supporter will laugh at the sheer stupidity of the notion that perhaps the plant-life of Earth is attempting to kill humanity in response to all the damage we've done to the environment over the years. As if the basic plot for this movie wasn't bad enough, the dialogue was sub-par throughout the entire movie. I don't know what M. Night was thinking when writing this movie, but he seems to have forgotten how to write clever, intriguing, and realistic dialogue for his characters to recite. In place of well-written dialogue we find surprisingly pointless conversations and even a few areas where characters are given a line to say that feels completely out of place given everything they've been experiencing over the course of the film. Essentially, nothing in the story for "The Happening" worked for me, and if the studio felt that this would be a nice attempt to cash in on the "Go Green" agenda, they were sorely mistaken as this movie made only a paltry amount of money during its mercifully brief stint at the box office.<br /><br />To top off this movie's horrible excuse for a story, "The Happening" also managed to have really talented actors give some of the worst performances of their careers. The movie's lead, Mark Wahlberg ("The Departed"), is an actor who I would normally classify as extremely talented and one of my favorite actor's in the business today; however, this movie really causes one to question what Mark was thinking in signing on for such an obvious flop. For an actor that generally chooses really good roles in typically great movies, this seems like a giant blunder on his part; especially when his overall performance is very uneven and generally uninspired, complete with some poor line readings and unconvincing acting in places. Supporting Mark we have actress Zooey Deschanel ("Failure to Launch") who does an average job as Elliot's distant wife, although a couple of times her performance seemed to falter, but this could have been caused by the rather dim-witted lines of dialogue her character was given to speak. Rounding out the primary supporting cast we have comedian and actor John Leguizamo ("Righteous Kill"). John is typically a fairly solid character actor, but here I think he was trying too hard to create a quirky character to the point that he ends up becoming more annoying than unique. I must point out that even though the cast had some rough spots in their performances, I believe a lot of the blame must rest with M. Night Shymalan for not giving his actors something worthy of their talents to work with.<br /><br />At one time writer/director M. Night Shymalan was being heralded as one of the most original filmmakers to hit Hollywood in years, thanks in no small part to the blockbuster successes of "The Sixth Sense" and "Signs"; and yet over the course of his career, only half of the movies he has made have actually been worth watching. "The Happening" continues the streak of cinematic garbage that M. Night has dumped upon unsuspecting moviegoers hoping for some sort of surprising movie experience, the likes of which we haven't seen since "The Sixth Sense". Perhaps with three well-below average movies in a row both studios and audiences will cease to give this overrated hack a chance, at least until he can come up with a story worthy of our attention once again.<br /><br />For those of you that may have noticed, "The Happening" is M. Night Shymalan's first rated R movie, a fact that the studio is heavily touting in their advertising for the recent DVD release; but I honestly can't say that I saw anything in this movie that should have garnered such a rating. Although, I do find it somewhat humorous that the only aspect of this movie the studio's marketing department can choose to focus on is its rating. When something like this occurs it's a pretty clear indication that the movie won't be worth your time or money.<br /><br />"The Happening" is rated R for violence and brief language.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>Horrid movie.  Bad script.  Bad acting.  Bad everything.  Shams, you disappointed me.  What happened with The Happening?  Everything they teach you not to do in a screenplay, you did blatantly.<br /><br />This is by far the worst of your movies.  I mean, this movie could have easily been done by some rookie filmmaker.<br /><br />I felt none of the suspense, none of the intensity, no sense of curiosity.  I couldn't even feel the tension between Deschanel and Wahlberg's character.  This was a dead, flat movie.  It was just there.  Nothing was "happening".<br /><br />What was with all the wide shots on the people killing themselves?  No close-ups?  At least make some sharp cuts to add intensity.  There was none of that.<br /><br />This whole movie smelled like monotony.  The theme music had that same dreary, moaning oboe theme to it. Even the freaking synopsis on the back cover was bland. Nothing rambunctious like "Edge of your seat thriller".<br /><br />Wahlberg and Deschanel did a horrible job.  Leguziamo did his best to salvage whatever he could of a scene.  Not their fault.  I've seen them all do much better.  Bad script.  Bad direction.<br /><br />Trees and plants as silent killers?  Okay, maybe you didn't want vines and limbs to be grabbing at people because that would have been cliche, but at least make the trees imposing enough to want to cause people to kill themselves.  Add some foreboding lighting or a weird glow.  Trees and Plants are more eco-friendly than eco-foe.  I wasn't convinced at all.  Sad.<br /><br />Shams, you're slipping.  What happened to all the movies with the surprise endings?  You strayed from your trademark.  That's what you're known far.  That's what we come to see.  We liked it when you surprised us. We understand that you don't have to do every movie that way, but  you seemed bored making this film.  Are you sure you're head is in the game?<br /><br />I'm assuming that you're just in a slump right now, but let's your next film comes back to the standard.  We miss that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>The Happening wasn't a horrible film but it just wasn't that good. The acting was incredibly hokey, I kept waiting for a punchline, and there's really no resolution but I did find many of the suicide sequences to be absolutely chilling. I wouldn't say I'm the biggest Mark Wahlberg fan but his performance was positively Oscar worthy in comparison to the "caught in the high beams" look on Zooey Deschanel's mug throughout the run time. I don't intend for this to sound mean-spirited but she's just not a good actress, much of her work seems to feature the same wide-eyed, emotionless, monotone-speaking character. As a love interest and leading lady, I feel she was a poor choice for this role.<br /><br />The comic relief in The Happening was awkward, the tender moments between Wahlberg and Deschanel were unconvincing and the resolution was...well...a preachy non-resolution. Yeah, I said preachy, what normally would work better as subtext becomes text here and it's handled clumsily. There is no punchline, there is no twist, what you see is what you get and what you get is a predictable and pretty darn pedestrian episode of The Outer Limits or The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />I didn't turn off the DVD or get up and walk away while the film was playing; I was interested in what was happening, I wanted to know more about the situation, and despite Zooey Deschanel's Robby The Robot impersonation I actually cared about the characters for some strange reason. Unfortunately, The Happening just didn't hit the spot, it all felt so cheesy and heavy-handed. If you're an M. Night Shyamalan fan, you'll probably come away from this a tad bit disappointed; be sure to rent first.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>I had really low expectations for "The Happening", the person I know that loves this kind of movie the most hated it, and the people whom I almost always agree with hated it.

Night Shyamalan<br />The Buzz: James Newton Howard, (in which the score is often errie and filled with actual purpose, fitting the breathtaking cinematography)<br /><br />A. Let me start by providing you with actual post on Various sites about M. Night's work and The Happening, food for thought to start the review:<br /><br />---He should make a movie in which he dies, NOW THAT WOULD BE awsome, (sic) I would see it just not to feel bad about throwing my money away with The lady in the water and The happening. What do you think. ---<br /><br />---Hi Arjun from India here and this guy is just embarrassing to all Indians. He should stop making movies. ---<br /><br />---He seriously needs to do Bollywood. He can use his "originality" there - maybe have the actors dance around in dinosaur suits or something.  --- (or something, riveting!)<br /><br />---His last 3 movies have been terribble. His storylines are always full of holes and pretty pointless. He should give everyone that went to go see "The Happening" the price of there ticket back out of his own pocket. Hopefully the next time he's in a bid to do another movie, some one else is smart enough to remeber(sic) the absolute bombs hes been making, and politely show him to the door---<br /><br />---I wouldn't rent a Shyamalan DVD even if it came with a free prostitute!---<br /><br />---Seriously, this guy's career should have been over the day after Unbreakable came out. Not one movie of his since the Sixth Sense has been of any decent quality...NOT ONE! Do us all a favor, Night...blacklist yourself! Told!---(huh?)<br /><br />---I don't hate the guy personally, but when he showed up with "The Sixth Sense" and then "Unbreakable" i think i and a lot of others, thought he was a guy who could provide moviegoers with years of great movies.<br />His output has been close to awful, and declining steadily ever since.<br />So i don't hate him. I'm just really disappointed---<br /><br />One can no clearly see the kind of blatant and common ignorance and stupidity amongst the masses, the claim they hate someone because of a certain type of film genre that person doesn't agree with. Morever, the most common element in most M. Night haters, is they dont just hate one of his films, they despise ALL OF THEM, and then throw in their nuances here and there as to why it was 'ok most of the time, but the rest I just didn't get.' Get a wetnap.<br /><br />Our last friend said he was really disappoinmted, disappointed in what??????????? originality? nonlinear? err, different? Off the beaten path of movie fans who adore live-action, comicbook saturation, and the same people that make Bev Hills Chihuahua the number one grossing movie in the box office of late, and that, that my friends, is the very coinage of our times. What a sad lot.<br /><br />1. I truly believe that most of the people that despise M. Night, and I am indeed generalizing, couldn't grasp the conceptual understanding that his movies ARE supposed to be that way. The movies are supposed to actually dare you to be different and even on the mass ignorance that abounds on message boards like 'IMDB' and 'Fandango', make you try to think out of the box. His films, especially 'Sixth Sense' and unequivocally 'The Village', take the film goer out of the realm of being and even for two hours, transport you to M's world. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with being different AND brillaint? You go make a film and see how ORIGINAL it is. I firmly believe that the lovers of M's movies, are a rare breed, a special kind of movie lover. They attain 'Ken' status of the kind of people I want to surround myself with. Not Ironman fanatics. The folks who I have met who are passionate about movies, think that 'The Village' is one of the greatest films of the last ten years, and I have to agree.<br />It's hard for people to accept different I suppose. These same Night haters, are going to bash him, prod him and hate his movies, long before they are released, all because they are not part of that circle, they have very limited attention spans, and couldn't for the life of them try to conceptually follow a film like the 'Sixth Sense' or 'The Village'. I would suppose it could be the equivalent of taking someone from a rolling-open admissions community college and dropping them in a full semesters load at Yale.<br /><br />2. This unbridled ignorance is truly astounding. Like the samples of post on IMDB and the like, the totality of claims of why the haters, completely loath his films and career is clearly evident. "His movies suck, he sucks, they are boring and pointless and they dont make sense" Hmm, nice argument. In my time off of recent, I have sifted through 100's of post, and for the most part, the reasoning or lack there of, is purely the same. Personally, I am not a fan of sketch comedy type films, anything with Will Ferell or the like, and not a Cohen Brothers fan, I don't enjoy chick flicks, or anything with Martin Lawrence. I believe Lucas should have left the Star Wars Series where it was at in the seventies and eighties and not made the abomination of the later three we were mauled into watching. I think Taratino is as untalented of a director as The Rock is to his acting ability, however, and I mention all these personal opinions, to say I would take an M. Night film, albeit even bad, any day of the week, month or year, over what is in the box office today.<br /><br />The Film:::::::While I do agree with most folks assessment on the nature of The Happening being feverishly boring to the point of yawning many times, and lacking appropriate suspense, I found it rather intriguing. My major problem with the film was the wooden characters, and that would reflect poor writing and directing, however, that doesn't mean the person is bad at his profession period. It is strange to me the often non tangible characters in the film, especially Walhberg's role, considering M. Night's expertise at amazing dialouge and interactions. I didn't often heavily care whether they escaped the toxin, could care less about his wife, and don't really care about anyone else they picked up along the way. However, the plot is in an element all its own, and if you havent seen it, ignore these haters and naysayers and see for yourself, with an open and shrewd eye to something different. The film has M. Night's signature on it, as if I were screening it without any credits not knowing who's it was, I would without question, say Night did this film. Original, thought provoking and mildly entertaining. People here can dissect each element of the film, and dog it, bring it down in ratings, and use their splendid fingers to tell us just why it was so bad. The same way those, perhaps same people, use unwarranted claims as to why films like Death Proof are revolutionary.<br /><br />There are very few movies that I actually go to see in the physical theatres. Anytime an epic comes out like 'Troy', '300' or stuff like 'Dances With Wolves', because of the totality and grand majesty of such a film that only can be appreciated on the big screen. That said, the one director, save Speilberg for the most part, that I always will go see is M. Night, hate him or love him, he certainly causes an uproar in the online movie loving community. Why? Because he is different, and makes us think, and brings us films that few, IF ANY, director can in todays saturated market of blockbusters and cookie-cutter talent.<br /><br />In conclusion: While the film may not be for the everyday movie goer, it certainly has its market. No it wasn't the best film, in fact it wasn't the best Night film by a long shot, but it was still unique, interesting and different, and for that alone, I enjoyed it intensely. The haters can't like it, they aren't capable of liking it, they will never like ANYTHING he does, and they are increasingly annoying. If you don't like his movies, then DONT GO SEE THEM, if you think they are going to be awful, then don't waste your money, if you cant stand him being different and cutting edge with ideas that make our minds wonder and yearn for more, then don't SEE HIS MOVIES. There are a lot of us that do like M. Night, and nothing you can say will ever change that fact.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The movie's concept is certainly an unsettling one and the opening of the movie is quite a push. An unseen force is causing people to suddenly become disorientated, lose the ability to speak and then commit suicide in creatively gruesome ways that richly deserve the first R rating Shyamalan has garnered. The fact that it first happens in New York City causes people to think initially that it is a terrorist attack. As the invisible "plague" spreads through other cities in the Northeast, that possibility becomes less likely.<br /><br />But of course there's an intimate story, one that revolves around high school science teacher, Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) who has a nutty problem worrying that his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), is having an affair when all she did was enjoy a tiramisu one day with a guy named Joey, who keeps calling her. (Joey's voice is played by the writer-director.) Elliot's friend Julian (John Leguizamo), with an eight-year-old daughter in tow, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), has the real problem, as his wife is not with him during the epidemic. He leaves his girl with the Moores to search for her. As the Moores and Jess bolt from Philadelphia by train, they become stuck in the small town of Filbert, as railroad communications have broken down, whereupon they seek help from one of the nuts, Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley).<br /><br />The film's problems are that given the blandness of the leading two Moores, the dialogue is bereft of wit. Nor can the formerly remarkable Zooey Deschanel save the pic, an actress who is still playing loopy roles as she did in Miguel Arteta's "The Good Girl" but who has lost her former cuteness with advancing years.<br /><br />I have no final thoughts to send this commentary out on. The Happening is a movie I know I will watch again, one that might even grow on me to the point I go from lukewarm appreciation all the way to full-blown love like I have with Shyamalan's Unbreakable. In the end, I really can't come up with a reason as to why, even with its problems, this feature affected me like it has. Probably certain things just are a little bit beyond our rational understanding.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>The Happening / B001DZOC6Y<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense</a> scared me more than any other movie I've ever seen because it scared me in a very psychological way. No matter how you slice it, that little boy is going to spend the rest of his life viewing gruesome deaths everywhere he goes, with no escape. And he will always be totally alone because, unless he manages to find someone who shares his sixth sense, he will never have anyone to talk to about this, nor will anyone be able to understand him. That's a lot for anyone to handle for their entire life, no matter how much you might initially be resolved to the idea of the talent as a 'gift'.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying is that I found "The Sixth Sense" scary because it scared me on a deeply mental level, and didn't just startle me. And I was deeply intrigued by "The Happening" because it seemed like the same type of 'smart horror' that would scare me in a similar manner. Unfortunately, Shyamalan seems to have decided to trade 'scary' for 'startling', because while "The Happening" has definite scary potential, it seems regularly eager to trade that in for cheap startles. The blood and gore are, in my mind, excessive and it's hard to escape the feeling that the blood'n'guts were added in a cynical attempt to boost sales with an 'R' rating. Pacing and suspense are almost completely thrown away from the very beginning - within a mere minutes of the movie's opening, the scientists on the telly have already nailed down that the incidents are localized around parks and other flora-heavy areas, that the infection is airborne, that it compels people to suicide, and that it probably isn't terrorist-related. This onslaught of information prevents the viewer from building up any kind of suspense regarding the incidents and all we are left with is the characters to care about.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the characters are where "The Happening" is weakest. The acting is just horrible, really every line seems deadpan and every facial expression seems wooden and unnatural. Wahlberg in particular is intensely awful, and what was up with his opening classroom spiel? Even the creationist teachers at my private elementary schools didn't let us scribble "Gawd did it" on our homework and call it a day, but Wahlberg seems perfectly at peace with teaching his students that not only will they never understand nature fully, they shouldn't even try. Beyond that, there's the usual horror movie fare of "rapid escape is essential, so let me just stop to pack some trinkets," not to be overshadowed by the "I know my loved one is dead, but I have to try to find them anyway, leaving my child in the hands of childless strangers who need a new adopted kid to cement their troubled marriage".<br /><br />A lot about this movie just doesn't feel realistic, and that hurts the 'scary potential' even worse - it's hard to be scared to the point of sleeplessness when it all feels so fake. I don't mean the little stuff like the train stopping because they "lost contact" (how?) or the fact that houses and automobiles are generally not air-tight. I mean the big stuff, the stuff that after 9-11 or SARS, movie-makers should really be aware of. Specifically, the ending seems completely unrealistic - for months after 9-11, people in relatively minor cities were still stockpiling water and planning bomb shelters. Faced with something so much bigger, the response would be incredible. Air-tight shelters would be constructed, air masks would be worn, whole forests would be burned down by vigilante militia groups. Which isn't even delving into the fact that the responses of the people DURING the crisis seem pretty unrealistic as well - it's a plague that makes you kill yourself, so people are arming themselves with guns for protection? Gee, that seems kind of like a bad idea.<br /><br />In the end, I was deeply disappointed by "The Happening". The movie was definitely startling, but it failed ultimately to be scary. Partly because it revealed too much too quickly, partly because the acting and characterization were awful, and partly because the movie seems all to willing to believe that movie-goers won't appreciate anything without a bucket of fake guts tossed all over the camera.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>M. Night Shymalan totally lost it.<br /><br />A movie about an natural disease spread in the air that causes people to commit suicide. Mark Walberg escapes the city with his wife and the daughter of his best friend. They are chased by the disease in the air every where they go and manage to escape it. They do not die in the end because it seems the disease stops one day after it started.<br /><br />We do not know what the heck this disease is about! Is it nature taking revenge because humans are ruining it as it was theorized in the movie? Why did Mark Walberg and his wife not die in the end? Is it their love, or is it merely that it stopped one day after it started.<br /><br />We have no clue. I can't believe Shyamalan wrote and directed this film, and I can't believe Mark Walberg agreed to act in it.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>*The Happening*, while entertaining in some parts, was, overall, a disappointment.<br /><br />En masse, people are killing themselves, using whatever methods are available whether it be walking off a tall building, driving into a tree, impaling, or stepping in front of a moving vehicle.<br /><br />A small group of people (including Wahlberg and Leguizamo) soon realize that it's a toxin coming from plants defending themselves.  However, this angle is never really fully developed.  So, from the scenes, you could infer that the plants are protesting against overpopulation, overbuilding, global warming and whatnots.<br /><br />However, there are just things that do not make sense.  Plants are everywhere and everyone would be dead within minutes.  Why only in the Northeastern states?  Plants aren't isolated in that region.  When the movie is over, everything is back to normal as if there wasn't even a dent in the population.  Just unbelieveable.<br /><br />In addition, there was no "Oh, my God!" moment as was seen in *Sixth Sense*.  In hindsight, I'm starting to believe that *Sixth Sense* was just a lucky movie for M. Night Shyamalan because all his succeeding movies (except *The Village*) aren't quite the same...in fact, they've gotten progressively worse.  So, I think it's time to stop expecting Shyamalan to pull off another jaw-dropping movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I'm not sure why there are so many 1 star reviews.

Certainly not his best, but a fair story.  The acting is a little weak, which is surprising considering how talented the cast is.  I thought the whole thing was an interesting idea that doesn't quite succeed, but does work on some levels.  Maybe my expectations were low after hearing so many bad reviews, but I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I'm just stumped beyond belief at what happened to M. Night Shyamalan.  He started out with such great promise.  Both `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable' are masterworks of suspense and intellect; smart reimaginings of commonly treaded genres that often breed inferior replicas of previous works.  I really though back in the early aughts that Shyamalan was going to reinvent the common thriller/horror film and make it something unique and inspired.  I also really thought that he was going to win an Oscar shortly after he lost to Sam Mendez back in 1999.  By now though, his swift embrace by the Academy over the surprise hit that was `The Sixth Sense' seems premature and almost foolish.  He's dropped his ball so far I fear that bending over to pick it up may cause him to hit his head and die.<br /><br />`The Happening' is retarded.<br /><br />The mere premise of this film is actually somewhat inspired.  I mean, the idea that the plants, in an effort to protect themselves from the threat of humanity, have adapted to producing a toxin that causes humans to go temporarily insane and then commit suicide is kind of genius.  From the outset, it would feel like Shyamalan is finding his niche again.  Sadly, the buck stops there and the rest of the `ingredients' are so awfully concocted that the film becomes a massive joke.<br /><br />Completely LOL at Wahlberg talking to a plastic plant.<br /><br />The dialog is ridiculous (hotdogs, really), the acting is horrendous (I love you Zooey, but your comedic approach to this material is distracting) and the plot development is too sporadic for its own good.  Seriously, who is going to believe Wahlberg as a teacher?  I mean, it's honestly distracting.  My dreams of Shyamalan regaining his momentum initially garnered back in 1999 have been abolished over the past few years.  I mean, what is wrong with him?  I will say this; he can direct a chilling sequence (that scene in the creepy house with that nut-job old woman was effectively intense) but he can't write to save his life.  He needs to let someone else write his work from now on.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>I had really high hopes for this one in wanting MNS to make a popular and successful film that customers will want to see. Every once in awhile I do an in-store sampling (random customers watch the films on the HD display and give feedback) prior to release to see how the release might fare (big mistake with this one).<br /><br />Out of 136 customers who filtered through last night whilst displaying the movie, 100 said they will not be renting or buying it now, 25 outright walked away laughing and several kids liked it. Needless to say, this movie was very disappointing. The lead performances, storyline, special effects, and writing were all sadly poor and subpar. Those stories I heard about in theaters of people laughing when the movie had meant to scare you or make you feel sad rang true here too. What I did notice was an unplanned target audience materialized - 12 to 14 year olds. Each kid liked it due to either the corny scare factor or the fake gore. Seven or eight 15-16 year olds walked through that had already seen it and all stated the movie sucked.<br /><br />So anyway, technically the BD has some nice offerings. All the featurettes and extra tidbits are as they are listed here, and most are in 1080. The trivia track actually turned out to be boring on the facts, but it does allow you to incorporate all of the extra features on the disc while watching the film. The deleted scenes were mercifully removed as they were atrocious, and as MNS admitted in the intros to them - they detracted from the film he had wanted people to see - especially all the extra gore. One thing on this BD I had not seen before was the ability to mute the main menu music (if left idling). The wind effects sound great on the DTS HD, and the transfer looked flawless; so much so that the CGI effects looked really bad.<br /><br />I can see why this movie fared poorly, and I know ZD and Marky Mark are way better actors than they show here. The best summary I can come up with is: that volumes of people kept laughing as they listened to the film (while shopping in the store); Mostly due to how corny all the acting/lines/character interaction sounded, let alone how bad it looked while watching it. Watch it for the sound and clarity - skip it for every other reason thinkable.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>From the reviews I knew the movie was going to be a letdown, but we had fun watching it and got suckered in by the spooky, melancholy sound of the wind stirring the grass and the leaves at the top of the incredibly tall trees.  From that standpoint the film's technical credits get high marks.  I even liked James Newton Howard's score, but I have a weakness for overemphatic film music--at least I thought that Howard understood the plot of the film, possibly better than MNS himself.<br /><br />TIRAMISU SPOILER AHEAD!<br /><br />The movie made us examine our own lives as Plato urges us to do.  We walked a mile in the other man's moccasins thinking that if a rare virus sprung up on the wind and made us try to kill ourselves, how would we do it?  It's not as easy as it sounds!  Sure, you could slide a hatpin out of your long hair and stab yourself in the throat with it, but most of us don't have that sort of hair ornament.  You saw what happened when Philadelphia comes to a standstill and an armed cop falls to the ground, his pistol clattering on the cobblestones, and a woman picks it up, then the gun falls again, well, that gun gets a lot of use, it's because people are literally starving for ways to kill themselves.  First off, I decided, I would smoke a carton of cigarettes and enjoy a pitcher of margaritas...  then see what happened.  Maybe a heroin overdose?  In the movie we marvelled how the characters managed to off themselves using just the tools at hand, like McGyvers in revsrse--I never would have thought of lying down on the lawn and letting a mower tear me to shreds....  though jumping out of a building is a natural.  Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo, Zooey Deschanel were all uniformly terrible, and Betty Buckley brought back memories of Carrie, where she played the girls' understanding gym teacher...  does she ever survive till the end credits in any of her movies?<br /><br />Most of all I thought M. Night misplayed Zooey Deschanel's secret.  We knew she was harboring a guilty secret, but why did it have to be something as banal as sharing a tiramisu dessert with "Joey"?  Why couldn't they have had sex like most guilty lovers?  Did he died for this dessert sin?  Or is he still alive at the end of the movie?  We were all ready for the twist ending in which it would be revealed that A;ma's pregnancy was the result, not of that one dessert date, but of a long campaign to drive Mark Wahlberg mad with their deceit--so the twist ending would be, "You told me you had dessert with him and now I found out youre having his baby!"  "But you seemed stressed otherwise I would have told you sooner, I just made up that part about the tiramisu."</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>"The Happening", like M. Night Shyamalan's superb "The Village", is yet another underrated film from a director, who has consistently produced one spectacular film after the other. I remain in the miniscule minority of people who actually liked "Lady in the Water", so perhaps you might want to keep that in mind before reading the rest of this review. Granted, some of his films are better than others. "Unbreakable", according to me, was a gigantic mis-step (though beautifully made), while "Signs" was a true blue masterpiece, and a classic in the science fiction genre.<br /><br />Which is why "The Happening" remains rather elusive and abstract, when held up against his back catalog. Its certainly science-fiction, especially since he predicts a world where our botanical friends overtake the universe and start killing humans, but the real twist is that nature eventually makes man completely self-destructive - not that we aren't already - to the point of voluntary suicide. Many of these suicides appear on-screen in rather graphic fashion - people walking in front of lawn-mowers, car accidents, jumping off buildings, shooting themselves - but they all feel rather plausible given the context.<br /><br />The only problem is with the casting, as Mark Wahlberg is actually a great actor who has had to 'dumb down' for a role such as this. This particular lead role requires the character to look 'continuously perplexed', and Wahlberg does so, but with a hint of irony and sarcasm, which I found rather disconcerting, especially since it seemed ill-fit in a film with rather serious undertones. Perhaps a bone-dead actor like Keanu Reeves would have done better here. I would have gone with Joaquin Phoenix, who stunned us all in "Signs" with his acting prowess.<br /><br />The Deschanel girl, who plays the lead female character, is a fine actress otherwise (and a fine musician as well), but her relationship with the main lead feels contrived and forced. Thankfully, this relationship doesn't form the base of the story, so we are pulled into the real issue of environmental mishap and the fury of the plant kingdom. Many critics have said that the lack of a perceptible 'villain' in this film, makes the entire outing seem weak and meandering. Well, that is in part true. Every Shyamalan film has had a true 'bad guy' in some form or the other, but here, the only villain is nature itself, and thats too vague of a concept to present on screen anyway. So we are treated of trees swaying in the breeze, etc, in the hope that we'd find this vision 'menacing' (all set to some dark violin music, of course). At times, this works well, and at others, not so much.<br /><br />"The Happening" is certainly an acquired taste. Alongwith "Unbreakable", its the least 'developed' film in the directors cannon, but its also riveting. I personally feel that its a bit ahead of its' time because its talking about issues that people feel are silly and ridiculous, which is why many of the episodes here seem unintentionally comical. Not so. With the right spirit and with a better understanding of whats happening in the world around us, this is easily a horror flick with the best thats out there.<br /><br />Certain characters, such as John Leguizamo, seem 'added on' with no actual benefit, but their presence makes sense a little down the film. Between the long 'escape sequences' and the truly harrowing scenes where the leads are trapped with a group in a field, wondering if they're going to die next, this is a superb commentary on science-fiction possibilities of the future on our planet. The climax, set in France, was especially interesting because it served as a warning of sorts.<br /><br />While you might have heard absolutely loathsome comments on "The Happening", it really is a little classic on its' own terms. The director knew what he was doing. There is a slow, fifteen minute portion of the film where the leads are hiding out in the house of a madwoman (played to perfection by Betty Buckley), but the mood of depression, solitude and impending insanity is captured so well. Watch it just for this long segment - its truly affecting.<br /><br />Four Stars. Not for everyone, but it clearly worked for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Ever heard this message?... "People better start taking better care of the environment or the environment will 'take care' of you!" If not you have a choice: You can watch and listen to the case Al Gore makes for a planet in trouble in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICL3KG">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, or you can watch The Happening...M. Night Shyamalan's fantasy about when plants and trees go wild.<br /><br />Al Gore at least makes a pretty good case for "cleaning up our act" here on Mother Earth. Of course there's the partisan Democrat/Republican thing getting in the way of Al's message.<br /><br />Then you have M. Night's version that needs some act cleaning up of its own. Marky Mark Wahlberg turns in his worst performance ever...even the horrible music that he made with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001Y5A">Marky Mark & The Funky Bunch</a> is easier to listen to than watching Wahlberg in The Happening. And Wahlberg gets absolutely zero redeeming value from his supporting cast.<br /><br />The story line is that vegetation rebels and develops a defense mechanism to stop humans for creating things that "are bad for the planet." The defense mechanism being an airborne toxin (I call it tree pollen...was this allergy season brutal or WHAT!) that makes people commit suicide in gruesome ways. The special effects of this are amazing to watch (sarcasm)!...Picture expansive shots of trees blowing in the wind. No the budget for this movie did NOT go over.<br /><br />This movie about trees that go to war with humans drags on for an hour and a half. Look, I even get the fact the Shayamalan meant this to be a sort of "B-esque" movie. But there was no dark humor, no humor and no unintentional humor. Usually you get one of the three in a B movie.<br /><br />If warring trees is something you'd like to fantasize about, I recommend a much shorter, 4 minute and 45 second listen to Rush's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1ZGDI">The Trees</a>. "There is unrest in the forest; there is trouble with the trees!" Skip The Happening.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Although "The Happening" may not be as affective as previous M. Night Shyamalan movies, it is still worth at least a rental. I am afraid I wasn't as happy with Mark Wahlberg's performance as I would have liked. I couldn't help wondering if someone else may have done a better job. In time this movie may be worth buying for the right price for it still beats out the overly bloody horrors in my book. To many of them no more that get you interested in a person before proceeding to hack them to pieces. It is true this certainly has some bloody scenes, but they are not gratuitous violence and they are used to further the plot. A couple known actors and the rest the cast are strangers. This helps us feel alone without preconceptions for the most part.<br /><br />People start killing themselves in large cities on the East coast. At first they believe it is a toxin released by terrorists that is the cause. Later many other theories are developed, but the one about plants  releasing a toxin seems the most likely. Watch out "Day of the Triffids". Well not quite, in fact I would have liked to seen some walking plants, but we just see the wind blowing them. Still fairly spooky, I found it entertaining enough to watch the whole movie even though Walhberg has limited range in acting. Good quality DVD with some replayability.

I have to give this film some credit because even though there isn't much happening on the surface in 'The Happening', it's an intriguing idea and I found myself interested throughout it's 90 minute running length.<br /><br /> I think most viewer's were expecting a different film. The story is fairly interesting, but that doesn't mean it's without it's flaws. It's not really as original as it seems as there have been tons of "nature strikes back" films and the performances aren't all that memorable, but it's worth a look if you have enough patience to sit through it.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />End-of-the-world scenarios have become such a cottage industry in recent years that M. Night Shyamalan's "The Happening" can't help but feel like a straggler to a party that`s already begun winding down.  In this case, the apocalyptic horseman comes in the form of a strange natural phenomenon which causes people to engage in mass suicides.  The usually reliable - but here way too over-earnest - Mark Wahlberg plays a high school science teacher who flees with his wife and the daughter of a friend from their home in New York City (where the plague begins) to a remote area of western Pennsylvania.<br /><br />As always, Shyamalan relies on subtlety and indirection rather than explicit violence and over-the-top special effects to achieve his thrills.  Yet, while there is a certain undeniable creepiness to some of the film, "The Happening" ultimately comes a cropper through annoying performances, lackluster storytelling, dopey dialogue and more laugh-out-loud moments than any ostensibly serious horror film should ever have to put up with.  It also doesn't help that "The Happening" feels like so many other recent movies that have come before it ("War of the Worlds," "I Am Legend," "Cloverfield," the "28 Day" series etc.) or that it pales in comparison to the much livelier, intentionally funny "The Signal" (albeit, in that film, the afflicted individuals were killing other people rather than themselves, making them a bit more of an actual threat).<br /><br />As seems to be the case with Shyamalan's most recent output, one winds up admiring "The Happening" much more than one likes it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>You don't have to be a major film fan to realize that writer/director M. Night Shyamalan basically has created movies that slowly go less and less into his first works The Sixth Sense in overall quality. But when it was announced that Fox wanted him to make his first ever "R" rated picture, would that be enough to break him out of his never-ending slump?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />The Happening stars Mark Walberg as a high school science teacher who among everyone else in his Pennsylvania suburb hears that an airborne biological terrorist attack has landed in New York causing it's victims to lose control and find a way to commit suicide. As residents flee towards help, soon they realize that this attack has spread over the Northeastern portion of the United States and that they're right in the middle of it. But is this plague manmade or of a more natural kind? Could it be caused by nature itself? Will anybody know or care after watching this dreck?!!?<br /><br />I doubt it. While "M" and this film try to be all scientific-like interesting, it truly falls amazingly flat. To be honest, this is M. Night's absolute worse film. First, the infected all basically do the same thing which is babble for a second, walk backwards, and find some way to kill themselves, all the while looking like they are still in complete control. Another is the dialouge. While the acting isn't all that great to begin with, I personally haven't heard words written this bad since some kid named Anakin was breaking some pregnant chick's heart. At times I truly felt more for myself watching this than for the victims screaming at the sight of seeing a brisk breeze of air flowing ever so calmly in front of them. Oh my God, WIND!!!!!<br /><br />However, an "R" rating does mean something had to earn it and in a small way it has. Some of the suicides are a bit clever, and yes, even reach R graphicness, but there's just not enough of them to save this movie. In fact, M. Knight himself (through interviews and deleted scenes) cut a few himself, not in fear of the MPAA, but out of thinking less is more. But trust me, the more the merrier really could have helped this fart of a flix. The disc itself does have alot of special features including deleted scenes (that are terrible), documentaries, and also a gag reel (that doesn't have one single blooper....where's the gag?). But no matter what he added to this presentation, nothing could change just how sophomoric and painfully lame this film is.<br /><br />An amazingly bad movie, without any of the style this director made with his first three films, avoid at all costs. You'll never look at a wind-blown tree in a park the same way again. Because it will now forever remind you of this lame blowhard of a movie.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:4.0/10)</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I understand this movie completely. It is an end of the world scenario that comes to life. Except mankind is not ending the world. It is the world ending mankind because we as humans have been "creating" too much hatred and violence. The world and planet is just sick of everything and ends those that are creating it. Mother Nature does have her "ways".</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>I don't think this is a particularly strong movie and it has a lot of gaps and hole in it . My bias? I"m a sucker for Shyamalan's work and I don't expect it to flow in a logical, plot-driven way. Some of his movies seem more like dreams that continue to evolve, sometimes to their darkest levels, and are played out in "real" life, but with a certain poetic quality.<br /><br />This movie is along those lines. Is it believable? Up to a point. People are worried about the environment but could an event, so self-limiting, actually happen? To fall under the director's spell, I think viewers need to suspend their sense of reality and accept the mystery and danger of life.<br /><br />In any case, I did enjoy this movie and found it evocative. 107 other people here on Amazon did not. So I dutifully note that I'm in the minority and may not be able to view Shyamalan's movies with objectivity. He speaks to those who believe that mysterious and even unseen forces could be at work in the world. I don't necessarily believe it but I can be creeped out enough by the thought when watching his movies</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>I'm noticing an interesting trend in Mr. Shyamalan's movies.  While the "threat" or "main issue" of the movie is often dramatic and horrifying, the dialogue and relationships of the characters are usually delicate and graceful.  There's a beautiful subtly to his movies that tug at your heart ever so gently.  All of his main characters have wounded souls that, somehow through the difficulty they confront in the course of the story, figure out their greatest strengths.  Not every ending is a perfect one and not every loose end is neatly tied and I wonder if that's why so many are walking away from his movies disappointed.  There's no bang-bang shoot em' up or excessive gratuitous sex in every scene.  I really walk away feeling connected to the people in his films.  They seem like everyday people (with the exception of a few supernatural powers in some of his films - lol) with everyday internal struggles and I like that.<br /><br />The Happening's characters are really no different than any of Mr. Shyamalan's other films, but the story is definitely different.  No one ever fully answers the question of what is happening, yet there is a perfectly scientific plausibility to the event.  I felt a myriad of emotions from fear and panic to being intrigued with how the story unfolded and ultimately how it ended.<br /><br />This was a good movie.  I think what so many viewers are dissatisfied with is M. Night Shyamalan's style.  He's a unique director and producer just like Quentin Terantino is... you either like his style or you don't.  The Happening was a great story with great characters and a lot of heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>The Happening "Happens" to be a very half @zzed  movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan he directed the 6th Sense which I like Unbreakable which I enjoy but he also directed Signs which if you see that movie you'll be like no wonder Mel Gibson's psycho now. Most recently he directed The Last Air Bender so his recent track record hasn't been good at all. Happening starring Mark Wahlberg as Elliot Moore & Mark this was your worst performance you have ever given. Zooey Deschanel as Alma Moore she was boring. John Leguizamo as Julian he has a daughter Jess played by Ashlyn Sanchez they give better perfomances even these 2 teenage actor that I've never heard of give better perfomances. Then you have Betty Buckly as Mrs. Jones. The movie starts off decent in Centeral Park & people are killing themselves. But boy oh boy does the idea of a neat interesting plot become a big cluster fv**  Elliot Moore is a High School Science teacher & his friend Julian works as a Math teacher they're told that some terrorist attack has happened & they need to evacate until it stops so Elliot his wife Alma, Julian & his daughter Jess are taking a train to get far away from the North East but the train has stopped cause it lost communication wtf? They leave these poeple stranded Julian decides to go to Princton NJ to find his wife. Now if you like John Leguizamo he dies. You like Mark Wahlberg he gives the worst performance. So there's a scene with this Soldier & he tells them that everybody offed thereselves at the base he's told that there are more people dead down the road his reaction is "Oh cheese & crackers." WTF? Then we have these 2 teen boys get there heads blown off with a shot gun. Then they go to this old ladies house Mrs. Jones definitly not how Billy Paul described her. Ok this lady is I don't care about her character at the dinner table that little girl Jess is going to get a biscuit & that b!**h  smacks her hand. Then the best part & this is on you tube type The Happening what no. This Lady is really mad at Marky Mark she says. "You plan on stealing from me." Marky Mark " No mam I'm not." Mrs.Jones: "Plan on murdering me in my sleep." Marky Mark. "What NOOOO." Oh & I was happy when Mrs. Jones died I don't care about her or pretty much anybody in the movie so why should. Ok the ending is decent Elliot & Alma adopt Jess & Alma is pregnet. But it shows the same thing "Happening." LOL in Europe. Mark Wahlberg this is the worst performance I've ever seen you give I mean I liked him in RM & Shooter. Zooey Daschanel bleh. Betty Buckly I don't care about John Leguizamo was decent Ashlyn Sanchez was decent too. People talk $#!* about The Blair Witch Project which was made on a shoestring budget & actors that at least came off as real people they weren't great but at least Heather Danahue, Josh Leonard & Michael Williams came off as real people. The Happening has a $48 million budget & just is pathetic & acting should be natural & Marky Mark gives a bad performance. Interesting idea terrible execution 1st they think it's terrorists then it's plants & trees communicate with each other then they communicate with insects then it's the air. People whined over The Expendables about Oh the plot wasn't deep at least it was straight forward. Good night this movie was awful but no wonder it was released by 20th Century Fox there recent track record hasn't been good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>There's a lot wrong with The Happening.<br /><br />At base, The Happening is a nightmarish parable about our crowded society in modern times.  We threaten the world, director M. Night Shyamalan seems to say, with our sheer numbers.  On the other hand, being completely isolated isn't the solution either, creating a suspicious, isolationist attitude that leads to a self-destructive spiral.<br /><br />But The Happening is mostly about watching people commit suicide in terrible ways.  This ranges from terrible echoes of 9/11, when workmen jump from a building to their death, to the cartoonishly absurd, when a zookeeper taunts a lion and it tears his arm off.  Anyone who watches the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet knows that big cats go for the neck first.<br /><br />Anyway, The Happening's premise is spooky: what if something in the wind made people commit suicide in the most immediate and awful way possible?  Where would you go?  What would you do?<br /><br />Night has all the elements of a good horror story: the aforementioned disaster, the strained relationship between Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his distant wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), and even an innocent little girl (Ashlyn Sanchez) thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The Happening should be a great horror film.  It's spooky.  The premise that a gust of wind could bring about a fatal, nightmarish end lends an ominous shadow to the events. We can expect plenty of drama, morally ambiguous choices, and desperate survival tactics as our protagonists flee for their lives from an alien foe.<br /><br />Actually, I was just describing Spielberg's War of the Worlds, which took the same premise and made a creepy, nuanced film about parents, children, and the distance between them. The two films have a lot in common: the insidious enemy that pops up out of nowhere, the little girl in distress, the long journey against all odds to a haven that might already have been destroyed.<br /><br />The Happening follows the same script but fails miserably on almost all counts. Oh, Night's got the scary part down.  But what carries a film like this is the emotional heft of characters brought to the brink.  Wahlberg does a workman-like job of trying to be clever and sarcastic, but the script forces him to spew mouthfuls of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook at a rapid fire pace that he can't keep up.  Deschanel, never a strong actress to begin with, is comedically awful.  There isn't the slightest romantic tension between her and Wahlberg.  And the little girl?  She barely says a word.<br /><br />The list of what's wrong goes on and on: citizens leave New York in an orderly fashion without snarling any mass transit; victims go to inordinate and improbable lengths to kill themselves; a father abandons his only child in a vain quest to find his wife; nobody seems to think traveling with a gas mask might be a good idea except two old ladies sitting at home.<br /><br />They're the smart ones.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Wow, over 115 1 star ratings for the Happening here on amazon?  I guess people didn't like the storyline, which mainly focused on a young couple running away from these poisonous plants that released a chemical making people kill themselves (in graphic ways in a few spots).<br /><br />No, don't worry, it's not what you're probably thinking- you don't actually SEE the plants turn violent with silly special effects and chase after people or anything like that- it's just that, whenever the wind would blow, people had to run for their lives.  Much of the storyline focused on the outside, especially the fields, while people were walking through them and trying to find a place to hide.  The kind of people the young couple met along the way brought a lot of entertainment to the story.<br /><br />And, SURPRISE, I happen to live in one of the areas where the plot was focused on, haha.  I guess I better start being nice to the plants around me then.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, having plants release something that would cause people to kill themselves leaves the door open for a lot of possibilities as far as storyline direction and creativity goes, and the Happening took advantage of this BIG time with lots of incredibly shocking scenes involving suicide and people showing no concern for their own lives because the toxin from the plants was controlling them, and in a way the people on the verge of suicide moved around like zombies.<br /><br />This movie did every single thing right to me- had a LOT of suspense, had a storyline that was easy to follow yet interesting enough to keep you guessing what would happen next, and the main characters were pretty good too (especially the guy).  I seriously don't get all the negativity for this movie because it was honestly good enough for me to rate it pretty highly and recommend it to others who might be interested in watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>Lifeless, morbid, absurd... One of the worst movies of the year.<br />One of its greatest sins, in my opinion, is that the director extracted some of worst perfomances EVER from every actor invovled in this presposterous mess. Highly NOT recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>The movie starts off very quickly, and you get a sense of urgency that things need to be done quickly for the cast of characters to be on the move.  Starting in NYC, and then in Philadelphia, you are taken on a bizzare ride and race for survival.  Mark Walberg does a superb job, as does Zooey Deschanel. It was nice to see John Lequizamo in a serious role.  He shows his ability to convince you he is a hiding his fear behind his strength, as he goes on a rescue mission for his wife.<br /><br />More gorey than any previous Shyamalan flick, this is really a bit off of what I expected.  His movies always have a bit of a surprise in them as well, where here, we follow the plot to its conclusion.  The scenes of self mutilation were thankfully few and mostly off screen, however, I think there is quite enough of that in society without any kind of epidemic.<br /><br />With the end, there is a sweet little old lady they run into who seems to have some very bizarre behavior issues.  It seemed that there were two issues at hand in the end, giving me a mixed idea of what the point was.<br /><br />Anyway, the premise itself, the enviroment turning on the only ones who really impact it, quite an idea.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Mark Wahlberg what were you thinking?  M. Night Shyamalan what were you thinking?  This one is just terrible.  No script, horrible acting, no meaningful plot...just an embarrassment to the director and to Mark.  The best part of the film is the artwork on the box...dead cars on a lonely highway.  Maybe that's what this should have been entitled.  Avoid at ALL cost.  I paid 1 cent (plus shipping) for this one and I still feel like I was totally ripped off.  I can't believe how bad this film was.  All I will remember is a wind machine blowing the leaves on trees...this one probably cost $500 to make...and that includes the special effects.  Shyamalan needs to hang it up...Wahlberg is much too good for this garbage.  I gave it ONE star because I couldn't give it a ZERO!  I feel like there was more depth in this review by me, than the entire script by M. Night.  GOODNIGHT M. Night.  I'll never give your future films another chance.  You truly laid a rotten egg with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>This is one of the spookiest films I've seen in recent years. A breeze comes up in Central Park, . . . and suddenly, people are walking off tall buildings, shooting themselves in the street, driving their cars into trees. Is it terrorists? No, actually, it appears to be a plot by trees and grass to rid the world of those pesky humans. Mark Wahlberg plays Elliot, a high school science teacher, who heads out of town with his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and the young daughter of his best friend, looking for a lightly inhabited area to hide out. (The plant plot initially affects large congregations of people, but it's working its way down to smaller and smaller groups.) There's a certain amount of confusion in the script, and I sort of expected a big "THE END?" in the last scene, but I'm going to be generous and assume Shyamalan was doing a homage to `50s science fiction film. SIXTH SENSE was terrific but SIGNS big time; this one is somewhere inbetween. The scary part comes mostly from the fact that there's no way you can protect yourself from the breeze, but there's some ironic humor, too: "It's plastic. I'm talking to a plastic tree. [pause] I'm still doing it." Not bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>Starts out interestingly enough, but becomes more boring and ridiculous as the movie goes on.

"People better start taking better care of the environment or the environment will 'take care' of you!" If not you have a choice: You can watch and listen to the case Al Gore makes for a planet in trouble in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICL3KG">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, or you can watch The Happening...M. Night Shyamalan's fantasy about when plants and trees go wild.<br /><br />Al Gore at least makes a pretty good case for "cleaning up our act" here on Mother Earth. Of course there's the partisan Democrat/Republican thing getting in the way of Al's message.<br /><br />Then you have M. Night's version that needs some act cleaning up of its own. Marky Mark Wahlberg turns in his worst performance ever...even the horrible music that he made with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001Y5A">Marky Mark & The Funky Bunch</a> is easier to listen to than watching Wahlberg in The Happening. And Wahlberg gets absolutely zero redeeming value from his supporting cast.<br /><br />The story line is that vegetation rebels and develops a defense mechanism to stop humans for creating things that "are bad for the planet." The defense mechanism being an airborne toxin (I call it tree pollen...was this allergy season brutal or WHAT!) that makes people commit suicide in gruesome ways. The special effects of this are amazing to watch (sarcasm)!...Picture expansive shots of trees blowing in the wind. No the budget for this movie did NOT go over.<br /><br />This movie about trees that go to war with humans drags on for an hour and a half. Look, I even get the fact the Shayamalan meant this to be a sort of "B-esque" movie. But there was no dark humor, no humor and no unintentional humor. Usually you get one of the three in a B movie.<br /><br />If warring trees is something you'd like to fantasize about, I recommend a much shorter, 4 minute and 45 second listen to Rush's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1ZGDI">The Trees</a>.

Night Shaymlian strikes out again with The Happening, which further shows what an over rated hack he is. The Happening does have an excellent premise which if given to a director like Frank Darabont could have easily been an excellent psychological thriller like last year's overlooked The Mist. Mark Wahlberg who happens to be one of my favorite actors provides one of his worst performances since The Truth About Charlie. Wahlberg displays no chemistry with Zooey Deshunal and watching the movie it's as if all the actors were method acting. There are two redeeming things about The Happening though; the first is the short running and the second is a scene involving a lawn mower. I wont's give any details about the scene other than it's one of the funniest on screen deaths of the year. Wahlberg will have a chance to redeem himself later this year with the video game adaptation Max Payne; as for Shamilan unless his makes a mini series about New Edition it'll be hard for me to ever support any of his movies again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Happening starring Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel is a film by M Night Shyamalan. This film is silly but so much more watchable than his last two films. The acting from Wahlberg is over the top, I have never seen him this loopy and inconsistent. Some of the scenes push the envelope, some work and some don't. This thriller is a mixed bag for me, decide for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Say what you will about The Sixth Sense (one of my favorite movies), you can't deny: it set new standards for mystery/suspense films world wide. Any thriller on topic of ghosts or supernatural events or Schizophrenia or anything you'd find in a thriller (Even Untraceable, which was a good movie) would have AT LEAST a BIT of inspiration of The Sixth Sense. And lo and behold, the ugly stepsister from the same director: The Happening. OK, so, M. Night Shyamalan has directed TSS, Unbreakable, Signs (which I thought was OK but slightly disappointing), The Village (Awful movie), Lady in the Water, and now The Happening.<br /><br />Judging from what you see in the beginning of the movie, something strange is happening- a bunch of people commiting suicide in gruesome and depressing ways. The film evolves into a drama about a family being hit by the same situation. they get evacuated and board a train, and they find out that they have to walk to escape. They soon find out that a Toxin has been released, causing these people to kill themselves.<br /><br />OK, so, the storyline is interesting, yes. But then the whole "family drama" part is where the fil starts to take a downhill slide. None of us know much about these people, and they aren't developed enough. We can't see why we should respect these characters or hope they'll survive. It's just like any other disaster film.<br /><br />I may be a little generous to give it 3 stars but let me tell you why- You know M. Night Shyamalan tried. He stopped trying to create the most shocking twist ending, and he put forth a cool storyline. The death scenes are pretty cool- very gory and disturbing. The lawnmower scene is pretty gnarly, the arm ripping off scene is a big "WHOA" moment, and the "Hairpin" scene is what sets the disturbing bang for the movie.<br /><br />So if you can give this movie credit for what it tried, you may enjoy it. But truth is, this is The Sixth Sense's ugly stepsister, no doubt about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>I have to admit that I was reluctant to watch this film. Inundated with previews for the film prior to its release, talk of how director M. Night Shyamalan was the next best thing since John Carpenter when it came to horror and a personal recommendation that it was bad made me stop. But when it came in I decided to watch it anyway. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The film starts in New York, Central Park where people suddenly stop in their tracks. The silence is chilling and what follows even more so as people begin to harm themselves.<br /><br />Move to Philadelphia and a high school where science teacher Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is teaching a group of students about the effects of change in nature. Called out of the office, the teachers are told there has been an apparent airborne attack in New York, possibly by terrorists.<br /><br />As people try and rush out of the big city to avoid a second attack, Moore meets up with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his daughter Jess. Elliott and Alma are in the midst of a relationship crisis that Julian has seen coming, feeling cold towards her since he and Elliott are friends.<br /><br />The airborne pathogen seems to be spreading, hitting more and more major metropolitan areas. As the train taking our travelers reaches a small town outside of the major city, it stops. The reason why? No one is answering their calls up and down the line. This is the last stop.<br /><br />Julian hears that the city his wife was headed for was hit and sets out to find her leaving Jess in the care of Elliott and Alma. What he finds when he reaches his destination is gruesome and startling and its effect on him chilling.<br /><br />Elliott's group carries on and they find a ride. But when they come to a crossroads, cars are coming from all directions, each one with the revelation that further on down the road are people who have been killed. Setting out on foot, it is Elliott who learns the secret of how this is happening, based in part on what one of his fellow travelers said early on.<br /><br />To tell you the cause of this event would be to spoil the surprise. Myself, I knew and it didn't faze me. If you don't want to know, stop reading now.<br /><br />It turns out the cause of the entire even was Mother Nature taking back what is hers, the planet. The airborne pathogen is not man made nor launched as a terrorists attack. It is a compound emitted by the plants that blocks the receptors in the brain that help man from harming himself. Once gone, it also increases their desire for self destruction, thus the mass deaths as a result of suicide.<br /><br />Elliott realizes that the attacks from the plants are focused on only large groups of people. Split into smaller groups, their chances of survival increase. But even then they have to face each other and the fears of who is to blame.<br /><br />Scenes of self destruction and death run rampant and may upset a few viewers. Gore hounds will be disappointed they don't go further. But the fear instilled here of an unseen enemy with no form of defense against it makes for a truly frightening film.<br /><br />Wahlberg is showing that he has the chops to become a great actor. The true gift is when an actor is so immersed in the character that you don't think of him as that celebrity but as that character. Wahlberg is becoming that sort of thespian. The rest of the cast holds up equally well, although Deschanel's character is offered little to do until near the end of the film.<br /><br />This film has taken hits left and right by critics and fans alike. I'll admit that its not the greatest film ever made. But it harkens back to the days of the end of the world films from the 50's that had some unknown creature or fear that caused man to panic and lose track of what was important. It made me think back to those scary films that relied on emotions instead of gore related effects to induce fear.<br /><br />The movie lives in that world, a world where the unknown boogie man, the creature that never raises its head until it attacks, the monster in the closet that is never seen lives. To think that nature itself could decide that it had had enough, that man was the disposable entity in this world that could be removed, is a terrifying thought.<br /><br />Shyamalan may not equal Carpenter in my eyes (I'm a big John Carpenter fan) but he does seem to have a knack for making ones skin crawl. This was a nice change after my disappointment in THE VILLAGE. If you're looking for a truly creepy film for a month when those sorts of films are sought out, this one should foot the bill.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6OI36USYOU1.html">A3D6OI36USYOU1</a><br/><p>OK, this is hilarious. A theatrical release that was generally panned by critics and rated a generous 2.5 stars by Amazon reviewers has already been pulled in favor of notice of the blockbuster DVD release scheduled for October 7. Can you feel the excitement? haw haw haw<br /><br />In case you missed it, or haven't heard what a monumentally bad and historically stupid flick this actually is, here is the summary as best as I can remember because I slept through most of the screening on the day of its release..... a sudden ill wind blows in allegedly carrying a deadly toxin released by the American Eastern Time Zone Federation of Angry Plants (AESTFAP), people become paralyzed, walk backwards, then begin to murder themselves (come on, these are NOT suicides) in the most gruesome manner available. Mark Wahlberg is introduced as a science teacher with an aloof wife (Zoey Deschanel) who remains aloof in spite of all the deathmurdercides going on all around her and the adjacent area codes. There is some mild scurrying about as Wahlberg and a few others attempt to figure out what is actually occuring, and as our hero is leading a small band of devotees to safety spontaneously breaks into a Doobie Bros tune to prove to a madman with a shotgun that "Everything is OK!" Well, everything's not OK cause shotgun go boom boom (advise your children to look away please).<br /><br />Actually, your children shouldn't be watching and you shouldn't either actually unless you are a one of these weird Shamalamadingdong "fans" I've been reading about or unless you're writing a paper on Bad Moviemaking 101. You see, the problem with this movie, aside from the bad acting and lack of a script, is that there is no villain, the Joint Chiefs aren't mobilized, there is no threat assessment, there's really not much of anything you can sink your teeth into except a ridiculous speculation that "the plants are ticked off and now they're fighting back!" Absurd right, and it ends just as it begins...stupidly.<br /><br />I am hopeful that the mucketymucks finally put this hack Shyamalbomb out of bidness. His films have gotten increasingly worse since the Sixth Sense (which some consider to be semi-overrated) and its time to just say NO to this clown. Go ahead and neg away, I'm doing a public service. 1 Pistule</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>(3.5 stars out of 5)<br /><br />The Good Things<br />*Video/sound quality is pretty good.  Picture is a little grainy, but it is not overwhelming.<br />*Includes some featurettes, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.<br />*The movie itself has a very good filming style.  The cameramanship is splendid.  It is particularly interesting how the camera shows the violence in a way that is not too graphic; I think its better that way.<br />*As I recall hearing, this is the first horror film shot entirely in daylight.<br />*This film does have its scary, freaky moments.  Some parts genuinely thrilled me.  It also had some dry witty moments as well, and some upbeat parts that provides some contrast to an otherwise dreary film.<br />*The premise is interesting (even if it is never fully explained what or why all of this is happening).  The script/story has some interesting concepts, such as the relationship between science, math, nature, and humanity. Possibly some allegories between the characters and modern society.  The story is not bad.<br />*Most people seem to think that the characters/writing/acting is horrid.  I don't really see why; the writing is just as good and interesting as any other movie by M. Night Shyamalan.  The characters are emotional, expressive, and rather touching.  The acting seemed good to me.<br />*The settings are used quite effectively.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not for kids or the extremely squeamish; contains some swearing and violence, including one or two bloody scenes (rated R).<br />*The plot is kind of weird, and ends a little abruptly.<br />*One or two laughable moments (although most people seem to think there are lots of laughable moments).<br />*Slowly paced (although not as bad as some of the other Shyamalan movies, like "The Village").<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*It is never fully revealed what causes the events or why.  I think it's good that way, because it corresponds to the movie's idea that people can never truly explain natural phenomenon.  But it may also be a dissapointment if you were expecting a straight answer.<br />*Other aspects of the characters and plot are never fully revealed either, and can only be found out by paying close attention or by watching the extras on the disc.<br /><br />Wow, this movie sure has a bad wrap, and I don't know why.  Were you expecting another "6th Sense" movie (again)? Then go watch "The 6th Sense." "The Happening" is another totally different title in Shyamalan's repertoire, and shouldn't really be put in the same league as his first breakthrough film.  This one has no major plot twist.  It has a straightforward story.  It has no oscar-award-winning performances.  It's simply an apocalyptic thriller, on the same level as Spielburg's "War of the Worlds" or Frank Darabont's "The Mist." To say that this is anything more is obviously a misconception, but I don't think it deserves to be considered something less.  To do so would be to say that Shyamalan is as bad of a director as Uwe Boll, and I don't think he deserves that.<br /><br />I thought that this was just as good of a movie as anything else by Shyamalan (although no better than anything else he made either).  I think it had some interesting elements, ideas, characters, and camerawork.  Some parts of it may even make you think (but it is not wholly obvious in the script; you have to really think about it in order to appreciate it).  If you have any interest in his work or intelligent filmmaking in general, give it a try by all means.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>My favorite movies are about the breakdown of society and how easy it can breakdown.

It is some accomplishment for a struggling director to Diversify himself into a group of audience limited in its capabilities by law of its Adult rating, and does it benefit from unadulterated suspense and a passionate attempt to be accepted for such by new and old fans? I would say the intent is there yet the zeal and outright pleasure in making cinema has been degraded from my position as audience member.

Night Shyamalan broke into Hollywood with Sixth Sense and was immediately considered one of the top, young directors in Hollywood.  This was soon followed by Unbreakable, a movie that cemented Bruce Willis as one of the top actors of the 1990s.  It was also a breakthrough film for the comic-book genre.  Then came Signs and the Village, two films that though still innovative and original, had many detractors.  Finally, it seems Mr. Night's magic has run out.  Lady in the Water barely broke even at the box office, and then came the outright bomb, The Happening.  Starring two familiar, but not blockbuster names, this movie adds a twist to a well-worn genre.  A plague has hit the northeastern section of the US that causes people to commit suicide.  The movie then follows a married couple's run from the plague.  Clues are dropped throughout the movie as to the source of the plague, plants.  Quite an original idea; sounds like a great premise for a great suspense, thriller, or horror movie.  This movie is none of those.  From the opening scene, the movie is quite apparent that something is up with the plants.  And of course the plants are seen swaying in the wind right before people start committing suicide - all throughout the movie.  So there goes the suspence, the foreboding, the fear of the unknown.  Even worse is the acting.  Both Ms. Daschaniel and Mr. Wahlberg look totally fake in their roles.  So all in all, a total letdown.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>If you go into "The Happening" expecting an American style horror/disaster flick, you're bound to be disappointed.  What you want from that kind of film are massive explosions, car crashes, tornadoes, zombies or monsters or ghosts, and big budget special effects, all tied together into some kind of coherent narrative with escalating action, leading to a climax in which (usually) the hero saves the world (or at least the local community) and achieves some kind of much needed reconciliation with his/her family.<br /><br />While there are elements of all that in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZOC6Y">The Happening</a>, what you really get here is something else, more subtle and strange, that alternates between the utterly mundane and the overblown melodramatic, between everyday moments and terrifying extremes.  There isn't really a sense of escalating action, but more inaction punctuated with crisis situations.  For the most part the feeling is sustained by a subtly creepy intensity mixed with moments of somewhat silly, interrupted by a few sudden and inexplicable and gory moments, inventive acts of self-destruction, all designed to shock and amuse.  If you go into this expecting something else, the style here can look like incompetence.  What struck me watching it the first time in theaters and even more on subsequent viewings in the home is that this is much more like a Japanese than American style horror film.  M. Night Shyamalan effectively made a "J-horror" flick.  Many of the very same features that some were bugged by in this film appear in spades in "J-Horror" films and are accepted as cultural oddities - I think there is a greater tolerance for unconventional stylings when they appear in a foreign language.  I suspect that if this had been an Asian film with subtitles, but otherwise identical, many critics who panned it would have proclaimed it brilliantly ironic and inventive.<br /><br />In J-horror (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000088NQR">Ringu</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009KA2UO">Dark Water</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CC885">Suicide Club</a>, or, even better, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E0OE4O">Pulse</a>) the focus tends to be on ordinary people, caught up in an inexplicable and seemingly supernatural situation, usually where some kind of force is out to avenge itself for some offence and doesn't really care who suffers, only cares that they suffer.  Part of what generates dread in these films is that the audience is aware of a real and potent threat, that the protagonists only gradually come to accept as real.  Moreover, it quickly becomes apparent there is no escape, and the threat is uncaring and implacable.  These films usually aren't plotted in the so-called "Hollywood style," where a character must act to face up to an escalating challenge that is both broadly significant and deeply personal.  In J-horror, the ultimate outcome is just not up to the characters.  They can't rise to the challenge, and the escalating dread comes from the fact that their efforts eventually come to nothing.  If they end up escaping, that is as inexplicable as the initial danger; while they may resolve personal issues, the larger issue represented by the threat remains unresolved.  While the story itself often meanders and reactions often alternate between overblown and understated, what ties it together are a series of horrific images, that are not so much explicit as highly suggestive.  Anyone who's seen "The Happening" should recognize that it fits easily with this general pattern - Frank Darabont's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010X745K">The Mist</a> works along similar lines, but is closer to conventional horror film expectations.<br /><br />Where the film deviates from the general framework is in its fairly unambiguous (pseudoscientific) explanations of the ultimate grounds of the inexplicable happenings.  Still, if it is blunt in its environmental message, it is also bluntly ironic about the likelihood of any changes taking place as a result of the kind of massive ecological catastrophe depicted here.  I found it to be a lot of fun to watch, and when I saw it again with my wife, we were both entertained.  My sense is that much of the disappointment about Shyamalan comes from expecting him to make the usual kind of Hollywood blockbuster films, when what he really does best is something more akin to American independent and foreign horror films.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>While I usually like M. Night Shyamalan's work, this was bad.  I also love Mark Wahlberg, but while he was my (only) highlight, he couldn't make me like this one.  It was impossibly and ridiculously bad.<br />Basically, Mark and his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and the daughter of a co-worker are literally running against the wind to try and save themselves from a strange and disturbing thing/phenomena that takes over peoples minds and makes them kill themselves.  At first it was assumend that it might be a terrorist attack, but with more and more people commiting suicide, it becomes clear that it's something else entirely.  I was so looking forward to watching this because the storyline to me, seemed enticing, but it wasn't and if I wasn't laughing at the stupidity of it all (the dialogue and the acting etc) then I was close to sleep with boredom.<br />Trust me, even if you are a fan of Shyamalan's work, this will surely disappoint.  If I were you, I'd wait until it was shown for free on TV and even then I'm not so sure.  Sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>"The Happening" is just another piece in the growing mountain of evidence that M. Night Shyamalan is a horrifically overrated moviemaker.  I have been duly unimpressed with some of his earlier efforts, but this one takes the proverbial cake.  Bad acting, a bad storyline, an anemic cast, and a heavy dose of left-wing eco-propaganda all combine to make this an eminently forgettable story -- except for the indelible scar that it has left on my beleaguered psyche.  There's really no need to say much more.  Other reviewers have already told more than we really need to know.  In an effort to set this one in proper context, however, I will conclude by noting that "Plan 9 From Outer Space" has found a soulmate.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>This is actually a pretty creative movie.  It's much different from your typical frightfest.  It actually has a much more real feel.  Many times during the film I thought of how terrifying it would be to see such a mass of suicide where nobody knew the cause.<br /><br />I do think it would have been better to leave the cause unidentified than to tie it in with a liberal environmentalist message, but I'm able to look past the whole plant thing and enjoy something different for a change.  Refreshing to see some horror that didn't involve a mindless schmuck parading around with a weapon.  But you know, there's a huge audience for that sort of thing apparently, and they must never get tired of it, as evidenced by all the negative reviews posted here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>I guess I can see why many film enthusiasts don't like "The Happening" very much.  After the rich visuals and truly "out there" stories of "Unbreakable", "Signs", and, of course "The Sixth Sense", this one feels a little stark and one-note, both thematically and visually.  In the former category, this is simply a story of nature rebelling against man.  Yes, there's some mystery (how far exactly will nature go?), but basically it's a movie about characters running through fields trying to escape toxin-laden winds.  On the latter front, the visuals offer no moody shadows, no scary night scenes, nothing but bright sunlight.  That's a brave and certainly credible choice in some ways (Stanley Kubrick, for example, deliberately filmed "The Shining" as a brightly lit movie to avoid the visual cliches of most onscreen horror), but unless other aspects of your story are rich and complex, sunshine and bright lighting probably aren't the most interesting ways to go in the suspense/horror genre.<br /><br />But having said all that, the movie is still sufficiently creepy and scary, and we care enough about the characters (especially the neurotic but endearing couple played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) to stay emotionally invested in the proceedings.  It's also interesting to see Mr. Shyamalan offer up a hard R-rated film, though one can argue that his previous PG-13 limitations forced him to shock us more creatively and subtly.<br /><br />In the end, if you like movies like "The Birds", "The Mist", the thousand or so entries in the "zombies vs. mankind" genre, or any number of other movies about a sudden scary phenomenon confronting humanity, with people having to pool together to address the crisis or just survive, you'll probably find "The Happening" compelling and entertaining enough. By my own rankings, it isn't nearly as "must see" as the Shyamalan movies mentioned at the outset, but a little more satisfying than the director's more recent efforts like "The Village" and "Lady in the Water" (though those have their merits, too).  It's a pretty good horror movie, no more and no less.<br /><br />Oh, yes-- it also helps that, at pretty much exactly 90 minutes, "The Happening" doesn't overstay its welcome.  One can't accuse Mr. Shyamalan of believing his story is so important that it needs lots of time to fully tell.  He gets you in and out quick.<br /><br />The standard DVD of "The Happening" features breathtaking picture and sound (it's amazing how good standard DVDs look when real effort goes into their making), and a nice selection of extra features that take you behind the scenes of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>It seems as though Night's movies are getting worse and worse. Almost 10 years ago, he soared into popularity with the highly original and engaging "The Sixth Sense". He followed up with "Unbreakable" which wasn't quite as good, but was still very engaging. "Signs", in my opinion, was on equal terms with "The Sixth Sense" and is one of my favorite Shyamalan films.<br /><br />Then came "The Village" and "The Lady In the Water". Both films were OK and had an original premise, but they both fell flat when it came to true suspense and the infamous "twist" ending.<br /><br />Well, here comes "The Happening" which seems to be completely devoid of a point. There is no "twist" ending and no plot resolution. Things happen and then they stop HAPPENING.<br /><br />>>> POSSIBLE SPOILER &lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />OK, OK. I get the "message" of the film. Man is ruining the earth, so now the earth is fighting back. So, now what?<br /><br />The story pulls you in and you really feel for the characters which makes you anticipate some sort of climax or resolution, but instead, we get a blank screen and the credits roll.<br /><br />Come on, Night. We know you can do it. Thrill us again. Stop trying to deliver your "messages" and just entertain us. That's what we really like.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Okay, I LOVED M. Night Shyamalan's movies "The Sixth Sense" & "Unbreakable" beyond words as both movies were excellent! I've been sorely disappointed with each film M. Night Shyamalan has been associated with since including "Signs", "The Village", & "Lady in The Water"!<br /><br />However, M. Night Shyamalan's end of the world movie/apocalyptic film, "The Happening", has to be his all time worst film to date hands down. The storyline sucked, the acting was lukewarm at best and I found the majority of the characters to be annoying!! The only interesting performance was played by Betty Buckley in her role as Mrs. Jones (the isolated/crazy woman in the middle of nowhere).</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>It doesn't seem like it was that long ago that M. Night Shyamalan was being regarded as the next best thing in film making.  After crafting smashing flicks like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, it seemed as Shyamalan couldn't do wrong.  Then we had The Village and Lady in the Water; end of story.  Maybe that's why I looked so forward to The Happening, as it seemed as if Shyamalan may have re-discovered what made his films so good in the first place.  Heavily marketed as being his first R-rated film, The Happening is instead mammothly disappointing as a horror film or paranoid thriller, and for it's relatively brisk running time, just seems to meander along.  Mark Wahlberg stars as a science teacher in a failing marriage who, along with his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher (John Leguizamo) go on the run when a toxin hits the air, causing people to kill themselves.  While The Happening gets off to a great start with some wonderfully creepy and graphic moments, it loses its momentum as the story drags on.  It doesn't help that Wahlberg and Deschanel are miscast either, and in the end we just don't care about the characters at all.  Still though, Shyamalan manages to inject enough disturbing imagery into the film to be able to get under your skin, and suggests that maybe he's looking to get into an edgier kind of film making instead of the tried and true "PG-13 with a twist at the end" kind of deal.  All in all, The Happening isn't an entirely horrible film (and much better than Lady in the Water mind you), but it's still a disappointing endeavor from a once heralded director.  Still, it could just be a step in the right direction.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan's movies appear to get progressively worse since THE SIXTH SENSE.  This movie begins out of nowhere and ends the same way. Explanations of what is happening or what has happened are almost non-existent and there is no credibility for anything that is happening.  Various issues and features brought into the story, such as a mood ring, separating families, the selective nature of "the happening" all turn out to be irrelevant . . they are never developed in the film.<br /><br />Shyamalan has obviously been trying to cash in on his one and only successful film and watching this one, and hoping for something remotely resembling THE SIXTH SENSE, is an exercise in frustration and disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan is known for his highly atmospheric melodramas with supernatural overtones.  Think "The Sixth Sense," "The Village," and "Signs."  The director's newest film, "The Happening" -- his first R-rated effort -- bears his trademark creepy moments, mysterious occurrences, shocks, and outright creepiness.<br /> One day, in Central Park, masses of people become disoriented, stop dead in their tracks, and walk backwards.  Nearby, at a high-rise construction site, workers plummet to their deaths one after another as they walk off the girders above.  Something very unusual is happening, but no one knows what.  The first guess is a terrorist attack.  After all, it is New York City, and memories of 9/11 are still vivid.<br /> High school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is summoned to a meeting of the staff and informed of the happening.  Elliot, wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), colleague and friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) decide things will be safer outside the city and board a train to Pennsylvania.  As the train makes its way to Philadelphia, cellphone calls to folks on the crowded train reveal that the odd behavior is spreading.  Is it terrorism, radioactive leakage from a nuclear power plant, a freak air-based virus?<br /> "The Happening" plays very much like an episode of the original "Twilight Zone."  It has that somber, foreboding quality and draws us in immediately with a sensationally effective opening sequence that is both riveting and shocking.  Shyamalan incorporates a number of reaction shots of individuals observing the devastating behavior of their friends and co-workers, so that we experience the horror through their eyes.  Shyamalan's Everyman is Elliot, who is conveniently a science teacher so that he can cobble together a plausible speculation about what's happening all over the East Coast.<br /> Wahlberg does a fine job of being both the average Joe caught in an extraordinary situation and the guy who manages to avoid succumbing to whatever it is that's affecting human beings.  Could this be vegetation -- trees, bushes, plants -- forming chemical defenses against man for decades of polluting the planet?  Some of his conclusions may not be 100-percent accurate, but they're good enough to keep him, Alma, Jess, and a few others they meet along the way alive when others are dying around them in gruesome, self-inflicted ways.<br /> The movie has its problems.  From a superb beginning, it bogs down and drags when it should be bristling with suspense.  For its R rating, it is surprisingly timid in its visuals.  We hear, for example, about horrendous things happening in surrounding areas, but seldom see them.  Why?  This isn't a radio play.  It would have been far more effective to show assorted examples of man's fatal disorientation in montage format, thus enhancing the scope and grimness of the unknown outbreak.  Starting with a brutal intensity, "The Happening" eases into a road trip to nowhere, as the ranks of the survivors thin and Elliot and a few others seem destined to be the last living humans on earth.<br /> Late in the film, Shyamalan introduces the character of Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley), a reclusive eccentric bordering on psychotic.  Her presence in the film is puzzling.  She provides some creepy moments, but they lead to dead ends.  There's nothing wrong with a red herring, but it has to misdirect.  The Mrs. Jones character is simply a curiosity and fails to provide any new information or advance the plot.<br /> Shyamalan likes control.  He is credited as writer, director, and one of the film's three producers.  So on his shoulders rests the responsibility of fashioning a complete, effective motion picture, not merely a series of clever episodes.  The film is reminiscent of those 1950's sci-fi films where some prehistoric beast comes to terrorize and destroy a major city and mankind has to organize quickly to destroy it.  The concept worked for over a decade.  "The Happening" wants to depart from this formula by making the threat more intangible and thus more frightening.  How can you confront an enemy when you don't know what that enemy is?  A good idea, but two-thirds of the way through we become tired of wondering what the "thing" is that is causing people to become suicidal.<br /> Shyamalan loves The Big Secret -- a major plot point he withholds from viewers until a crucial, climactic point.  It worked beautifully in "The Sixth Sense," far less effectively in "Unbreakable."  "The Happening" falls somewhere between these two films in effectiveness.  It needs a wallop of an ending.  Instead, it ends in an anticlimactic whimper.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg, "Contraband") is teaching high school science and talks to his students about an article where bees have been vanishing and how this could affect the world in drastic ways. Soon after this a mysterious breeze hits New York, specifically Central Park where people start to kill themselves (one lady even jabs a pen into her neck) and from then on it seems clear that the planet is quite unhappy with how people have been and are currently treating it so why not create something that causes us to lose our will to live.<br /><br />Elliot and his somewhat jaded wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel, "(500) Days of Summer") along with a few others try to escape to safety and stay alive despite all this chaos. They go through the nearby countryside where Elliot keeps trying to find ways to simply explain what is happening to the planet and why people are doing what they're doing. The pro-earth propaganda just is sickening, the story is just plain silly, no scares, not good acting by anyone, people just run off and do their own thing which is usually the dumbest thing. Like when Elliot's friend Julian (John Leguizamo, "Moulin Rouge") goes into the city to get his loved ones despite knowing he has no chance to make it, once a hole is punctured in the roof of the car, the bad air gets in and soon after he thankfully off's himself.<br /><br />Watching this load of you know what from director M. Night Shyamalan is just so hard to endure. Shyamalan has made good movies like "The Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable" and even "Signs" wasn't too bad, however he's also made bad, bad flicks like "The Village" and "The Last Airbender". "The Happening" falls into a whole new category of bad, its another of the movies that's on a list of ones I totally loathe and hate.<br /><br />Its not a smart, clever flick, its boring, badly paced, really poorly written and really makes the viewer lose their will to live, or maybe that's just how I felt while watching it. 1/2 out of 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>I have to shamefully admit something here: I'm an M. Night junkie. I love just about everything he's done. Yes, even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JU7KAE">Lady in the Water</a>, which had a heartfelt message at its core and a great actor (Paul Giamatti) leading the way. And there were at least some creepy creatures in it. Lots of things were "happening."<br /><br />Unfortunately, you can't say the same thing for THE HAPPENING (I've given it the unfortunate new title of "The Unhappening").<br /><br />Let's see ...where to begin...<br /><br />I guess the story is as bad a place as any...<br /><br />First off, if you're going to make a thriller, it needs to be scary. The Happening isn't. The story has an enemy that we never see. And although unseen enemies can be psychologically frightening if done right (a bit of a caveat), they can be hard to pull off. The simple fact that not only was The Happening's main antagonist(s) not in the least frightening, it was seriously lame and completely unbelievable as to how the main protagonist comes to understand how it's "chasing them."<br /><br />Second problem...<br /><br />Acting. Although I'm no die-hard fan of Mark Wahlberg (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQI">The Departed</a>), I have enjoyed previous films with him as a main character. But here he pulls in a very wooden and careless performance. Perhaps the script stymied him, perhaps not. But I think the bad script/story is definitely to blame, because also in the cast were John Leguizamo (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGB6LO">Ice Age</a>) and Zooey Deschanel (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7UG3O">Failure to Launch</a>), both of which I consider high prizes in Hollywood and often underused. Their stilted line deliveries ("Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it!") and equally wooden performances seem to point toward story problems of epic proportions.<br /><br />The final stone...<br /><br />I'll cast the final stone and mention the complete lack of anything approaching a character we can sympathize or identify with. Again, pretty much a script/story problem. People die. They fall off buildings, stab themselves with hair pins, allow themselves to be run over by a riding mower, hang themselves, crash their cars, and die in fairly gruesome fashion (earning the film it's first R rating for M. Night). And I think this is where he screwed up. He must've equated gruesomeness with theatrical tension, but that wasn't the case. There needs to be a human element to the story and up until now, M. Night has been able to deliver it.<br /><br />But here, it just ain't "happening."</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>In the opening, people start committing suicide randomly, finding strangely violent cinematic ways to dispatch themselves - and they haven't even seen this film yet. Cut to Marky Mark, a high school teacher in Philly who is making his kids fail their SATs by filling their heads with nonsense about disappearing bees. Are the bees related? What do you think? When the news of this potential bio-terrorist attack hits the school, Mark decides for some reason to get on a train with his not-quite-clear-how-estanged wife. More deaths follow, the train stops en route.<br /><br />A bunch of third-tier characters kill themselves in imaginatively gruesome ways and Mark uses his science teaching skills to figure out the virus is highly communicable and travels through the air. Genius. A botanist whom he happens across tells him: it's the plants - they've had enough of our non-recycling polluting ways and oak trees are throwing the kill switch on humans. And he believes that. So what better way to escape than with a bunch of strangers spending the next 20 minutes of screen time walking across a field? More people die, surprisingly enough, and their group gets ever-smaller. Wahlberg's performance here spawned a series of sketches in SNL where he talks to chickens and road signs, it's just that good.<br /><br />Finally they reach the house of a crazy old hermit woman who harasses the hell out of them, forcing some high school-level acting from almost everyone in the same scene. She dies too. In a relationship moment, Mark's wife tells him about some tiramisu she ate with another guy and wonders if that's cheating. The next day, they leave the house and mysteriously the virus has completely gone, just like the $10 from my wallet and *just like a scientist on a TV report at the beginning said it would*. They live.<br /><br />In the epilogue set in Paris (the first time M has stepped outside of Philly for a long time), stereotypical French people are walking next to the Eiffel Tower, carrying baguettes and garlic and probably smoking too. They start to kill themselves, just like in the film's opening in Central Park. The wind is heard through the trees as The Happening continues. This summary just saved you two hours. You're welcome.</p></br></body></html>

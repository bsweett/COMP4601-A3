I needed to watch something light after 'Rescue Dawn' and this fit the bill. Over-talented cast in a B-movie (John Travolta, William B Macy, John McGinley, Marisa Tomei). 3-stars, but that's 2-stars for the movie and an extra star just for Tomei, who still looks great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Wild Hogs was better than I expected, some good laughs and hijinx. John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy are the "wild hogs" who are childhood friends going through mini life-crisis of their own. Ray Liotta also stars but he doesn't play one of the good guys, he steals this film as usual.

I don't think too many people would have thought about this combination of actors and surprisingly they all work well together.  Lawrence was somewhat tamer than normal and believe me that is a good thing.  Travolta gets caught over acting quite a bit, and Macy and Allen were spot on.  Together though these four actors find their mojo and create one fun movie.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>I originally judged this movie as another mid life crisis movie. After getting the chance to watch this movie I must admit I was completly wrong. This movie is great. It's a fun comedy with great chemistry between the actors.<br /><br />The adventure starts by introducing all four characters. Tim Allen, John Travolta, William Macy, and Martin Lawerence. Each character brings something special to the movie. I can say most of the movie I was laughing at loud because most of the humor is physical. There isn't a deep involved storyline so you don't have to worry about keeping track of much.<br /><br />I would say this movie can be viewed by the entire family as it has few profanities and very little physical violence that is mainly comical. It is really one of the best comedies this year and should be a must view for anyone who wants a good laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>What started as a gay-joke laced Tim Allen comedy quickly turned into a disastrous problem-laden situation comedy which fell into the age old trap of seriousness. When the conflict is too colossal, the only solution is nonsense. A variegated cast and an unrealistically neat and tidy conclusion make this wannabe feel-good movie second-class salvage.<br /><br />Four middle-aged friends (Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy) reach a midlife crisis in which they are bored with their everyday routines and threadbare family activities. Having a tradition of going to the local bar, riding motorcycles and wearing black leather adorned with a fictitious "Wild Hogs" gang logo, the lot decide to go on a road trip. Taking in the sights and the fresh air, they encounter a licentious policeman, a barbarous "real" biker gang and an abundance of adventure in the peaceful chile-loving town of Madrid, New Mexico.<br /><br />While most of the diverse cast manages to play it relatively inconspicuous, Martin Lawrence feels out of place. Travolta is in more and more comedies of late, probably since he's getting older and out of shape and less believable as a dramatic actor. Allen plays his typical "Tool Man" role, and William H. Macy goes back to his Mystery Men roots; which are withered and dying. Lawrence looks a little too young and his brand of comedy is mainly obnoxious dialogue, whereas the other three more easily fall into their roles of middle-aged, worn out men.<br /><br />The story essentially wishes to be a comedy, but the plotline resembles more serious fare. The film falls into a classic plot deterioration complex, in which the conflict created for the protagonists to overcome is so incredibly serious that the only solution is one of nonsensical luck or unbelievable circumstances. The mood is supposed to be carefree and silly, but the loss of all believability turns the lighthearted comedy into absurdity. The screenwriters couldn't figure out how to solve the enormous dilemma and it doesn't fool anyone. The most popular and pathetic "easy way out" example is the "it was all just a bad dream" scenario, which we've all seen before and is thankfully not employed by Wild Hogs. After such a noticeable blunder is made, the film wraps up too neatly. When every solution is presented to the audience with a cherry on top, it adds to the disbelief. Not everyone has to end up happy for a comedy to be commercially or critically successful.<br /><br />Another aspect that doesn't coalesce into the film smoothly is the overly intense villains, which could have been in a serious drama. Ray Liotta plays the rival biker gang's leader in such an unpleasant and sinister role that it feels contradictory to the playful design of the rest of the film. Towards the middle of the movie, viewers will probably be shrinking in fear for the hero foursome, due to the asperity of the dastardly enemies. The only imaginable conclusion for Liotta's character is that he will resort to murder in compensation for the wrongs done to him. When that isn't feasible in a film engineered like this, all other solutions only disrupt the suspension of disbelief. Including how many heavy-handed punches can be taken by the Wild Hogs without incurring any injuries.<br /><br />Lots of interesting cameos and bit parts are thrown into the film, which definitely helps, but not sufficiently. Legendary "Easy Rider" biker Peter Fonda makes an appearance, as well as Loveline guru Dr. Drew. Marisa "still sexy" Tomei plays the love interest and several other noticeable character actors appear throughout.<br /><br />Fun at times, silly at others and absolutely ridiculous most of the time, Wild Hogs is the perfect comedy for fans of John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy, and probably no one else.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A comedy-adventure about a group of suburban, middle-aged friends who decide hit the road with a freewheeling motorcycle trip. When this mis-matched, couch-potato foursome set out for a once-in-a-lifetime experience, they encounter an unexpected world. It's a wild funny ride with a great cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Midlife.  Your life is bland, you're in a rut, and your body's falling apart.  What to do?  Why not get together with some buds and go on a male-bonding motorcycle trip?  Let that testosterone rip, by golly.  Be cool (for maybe the first time ever).  What's so hilariously coincidental is that three of my close buds (all solidly middle-aged) just took a bike trip to the New Mexico Rockies (I was invited, but politely declined), so when I stumbled across WILD HOGS I had to pull up a chair and watch the madcap shenanigans of John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy gone wild.  (Yet unlike this cast, my friends didn't have a run-in with the Del Fuegos.  Darn.)<br /><br />The movie is silly, predictable, often lame, and decidedly over-the-top, but come on; it's still funny and entertaining--plus there is an undercurrent of midlife angst that resonates with old cusses like moi.  I especially liked the give-and-take between our heroes and the rough and ready Del Fuegos, led by a bristly Ray Liotta (who was born to play a biker gang leader).  But the Del Fuego who steals every scene he's in is the versatile Kevin Durand (who was outrageously fantastic in his brief role in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SF4">Smokin' Aces</a>); Durand's reaction, during the closing credits, when the Del Fuegos' bar was resurrected in a spoof to Home Makeover had me rolling on the floor.  So midlife might not be so funny, but trying to spice it up can be, and WILD HOGS proves it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>This is a fun movie about four everyday guys, known collectively as the "Wild Hogs", who decide to add a little adventure to their lives by taking a cross-country motorcycle road trip which turns out to be a little more adventure than they had originally considered when they cross paths with the notorious Del Fuegos gang.<br /><br />The production opens nicely and moves along with a steady rhythm that kept me interested throughout the film. Humorously engaging with plenty of fun gags and cool special effects and a fun story too! A good "buddies" film to sit down to, "Wild Hogs" delivers.<br /><br />I thought the cast did an excellent job. Martin Lawrence's wife was a pleasantly surprising choice for those of you who follow the who's worked with who thing.

If you like Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence, you'll like this movie a lot and think it's hilarious.  If you don't like those guys, you're probably better off not watching it.  Simple as that.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>Wild Hogs is a typical midlife crisis movie.  Four men, who have been friends for years and who suit up in leather and ride to the local bar and grill regularly to hang out, suddenly wonder what happened to their lives.  They all realize, one by one, that they've hit middle age and fallen into a rut, and they decide to take a cross country trip on their bikes to get out of it.<br /><br />This is one of the more entertaining movies I've seen in a while.  What made it for me, however, was not the plot or even the comedic moments but rather the excellent performances by a great cast.  John Travolta plays the cool-guy-in-a-midlife-crisis role perfectly, and Tim Allen pulls off his when-did-my-life-get-so-bland part flawlessly as well.  Throw in great performances by Martin Lawrence, a man desperate to get out from under his overbearing wife's thumb, and William H. Macy, a geek who hopes he can FINALLY do something that will make him cool, and you've got a great group of main characters.<br /><br />Macy's performance is probably the most surprisingly good of the bunch.  He's downright hilarious in this movie as the 'rebel nerd.'  And Ray Liotta is excellent as the villain, the antagonist who tries to refuse this group of "Wild Hogs" their right to ride on the grounds that they're not real bikers.<br /><br />This is a very funny movie and is sure to keep you entertained.  With a relatively unoriginal plot this may not have been a great film if not for the excellent cast, but these guys will have you cheering for the middle-aged suburbanite and longing for the open road yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Hollywood needs to rediscover the lost art of movie comedy. "Wild Hogs" is "City Slickers on Harleys" minus the humor, inventiveness and overall good taste. The filmmakers take every conceivable wrong turn and waste a fine cast in the process.

It's a nice family film that isn't too sappy or corny. This film took a beating by critics and I say you reviewers need to loosen your belt buckles and take your shoes off sometimes! How can you be so mean to such a well meaning film? It's certainly worth a watch or two. It's not too "wild" but, it's stars like to "hog" the screen!

During the week each does his nine-to-five thing, but every weekend they armor up in denim and leather, cruise around town on their motorcycles and then have a few beers. When mid-life crisis tickled one man's nose, it was not long before it spread through the group and a motorcycle road trip ensued. What better way for them to regain the spontanaety and autonomy of their glory days? I'm not sure this plot really needed conflict, but on their way west they came across a more traditional biker gang, who did not take kindly to these four midwestern suburbanites considering themselves peers.<br /><br />When the movie was first advertised I could not believe the cast (John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy). I had no issues with getting such an ensemble together, I was more taken back by the fact that these men (primarily Travolta) would make a movie like this. The more I thought about it, and certainly now that I have seen the movie, I believe that this was more about making a fun movie and working together than it was about setting box office records. I would have loved to be a fly on the camera while these men worked together; I hope it was as much fun for them as I imagine it to have been.<br /><br />I gave Wild Hogs "the old college try" since I had heard some surprisingly encouraging remarks. I talked to a few people who were very pleased with the movie. I addressed my concerns with them about how cheesy it looked and I was told not to worry. In the end, Wild Hogs was very cheesy. But it was fun enough for what it was. If you can relate with the characters I am sure there is more substance to the movie than I was able to enjoy.<br /><br />Have you ever been told that, "You will love Office Space even more if you have ever worked in an office setting?" Well, you will appreciate Wild Hogs much more if your own mid-life crisis is knocking, or has knocked at your door. Since (thankfully) mine has not, once the "conflict" settled into the story my interest waned.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>I thought this movie would be complete s**te, being another peurile attempt at resurrecting the waning careers of some has-been stars. In the event, I was surprised to see a movie that not only made me choke with laughter, but also had a very good ending as a bonus.<br /><br />The story follows four surburban Harley riders in the midst of their respective mid-life, boring, surburban lives. They each have nothing to liven up their quickly aging lives except the annual suburb's parade in which they ride their Harleys in formation. Exciting stuff. One of them comes up with the brain wave to take a road trip. A long story short, they all agree to go, and four of them set out for the Pacific U.S. in an adventure that has no plans, and no cellphones.<br /><br />The format was pretty predictable: the four would do something, and something would go wrong. The trick was guessing what went wrong with each new event. The humour is fairly slapstick in nature, though there is a deeper side to it. I have to admit, the deeper side comes in pretty shallow, in all honesty.<br /><br />This is no deep movie, though the critique of mid-life surburban boredom could be a target of the movie's comment. However, the movie is one that will appeal to the most basic of humours, (that is, like myself), and will keep one entertained for the duration. I am not sure it is worth a second or third viewing, but it was sure funny during the first one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>My wife generally doesn't like comedies as much as I do, but she really liked this one and was still laughing about parts of it a couple of days later.

A talented cast is mostly wasted with a sub par script about 4 buddies unhappy with portions of their life decide to ride their motorcycles across country for a week.  Along the way they run afoul of a nasty motorcycle gang and have to save a town from being ravaged.  Ray Liotta is okay as the gang leader, though I think some of his underlings are much funnier.  An extra star for the surprise cameo at the end.

Along the way, they run into the Del Fuegos, a real motorcycle gang, and barely manage to survive the encounter.  They seek refuge in Madrid, where Dudley meets Maggie (Tomei) and takes a liking to her.  Meanwhile, the Del Fuegos find out where the Hogs are, and come looking for them.<br /><br />"Wild Hogs" is an uneven movie that has some good moments, but they are balanced out by some unfunny ones.  Most of the major laughs can be seen in the previews, and that is never a good sign.  The four leads have a camaraderie that is believeable, and that is perhaps what saves the movie in the end.  This is by no means the best movie for any of them, but there is enough here that many will enjoy it.  I recommend waiting for the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>*1/2<br /><br />In "Wild Hogs," four middle-aged, suburban bikers (John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy) hit the road in a bid to recapture the free-spirited glory of their untroubled youth.  While en route from Ohio to California, the group does battle with a leather-clad motorcycle gang (headed by Ray Liotta) that regularly terrorizes the small Midwestern town through which the boys are passing.<br /><br />Though the credits state that the screenplay was written by one Brad Copeland, we suspect that it might actually be the product of a precocious seventh-grader banging away on his personal computer while feeling his first stirrings of puberty.  That might account for why every single joke seems to have originated in a junior high school locker room.  With its nonstop gay-bashing and rituals of male-bonding, it's often hard to tell whether the movie is actually more homophobic or homoerotic in nature.  Add to this an overabundance of genuinely uninspired slapstick routines as well as a raft of midlife crisis cliches, and you have one of the worst least-common-denominator comedies to come our way in a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I have to strongly disagree with the [...] review of this film.<br /><br />I thought the chemistry between the 4 main actors is what made this film. It's an enjoyable movie that has a lot of heart and the main characters' friendships are quite believable. Even though the plot is pretty predictable, it does have some genuinely funny and touching moments. I did, however, feel that Marissa Tomei was not used to her fullest. She is merely a cardboard cut-out instead of a supporting actress (she is capable of SO much more)and she really doesn't have all that much to do in the film except serve as a love interest for William H. Macy.<br /><br />The sound and picture quality are both very good and the DVD does offer some decent, if not great, extras (the gag reel was TOO SHORT!).<br /><br />It's worth a rental, but I don't think I will buy this title until it is offered at a really cheap price.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is an awesome comedy, because it has a lot of great actors like Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, John Travolta, and William H.

Smart casting on this film - each actor brings something very different (and a different audience) to the core group of four guys who hit the road on their motorcycles for a middle-age-crisis trip. (No wonder it did pretty well at the box office. Martin Lawrence and Tim Allen provide the "comedian" power, and Bill Macy and John Travolta have the acting cred.)<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Doug (Allen), Dudley (Macy), Woody (Travolta), and Bobby (Lawrence), four friends who get together on the weekends to ride motorcycles. Due to various things going on in each of their lives, the guys decide to take a 2,000 mile road trip to the coast together. On the way, they cement their friendships, learn more about each other and themselves, et. al.<br /><br />This was a fun ride. While the plot itself is no dynamo, the characters (and the way the actors portrayed them) made it worth watching. When Woody "accidentally" blows up a biker bar, Travolta's freak-outs are pretty dead on. Macy is, as always, soooo true.<br /><br />A fun family flick. Break out the popcorn for this one.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Okay, so I did not want to see this movie when it came out.  Of the entire cast the only actor I actually enjoyed on a regular basis was William H. Macy and so I didn't have the highest of hopes for this film.  That said, I was blown away with how funny this movie really is.  I mean, I was laughing just about the whole way through, and while Macy probably gives the funniest performance here the entire cast really hold their own as well.  One of my initial arguments going into this movie was that believing Martin Lawrence would be friends with the likes of Allen, Travolta and Macy was a bit far fetched.  They just seem to be cut from a different mold.  I was so very wrong.  Lawrence really left his `Martin' days behind here and has advanced as a comedian.  He's matured and is so believable here.  All four actors really fit well together, and that is a big plus to the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />The film follows four friends, Woody, Doug, Bobby and Dudley as they take off on the adventure of their lives to find themselves, escape the pressures of their lives and release the stress that just keeps building.  Woody is going through a nasty divorce from his supermodel wife although he refuses to admit anything is wrong to his friends.  Doug is facing stress from work and just needs to escape.  Bobby has family issues to work through, namely the lack of support from his wife and mother-in-law and Dudley just really needs a woman.  Together they make up `The Wild Hogs', their idea of a motorcycle gang, and so it's with leather jackets tightly fastened and Harley's between their legs that they set off for self discovery.  Once they leave for the open road though any and everything you can imagine goes seriously wrong.<br /><br />The gags within the film may not be all fresh and or original (I don't know why every comedy feels the need for the homosexual gags...sure some are funny but they just seem to overdo it at times) but the execution is well thought out and there are plenty of redeeming moments to help you forgive the missteps.  I love John C. McGinley on `Scrubs' but here he did nothing for me.  His character was just too over the top (although I did laugh at some of his scenes).<br /><br />Two supporting actors that are worth their weight here are Marisa Tomei and Ray Liotta.  As Jack, Ray completely steals the scenes he embodies.  His rebel gang leader is so harsh yet so hysterically on point.  You hate him yet want to see more of him.  As Maggie, Marisa is confident, endearing and so beautiful.  Although one may gawk at someone of her level of beauty falling for William H. Macy, but they play this side plot off so well it becomes very believable.<br /><br />There are plenty of scenes within `Wild Hogs' that will make the viewer chuckle and then plenty to evoke full on belly laughs.  A note to all who have not seen this film, as funny as it all is you MUST wait till the credits begin to roll for the biggest surprise.  Lets just say a gag involving a real motorcycle gang and a spoof on `Extreme Makeover: Home Edition' had me in tears it was so funny.  Seriously, it alone makes this movie worth OWNING.  So, in the end, I was wrong about `Wild Hogs'.  I expected to leave the theater pointing at my wife (who insisted we go) and saying "I told you so" as we left disgusted at the waste of time.  Instead I actually think I enjoyed the film more than she did.  I highly recommend this film.  Sure it's not perfect but it's a nice twist on the coming of age film sporting some really nice comedic performances by the entire cast.  And like I said, that closing scene is just priceless, truly and utterly priceless.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>WILD HOGS fluctuates between a certain insipidity and gut-busting humor. The film suffers from contrived situations and phoned-in efforts of two of the leads (a too twitchy John Travolta, who overacts, and Tim Allen, who's been letting me down a lot lately). Meanwhile, Martin Lawrence is his normal hit and miss comedic self. William H. Macy is the fourth lead and carries WILD HOGS on his reliable shoulders, here providing a hefty bulk of the film's hilarious scenes. I don't think I exaggerate when I state that Mr. Macy can do no wrong as an actor. He embellishes his portrayal of a nebbish, klutzy computer geek with a layer of sensitivity and naive soulfulness. He's very endearing in his haplessness. To me, the most honest moments in the film come in Macy's tongue-tied but heartfelt romancing of the lovely Marisa Tomei, who, by the way, is the second most appealing performer here.<br /><br />SERIOUS SPOILERS begin:<br /><br />WILD HOGS is a rallying road picture for the downtrodden middle-aged menfolk, a CITY SLICKERS for the new millennium (but not as consistently charming or funny). When Woody, an in-trouble businessman (Travolta) decides to forget his troubles, he manages to talk his longtime buddies into taking a stab at the wild freedom as exercised by bike gangs who live free off the land. Woody intends for his bike-riding Wild Hogs pals to do this by taking a cross-country trip on their Harleys and fending for themselves on the road and without their cell phones. The three other 40-something members of this part-time bike "gang" consist of Doug (Allen), a dentist with dietary prohibitions whose family treats him with fond and absentminded scorn, Bobby (Martin Lawrence), a plumber and the very portrait of emasculation (he's so henpecked he lies to his wife and tells her he's going to a toilet bowl seminar), and Dudley (William H. Macy), a clueless but very affable computer expert who insists on having motorcycle mishaps.<br /><br />But an early sampling of life on the wild side only offers up inclement weather, a marshmallow-induced conflagration, poop in a bag, and birds in the face. Then, a misconstrued conversation and the vision of men sharing the same sleeping bag threaten to land the four in hot water with a seemingly disapproving patrolman (a tightly uniformed John C. McGinley). Later on, these four in deep water threaten to land them in a sleeping bag with the same patrolman. Know what I mean?<br /><br />Soon after, a poorly conceived excursion into a real biker bar gets the guys in trouble as they run afoul of a local bike gang, the Del Fuegos, the leader of which (Ray Liotta, who, surprise, has another intimidatingly intense role) goes on a rant about bike-riding poseurs and then exacts punishment from the Hogs. However, Woody refuses to slink back to his white collar world and opts to do something retaliatory. The film then, more or less, takes a break from its travelogue tone as it hones in on the Wild Hogs frenziedly coping with the consequences of Woody's actions.<br /><br />END SPOILERS.<br /><br />Detractors of the film will find much to back up their claims: the lackluster performances (Travolta as a lead is wasted), a certain lack of chemistry among the leads, and the uninspired storyline. To me, however, this is simply a case of the truly funny moments actually outweighing the negatives and swinging my vote towards a favorable response. I'll be honest: yes, I noticed the flaws, but I was having so much fun in the theater I was able to magnanimously overlook them. Granted, some of the humor is forced and some just doesn't work (c'mon, what person above 7 years old really finds munching on a butter stick funny?). And, granted, I expected more from the all-star cast as the only ones who I felt earned their paychecks were Macy, Tomei, and Liotta - oh, and I also enjoyed the droll musical bits with Tenacious D's Kyle Gass. Travolta needs to pay better attention to future scripts (that, or brush up on his acting) or he just might take a tumble down to the same tier of acting purgatory in which Allen and Lawrence inhabit.<br /><br />WILD HOGS is inundated with poop jokes, gay jokes, bull slapping, gags involving items hitting people's personal areas...you know, low brow stuff. Now, that could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your preference and juvenile mindset. However, the dubiousness of certain aspects of the comedy is thankfully offset by several genuinely laugh-out-loud sequences, two of my favorites being the early scene of Macy on his computer while in a coffee shop and the chuckle-icious closing credit sequence. You probably know going in that this film won't stretch your intellect, no. But there's a chance it might elicit hearty chuckles out of your gut. In my opinion, it's worth watching the film if only to savor William H. Macy's engaging take on Dudley and the sweet comeliness of Marisa Tomei. Liotta, too, has his moments.<br /><br />One legendary biker advises the Hogs to either "ride hard or go home." WILD HOGS, despite the cinematic pot holes, rides hard enough. Three and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>Wild Hogs is about four now-middle-aged friends whose one indulgence is their weekly motorcycle ride. Doug (Tim Allen) is a dentist with high cholesterol who hasn't been on a vacation in years. Bobby (Martin Lawrence) has taken a year off his job as a plumber to write a self-help book that still isn't finished, and his wife has just arranged for him to get his old job back. Dudley (William H. Macy) is a computer programmer who can't get a date... because he freezes around women. And Woody (John Travolta) is the one they all think has it all--a gorgeous model for a wife and a high-powered job.<br /><br />But Woody's wife has left him, and he's lost his job, and he's broke. So he comes up with the idea for the four of them to take a cross-country bike trip.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is just pure fun--depicting their misadventures in beginning the trip. Then they run across the Del Fuegos, a real motorcycle gang, led by Jack (Ray Liotta). Jack takes advantage of Dudley's naivete and steals his bike. They leave, with Dudley in a rusty sidecar, but then Woody, with nothing to lose, decides to get it back.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil how he does it, but from then on, Woody's on the run from the Del Fuegos, and simultaneously trying to hide that from the other Wild Hogs.<br /><br />The climax comes in the little town of Madrid, where they all face what's bothering them and fix their lives--or at least start to. Dudley even finds a girl (Marisa Tomei).<br /><br />Wild Hogs is full of laughs. And interestingly, it's not Allen and Lawrence who provide most of them. The four actors work well together, despite being vastly different types--or perhaps because of it. What made the movie even funnier for me is that we I someone who's very much like Dudley: very smart, socially inept, an inexhaustible font of trivia, but so full of goodwill and so oblivious to his effect on others that you just can't help liking him.<br /><br />My only quibbles are that the conflict with the Del Fuegos was resolved a little too easily, and that Dudley's romance wasn't all that believable.<br /><br />Mostly, it's a wonderfully feel-good movie. If you want a good laugh, and to escape for a couple of hours, I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this movie is so funny everyone who sees it or wants to see it they would enjoy it. it has a good cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>I went for the laughs, but discovered "Wild Hogs" also had a good message about enjoying your life, sticking with your friends, and standing up for what you believe in.

It seems like a great idea and a can't miss premise. You get four quality Hollywood stars (Tim Allen, William H. Macy, Martin Lawrence and John Travolta). They'll play men with various flaws who love to ride motorcycles. In an attempt to salvage the glory of their younger years, they decide to go on a motorcycle road trip. You throw in a strong supporting cast with Marissa Tomei, Ray Liotta, and one of the "others" from Lost (MC Gainey) and you are sure to have a hit on your hands. This movie actually did quite well in the spring 2007 box office, but as I watched, I could see how each scene looked funny on paper, but the actual on screen performance left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />On a whole, this movie was humorous, and even a few times laugh outloud funny. More often however, the jokes seemed force, the cast seemed to be trying to hard. Tim Allen played the same character he always plays, this time a middle-aged dentist who hasn't done anything out of the ordinary in years. Martin Lawrence is a plumber dominated by his lawyer wife, and William H. Macy is computer geek who has no clue about the opposite sex. John Travolta is a guy that has the supermodel wife and the nice house. His friends, however, don't know that his wife is divorcing him and he is flat broke. Once on the road trip, then men encounter various minor problems before encountering a "real" biker gang, led by Ray Liotta. Of course, this is the conflict around whicht the plot revolves.<br /><br />John Travolta is the weakest link in the cast, perhaps through no fault of his own. He singlehandedly does something to the other biker gang, and then for no reason, decides he can't tell his friends what he did. This leads to the conflict, and the whole time if he had just told his friends what he did, then the conflict could have been avoided. The looks on Travolta's face were painful to watch as he agonized over the secret he harbored.<br /><br />This movie is full of cartoonish violence and PG13 type bad language. I thought the closing credits where Extreme Makeover Home Edition was parodied was one of the best parts of the film. I can't recommend anyone buying this movie until they've at least rented it and checked it out. It has a lot going for it but falls short in many other areas, like making you laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>I originally judged this movie as another mid life crisis movie.

The premise was that of four buddies who love to go riding their motorcycles together on weekends calling themselves Wild Hogs, and throughout the rest of the week lead rather dull, boring lives. So, with that premise being obvious from the trailers I thought the movie looked alright, it appeared to have plenty of humor from its rather talented ensemble cast comprised of Tim Allen ("The Santa Clause"), John Travolta ("Ladder 49"), Martin Lawrence ("Big Momma's House"), and William H. Macy ("Cellular"), but I wondered if all the funny parts were in the preview, a problem that many comedies seem to fall prey to. However, upon its release movie audiences were praising it as being one of the funniest films of the year, and a must see movie. This of course made me curious, so one night my wife and I decided to go see a movie and "Wild Hogs" turned out to be the one we wound up going to see. And let me tell you we were absolutely rolling with laughter, as was the rest of the audience.<br /><br />"Wild Hogs" is the story of four friends, as I stated earlier, who are all having some form of mid-life crisis, and they decide to take a road trip on their motorcycles across the country. With no plan, no map, and no cell phones, just them and the road, these four guys are in for the ride of their lives. However, their trip doesn't always go as smoothly as they'd hope, after having some rather embarrasing mishaps that they'd love nothing more than to forget about, these four friends decide to stop off at a bar for a drink. Except this isn't any ordinary bar, it's a biker bar belonging to a dangerous biker gang known as the Del Fuegos, who don't take too kindly to wannabe bikers in their territory. So will these 'Hogs' survive their road trip adventure or find that sometimes it doesn't pay to be wild.<br /><br />This is one movie that definitely surprised me by how good it really was. What surprised me the most was the fact that for being an ensemble comedy it was absolutely hilarious throughout the entire duration, and each of the lead actors had their fair share of the laughs to give. To me, the most surprising of the entire cast was William H. Macy. I've always thought he was a good actor, but never thought of him as much of a funnyman, but all that changed with this movie. He was by far the absolute funniest of the 4 main actors. Don't get me wrong Tim Allen gives his most hilarious performance since his run on "Home Improvement", John Travolta's never been this funny, and Martin Lawrence hasn't been this on his game since the first "Big Momma's House". But it's William H. Macy's performance that is most memorable. Ray Liotta as the lead biker was a good choice for the villain, and it was obvious he was having fun playing the role opposite such comedic talent and he even had a couple of humorous moments to shine in.<br /><br />The story was actually much better than I predicted it to be, with plenty of surprise cameos, and humorous setups and one-liners, it was nice to see a comedy that didn't rely purely on sight-gags and slapstick. Director Walt Becker is no stranger to comedy after helming the hilarious "Van Wilder", but this was definitely a different type of comedy for him. "Van Wilder" was a very adult-oriented, raunchy comedy as most National Lampoon movies are, but "Wild Hogs" is a fairly family friendly film that doesn't fall back on the run-of-the-mill sex jokes or fart gags; instead, this film survives on the terrific comedic timing of its talented cast and well-paced script. "Wild Hogs" is one extremely funny ride of a movie that the whole family should enjoy, especially those with a penchant for motorcycles and road trips.<br /><br />"Wild Hogs" is rated PG-13 for language and mild violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This movie is great fun with a fantastic line-up of talented comics.

I'm not sure.  I guess that depends on your opinion of homophobic jokes.<br /><br />Four middle-aged men with aspirations of gnarliness decide to de-tame their adequate (but unexciting) lives with an old-fashioned bike trip.  Doug (Tim Allen) is a dentist on a diet.  Bobby (Martin Lawrence) is a writer/plumber who is whipped by every female in his family.  Woody (John Travolta), once wealthy, now finds himself broke and dumped.  And Dudley (William H. Macy) is a painfully nerdy computer programmer who is smart enough to install voice-recognition software in his laptop, but not smart enough to figure out how to turn his computer off when it starts to belt out embarrasing website names in the middle of a coffee shop.<br /><br />How on Earth did these four men ever become friends?  Who cares?  Certainly not the script.  It's too busy hauling out old sitcom cliches and cheesy character foibles to ever consider things like back stories or, say, plausibility.<br /><br />The men eventually meet a "real" gang of bikers, the Del Fuegos, led by Jack (Ray Liotta, in the only decent role of the film), and of course they go head-to-head.  Caught in the middle is the small, arid town of Madrid, where the sherrifs get their training by playing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A5IWE">Doom 3</a> and the waitresses look like Marisa Tomei.<br /><br />Wait a minute.  That IS Marisa Tomei.  And guess which of our hapless heroes she falls in love with for no apparant reason whatsoever?  The answer is less interesting than you might think.<br /><br />And so is the film.  It has its moments (Macy's bumbling dope gets a few good lines, and Lawrence manages to be funny without saying much at all), but those moments are fleeting.  The rest of the film is paint-by-numbers comedy, a bad mixture of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001I55VU">Boy Meets World</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSY">Easy Rider</a>.  If you like guys on bikes accidentally clotheslining themselves on street signs, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the jokes this flick has to offer.  If you ask me, though, "Wild Hogs" could've used a lot less ham, and a lot more wild.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I had not paid a lot of attention to Wild Hogs until the movie was recommended by someone.  The story is a simple one: four middle-aged men (Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy), living in Cincinnati, are feeling that life is passing them by.  The interest that joins them together are motorcycles and they were playfully dubbed "The Wild Hogs" complete with a leather jacket back patch that is designed by Tim Allen's wife.  However, the four buddies may look like bikers their only ride takes them around town to a local bar - until John Travolta brings up a road trip.  What follows is a comic adventure that takes the guys to California as they pretend to be bikers.<br /><br />Along the way the guys run into a motorcycle gang (called the Del Fuegos - which turns out to be a nice play on words) led by Jack (nicely played by Ray Liotta), who seems more outraged that the Wild Hogs dare to call themselves a motorcycle gang.  Jack's gang is the terror of the area and the local police are not match for them, and they set out to have vengeance on the Hogs.  In the final showdown between the gangs, the Hogs have to prove themselves (which, of course they do) and inspire the locals of Madrid, New Mexico to defy Jack and his gang.<br /><br />The film is good fun and it is clear that everyone enjoyed making the movie.  There is a brief appearance of Peter Fonda - his Easy Rider character now grandfatherly - that was a most welcome addition to the cast; it was also good to see Marisa Tomei as the owner of a diner. The message of Wild Hogs is; simply, don't wait to do the things you want to do - make the time.  Wild Hogs was the best time my wife and I have had at the movies in a long time.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Wild Hogs" is great! The cast led by Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, and William H.

He only came alive briefly when he sneaked behind enemy lines to cut the gas lines of the Del Fuego's motorcycles, causing their hang out to go up in flames. Sorry if I spoiled the suspense.<br /><br />I never saw it, but I heard that he made a movie based on the science fiction writing of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, that could be worse than The Wild Hogs, but it is hard to imagine how. Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000. I gave The Wild Hogs 2 stars, just in case this other Travolta vehicle is actually worse. A 1 star film has to be like, Plan 9 From Outer Space.<br /><br />Travolta was great in Pulp Fiction. Saturday Night Fever, even. Urban Cowboy? All right, I suppose. He was good as Vinnie Barbarino on Welcome Back, Kotter--though constantly overshadowed by the scene stealing Horshak. He might have even been good in the film version of the musical version of the film Hairspray. Though I doubt he topped the divine performance of Divine, even with the help of co-star Christopher (More Cowbell!!!!) Walken. But in a lame movie like The Wild Hogs, Travolta really stuck out as the lamest of the lame.<br /><br />I would say that Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence were at a slightly higher level of acting then they displayed in their sit coms, Home Improvement and Martin. That is appropriate for this kind of movie, so they did their jobs adequately. William H. Macy is, according to several women who offered their opinons unsolicited, one of the least attractive men to ever trod planet Earth. I guess when he gets the girl, we should all be cheering him on. The woman he falls for was really the best actor, ever, just to make you believe that she liked him. Ray Liotta makes for a scary villain. Cameo by Peter Fonda--good to see him. He hasn't done much since Easy Rider. Jack Nicholson has eclipsed him ten fold, and even Dennis Hopper has done more since Easy Rider. The woman who plays Chris Rock's mom on Everybody Hates Chris played Martin Lawrence's wife. I like her, but this stupid film wasted her talent.<br /><br />I was just reading about the Oscars, and how the films that get the awards usually aren't the ones that do well at the Box Office. With few exceptions, like Titanic, they rarely overlap. Of this year's nominees for best picture, Juno actually did the best at the box office. It's pro life theme played well in the Midwest, and it built an audience by good word-of-mouth. It was maybe 23rd or 27th. But The Wild Hogs ranked 13th or 15th at the box office. Still, I don't care. It was extremely lame. It won't win any Oscars and the critics will pan it. I am sad that a movie as lame as this would actually earn any money whatsoever.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSY">Easy Rider</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767818172">The Wild One</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558908242">Pulp Fiction</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQSP6K">Welcome Back, Kotter</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXCH">Saturday Night Fever</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXIV">Battlefield Earth</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001EFV7C">The Cooler</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJZ6">Boogie Nights</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792846427">Fargo</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RZ9Y">Hairspray</a></p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>For what it was, I thought "Wild Hogs" was a pretty engaging film.

With talent like this William Macy, Travolta, Tim Allen, Ray Liotta, Lawrence Martin and Academy Award Winner Marisa Tomei you expect more but too often the actors instead of working off of each other in a nice ensemble seem to be trying to outdoing each other and the whole thing just falls flat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>Four suburban friends who have in common the love for their motorcycles and who call themselves Wild Hogs (Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, William H.

On their way, they cross paths with a real thing, an intimidating band of New Mexico bikers known as the Del Fuegos and their bad-to-the-bone leader, Ray Liotta. Jack and his buddies do not like middle-class suburbanites -amateur bikers, and a lot of misadventures ensue as the result of their meeting.<br /><br />I think the movie is better than majority of critics giving it credit for. The soundtrack contains classic rock songs. Along with the "Wild Hogs" gang we would pass and enjoy the beautiful scenery on the way from Ohio to the Pacific coast. The movie has even a class act in the end when the obligatory Deus ex machine shows up in the small charming town Madrid, New Mexico to settle all the scores and to stop the war between Wild Hogs and Del Fuegos. Peter Fonda's appearance immediately brings to mind another cross-country motorcycle adventure that happened almost forty years ago.<br /><br />I would not stay in line to the theater to see this comedy there, and I did not even know when it was released. One of my husband's coworkers, a biker himself who liked the movie, gave us the DVD which we watched on Saturday night and had a good time. No, it is not a subtle, witty and sophisticated comedy but so what?

Macy as the leads, Walt Becker's "Wild Hogs" should have been a first-rate comedy; instead, it is 'by-the-numbers', and surprisingly flat, relying on stereotypes and old gags in place of originality.<br /><br />The concept of middle-aged men hoping to recapture a zest for life on a cross-country trip has always been ripe with storytelling potential (from "Deliverance" to "About Schmidt"), and making the trek on motorcycles was a terrific variation; but from the outset, something just seemed out of kilter. Travolta's cocky failure lacks any warmth, as does Allen's paunchy dentist (wasting Jill Hennessy, in the clich&eacute;d 'wise wife' role); Martin Lawrence fares better, as a plumber taking a year-long sabbatical to write, surrounded by a houseful of sharp-tongued women, but his introduction feels more like a TV sitcom than a feature film; only Macy's portrayal of a likable geek rises above his material (who would have believed he'd be funnier than Allen or Lawrence?)<br /><br />Relying heavily on classic rock tunes of the seventies and eighties to provide atmosphere, the film quickly introduces the stereotypical gay cop (John C. McGinley, who is making a career out of these roles), in a camping scene so ripe with homosexual innuendos that you may want to send the kids out; of course, the guys run afoul of a 'real' biker gang (headed by a superb Ray Liotta, who, with Macy, gives the best performances of the film), and eventually, they end up in a small town, where Macy finally finds love with the always terrific Marisa Tomei (why she immediately falls for him is another plot-hole in a film that is rampant with them).<br /><br />The film's climax, as the Hogs takes on Liotta's gang, in the town, again offers comic potential, but, other than a terrific verbal exchange between Liotta and Macy ("Shoot his legs!" "I'm a computer programmer, I don't need legs" "Shoot his hands!"), it is completely predictable (even a surprise cameo isn't really much of a surprise). Worst of all, the film's resolution doesn't show any improvement in the lives of the four friends (even Macy returns to Cincinnati, amazingly enough).<br /><br />Director Becker, in the Special Features, said that he bought and sold Harleys to pay his way through college, so the script was a 'natural' for him, and that he let the cast improvise, extensively, since they were such 'pros'...I wish he'd demonstrated some of that Harley expertise in the film, and had asserted more control directing his cast...it might have made for a better film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>This movie has got somewhat panned here in the UK, sometimes the UK and USA comedy genre don't quite meet but I found really funny in parts, perhaps because I am fan of Roth, Lawrence, Travolta, Liotta and Macey or perhaps because my comedy gene is more international than national!<br /><br />The movie premise is quite simple, take four middle aged men who have an urge to be bikers, put them on motorbikes, and send them on a 2,000 mile round trip and what do you have?  You have total mayhem, laughs galore especially when they meet up with a nasty Hells Angels type biker group led by the enigmatic Liotta.<br /><br />This is a real "popcorn" movie, you need to see it with your mates, and laugh at the cheesy one liners, and Liotta's dead pan character Jack.<br /><br />For me the best part of the movie is at the end when Ty Pennington makes an appearance, you will wet your pants laughing, especially as his cameo part is himself playing his Extreme-Makeover role, it has to be seen to be believed is all I can say!<br /><br />Hoggishly good fun that will tickle your funny bone and have you chuckling  none stop.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>When this movie first appeared, I read the review by N.O.Scott, in the New York Times.  He blasted it (in a very funny way.)  Then a friend of mine seconded his opinion, claiming it was dreadful.  She mentioned that the 12 yr old boy she brought to the film thoroughly enjoyed it.  One of the readers of the NYTimes, a jr. high teacher, said he found the movie to be perfectly geared to a jr. high audience.<br /><br />So....I waited till it came to the dollar theater, not expecting a whole lot.  I think that expectations are important...I have found that if I expect a lot I'm often disappointed, and vice-versa.  So I offer this review saying that if you don't expect High Art, and are not bothered by politically incorrect homophobic jokes, you might like this.  (I also advise you to read the review here by Mark Eremite, which I think is quite intelligent.)<br /><br />So, expecting not-much, I bought my very cheap ticket and joined the crowd at the Sat. afternoon show at the cheapest theater in town.  I actually enjoyed it!  Not a huge amount---but my attention never left the screen from beginning to end.  With the exception of a really tacky episode with a gay cop, there's nothing really offensive.  And that says a lot for movies these days.<br /><br />I think that the success of the film (and it was a huge box office smash) is due to the very capable and attractive cast.  John Travolta is strong and charismatic.  While I wouldn't call him exactly handsome, he certainly is hunky and not bad to look at. He doesn't seem to take the role terribly seriously but maybe that's ok.  Martin Lawrence is very funny and endearing.  His facial expressions are terrific and he excudes a sweet vulnerability as the hen pecked plumber.<br /><br />William H. Macy, a fine actor, brings a touch of class to what could have been a very dopey character--the computer nerd.  He embues this girl-shy guy with an innocence and simplicity that is really touching.  Even with his rumpled face and tendancy to self-destruct, he wins the prettiest girl in town, which I found truly touching.<br /><br />Tim Allen's performance, as the dentist, was the most lack-luster, in my opinion.  He does have a nice moment near the end, when confronting the "real" bikers, telling them that they, are really the posers.  That won points for me.<br /><br />The big surprise is the cameo appeaance of the archetypal film bad-biker, Peter Fonda!  He is appropriately adorable with his grey curls under his bandana, eclipsing all of the other bikers, and wannabes with his presence.  A nice touch, for those of us who remember him cruising through the same New Mexico territory in Easy Rider.<br /><br />Under all the silliness, there are some nice lessons and the good guys really do win out.  Just read the reviews here, see who you most resonate with, and make that your index of how much you'll like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Sure the critics have ripped this film apart, but the reviews here seem to be on the positive side. I just had a great time. I do feel they could have utilized all these comedic talents to a much greater extent, but I got a good dozen or so laughs out of this one, as did the audience I saw it with. The homosexual humor was used a little too much and some of the jokes did fall quite flat.  Overall, Wild Hogs makes me want to cut work for a week and take a trip across the country.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>While Wild Hogs didn't enjoy terrific raves from critics, it did well at the tills. The actors seemed to have a really good time doing this movie, too. The story is about a group of middle-aged weekend bikers from the 'burbs who feel the itch for adventure. Impulsively, they decide to go on a road trip on their bikes with no plan. Hilarity ensues when each bumbling character faces a challenge that addresses each of their fears, especially when they meet a rough biker gang in New Mexico headed by ultimate biker (Ray Liotta).<br /><br />The movie is lengthy but you will allow it if you are just in the mood for laughs. The laughs come especially if you are able to relate to the characters' situations. Tim Allen plays Doug Madsen, reportedly a daredevil in his teens but grows up to become a dentist who has played it safe ever since he got married with kids. John Travolta plays Woody Stevens, the supposedly successful guy who has it all, but is actually hiding a divorce from his supermodel wife and his bankrupt status. Martin Lawrence plays Bobby Davis, the henpecked husband who doesn't bring home the bacon. The best performance for me was from William H. Macy as Dudley Frank, the quintessential geek.<br /><br />It was nice to see Macy play this character because he really pulled it off and it was such a welcome change from his honest cop roles. A little dance sequence was once more milked out of Travolta, who also played his role quite well (his face looked like he gets Botoxed regularly!). Marisa Tomei was a nice surprise. She plays Maggy, the owner of the small town diner. Like her character, she has definitely aged and seems to have been forgotten in such a tiny town but she is still quite pretty and has that fragile, approachable appeal. Towards the ending of the film make sure you stay on to watch Wild Hogs' closing credits to see a funny sequence provided by a TV show.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>If all you are after is a light weight comedy and are willing to laugh at some pretty standard jokes, well, this might be your ticket.  With all the star power brought to this thing, I was hoping for it to take flight, but its stubby little wings couldn't these Wild Hogs in the air.<br /><br />Sure, everyone in the movie is likeable.  Even the really bad guys in the movie, the Del Fuegos never reach sinister.  They yell, they threaten, they are pretty creepy, but do they ever really become dangerous.  Nah.  And in this kind of fluff, they aren't supposed to. Then why have them at all?  And take Ray Liotta as their leader, Jack.  Why would he take so ferociously after these four dweebs?  It just didn't make any sense except that the plot needed it.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the town of Madrid, its Sheriff Charly (Stephen Tobolowsky), and even trying hard to believe in Marisa Tomey as Maggie the owner of the town's diner, it was all so predictable and offered nothing really surprising.  Maybe because it is all based on the clich&eacute; of the male mid-life crisis times the four members of the Wild Hogs sort-of-club.<br /><br />But if you want some jokes and don't care that they are pretty ordinary and you want to see a bunch of stars on the screen and don't care too much about what they are saying and doing, then this can be a decent entertainment.  Just don't expect much wild anything.</p></br><a href="../users/A284WUQS94AQ7A.html">A284WUQS94AQ7A</a><br/><p>This biker comedy is one that will have you laughing, especially if you ride.  Four middle-aged, weekend riders decide to take a cross-country road trip.  You know when Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy are together it'll be a good laugh!  They encounter a biker group that apparently doesn't like "posers".  There are cameo appearances by the father and son bike builders from Orange County Choppers---Paul Teutul and Paul Teutul, Jr.  What a lot of people missed is the who played the character, Damien Blade, owner of the bar that Travolta burned down---it's Peter Fonda!  Reminiscent of Easy Rider! Come on! They had to put him in just for that connection!  Anyways, if you ride like I do, you would understand the road trip and the free feeling, just getting on your bike.  This film puts a little more fun and outrageous motorcycling into it!  Just enjoy the ride, it's worth seeing!</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I hate whoever did the music for this movie. It's annoying and terrible. That aside, most all the jokes fell flat with me. I didn't appreciate the mean spirited homophobic jokes either. Not all gay people are sex obsessed perverts that straight men need to fear. The only funny part was when John Travolta blew up the bar.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>Being a fan of Tim Allen, John Travolta, William H. Macy, and Martin Lawrence I thought I would really enjoy this movie.  I wasn't disappointed because not only is there a fun story but good acting a well-timed comedy that only these actors could pull off.<br /><br />This is the story of four city-slickers who go on a cross-country and back road trip on a couple of motorcycles to relive their glory days and hopefully put a little bit of energy back into their lives.  Of course, many mishaps happen along the way but things get really tough when they infuriate a biker gang called the Del Fuegos.  As expected, hilarity ensues.<br /><br />This may not be the funniest movie I've seen but it does have a lot of laugh-out-loud moments that I really enjoyed.  While the four actors listed above are fine performers, I really must take my hat off to William H. Macy who, I believe, stole the show.<br /><br />So, prepare yourselves for a while ride when you pick up this movie and enjoy a couple of hours with the Wild Hogs.  Make sure you watch the closing credits (the first several minutes of them anyways) because the twist they throw in at the end is hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>Apparently if you lump any 4 guys together on a road trip, there is going to be a lot of homophobic hi-jinks. There was so much gay slander jokes in this movie, it really got old quickly. The movie execs must believe the average American movie watcher obviously has the IQ of a caveman, sorry to any cavemen I've offended.<br /> The movie also has a lot of slapstick humor, making a Jerry Lewis type character out of William Macy. He klutzes everything up from fights to riding the motorcycle to dancing, to eating chili. This movie could have been about a mid life crisis and taken the subject seriously, and may have gotten a movie that was somewhat thoughtful or interesting. Instead what you have here is a stereo-typing four stooges on Harleys with a good dose of homophobic humor thrown in.</p></br></body></html>

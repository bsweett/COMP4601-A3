Good production design all around.<br />*The Predators get to use most all of the great weapons introduced in previous films.  The Aliens exhibit the same unnatural intelligence (or instinct) as in the previous films.  This film also introduces some interesting, logical ideas (like how the Alien skeleton is acid-proof, or how the Aliens willingly kill themselves to free their queen...).<br />*Even though it seems a little silly, I thought it was cool to see the Predator bonding with the main character.<br />*Very fascinating story line that ties the two franchises together brilliantly (and still corresponds well to the original films).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not much blood or guts, which is truly unsual for an Alien or Predator film.  The unrated version has a little more, but is stil not much.<br />*Kind of boring for the first hour.<br />*Despite the interesting backstory, the movie itself reminds me of the other films made by this director (like "Event Horizon" or "Resident Evil," all of which showed the same spiel about a bunch of people who explore a dark place and encounter something scary).<br />*Most of the characters are dull.  They tried to develop them to an extent, but they are ultimately unmemorable.<br /><br />It took me a few viewings to truly appreciate this.  I really don't care much for the characters (even the main character), and most wind up dying anyway.  And when the film spends the first hour developing these boring characters, the film as a whole seems very tedious.  But, the second half is very cool; there are lots of great fight scenes and slick special effects.  I was largely impressed by the backstory that tied the Alien and Predator together.  While this hardly compares to the other Alien or Predator films, this is pretty fun.  Fans of either franchise should probably see this at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>The movie is PG-13 so that pretty much tells you what you wont see. The speical effects are really good but as I said, PG-13 really hurts the movie. I see they have an unrated version but I wont buy it. I did notice that they have an extended version. I thought it was cool until I realize it didnt have more violence, just swearing. Cool effects with a few scenes that are really good but overall, disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>Sorry, if you really are into the Alien and Predator movies, then I suggest you watch this on Cinemax (now running it and see if you want to buy it this version).  With the protracted and harmful battle between the director and, once again 20th Century Outfoxed winning to make it good for the kiddies, adults lose out.  So guess what will come down the road 6 months to a year from now?  AVP-Director's Cut (THANKFULLY).  I will wait to buy until then.<br /><br />Movie makers are going to have to learn that the under 16 crowd is the movie goers these days.  Movie theatres are used as a "babysitter".  But you CANNOT gear all movies to that audience and have to make choices that stop this dumbing-down of movies.  Why there are so many box office failures of late.<br /><br />So great premise, one we have waited for since Predator 2.  Shame that had to short change us in order to make it for the children's bucks.<br /><br />Wait for the Director's Cut Edition which will be coming shortly, I am sure.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Though it had a simple plot, AVP (alias Alien vs.<br /><br />Predator), was filled with spectacular special effects<br /><br />and makeup.  It is a must for sci-fi<br /><br />buffs...particularly if you're familiar with the<br /><br />original flicks that spawned this sequel --- namely,<br /><br />"Alien" and "Predator".  The original "Alien" starred<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver.  The original "Predator" starred<br /><br />(none other than) Arnold Swartzenegger.  Not so<br /><br />strange, however is the ending of AVP.  It ends much<br /><br />like the original "Alien".  If you just want to go on<br /><br />a 90-minute thrill ride, pick up a  copy of AVP.  In<br /><br />the sci-fi genre it gets a 4.  Just be prepared for<br /><br />lots of gooey ooze and slime.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...I have to agree with those who give the movie 1 star and those who give it 4 (but that is how far as it goes because it's not a 5 star movie!). The thing is that Alien vs Predator could have been a lot worse. The way the creatures look (the aliens/alien-predators I mean), well, they're perfect "in their ugliness". And the rest of the movie looks good too. The pyramid, the halls. Well, the movie works visually, it works indeed -the problem is what Alien-fans notice too many times during AvP, the lack of research and "history" behind the previous Alien-movies (I haven't seen the Predator-movies). As a fan of Alien 1-3 I must say that this movie is not worthy of becoming a part of the Alien-saga. But at the same time -because of my low expectaions (real low) the movie surprised me in a positive way as an entertaining, watchable piece. And still the creators lack of "inspiration" (or so it seems) makes the whole experience a little "braindead". And sometimes embarrasing.<br /><br />The picture is fantastic, the sound too (dts) - but the acting is not very good (and I'm not surprised). But remember that the acting in Camerons' Aliens wasn't much to brag about either. What this movie is missing is a Ripley-character (and an actress like Weaver of course)!<br /><br />There are many flaws in AvP, and this way the scriptwriter and director Paul Anderson seems a bit lazy -and he does not impress me. And all in all this movie does not make me "hunger" for yet another sequel. It's watchable, that's all and I've seen the so-called "extended" version on the extreme edition. The movie is missing nerve, and adventure not least. The magic isn't quite there, and it surprises me that they used this director. The only good thing about his previous work "Event Horizon" is the sound. His storytelling seem to be missing something.<br /><br />3 stars, nothing more - nothing less.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>I rented "AvP" and thought it was rather CALM. There are some gorgeous settings and spaceships as well as some great battle scenes with some truly wonderful special effects. However the blood, guts and gore that SHOULD be here, are strangely absent. An "R" rated version was made, but the company behind the movie (20th Century Fox) decided to go for mass appeal and tone "AvP" down to a merry PG-13. Seeing the actors meet their doom is/was half the fun - we'll never know until the "Director's Cut" is released. All previous "Predator" and "Alien" movies had been rated "R". The originals are now Sci-Fi classics. "AvP" should never reach the classic category. "AvP" boasts no major star power. Sanaa Lathan (who?), Raoul Bova (who?) as the main two characters and an old Lance Henriksen reprising yet a different role - no longer the droid "Bishop" who was ripped in half in "Aliens". Arnold Schwarzenegger (as "Dutch") and Sigourney Weaver (as "Ripley") where are you? Before "AvP" even hit the screen, the series was off and running - in comic books, toys, card games, lunch boxes and video games - so I'm assuming this movie was a must for Hollywood. Naturally, the cheesy ending is a puzzler where you think the winner is declared, but just before the end credits start rolling - something happens - making it ripe for a "AvP: Part 2". A few things that simply didn't work for me in this film... 1) the man-made conveyer belts in the lost civilization that the mother alien was using for all her pods (sorry, I don't believe the alien creatures were smart enough to build these); 2) Lathan's character buddying up with the Predator (oh please); and 3) there were thousands of aliens and only a handful of predators (somehow this was fair?). I give Paul Anderson credit for making this potential masterpiece, but fault him for buckling under the strong hand of 20th Century Fox. I wish Anderson was able to release the full length movie he wanted the audience to see. Here's hoping that someday we fans will get that chance. Specifics: 101 minutes long including the credits. DVD includes 2 commentaries, 3 deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, comic book info, widescreen format with 5.1 DTS beautiful surround sound. While "AvP" has been rendered a Sci-Fi success at the box office, I will wait for the "Director's Cut" (R-rated) version of the film to come to DVD before I purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Been in development hell for a long time, this film started with a shot in Predator 2 where Danny Glover finds a trophy room with a clearly noticeable Alien head. Since then fans have been wondering what would've that battle looked like? Well this film gives the answers, well, more or less.<br /><br />A satellite owned by Weyland(an ancestor to the Aliens Weyland apparently) finds a heat blume reading below an island in Antartica. With technology, they found out it originated inside a massive pyramid with remnants of Aztec, Mayan and Cambodian pyramids, suggesting it's the first pyramid ever built. Weyland sets up a team to investigate, only to find 2 races who've been warring for centuries.<br /><br />What freaks you out about Alien is the claustrophia and the feeling that something was in the room you just didn't know where. Predator had a villain who was able to become invisible besides an odd optical effect and had blades and a shoulder mounted cannon.<br /><br />This film is sort of in the middle of course. The film does have plot holes that a train can drive through. The predators are supposed to hunt aliens who've hatched out of hosts? So what was that predator doing in the first one killing off uninfected people? Or the fact he had to "earn" his cannon when he had it in the beginning. And of course there's the 100 years thing, despite the fact Arnold and Danny Glover fought them less than 10 years apart.<br /><br />But taken on it's own, it's quite a fun film to watch, especially when the actual fighting starts, and it has a really suspenseful climax, but of course in typical Paul fashion, he leaves it wide open for a sequel, which if he could correct the faults of this film, it could be quite good but this film I like, but who knows how you'll take it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I have to say that I am not a MAJOR fan of either the Alien or the Predator series, though I've seen all the previous movies and liked them.  So, I cannot take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that is not familiar with the "details" I have to say that the movie was pretty good!<br /><br />It is an action-packed Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider type of adventure combining significant elements of horror.<br /><br />The acting is average and the choice for lead actress was poor at best. Though she is a Halle Berry type (which is definitely a bonus) this film does not seem to be her thing, especially when she does not present her "Halle Berry qualities." Consequently she is not convincing in her role.  Moreover, the opening scenes with her receiving the phone call while climbing the mountain were weak.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all very good!<br /><br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>AVP is a movie that has been in the making for a long time.  Ever since an alien head showed up in "Predator 2", fans have been craving this match up.  Now it is finally here, but do fans get what they have been waiting for?  Yes, and no.<br /><br />The discovery of pyramid in Antarctica prompts Charles Bishop Weyland (Henriksen) to mount an expidition there.  When his team enters the pyramid, they set off sensors that seal off the pyramid and set the wall into motion.  Quickly they discover alien eggs that begin to open and predators that are looking for some aliens to hunt.  It seems that this temple is used every 100 years as a rite of passage for the predators.  Now, the humans are caught in the middle and must choose a side if they want to have any hope of getting out alive.<br /><br />AVP does deliver some good battles between the aliens and the predators, but even the best of them suffer from what is my biggest complaint with this movie.  The director and producers have taken two R-rated franchises and joined them up into a PG-13 battle royale.  The only possible reason to deliver a PG-13 movie is to get a lot of teenagers into the audience, and it is a shame that this movie is watered down because of it.  The mythology of the two creatures is changed a bit for the movie, but that did not bother me.  The actors did serviceable jobs, but they are not why you would go see AVP.  Better than last year's "Freddy Vs. Jason", AVP is worth checking out for those seeking a good monster match up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I really did like this movie a lot when I watched it the first time. Since then, I went back and watched; Predator, Predator 2, and Alien, Aliens, Alien 3. They were all fantastic. Then I watched Alien vs. Predator and I found it lacking.<br /><br />Compared to the others, the movie seemed childish. It has to be a little childish if it's rated PG-13. You know something isn't right if every Predator/Alien movie before this is rated R and this was knocked down to be a PG-13 film.<br /><br />The acting was pretty lame in this movie with the only noticeable star being Lance Henriksen, which is a fantastic choice because he is a wonderful actor, it's especially great considering he was in both Aliens and Alien 3 and it's nice to see an old face we all know. But even he could not help the film. Everyone else is a bunch of nobodies, and after seeing this movie, looks to stay that way.<br /><br />The story had its share of problems as well. The number one problem being that the movie is set in 2004. What a horrible choice to set a movie in. At least it still felt right to have Predator 2 in 1997. But 2004 just felt too early a time to have this taking place. Is Bishop Wayland, played by actor Lance Henriksen, the ancestor of the human Bishop that designed the androids on Alien 3? It has to be since Alien 3 is set at least 54 years from now. Certainly not 2004. I was never really clear on that.<br /><br />I did, however, like the storyline of how in the past humans would breed aliens as a human sacrifice so the Predators could begin their hunt. I also liked how they showed it in the past as the Predators were being overthrown and would self destruct. Very well done scene, the chest buster skeletons looked great and gave a good intro for that story.<br /><br />The bond the Predator shared with the human at the end of the film was very interesting and obviously a tribute to the comic book series which occasionally showed the two species working together.<br /><br />Now to the look of the film. The map to the pyramid that was on the Predator's arm reminded me a lot of the Hive map used in the lack luster movie Resident Evil that Mr. Paul directed as well. This which isn't a good thing and has me wondering if we will see maps like this in future movies he is involved with. I have to give it to them; the Aliens in the movie looked fantastic, very sleek and well designed. I give them props for that. Predator looked great as well, but bulkier. They looked so bulky, it look as if they didn't have a neck, nothing like the look of the Predators in the first and second film. But when the Predator took of his mask, the detail was astounding. He looked fantastic. The face just seems to look better and better with each new film.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about it being set in Antarctica was the Predator must have been freezing. I know once it wasn't covered in ice, but it's been established in the first two films that Predators prefer hot/humid environments. They must have been shaking in their boots and very uncomfortable.<br /><br />The battle sequences were great, every single one of them. If nothing else is good in this movie, the action is. It was nice to see the return of the Predator's weapons as well.<br /><br />Overall, as a movie by itself, it's decent. When compared to the other movies, they are all far superior to Alien vs. Predator. This movie reeks of what could have been with the scent of a good movie. So I can see why people like this movie with the great action scenes and fantastic monsters. But I can also see why long time fans like my self don't care for it. The acting is horrible and the story of them going to Antarctica to look for an ancient temple is kind of dumb. Like I said, I liked the ancient scenes. So I'm torn; when they make another movie, we need a better story, and a better director. Resident Evil: Apocalypse was better than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>With a plot that makes absolutly no sense if you've seen any of the alien or predator movies and a bunch of faux scares with decent effects but no real gore (which is what you look for in one of these films) AvP falls short, very very short of what it could have been.  The acting is what it could be which is not very good and the alien on predator battles and or fights are really dissapointing.  This is no war.  It's one predator and a human girl fighting a bunch of aliens.  False advertising is what I call that.  A waste of time and money, not just for the consumer but for 20th centery fox as well...really bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>I, like so many fans of the Alien and Predator series have been looking forward to a story featuring these two super creatures on the big screen for quite some time.  Despite some MAJOR glaring continuity error's from the original alien films and also the subsequent predator movies, I personally felt that for all of these problems, I still enjoyed the film.<br /><br />Were there problems combining these two franchises together?  ABSOLUTELY.  There was much that was removed from the original script which went on to explain several of these errors, such as the incredible speed with which the aliens would be implanted, burst and grow to full size in...this being just one example of what apparently WAS in the script, but due to pressure from the film company, was edited out in order to achieve a more viewer-friendly PG13 rating.  While I see the reason for doing this, I also feel it, deep down, screwed up the enjoyment of the film overall.<br /><br />I also noticed one problem from the original Predator films that seemed to be totally absent from AVP: from what I can gather, the sweltering heat of the jungle featured in the first movie and the major heat-wave they were experiencing in Pred-2 gave me the distinct impression that hot, humid weather had to do with the where and when the Predator's did their hunting.  Now we see them in about the most opposite weather scenario you can have on planet earth in AVP.  Continuity error?  Yup.  I also found the coming to hunt every 100 years or so to be another HUGE error from the original films vs. AVP.  When you get right down to it, there were SO MANY I am virtually amazed I actually enjoyed the movie at ALL -- but I did.  I still had a fun time watching two of the greatest bad guys Hollywood has ever put on film going at it toe-to-toe.  The special effects were, by and large, rather impressive.  While many (and I do mean many) problems exist between the original films of both the franchises and this version, I have to say I enjoyed it better than the last two Alien films combined, especially Alien Resurrection.<br /><br />Will there be an AVP2?  Most likely.  What I am waiting for however, is the Directors Cut of AVP which will no doubt explain much of the problems that pretty much everyone who has seen the films have noticed and had problems with...but there are so many of them I seriously doubt that even HALF can be taken care of sufficiently.  Still, if AVP2 hits the big screens and is PG13 will I see it?  I'd have to say YES.  My son is just now discovering Aliens and Predators and he thought the film was just about the greatest movie EVER (but you have to realize he thinks the sequel to Dumb & Dumber was better than the original...).  As a friend of mine pointed out when we were watching Terminator 2 and I was busy commenting on some of the films un-real scenes, 'Just enjoy the movie as is.  It isn't supposed to be rocket science.'  And he was right.  Sure, Hollywood is more concerned with the bottom line rather than actually making good cinema any longer, but I still enjoy a fun alien movie with great special effects.  Here's to hoping the next AVP movie will be able to close the gaps created by this movie.  All in all, it could have been a lot better, but it was still pretty fun.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Do you remember those action figure commercials you were bombarded with as a child where the children are holding the action figures, making them do really cool stuff that they actually couldn't do, in an environment that no kid on Earth could recreate? That's about what "Alien Vs. Predator" adds up to. With the intense action of the average "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" episode and the genius story-writing, matched only by "xXx," "Alien Vs. Predator" is every bit as tame, lame, vapid and pointless as every bad review you've read. In all honesty, I don't know what I'm doing here, writing a review. It's all been said before. You should know better by now. And if you made the same mistake I made recently by giving it a fair chance, you will only be left feeling stupid. Paul W.S. Anderson, who directed the "Mortal Kombat" flick that, even at the age of 11, was too dumb for me, botches the material in every way possible. The Predator(s) come across as teddy bears, the Alien is just a crummy plot-device, and the characters have no soul whatsoever. Add that to the fact that action is without intensity and the horror is non-existent, compounded by the shoddy special effects, and you have possibly the worst movie made since the turn of the century. The fact that this is rated PG-13 alone tells you enough. Suffice it to say, if you watch this and expect to get anything out if it, the joke's on you.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Stuck in development hell for what seemed like an eternity, Fox's Alien and Predator franchises are finally slapped together in this just plain awful Alien VS Predator.  And naturally, who better than hack Paul W.S. Anderson to write and direct this?  For starters, as a few previous reviewers already mentioned, there are so many non-sensical plot devices (if the Predators come to Earth every 100 years, then what were Arnie and Danny Glover fighting in the first two Predator movies) that the film tries to make little sense at all.  One thing that particularly bothered me here, is that right after the Alien facehuggers impregnated the hosts, they immediately birthed an Alien.  Am I wrong, or didn't it take at least a few hours for an Alien to gestate inside it's host before it was born?  If this wasn't the case, then John Hurt would have been dead right after the facehugger came off him, and would have never made it to dinner.  Not to mention Sigourney Weaver would have never lived long enough to kill herself in Alien 3, and would have been dead as soon as she crash landed on Fury 161.  The dialogue is atrocious, and the cast, besides Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner and good 'ol Lance Henriksen, is bad as well.  The only good points of AVP are some imaginitive production designs, and the Predators look as cool as ever, but that's it.  To sustain a PG-13 rating, which no film in either series ever got, there was a good bit of gore cut out of the film which many are hoping will be fully restored for the upcoming Unrated version of the film to be released on DVD, but added gore scenes aren't going to save this.  Let's all take the time to thank Paul W.S. Anderson (nice job on what an above reviewer interpreted the W.S. to stand for) for delivering another mainstream aimed schlock fest, and naturally, there's a shameless door being left open for a sequel (or two, or three).</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Those jonesing for some spectacularly realized one-on-one fight sequences involving Aliens and Predators will be bitterly disappointed, given that this movie ultimately delivers only about 90 seconds of that.  Call me crazy, but I kind of thought that was the whole point of this concept - bring together the two most vicious, sophisticated and entertaining monsters in cinema history and lock them in a room.  Anderson does give us that, kind of.  The "room" is a suitably creepy pyramid deep beneath Antarctica, and of course it contains the requisite clutch of human prey to be sequentially disemboweled and decapitated at a steadily increasing rate.  So why is it so boring?  Mainly because there's too much focus on the humans, and not enough on the bad guys we've all come out to see.  It doesn't help that the unifying story - the flimsy excuse for bringing everyone together - involves a once-in-a-hundred-years showdown and ritual human sacrifices.  Hose off the decorative archaeology and what it comes down to is this: once a century, the Aliens and Predators get together for the equivalent of a round of paintball in a purpose built fun park.  It gets worse: one of the humans - a tough-as-nails tomboy, of course - starts earning a Predator's respect.  You can guess how it goes from there: soaring music and big explosions as they reach out across the inter-species divide.  Whatever.  It's mildly diverting, but nothing you haven't seen before: a shame, when something striking and new - the realization of an irresistible "what if..." scenario - was precisely what this movie promised.  Ten years in development, you would've thought they could do better than this.  I would have settled for a 90-minute fight-fest in deep space pitting Aliens against Predators in situations where they needed all their disparate skills to survive.  No humans.  No dialogue.  We work it all out from the action itself.  A $65 million Hollywood digital movie told in the narrative grammar of silent film: now that's a once-in-a-hundred-years event I'd REALLY want to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Hardcore Aliens fans can find a lot to dislike in this film, although anyone who's found "Alien3" and "Alien: Resurrection" to be causes worth championing likely don't have the sense of humor to enjoy this film no matter what.<br /><br />There's a lot of wasted potential in this film -- a great haunted house setting apparently inspired by "The Thing" is almost entirely wasted and the site is abandoned except for the destruction of it at the end; two of the three Predators are fumbling idiots and the last is a relatively cuddly guy who seems unaware that his relatives hunt and skin humans for sport; the tie between the human pyramid cultures is simply tossed out there, without anything being made of it, including how a "heat plume" could be spotted by cultures prior to the 21st century -- but overall, it's not a bad film. It has the requisite number of Aliens hissing and drooling acid, it has facehuggers and chestbursters and it has a pissed-off queen tearing up the joint.<br /><br />There's a token attempt or two to tie this into Aliens lore -- the father of robotics' middle name is Bishop, and is played by the same actor as played the robot of that name in Aliens -- but mostly it's "hey, these things are kewl!" and tossing them all into the blender and hitting puree, without worrying much about the logic of what comes out.<br /><br />For someone waiting years for the next part of the Aliens saga, this is a disappointment. For someone who went in knowing it would be dumb fun (like, say, Predator fans, or those who have been burned enough by science fiction franchises enough over the past few years to learn their lesson), it's dumb fun, incapable of offense.<br /><br />This is a rental for most folks.</p></br><a href="../users/AK61LQI92GTCH.html">AK61LQI92GTCH</a><br/><p>A friend loaned me ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (recommended) in the full-screen version - usually not recommended, but in this case it probably didn't matter.  There wasn't that much interesting happening in the middle of the screen, so I probably wasn't missing much happening on the edges.<br /><br />  I'm not a devoted fan of either the Alien or the Predator franchise, and I suppose my ignorance has inoculated me against outrage.  I don't know alien incubation times, or when a predator has last visited the earth, and I don't remember what a predator is supposed to look like when he pulls his mask off. Also, I'm blissfully unaware that AVP offends the story lines of earlier movies.<br /><br />  AVP is okay, but that's about it.  About my only beef is that the aliens didn't really versus the predators enough.  Probably a rental, but I'd recommend borrowing it from somebody if you can.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Paul W.S. Anderson is a crappy director, almost as crappy as Michael Bay. This movie should've been categorized as a comedy because I was laughing throughout the entire thing. There were tons of cheesy lines, not to mention the chick in the movie outlives the predators. This is one of those movies where you're laughing that it's so bad, so if that's what you're looking for then go see it. I wouldn't recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JDYUSI2RILEB.html">A2JDYUSI2RILEB</a><br/><p>Paul W.S. Anderson will never be mistaken for a true auteur. His filmography is littered with good-looking, albeit brainless, genre flicks like "Resident Evil" and "Event Horizon". Still, Anderson knows how to construct a stylish looking genre flick, and his B-movie expertise makes him perfect for ALIEN VS. PREDATOR, an enjoyable B-movie mash-up of the Alien and Predator franchises which isn't -- obviously -- on the level of Scott and Cameron's classics, but isn't but for what it is.<br /><br />Granted, Anderson's film IS ridiculous, but after two tepid "Alien" sequels that each nearly ended that series -- not to mention a disappointing sequel that put a near- permanent hold on the "Predator" franchise -- the dumb comic-book action of "Alien Vs. Predator" comes as a somewhat refreshing surprise.<br /><br />Not that the movie's routine first half will have you on the edge of your seat, however. Anderson and Shane Salerno's premise follows a group of present day archeologists and scientists -- hired by wealthy industrialist Charles Weyland (Lance Henriksen, playing the human forefather to Bishop) -- into the Antarctic where an ancient temple has been found beneath the ice. The group, which includes environmental expert Sanaa Lathan, uncovers a strange chamber where humans were used as ritual sacrifices for...well, without divulging all of the plot, let's just say that Aliens and Predators were somehow involved in the development of human civilization and big game hunting simultaneously.<br /><br />"Alien Vs. Predator" is not nearly as ambitious as "Alien 3" or "Alien: Resurrection," yet it's more entertaining than both of those misguided flops (not to mention "Predator 2"), particularly once the film hits its midway point. When the Predators and Aliens finally meet, Anderson's movie delivers the outlandish action and effects you'd anticipate coming from the premise, and rolls its way to the finish line surprisingly well.<br /><br />Up until that point, the dialogue isn't especially interesting nor the scenario full of twists, yet I enjoyed the movie's visual design and special effects. Unlike the freakish make-up seen in "Resurrection" and the overall garish look of "Alien 3," Anderson seems to have gone back to the drawing board and utilized the design of the creatures from James Cameron's superlative "Aliens," in addition to H.R. Giger's original "Alien" conceptions, in establishing the look of the movie. There are also a few fleeting nods to those initial "Alien" movies (something that ought to please fans), but for the most part, "Alien Vs. Predator" stands on its own as an efficient, if unremarkable, late summer genre offering. The special effects are excellent and the final climactic battle between the Alien Queen, the Predator, and the last human standing is good, old-fashioned fun, well-edited and choreographed, and easily the best set piece of the "Alien" series since the conclusion of Cameron's 1986 hit.<br /><br />Early in the film, one of the "Wolf Man" films is seen playing on a background TV. It's a telling reference, since "Alien Vs. Predator" is not a film with much on its mind other than providing its audience with an entertainment that couples two well-established monster franchises. In its own way, it's not all that different from "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" or any of the later Universal Monster team-ups from the mid '40s. It's a modern-day B-movie that knows what it is and provides a reasonably entertaining time for viewers who can approach it from the mind set that the material requires. (Now, if only Anderson had known when to quit and not tossed in that last groaner of a final shot!).<br /><br />Fox's Blu-Ray is pretty solid for an early format release. The transfer holds up decently, and BOTH cuts (unrated and PG13) of the film are included along with two commentaries and a trivia track.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The concept at the core of the story, is clever. The visuals are excellent. I thought the movie was awesome as a whole but of coarse it wasnt perfect.

As it turns out, the pyramid was used for battles between worshipped gods and their prey (predators and aliens, of course). And, to the misfortune of the crew, the time has come once again for the creatures to battle, and they find themselves trapped within the giant pyramid right in the middle of the slaughter.<br /><br />So what if they screwed over the storylines of both the aliens and the predators? As a friend of mine said, AVP is meant to stand alone as a completely new concept for the two species. For people (like myself) that loved both Predator movies and the Alien series, combining the two extraterrestrials in the same movie -- and even more, to have them face-off -- is a dream concept. And, just as the video games and comic books, I believe AVP the movie has succeeded in giving fans (mostly) what they want. The human characters having no appeal whatsoever (unlike Sigourney Weavor or Arnold Schwarzenegger of the original films) just makes it easier to focus on the battles, and at times hoping those idiotic Earthlings will be slaughtered along with the others.<br /><br />But be warned, the director's cut is soon to be released on DVD with all of the cut footage, including great fight sequences and plenty of gore (giving it an R-rating, mind you, unlike the PG-13 theatrical version). Sadly, though, there aren't any of those R-rated scenes in the deleted scenes featured here. And, to my disappointment, the "alternate beginning" was no more than the extremely short scene when the early 1900's Antarctic village was ambushed by a predator (this occurance was mentioned as a historical fact by the characters in the theatrical version, but the "alternate beginning" just lets us see it).<br /><br />Regardless of any disappointments (namely some bad actors, a big difference in the story behind the predators' and aliens' original movies, and some cheesy aspects that take away any terror that could have been in there), AVP is irresistible to any fan of sci-fi/action movies. This is two of cinema's greatest monsters in hand-to-hand combat. What more can you ask for? Don't expect a masterpiece, just expect a good ol' action flick worthy of it's place in your DVD collection (that is unless, like myself, you can't find the patience to wait for the director's cut).</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>It could have been more gorry and scary.

This PC special effects has got to go, bring on the REAL horror flix.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Anderson knows exactly how to disappoint and often do the opposite of what his career suggested with "Event Horizon" with AvP going back to the fanboy basics of rewriting "Mortal Kombat the movie" and introducing Aliens and Predators as allegedly the principle players... for a on-screen running time of about eight minutes when they eventually manage to come together - "Where is the AvP in AvP?" ends up being question #2 next to question #1 - "why is this PG13?" Anderson usually says that it is the studio's fault (note - "usually says", as this is not the first time he has used the excuse; see - Soldier, Resident Evil 1 + 2 plus his Director's Comments on this DVD!) but if you look at Anderson's track record you can tell that the producers have known what their product was all along - *Aliens for Children*.<br /><br />If they are going to slaughter a series at least choose one at a time. Here they manage hack both to death in one go. Is it economic for Hollywood to fail two franchises in the budget or something? Alien and Predator are high concept artistic science-fiction creations as a result of human qualities (fear, speed, technology strength etc). AvP is not `art' in any sense of the word. In fact while Alien and Alien 2, even Predator 1 and Predator 2 to some degree can lay claim to being "art" movies with AvP even having a worthy art series of graphic novels (please do not call them comics) all these appear to have been left sidelined for what is a fanboy Alien meets Predator... with the emphasis on the word `boy' ... and another on the fact that we know humour does not work here since Alien: Resurrection, the scene is set for an auditorium full of 12 year old going "Hahahahaha", "yuccchk" or "cool look at the way that guy died" or "Yeah the Alien won that battle", you don't care about any of the wooden-as-your-front-door cannon fodder characters that you saw in Braveheart as extras, or the fact that the set from Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 has been reconstructed, or the fact that the person sitting next to you in the auditorium is half your height as you mull over the changing times of having witnessed ALIEN in the cinema, you would at least expect a little more Alien Vs Predator and not an artic mission that takes up half the movie.<br /><br />I will say this much - AvP is certainly the WORST Predator movie (how could it be any worse than this!), but maybe there is a chance that Alien: Resurrection can sit next to this one in the same sort of "turkey entry" vanity casting, there is plenty of reasons not to see AvP, but considering that this is the only sci-fi movie with a 2004/2005 Hollywood budget, you might be glad to know that it does do some interesting science fiction from time to time, so sci-fi lovers may sit through this as they did something like Riddick, knowing that both these films are not a patch on the original, the interesting few moments in AvP are the CGI generated blackflash historical fights between the two aliens; a nice earth-entry landing and the concept of Predators harvesting Aliens, maybe one fight sequence, but in the end little segments that you thought where good do not make a movie by any means. Trying to find another excuse for watching AvP, there is about thirty minutes of Lance Henriksen fanboy backside pucking-up, but then again that is about the best thing this movie has to offer, and Lance knows that with Ripley gone, Schwarzenneger a Governor and Glover chasing serial killers called SAW, he can bend over for as long as he likes... and he does! ... so watch it for him maybe... but little else. And hey yeah it does have a 3rd act Mother Alien Vs Predator ending with overtones of water as deep-space, but the double-dose-to-be-continued-endings really does raise questions about how much attention anyone paid in biology class aside for imagining what green guts look like on the floor --- brains firmly out the window and double to be continued in two directions maybe, this is like some of sort of sales pitch for the entire movie or what? I wish Cameroon and Scott could have done something before the completely artless fanboy bubblegum directors somehow get their hands on the concept.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>In this corner, at 7'2" and weighing in at 323 pounds, the planet hopping, ritualistic hunter who made mince meat of an entire Special Ops Squad led by the Governor of California as well as a Los Angeles police force, the clef-lipped ferocity of The Predator!  And in the other corner, weighing in at 314 pounds...at about 6'8"...not including the tail...the one who not only brought Sigorney Weaver to her knees, but made a group of Future High Tech Marines look like babies, the scourge of all animals in the galaxy, the acid bleeding, multiple mandible, he'll go in through your face and come out of your stomach, how-does-he-see-with-no-eyes...THE ALIEN!<br /><br />Ok enough of that, as for the movie; surprisingly I found myself really liking this movie long after I watched it.  I did like it when I was watching it, but the more I thought about it afterward the more I liked it.  The plot is actually pretty smart and the action scenes are great, especially the fight scenes involving the Alien and Predator.  But alas, the actors are second-rate nobodies with the exception of Lance Henriksen.  What Alien movie would be complete without him?  It really helps tie them all together.  Plus, it makes you wonder, was Bishop made in his image?  The other Alien movies where set in the future, this one is set in the present, so we know the Alien race is living on in corners of the universe.  This is a dominating creature; all it does is kill and breed.<br /><br />The story starts as the satellite of a rich industrialist picks up a heat signature in a remote island off the coast of Antarctica, 2000 feet below the surface.  A team of experts is quickly pulled together to find out what it is.  As a note, just because the actors are unknown, doesn't mean they aren't decent.  The lead character, an environmental expert/explorer played by Sanaa Lathan, shows strength, determination and tenacity...everything a young actor wants to show off.  She gets to run, jump and tell the lead character that they aren't ready for this expedition that will take them to unknown areas of the earth.  What happens next may seem predictable, but the twists and turns that come with it are actually surprising and entertaining.<br /><br />If you didn't like any of the franchise movies, you may not like this one.  But if you were a fan of the Dark Horse comics and/or the movies, this one will keep your attention till the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Well, waddya know. John Travolta, you can now breath a sigh of relief because "Alien Vs Predator" has risen to dethrone "Battlefield Earth" as the most ridiculous science-fiction-fightfest of the modern era. Between the mooncrater sized plot holes (the humans discerning thousands of years of history from a few lines of hieroglyphics was my favorite) to deconstructing six movies' worth of characterization in barely 90 minutes, this scriptless wonder was generating unintended laughs from the audience I was sharing this misery with. The actual fight scenes were so Bugs Bunny/Road Runner goofy that snickers were breaking out on a regular basis. You gotta love it when the Predator starts swinging an Alien around by the tail, like it was a loose cat.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, this movie has more wardrobe malfunctions than a superbowl half-time extravaganza. The Predators have cloaks of invisibility that suddenly seem to give out during the last fifteen minutes. Same for their "I can see the little thing inside you" goggles. And if I was trapped alone in the night of an Antarctic winter, I'd really think I'd look like I was really COLD if I was dressed in a friggin' T-SHIRT! But I guess anything logical is not to be expected when the pyramid shifts every ten minutes - except near the end when the clock must have busted and allowed the passages to just move at random. Believe it or not THE SETS ARE THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!! (Thus saving this review from dropping to one star.)Even the sets are cribbed from somewhere else. If you see "AvP" when it makes its inevitable DVD Director's Cut appearance, think of "The Mummy" as the hapless humans scurry around this Alien Antfarm.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Go rent the newly issued PREDATOR or the first two ALIEN movies if you want to remember exactly how good-old jump out of your chair sci-fi scares are created. Then pray that "Freddy Vs Alien Vs Jason Vs Predator Vs The Rugrats" isn't the next brilliant idea to puke out of the bowels of the current Hollywood scriptmill critter spitter.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>Being a fan of the original Predator movie which I really enjoyed even though when Predator takes off his "armour mask", I've always said that that's the ugliest thing I've ever seen in a horror movie and I've seen hundreds and hundred of horror movies!!!!!! and being a fan of the Alien movies, which to me were much better having Sigourney Weaver in them. I don't think another actress could have played her role any better. Ok, having liked both movies, I eagerly awaited this movie to see the showdown between these 2 creatures.... kinda like Freddy vs. Jason. For being rated PG-13, I thought this movie was good, especially the special effects. I wish it would have been rated R however. I heard several gory scenes were left out giving it the PG-13 rating. Without going into all the details of the movie.... basically, an expidition to Antarctica finds a dwelling ground where the aliens live and we find the predators wanting to "move in". Ultimately, we see the "showdown" between Alien vs. Predator and the movie keeps you guessing as to who the winner will be.. if there is one. To me, this movie isn't as bad as reviews have said it is but there will always be a difference of opinions! Worth renting even if you have never seen any of the Predator or Alien movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>Understand that even with a two star rating that I enjoyed watching this movie; it is just that I had to turn my brain off.  There are more holes in this plot than in a round of Swiss cheese.  The plot holes are unfortunate because the premise of Aliens fighting predators with humans caught sort of in the middle was interesting.<br /><br />A satellite owned by Weyland Corporation, headed by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen!), spots a heat source under an ancient pyramid, under a couple thousand feet of ice.  The heat source must have been really big current day sensors to spot it.  Someone should tell the Navy about this to aid in underwater detection of submarines.  When the Aliens melted the snow and ice to get to the pyramid you would have thought that a heat source thousands of times greater than the energy put out by the pyramid would have been detected by somebody.  Also, you would think after encountering the Aliens in previous movies and consistently fairing poorly that Lance Henriksen would have learned his lesson.  I like Lance Henriksen, but how many times can one person be killed or maimed by Aliens?<br /><br />Anyway, Weyland puts together an expedition to the pyramid, just coincidentally at the same time Predators arrive, which in retrospect has to be on a routine Alien hunting trip.  You can imagine that the Predators are upset that the humans are in their hunting lodge.  Anyway, humans cause an Alien queen to be awakened and start laying eggs, which also triggers the closure of the pyramid.  Just before the pyramid closes the Predators arrive and slip under the door as it closes.  We soon learn that the pyramid reconfigures itself about every 10 minutes, because the creators of the pyramids, Aztecs, I think, worked on a metric system.  The only problem is that the Aztecs used a base 20 numbering system, which is definitely not metric, which is base 10.  Okay, every movie can be forgiven some implausibility, so move on.  Wait a moment, there are places where it seemed like the pyramid was reconfiguring itself in just two or three minutes, and then for a lengthy period in the last part of the movie the action went on for a long time while the pyramid did not move at all.  Perhaps I can forgive yet another implausibility.<br /><br />The Alien eggs soon begin to hatch and humans and Predators fall prey to the spidery little Alien hatchlings.  Soon fully grown Aliens start preying on the humans.  Wait a moment.  I thought Aliens took longer than an hour or two to get to full size.  I guess for the sake of action and pace logic is continuing to be suspended.  I also wonder whether I was the only one to notice that there were far more fully grown Aliens than there were dead human hosts.  Since the Predators did not bring extra victims with them where did all the hosts come from?  Also, the hatchlings seem to emerge from the humans in a matter of minutes versus the much longer period of time we saw in the first Alien movies.  I realize at this point that I am thinking too much about plot consistency.  Actually, thinking about this movie at all hurts at this point.<br /><br />The Aliens, humans and Predators all mill around in the pyramid trying to kill each other to the end of the movie.  The relatively soft humans are really little sport for either the Aliens or the Predators.  What surprised me was that the Predators were not that much of a match for the Aliens.  I would have thought that their armor and helmet would have been durable enough to withstand the Alien blood and the little fanged mouth part that comes jetting out, but apparently the helmets were about as strong as plastic and had nearly no resistance to Alien mouth parts.  Curiouser and curiouser.  I leave the ending to the patient viewer to discover.<br /><br />This movie really has no relationship to previous Alien movies at all.  It can not have any relationship because if it did it would make even less sense.  For example, the movie implied Aliens come to Earth every 100 years.  I guess someone should tell Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Glover that they are dealing with rogue Predators who do not follow the rules of the worst movie in this series.  Also, the movie said that human sacrifices were expected, yet the Predators brought none with them.  What is up with that?  First, in earlier movies Predators were hunting humans and we were seen as one big hunting ground.  Now the Predators have no interest in us and never have?  Second, we know that Predators find it easy to capture us, so getting sacrifices would have been easy.  I do not buy that heat from the pyramid was supposed to attract victims to the pyramid.  How could the Aliens know enough would show up?<br /><br />Lastly, given the violence and R-rating of the previous movies, I recognized that the studio toned the movie down so that the movie could be watched by younger audiences, as though this was a good thing.  Relaxing the standards of the previous movies in addition to the constant logical lapses detracted significantly from the movie for me.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first two Alien movies immensely.  The third and fourth movies were fair, but made an attempt to be logical and consistent.  This movie decided that they could make anything up they needed to create some sort of plot without considering that viewers might actually think about the movie.  Of course, given that the Predators act like a bunch of rednecks anyway, maybe that is what was expected.  Watch this movie for the action, but do not ascribe any sort of coherency or thought to the plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'Alien vs. Predator' is a movie that fans of both franchises have been waiting for for a very long time.  The idea for pitting the villains from the two franchises against each other first emerged in a Dark Horse Comic Book by the same name that appeared in the late 1980's and early 1990's.  The franchise then moved into video games, both in the coin-op machines and the computer and game console platforms.  At long last the franchise made it to the big screen.  The result proves to be a mixed bag for the fans.<br /><br />First, there is the plot.  The story is actually pretty cool.  Without spoiling much, a satellite owned by Weyland Enterprises reveals a structure resembling pyramids reminscient of several ancient cultures buried beneath a think sheet of ice in Antarctica.  Charles Bishop Weyland, played by Lance Henrikson, sees the discovery and exploration as an opportunity to leave a lasting legacy.  So, he rounds up a team of experts including Alexa Woods, an environmental guide (played by Sanna Lathan) and Sebastian de Rosa, an expert in ancient cultures (played by Raoul Bova).  Shortly after they arrive, a weird set of circumstances occur, and they find themselves in "the middle of a war."<br /><br />The good points about the plot include tying in elements from both movie franchises.  Weyland Enterprises might be recognized as the company in the 'Alien' series.  Furthermore, Henrickson's character, Charles Bishop Weyland, is the model for the Bishop character from 'Aliens.'  The downside of the plot is that it became too predictable too early.  Fans of the comic series will be able to predict how some of the plotlines will turn out.  On top of that, setting the movie in 2004 makes it seem unlikely that no record of the Aliens would have been recorded before they make their appearance in the future set in the Alien series.<br /><br />Next, the characters are a mixed bag as well.  Henriksen was a great addition to the cast.  He is a recognizeable face from the 'Alien' franchise, and his presence helps ground this movie.  Sanaa Lathan was a welcome choice for the female lead.  Although she is recognizeable from some of her other film roles ('Out of Time,' 'Blade'), she is not established superstar.  She and some of the other lesser known actors were refreshing.  However, if you have seen 'Alien' or read the comic books, you'll have a good idea of who is going to survive, and who won't.<br /><br />Other issues:  this movie could have used another half hour.  Other than some scattered appearances by the Aliens and the Predator species, you don't really see much of them for the first half hour.  There was just too much build up for the last third, some of it could have been worked into the spaces between action scenes.  There are a few continuity problems.  Most of these problems have been addressed by other reviewers, and are apparently the result in a last minute change of the rating by the studio.  Finally, the movie just didn't seem to have the grand scale that a combination of the two franchises would have seemed to have warranted.  This was a good story, but perhaps an off-Earth locale could have allowed for a larger scope to the film.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the movie, I have a copy on DVD for my collection, and I imagine I will watch it several more times.  However, some of the decisions for this movie could have been better.  I heard mixed reviews for the movie before I saw it, and I'm not sure what my expectations were, but the movie really didn't meet them.  The action scenes are pretty good for the most part, but there should have been more of them and a more balanced presentation of the rivalry.  This film doesn't have the suspense, tension, or mystery of the independent franchises either.<br /><br />The DVD has a few good extras, the best of which is the 'First Look' feature that goes behind the scenes.  There are some items on the DVD that don't seem to belong there.  This would include a promo for the Super Bowl that will be on Fox in 2005 that was shot sometime last year.  Not to mention, there are some previews for other movies that do not enhance this DVD at all.  Its borderline offensive that the extra content you buy on this DVD are actually promotions for other movies as opposed to features for this movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a movie that fans of the "Alien' and 'Predator' franchises need to see.  I'd generally recommend it to other fans.  Although not very gory, there is still some gore, but what might be more troubling to young viewers are the aliens themselves, which can be a bit frightening.  I'd give the movie either 3.5 stars, maybe four, but the DVD was lacking, and warrants 2.5 or 3 at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Alexa Woods (the beautiful Sanaa Lathan) is ice climbing when she gets a rather rude phone call. Someone wants her to put her life on hold and guide a group of explorers into an as-of-yet unknown pyramid found on a make-believe island next door to Antarctica. And that someone is billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen, Aliens), of the Weyland Corporation.<br /><br />The group of trepid explorers find their way to this frozen little land and discover that something has cut a hole in the ice at a 30 degree angle. And this hole leads down hundreds of yards to where the newly discovered pyramid rests.<br /><br />Once Alexa, Weyland, and the other members make their way into the pyramid, a shifting maze suddenly separates the parties. And waiting for them are the Aliens, ready to impregnant them with their nasty little eggs and get those chests a-bursting.<br /><br />But also, coming from outer space, are The Predators (no, Ahhnolds not coming back). The Predators have held a queen Alien in captivity within the pyramid for centuries. And what the Predators are excited about is that they can finally hunt and have their right of passage (as a Predator, you must kill off the Aliens in order to pass into the upper echelons of their order...I think). Humans are seen as a possible way out by the Aliens (if they can breed enough, they might be able to overpower the Predators). But the Predators only see humans as a means to an end. They're just chess pieces. They really just want to kick some bad-boy Alien booty.<br /><br />***********************************************************************<br /><br />What was good about the film?<br /><br />Being a fan of the Alien quadrilogy (is that really a word?), I was happy to be reaquainted with them, even if for a short while. I love the way they look and move.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first Predator film, but the second one left me wanting in a not-so-kindly way. I also thought it was kinda cool that an alien race (the Predators) would come to Earth and use it just as a hunting ground for trophies (i.e., human skulls).<br /><br />The action between the Aliens and Predators was pretty nice. I liked the futuristic boomerangs that the Predators carried and I really liked seeing the hand to hand (do Aliens have hands?) combat between the two.<br /><br />Where this movie fell short was in its editing.<br /><br />Obviously, some genius sitting behind a marketing desk (and looking up God-only-knows what kind of statistics) decided to cut and paste this movie until it met with a PG-13 rating. WHY?! The Alien series is an R-rated series, as was Predator. Cutting out any excessive gore, violence, or other pertinent scenes is ridiculous! Listen to me, whoever you are out there in Hollyweird-Land. Don't EVER do that again! Shame on you.<br /><br />I've read complaints from other reviewers about the lack of character development in this film. So what. Quit yer grippin'. It was never MEANT to be a character film. What was in there was enough to keep me interested in them. But only just.<br /><br />Final words: Sequel? If so, they BETTER NOT GET A PG-13 RATING ON IT OR I'M GONNA BE P#$$ED!</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>Alien! Predator! The fact of the matter is that this movie sucks. I didn't care one iota about ANY of the characters and I completely HATED how the Predator toward the end shows something resembling benevolence, completely removing his aura of mercilessness. Like the people in it, I can hardly remember what the story was about. It was obviously weak. I will say the fight between the two has its moments but it doesn't come close to epic status befitting these two legendary creatures. The final seconds are okay, I guess, but it's nothing more than a cliched tease for a possible sequel (at least that's what the producers must be clamoring for). Ultimately it is a failure because I totally forgot about it soon after watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>For years my instincts told me this would be a dud. One that five minutes into it you would going awww crap. Well, saw this at the local megalomart for a few yen and took the chance. Had a intriguing story, interesting and fresh. Was satisfying visually. Actors OK. The gal cute. Characters there, but not overdone. Movie moves along, no straying down boring paths. Direction good. Fight scenes enjoyable...and compared to many movies nowadays, understandable in what is actually happening. NOT a bunch of quickly edited shots of incomprehensible movement. With the Aliens and Predators special weapons arsenal available, you want to see how they match up, that's the money shot of this whole undertaking. The Alien makes wicked use of his spiked tail, and the Predator is fearless. Some reviewers grip about some possibile differences between this foray and previous films. Eh, I saw the original Alien back in the day with my GF at the local theater. Did not see anything amiss. The Predator seemed the same, not too handsome, still.  Now if the Alien had buck teeth and the Predator had a blond wig I would object. I like the "team-up" near the end, preventing another dreary ending. The last shot? What did you expect? It's only logical, and in the age of sequels mandatory. Give this one a shot, I say.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S3C5OFU508P3.html">A1S3C5OFU508P3</a><br/><p>For years, "Aliens" has been my favorite movie, not only due to the tense action, but also due to the power and likelihood of the adversary. It is my strongly held opinion that when humans encounter an alien animal species for the first time, it will be a hive-based species rather than humanoid. Insects are far more efficient, prolific, resilient and relentless in their pursuit of survival.<br /> I consider the adversary created for the Alien line of movies to be the product of genius. It is terrifying to look at, extremely powerful, deadly, prolific, and intelligent. The melding of the Alien creature with the Predator creature in the same movie is also the product of genius. A space-faring species that never lost their roots of the ritual hunt would find the Alien creature one of the most formidable opponents, so it is natural that they would reserve an otherwise useless planet as a hunting ground.<br /> This movie combines the tense action of the Predator with the ruthlessness of the Alien and there is a three-way battle with humans largely in the way. It takes some time to develop the complete background, but once it does, you are on the edge of your seat anticipating the next event. In a classic, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" situation an unusual alliance is formed for survival.<br /> This is a great movie, it rivals "Aliens" in terms of action and the intelligent extrapolation of alien species and ends with what could be the first event in a climactic battle for the survival of a species.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>Eh... I didn't care for this movie at all. I like the first two Alien movies and the first Predator movie, so I hoped that I'd really like this, but alas I did not. The story was confusing, I had to watch it multiple times before I actually got it (or I'm just slow...), I didn't care for hardly any of the characters at all, and I didn't feel a sense of suspense throughout the whole movie. The acting wasn't great, either... I just didn't really like this movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>I was myself surprised by how much I actually liked AVP, considering that it is very inferior to the founding films in both franchises and also to the Dark Horse original "Aliens vs. Predator" comics.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind, that this film plays in an ENTIRELY different (lower) league than "Alien", "Predator" and "Aliens". To my personal taste it is also mostly on the same level of quality as "Alien3" and "Predator 2". On another hand it is definitely better than "AVP 2", "Alien Resurrection" and "Predators".<br /><br />The possible future fusion of both franchises was first announced on the screen in "Predator 2" in 1990, in a short glimpse on the trophies wall in Predator's ship - amongst other memories of succesful hunts we could admire one huge adult xenomorph's (adult form of Alien creature) head. This promise was further confirmed in 1991 by the extraordinary Dark Horse comics "Aliens vs. Predator", which was in part an inspiration for AVP. "Aliens vs. Predators" comics met a considerable success in the following years, although none of them ever came even close to the quality of the first one.<br /><br />It took however 13 years to produce a film in which both Aliens and Predators are present and this long wait didn't help the whole enterprise. The scenario adopted for this film was clearly not the best of solutions. Placing the action of AVP in Antarctica in present times broke the logics of both franchises. The aura of awe and horror surrounding the Aliens was in part created by the fact that they were a complete novelty for humanity - a completely new form of existence, absolutely unfamiliar, unheard off, in one word ALIEN. Placing them on Earth quite regularly since prehistoric times and suggest that images of some of the monsters in ancient temples were in fact traces of their presence on our planet, all of that ripped in shreds this particular shroud of terror in which they were wrapped. Also, putting Predators in Antarctica, was ludicrous, as it was stressed otherwise in both movies, that they are partial to heat and hunt on Earth only in the hottest spots, during the hottest summers...<br /><br />All of that was already a HUGE mistake, but giving up on the best parts of the original comics was even worse! Replacing the character of Machiko Noguchi (colonial administrator of a distant planet) by Alexa Woods (guide for high mountain and polar expeditions) was a rather bad idea, but it had also its good points, for reasons which I will explain later. But changing the ending was a DEADLY SIN.<br /><br />I can not go into details, in case if you didn't yet see the film or read the comics, but let's just be said that the final fate of Machiko Noguchi in the original comics is one of the best ideas I have seen in the whole SF - and it opens the gate to infinite possibilities for sequels full of wonderful adventures. But AVP closed this gate so thoroughly that I think the producer, the director and the scenarist simply CHICKENED OUT after seeing the sheer scale of future possibilities. I can not say anything more - read the comics and see the film and judge by yourself.<br /><br />That being said, if we forget for a moment that AVP was supposed to be part of BOTH great franchises, it is not such a bad "stand alone" SF film and ultimately I rather liked it, for reasons which I will enumarate below, with limited SPOILERS:<br /><br />1. Antarctica. This place of action gives to AVP a quite unique atmosphere, to such extent, that it is easy to forget that we are on our planet... The abandoned "village", where once whalers dwelled and worked, inspired clearly by the real life "ghost town" of Grytviken, is particularly well made.<br /><br />2. The Great Pyramid of Predators. That gigantic structure is really well done and contributes a lot to the oppressive atmosphere dominating in the film. And the deadly surprises hidden in its mechanisms are also quite impressive.<br /><br />3. Alien vs. Predator fights - VERY well done! The duel between "Grid" (a particularly big Alien "soldier") and one of the young Predators is actually the ONE scene which is as good as anything from "Aliens" or the first "Predator".<br /><br />4. Lance Henriksen. It is a real pleasure to watch this actor in any movie in which he appears - and here, as Charles Bishop Weyland, the founder and CEO of Weyland Industries (which later, after a merger will become the infamous Weyland-Yutani), he is as good as Bishop the android in "Aliens"<br /><br />5. "Scar" Predator. The most gifted of the three young Predators who appear in the film is a very impressive creature and an imposing presence on the screen, quite a lot like the principal Predator in "Aliens vs. Predators" comics.<br /><br />6. Last but not least, Sanaa Lathan. Cast as Alexa Woods, the principal character, she is the MAIN reason why I liked this film so much. Although her character was clearly inspired by Machiko Noguchi from the comics, Alexa is different, but definitely not one bit less interesting. Making her living by guiding expeditions in Himalayas, Arctic and Antarctica, respected in her profession, confident in her abilities and financially independent, she is completely in charge of her destiny and is definitely no damsel in distress. But, although very tough when needed, she is also a very feminine and warm person - and thanks to Sanaa Latham unique charm, this character is also very beautful and sexy...<br /><br />Also, what I liked very much in Alexa Woods is the calm, the self-control, a great dignity, all mixed with modest and gentle behaviour. When she needs to take charge, Alexa rules with an iron fist - but wrapped in a soft silk glove... Finally, she is also a lady, in the best meaning of this word - it takes two hours of all hell breaking lose and a hurricane of violence, death and suffering to finally force her to raise her voice and shout one obscenity!<br /><br />And then, there are also scenes, in which Alexa meets one of the Predators face to face. Sanaa Latham played in those moments PERFECTLY! I believe that I have never seen in the cinema a more intense and more interesting meeting and interaction between a human and an alien intelligent creature. The scene in which Alexa receives a "gift" (well, sort of...) is particularly strong - and her acceptance of it is... well, no. I am not saying anything more - if you didn't see this film, you desserve to discover it by yourself.<br />---<br />CONCLUSION: if one manages to forget that this film is supposed to be a sequel in two franchises and succeeds to no less than three MASTERPIECES ("Alien", "Aliens" and "Predator"), AVP is a quite good SF movie, visually stunning and well interpreted. I simply can not help it - I LIKE IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Back in the late 80's early 90's there was a comic book series called Alien vs Predator then in 1993 AVP a beat em up was released on the SNES & Capcom made an even better beat em up there was a Atari Jaguar game it was an FPS though.

BTW I ment to rate it 2 stars not 1 sorry guys.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>Like most people, I always liked the Alien movies. In fact, the original Alien movie is probably the only horror movie that really scared the living day lights out of me! Even when I saw it a second time (with annoying commercial breaks), it still scared me. Later, I learned that the alien monster or "xenomorph" was originally designed by a Swiss surrealist painter with an interest in psychoanalysis, H.R. Giger. Perhaps that's why the monster is so scary. Clearly, Giger and the rest of the production team have tapped into our worst nightmares and subconscious fears.<br /><br />I liked the Predator movies as well, so the concept of a crossover had a certain appeal.<br /><br />I know that the critics dissed "Alien vs. Predator", and apparently many hard-line Alien fans didn't like it either. In my opinion, however, "Alien vs. Predator" is an underrated movie. It could have been much worse! Sure, it's not as good as the real Alien movies, but it's perfectly acceptable. If you like constant action, monsters, and a little bit of science fiction, that is!<br /><br />What's missing from the crossover movie is that special magic touch that made the original Alien movies so memorable. The characters aren't very interesting either, not even the main hero Alexa Woods. Also, the continuity between "Alien vs. Predator" and the other Alien or Predator movies isn't very clear. While this will no doubt annoy the most devoted fans, I don't think the regular viewer will mind. I certainly didn't when I saw the movie on Swedish TV just the other day! Once the action gets started, and the bizarre aliens and predators start fighting each other, with the humans stuck in between, you tend to forget that it's not "really" an Alien movie.<br /><br />The plot of "Alien vs. Predator" is quite simple. A research team discovers an underground pyramid in the Antarctica. The pyramid was built by a previously unknown civilization, combining traits of the Aztecs, Egyptians and Cambodians. It's all bunk, of course. My father (who was watching the movie with me) kindly informed me that the Aztecs didn't have the kind of calendar depicted in the movie. Those were the Mayans! I kindly informed him that the Egyptians, of course, never practiced human sacrifice...<br /><br />Then, the fun begins. It turns out that the pyramid is used by the "hunters" from the Predator movies for initiation rituals. The young hunters must prove their worth by fighting "the snakes", which turn out to be the Alien monsters. Unfortunately, the Aliens need to kill other life forms to reproduce (they are parasites). For that purpose, humans are fooled into the sacrificial chamber of the temple, only to be infected and killed by Alien "facehuggers". When the mature Aliens burst out of the dead human bodies, the hunt can begin! Of course, something goes terrible wrong, the captive Alien Queen escapes, and soon it's not so clear who is the hunter and who is the hunted... The female hero, Alexa, is forced to co-operate with an Alien-infected Predator to stop the Alien Queen from reaching the surface. Meanwhile, the Predator space ship plans to "drop the big one" in case they fail.<br /><br />The fate of human civilization hangs in the balance...<br /><br />The best movie around? Hardly. A worthy prequel to the really real Alien movies? Probably not. But as Friday night entertainment goes, I'd say it's about as good as it can get. FOUR STARS.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>This film definitely benefits from retrospect. After having viewed it now several times I've come down on the side of the fans with this film and not on the side of the haters, of which there are many.<br /><br />When this movie was reported on, most of the mainstream press dismissed it outright as either an over the top combination, too niche of an audience, a bad idea that could ruin both franchises, and so on. After the initial shock wave settled and the movie came out, the box office numbers were pretty dismal and the film was then seen to have under-preformed. The expectation was probably too great to live up to or even meet half-way. Aliens vs. Predator landed with a thud in the theatres as well as on DVD when it was finally released.<br /><br />But with all due respect, the film is greater than it's marketing history and will probably be seen as such in time to come.<br /><br />The story has some surprising elements to it. Lance Henriksen being one of them, playing Charles 'Bishop' Weyland of ... ahem ...Weyland Industries. Yes, now it all makes sense. The whole question of Bishop wants to be answered and is begging to be answered in this film, much like the Terminator Series tries to reverse engineer their own on-screen technology to show you its roots. Henrikson's character is a billionaire industrialist that does it all and has the jump on most modern governments and not-surprisingly more armed than modern governments as well. But in this film, he's the aging, decrepit and frail leader that probably should've stayed home but takes no advice.<br /><br />Overall, the action is good, the story is well-written and engaging. The CG is  flawless and one can tell that a lot of love went into his movie from the inception of the idea and followed it all the way through the process. This is a much better movie than it was given credit for, and AVP holds it own in the world of both Predators and Aliens.<br /><br />And for the record, if you have any doubts at all, this film also looks a million times better once you get a whiff of AVP:R, which was a complete and unmitigated disaster. It's a shame that movie was even made, because AVP:R did what everyone thought this film was going to do to both franchises. It just goes to show how much hard work is required to carry off something of the magnitude achieved in this film. Making a naval gazing, teen slasher movie and trying to pass it off as either an Aliens or Predator production is just downright shameful.<br /><br />Well, as of this date AVP3 is silently in the works and it looks as though AVP:R is just going to be outright ignored in the storyline, and should be. Hopefully AVP3 will pick off where AVP left off.<br /><br />... ...</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Alien vs predator is worth seeing. Theres no point pretending its a classic film - its not. However to write it off completely is unfair as it has some merit. I thought the basic plot idea was a rather well thought out story, and for the first hour the film maintained a decent level of interest and even a little bit of characterisation.<br /><br />It was certainly nice to Lance Henriksen back playing Charles Bishop Weyland - a nod to Bishop the android in Aliens. Sanaa Lathan is also pretty good as Alexa (effectively the Ripley role) but you would have thought that they could have come up with something slightly more original than creating another Ripley like character. It did become a bit predictable in the second half of the film and there are some noteable plot holes that can't be explained away.<br /><br />Overall though I found to be an entertaining film. It may be shallow but there are a lot worse films than this out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I've only recently just finished watching the Alien movies, and although I watched the Predator movies, I was never that fussed about them. If I had to choose one, I'd have to say I preferred the Alien movies to the Predator.<br /><br />So I was shocked after watching AVP, that I actually found myself sympathising with the Predators!!!<br /><br />There seems to be no relation to the other movies, Sigourney Weaver famously refused to have anything to do with it, so it was left for a below-standard movie to come onto our screens, without any backing from one of the original stars. Surely that's got to be a bad thing?<br /><br />The storyline was a bit iffy, and the characters weren't that particularly likable. They never are in these movies, cos there's more money thrown at the special effects than developing the character storylines. But not to worry, that's the only major letdown, and it's to be expected.<br /><br />What always got me about the Alien movies, and especially the Predator movies, is that you never really saw the aliens/predators that much. In this film, they're shown too much. When they're not shown as much (particularly the Predator, who was mostly invisible in the original movies), it gives the audience a sense of anticipation, of fear etc.<br /><br />For this, like that other 'vs' movie - Freddy vs Jason - there should have been lots of alien vs predator fights. There's barely anything. One at the most. I can understand why some die hard fans were a bit miffed at that. If I'd been a die hard fan, I wouldn't have wanted to watch a few characters run around a pyramid, just asking to be killed.<br /><br />But by the end of the movie, if you don't feel sorry for the Predators (looking bigger, better, and badder than their previous outings), then you have no heart. I actually found myself thinking "awwwwww", without hopefully not giving too much away about the finale.<br /><br />There's already a sequel about to come out in the UK this month, which I'm not sure about. True, the first does just BEG for a sequel, but was it necessary? I'm sure I'll find out soon enough. Personally, they should have either made another Aliens movie (although I think Resurrection was final enough), or made another Predator movie (and brought back Arnie!), and left this well alone.<br /><br />If I do see the sequel, I know who I'm rooting for. Go boy, go!</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>I'll start off by saying this wasn't a terrible movie, but it's problem is that it delivers very little, especially from two franchises that have given so much.  What is odd is that any of the prior Alien or Predator films each had more action that AVP.  And you have to admit, there is only so much you can do with a story for this kind of film, so it all comes down to the action.  That's what we want to see the most - great Alien vs Predator battles.  Be warned now, there are really only two honest battles in the whole film between the two species.<br /><br />Does the story make sense compared to what has happened with the other franchises?  Not really. So if you are hardcore about the franchises and appreciate continuity, AVP doesn't make too much sense.  Predator took place in 1987 and 1997 (keep in mind Predator 2 was made in 1990 but took place in 97).  Neither of those encounters were mentioned, only that the Predators came to Earth centuries ago.  As for the Aliens, we shouldn't really know about them until a long while from now according to the first Alien movies.  Maybe in future installments of the franchise (if it happens) something will come about to make the connections.<br /><br />I was not impressed with any of the characters in the film, except maybe Weyland.  Played by Lance Henrikson, who also played in Aliens and Alien 3 as the robot "Bishop".  There is a connection from the robot to this guy in AVP, but its never quite explained.  The rest of the crew is lifeless, and serve very little purpose except as bait.<br /><br />So it comes down to the creatures.  What there is is great, but it needed more.  It takes one hour out of the hour and forty minutes for the first fight to begin, which was a fun duel and a surprising outcome.  The Alien queen made it into the film, which I felt was a welcome return from Aliens and Alien Resurrection.  This is the 2nd and final battle of the film, when she goes up against the main Predator outside in the snow and ice.  The Predators looked great and tough as ever, but more clean cut this time around and not so rugged as the originals.  The aliens were CGI for the most part, and lacked the fright they presented in the earlier films too.  The humans - kinda just get in the way, but serve to tell the story - such as it is.<br /><br />Considering how many years it took, and a dream come true that this film was even made, its still worth watching to those who are dying to see some kind of matchup between these two great creatures.  Chances are you expected more, but I guess that's what AVPR is for.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Action - 3.5<br />Characters - 2.5<br />Story - 3<br />Overall - 3</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>A greatly disappointing 5th film in the Alien franchise (also the third in the Predator series), Alien Vs Predator makes a mockery of the intense and ruthless alien creatures defined in the films Alien and Predator. Far from the macabre masterpieces of the original films, this mishmash of comic book lore and subplots is an insult to the viewer and an insult to Ridley Scott and James Cameron.<br /><br />A group of scientists and adventurers are pawns in a diabolical "right of passage" when they are sent to the depths of Antarctica to explore an ancient pyramid. Gathered together by industrialist billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) and lead by survivalist Alexa Woods (Sanaa Latham), the unsuspecting group ventures into an icy trap. Predators purposefully lure pray for alien eggs so that they can duel within the labyrinthine corridors of the icy monolith. What follows are some of the mildest scenes of action and alien violence imaginable.<br /><br />One by one the human fodder is ushered into lonesome passageways and claustrophobic tunnels to meet offscreen demises that we can only assume are horrendous. A spattering of action sequences is well-choreographed and at rare moments I sometimes am able to ignore the shape of a man in a rubber suit. But when predators swing aliens around their heads like lassos, it's easy to forget that either creature could actually exist in the nightmarish premises once imagined by surrealist H.R. Giger and visionary director Ridley Scott.<br /><br />Reduced to mere PG-13 frolicking animals, both the Aliens and Predators have never been so un-scary and un-cool. Even the Alien Queen is nothing more than a rip-off of Jurassic Park's T-Rex. It seems that even after Sigourney Weaver finally gave up the lead role resolutely, the copyright holders wished to capitalize on pre-sold audiences. When will it all end? Probably never, considering Alien Vs Predator 2 will be released Christmas 2007. While the plotlines continued to diminish after Cameron's original sequel, I never expected the once horrifying and bloodthirsty creatures to clash in overly bland battles diluted by the decision to purge all forms of mature content. Director Paul W.S. Anderson is surprisingly timid with such influences, considering his repertoire contains harsher fare like Soldier and Event Horizon. Despite outstanding computer animation and practical special effects, the Aliens and Predators have never looked so ridiculously harmless.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The biggest problem with this movie is it's too dark most of the time. I can hardly see things clearly. That makes it's very difficult for me to enjoy it. There are a lot of fighting and bloody scenes but there's no suspense at all.

we can't, & do we really know what lays beneath Antarctica, I think not.<br /><br />& the reason the aliens never make it to society on earth is simply because the Predator nukes them all, & the survivor (Sanaa Lathan) could have easily told Weyland Inc. about her experiences & they would likely keep it quiet, but yet they knew in "Alien" what the Nostronmo crew had, that is why Ash protected it even though it was killing the crew.<br /><br />As for the Queen surviving in the Pyramid, remember, she was frozen, as for there being more aliens than hosts, how do we know many of them were not frozen with her 100 years ago, we don't, there is nothing to suggest otherwise.<br /><br />The only place I see inconsistency that no one seems to notice is the Predator's inpregnation, the Queen throws her tail into him, this does contradict "Alien 3" when an alien refuses to kill Ripley because of her inpregnation, the Queen would not have done this, & like one reviewer noted, the arriving Predators would have inspected their fallen one before allowing it into their ship, this is the only flaw aside from the Predators being so easily defeated by the aliens, other than this, this one stays overall consistent, I just requires you to think a bit.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>I've never liked the concept of an alien tricked out with all kinds of hi-tech gear hunting humans as sport. I mean, where's the challenge? There's no skill involved in tracking or blowing them to bits with your super lasers, is there? Or stealth, even, since you have your invisibility gadget. I started to compare it to humans hunting deer, but upon reflection, there is much more patience, skill, and discomfort there on the part of the hunters, who also seek to dispatch their meal with the best shot possible.<br /><br />On to the movie. The director actually succeeds in giving it enough human interest and getting us to like the characters in a suprisingly short period of time. Unfortunately they get killed off pretty quickly, too. The endgame gives us an interesting partnership scenario, and there are some OK AVP faceoffs, but the human cat-and-mouse stuff is not particularly interesting.<br /><br />So ... it could have been much worse. I liked it better than the last two sequels.

The movie had a familiar feel to it, not of the obvious though, Predator movies, and Aliens. It rather felt, sometimes glaringly, similiar to Mortal Kombat. The special effects reminded me of Resident Evil, along with some of the noise and cinematography (slow motion). But then, it felt slashed, and edited by a cruel hand. I imagine w.s. anderson very upset by the tone of the movie. I really was surprised at how short it felt. It gives you a little action (what everyone was holding their breathe for from AVP!) then they take away quickly, and drive you away towards a climax nearly at a pitch of 90 degrees! NO time to savor the mortal kombat of sci fi's most familiar icons. I felt the movie included way too much build up, the setting was brooded over and it was obvious. On a personal note, If i may: Why change the familiar noise of the predator? Those things I pick up quickly, for instance, an unfamiliar, and very annoying, lion roar sound. Then anderson gives a little back, the familiar clicking or purring of the predator. All of the familiarities, of mine, have been downplayed. The movie was geared towards too large an audience. But, the movie has done wonderful in sales, and so, another chance will more than likely be given to this promising franchise. Go ahead and rent this. It's worth a fun evening.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>When "Freddy Vs. Jason" was a massive hit in the summer of 2003, you knew that this would start the trend of "Vs." movies. And so it has. Here we get the icon from the long running series of "Alien" films that started way back in 1979 coming together with the Predator from the film series of the same name that started in 1987 and only had one other film. As far as the "Alien" movies go, this one isn't too bad of a new venture with the character with some nice moments, but is far from being a great representation. As far as the Predator goes, this is the best film for that character, since the 1987 original with Ah-Nold was mildly good, and the sequel in 1990 was extremely bad. The movie was written and directed by Paul Anderson, a man whose other work I have not seen. From what I uunderstand, this film is a sequel to the "Predator" movies, and a prequel to the "Alien" films. The story starts with something dastardly happening in 1904 at an Anartic whaling station. Immediatley jumping to present day, the discovery of a massive pyramid that is located way beneath the ice is located. Lance Henriksen, a nice nod to the history of the "Alien" series, plays Charles Bishop Wayland, who pulls together an elite group of scientists  to make the trek to Antartica and help him locate the mysterious pyramid. The scientists are made up of the usual fodder of people with different backgrounds and races, but the two stand outs are explorer Lex Woods(the lovely Sanaa Lathan), and french archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa, played by Raoul Bova. Once inside, the pyramid moves and changes every 10 minutes, and our captives soon learn that the place was a training ground for the predators to become hunters, and it's hunted were the aliens themselves. Soon three predators arrive as our captives do, which sets in motion the release of a gang of aliens from the queen mother, who has been held in some kind of crypto chamber to make new aliens so the hunt can begin. Most of the script and it's dialogue is mostly mumbo jumbo, because mainly the audience wants to see the good stuff. Unfortunatley, with it's surprising PG-13 rating, you won't be seeing the kind of good stuff you would probably want to see. There is some goo with alien guck and predator blood, but that is about as nasty as it gets. Why PG-13?. What in the world were they thinking?. The big team up between the two beasts happens about halfway in the movie, and while it is pretty good, it is also way too brief. The end battle is more running and trying to find something to stop whichever beast is left standing. Don't want to spoil it for you. So, the big grudge match really doesn't live up to the hype or deliver in the way that Freddy and Jason's showdown did. Big overture, little show. However, the movie is beautiful to look at. It is nicely shot and choregraphed, and it does look amazing. It makes the most of it's limited location, and for the most part, it works. The acting is pretty decent. Sanaa Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver, and I doubt she would try to be, but she holds her own pretty well in the role and gets the job done. It was very nice to see Lance Henriksen. He brought a sort of legitimacy to the proceedings, even if the end result does not really stand up to the best of the "Alien" series. I never liked the "Predator" movies. Always thought they were a poor man's "Alien". I can't give the creature the 'icon' title like the alien because I don't think the creature is. Not like the alien. It's a 90 minute popcorn/cotton candy monster fest. It does not really add upon the existing franchise of "Alien", but it does deliver the best of the "Predator" movies. It should of been R rated as well. It is not an overly great film, but is far from being the worst piece of trash ever captured on film. Talk about an overreaction. It is definitley watchable and entertaining, with some nice shots and moments here and there, but nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>In 1979, we were introduced to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011V8IQ">Alien (The Director's Cut)</a>(1979), not only did it chase Sigourney Weaver around, it scared the water out of us.

I don't think it works that it takes place in present time with Bishop being in it though. I mean think about why that is a flaw.  Alien 3 took place in the future like a 100 years after this and the Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henrikson) character was in that. He's a human that has a android made of him and that isn't even mentioned here. Here he's just a sick rich guy who wants to explore an underground Pyramid. Oh plus he doesn't even mention aliens or have knowledge of them.  So I don't think him being in it works or even makes sense. They might as well not even have called him Bishop. The Alien movies are years in the future with spaceships and the humans don't use ships in this..they weren't even invented.<br /><br />  Don't get me wrong though this movie does have decent ideas and they are decently executed. The Alien vs Predator scenes are entertaining and cool but isn't really any use for humans being in the movie. The humans in this barely even put up a fight at all, where's Ripley when you need her ? Plus just like in Freddy vs Jason, you don't care about the humans eventhough they take up half the movie. You just want to see Aliens vs Predators and when you get it that's when there's some actual life in the movie. I guess the film-makers thought that Bishop being in it would attract fans of the Alien franchise. It would've worked if they actually thought it through. Plus having the director of Resident Evil do it wasn't a great idea either. Still though this is a better Alien movie than Alien Resurrection at least. When a movie doesn't get released for critics, you expect something horrible but this really isn't that bad.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>If you think 'AVP' can scare you like the first 'Alien' film, you are utterly mistaken.  Like 'Frankenstein Meets a Wolfman' or films with such titles, 'AVP' needs our clear understanding that this is a popcorn film for the fans of these series.  It's pure entertainment -- derivative but still thrilling actions with cardboard characters -- and surprisingly, it is fairly enjoyable as such.<br /><br />The story is not bad, considering the time gaps between the two series.  In the year of 2004 (which means, this year!) a team of academics led by an eccentric millionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen, reminding us of his famous role)  try to examine the archeologic findings.  Unfortunately, they find themselves trapped in the pyramid-like constructions, where the fierce battles between Aliens and Predators are going to happen.<br /><br />The logics behind the apparently contrived situations look  forced at first sight, ignoring some parts of the films made in the past, but I think still the plot itself is pretty reasonable if not original.  The bad things about it is, in fact, that the derivative set-pieces are not scary or exciting as the writers think, and even the film's final scene (that is a clear sign of another chapter coming) is not really a surprise, being telegraphed from 40 minutes away.<br /><br />But I didn't hate the film, simply because Paul WS Anderson, whose past track records include not-so-great sci-fi films like 'Soldier''Mortal Kombat''Event Horizon' and 'Resident Evil' keeps the things going anyway, with good production designs and many references to the previous Alien and Predator  films in the past (see the way Henriksen uses a pen before his PC, tapping on the desk with it, for example).  And the film's unexpected turn concerning one Predator with the heroine Sanaa Lathan is a good idea.<br /><br />'AVP' is more like a novelty, so you cannot expect the same credible characters seen in James Cameron's sensational 'Aliens.'  No little girl, no suggested undertone, no Vasquez.  Still, the actions themselves are not bad, actors doing good jobs, CGIs fine (not perfect, though).</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>After a decade the story is finally on the big screen.  After years of novels and comic books we get to see Predators and Aliens go at it on the big screen.  For those of you only use to the Alien and Predator films there is one thing I should point out.  I could point out more, but I don't wish to spoil it.<br /><br />For those Predator fans who might get upset because it seems the hunters have tossed out the rules, the rituals of the hunt, please remember that different prey is hunted in different ways.  And even Predators toss out the rules when things go wrong.<br /><br />As for the Aliens they still scare the sh*t out of me (like they did in their first two movies).  Shiny, wet, evil creatures!  Yuckie-pooh!  They even surprised me in their first encounter with the Predators and gave the movie a cool ending!<br /><br />Oh, and I guess the humans did OK also.<br /><br />Just sit down, eat the popcorn, enjoy the film and don't worry about the shadows moving about in the dark theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>I was expecting more, I'll admit.

I saw this film out of curiosity. The first 20 minutes of the film was just boring because I was just waiting for them to fight. I understand that they got to explain the story and all but c'mon. It should have just tooken like ten minutes. I was close to walking out of the theater. The story line was great, terrible acting of course. But it turned out to be an enjoyable film. I wouldn't watch it again because it really wasnt that good. This film could have been a lot lot better but it seemed to be ok. I wouldn't recommend it, but watch it if you want just to see how it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I had a great time watching Alien Vs. Predator.<br /><br />I went in to the movie sceptic. PG-13? How can they do an Alien/Predator movie without the R-rated violence?<br /><br />I'll tell you what though, this movie was engrossing from beginning to end. The violence is there, but it's mostly Alien and Predator violence and it was very sharply done. Frightening. Fast. The violence was done in the tradition of old style hollywood and was very effectively done with sound effects.<br /><br />The story is well thought out and gives a marvelous new look inside the world of the Predator!! Where they came from. What they're about. Successfully blending their world with the Aliens and demanding your attention as the events unfold between the two sides and the unexpecting humans in the middle.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who has seen the Alien or Predator movies. In fact, I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't. I left the movie theatre smiling and talking. Also, knowing a little more about Bishop (the andriod from ALIENS).<br /><br />Go see!! What are you waiting for!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>I watched AVP with fairly low expectations after one or two reviews as savage as the two alien creatures featured in it. However, despite the fact that this isn't a perfect movie, I found it to be extremely enjoyable and didn't want it to end. Let's face it, this sort of film was always going to be more about action and somewhat less about storyline. And what action there is I found to be very entertaining, with lots of variety in the way the combat between the three races (if you include humans) takes place as well as many unpredictable moments and inventive use of each races particular traits.<br /><br />Quite simply all my favourite aspects of the two film series are thrown together in one place, and I'm praying for an even better sequel.<br /><br />To have a balanced viewpoint I should comment on the minor niggles that some people seem to dwell on (and miss out on the otherwise enjoyable parts of the movie). The plot itself - I won't comment on the specifics, but the story that emerges later on is perhaps a little too ambitous, and a simpler story that could have been built on in future sequel(s) may have been better received. My only other minor complaints were a couple of plot holes and minimal character development in most of the characters - but none of these will affect your enjoyment of this DVD as long as you don't dwell on them like most people seem to...<br /><br />A few years ago most people doubted whether this crossover would ever happen. Now it's here most people are demanding perfection! I for one would rather appreciate what we have got and think about two of the greatest and most inventive sci-fi creatures ever created battling it out before your eyes. Superb!</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>In fact AVP is weaker than a 10x recycled tea bag. You get my point...it's a very weak film. What else could be expected from Paul 'It's not my fault' Anderson? A man who is forever blaming studio interference for the poor quality of his films. What on earth Fox, Walter Hill and John Davis were thinking in hiring this hack I'm not sure I want to know. Trust me, no matter how naive and simple your film-going pleasures are, you will walk away from AVP forever jaded and cynical.<br /><br />Both franchises are best examples of their genre.<br /><br />Alien-Utterly faultless<br />Aliens-Breathtaking hardcore sci-fi action<br />Predator-Just so brilliant words fail to describe it<br />Predator 2-Underrated sequel that plays like a story taken directly from a 1950 Tales from the Crypt comic-book.<br />Alien 3-Notorious failure but far superior to AVP.<br />Alien Resurrection-Very strange but intriguing weirdo sequel with some wonderfully unique touches.<br /><br />And now...<br /><br />AVP: Alien vs Predator-Watered down, childish, repetitive, boring, completely flat, soulless and castrated.<br /><br />Paul Anderson simply has no idea where the heart of either franchises is. He directs the film with arrogance and over-confidence. Undeniable proof of this is obvious in the scene where Sebastian says 'It's all beginning to make sense now.'<br /><br />I'm sorry, the sense must have been lost and me and the rest of the audience.<br /><br />Having seen AVP in the cinema twice now I must stress to you that the film does NOT hold up in repeat viewings. After being surprised at how 'not too bad' it was the first time, the rotten dialogue, endless exposition, slow set-up and lack of actual Alien vs Predator fighting damn this film to hell. Much like the main faults of last years Freddy vs Jason, though at least that film was a hard R-rated movie and not a kids movie.<br /><br />For a crossover franchise that has existed for over 14 years throughout many different forms of media, the AVP movie should have been an epic directed by someone with talent. Instead Anderson craps all over the source material and directs the worst film of his toilet dwelling career. AVP plays like a bunch of cut-scenes from the video games and totally devoid of any originality. In one particular scene he blatantly and obviously rips off a narrative from HP Lovecraft's At The Mountains Of Madness. The nerve!<br /><br />There are plot holes all over the place and massive gaps in logic. Like why does the acid blood conveniently only corrode weapons the Predator doesn't really need? And why oh why do they hunt in Antarctica? The are drawn to earth areas of heat and conflict.<br /><br />Just as horror movies are desperate to come up with new, better reasons to make the use of cell phones not available to the dying one-by-one characters, AVP uses the most asinine reason to isolate the cast so no one can help.<br /><br />Get your head around this monstrosity...the Predators hunt Aliens in a pyramid 2000 feet below the ice on a remote island in Antarctica.<br /><br />WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!<br /><br />Of course they do. And the next RoboCop movie is set in a volcano below Vietnam. Honestly, it is the most ridiculous story ever concocted. How dare they release this gibberish upon an audience who, for a long time, deserve better.<br /><br />Despite the utterly moronic plot and pathetic characters, the film does do a decent job of tying both creatures together. Such as the Predator's fondness for triangles and multiples of ten. The Weyland-Yutani corporation's initial interest in the species. And the presence of Lance Henriksen, as Bishop's creator and the only cast member with credibility.<br /><br />The Predators get very little screen time (much of the film's meager 101 minute running time-14 minutes of credits-is devoted to wandering around dark corridors...how astonishingly new) and when they do show up they are total wimps. Though the main one is a bit harder, he's a bit too humanized at the end. His facial expressions are very, very cool however.<br /><br />One cannot help how much better this film could have been. Even with the awful Anderson at the helm, if Alan Silvestri's scores and themes from the Predator movies had been kept then the tame action scenes would have soared. As it is, Harald Kloser's score to the movie is generic and unengaging. Yet another missed opportunity.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`AVP, Alien vs. Predator' directed and co-authored by Paul W. S. Anderson is almost inevidably seen as pure exploitation of characters from earlier popular movies, especially since the whole premise was suggested by s quick shot near the end of `Predator 2' when we see an obvious `Alien' skeleton in the trophy case of the predator. This means the expectation invariably is that it will fall many cuts below it's exemplars, especially since the original films were directed by the likes of Ridley Scott and James Cameron. So, my mission is to examine just how this film inevitably fails to live up to its stellar parents.<br /><br />The first thing which strikes me is that the story falls into the same trap of every poorly written action thriller, in that no sooner do the major characters get to their dangerous venue than they start to do stupid things. The stupidity is so blatent here that the lead character, Sanaa Lathan, playing the ice climbing expert / guide has to point this out. The other side of this coin is that since we know perfectly well that this Antarctic venue will house at least one, or both of the most horrific alien monsters ever invented, which immediately spoils almost all of the mystery behind the story. When James Cameron did `Aliens', we also knew there was evil afoot on the `Alien' planet, but Cameron's point of view and strong characters made up for this lack of surprise. I found several other oddities in the story, such as the inconsistency between the object of the pyramid and the fact that the visiting predator warriors killed off the humans they found at the scene.<br /><br />Another problem is that this cast simply did not hold a candle to the strong casts of `Alien', `Aliens', `Predator', and `Predator 2'. No matter how good Sanaa Lathan was in the lead role, she simply could not hold a candle to the iconic performances and role of Ripley created by Sigourny Weaver (at the cost of being forever typecast into this persona). In spite of some earnest attempts, I simply could not connect with these characters as easily as I could sympathise with Schwarzenneger and Co in `Predator' or Cameron's excellent cast in `Aliens'. The only character with whom I developed any sympathy was `Aliens' and `Terminator' veteran, Lance Hendriksen's character.<br /><br />And, in spite of the `de rigeur' good special effects, the real attention getters were the great inventions of the original monster creations by H. R. Geiger (Alien) and Stan Winston (Predator), based on an idea by James Cameron.<br /><br />In general, I found the technical aspects of the filming and editing to detract rather than add to the experience. In one of the voiceover commentaries, the director said they made a point of making it dark, over anticipated studio objections. Well, I think the studio got it right. The fast action is even harder to appreciate in the dark than it would be in a well lit scene. Ridley Scott is famous for `dark' scenes (see especially `Blade Runner'), but he also seems to have the technique to carry it off.<br /><br />In balance, the movie still managed to entertain with a reasonably interesting, albeit totally fantastic premise and a closure to the rampaging aliens which fell well within believability, given the facts available from earlier movies. It was certainly better than some other stinker FX action works such as `Van Helsing' and `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Let's assess the "ancestors" of this "continuance": "Alien" was a genuine thriller with a surprising heroine in the person of "Ellen Ripley" (Sigourney Weaver); James Cameron's "Aliens" was a slam-bang roller coaster of excitement and thrills; the third one, "Alien3", may have suffered with plot but it did benefit from some interesting SFX and the acting of Weaver and Charles S. Dutton; and final installment, "Alien: Resurrection" featured interesting wordplay between characters portrayed by Weaver, Ron Perlman, and doe-eyed Wynonna Ryder, along with some really kinky erotic imagery between Weaver and the mother alien.<br /><br />As far as "Predator" is concerned, it ranks as one "Ah-nuld's" best, featuring an extremely testosterone-enhanced cast being stalked by the ultimate "big-game" hunter.<br /><br />We won't discuss the forgettable "Predator 2"...however,...<br /><br />"Alien vs. Predator" comes close to the latter as a deplorable addition to the Alien/Predator mythology.  Not that the other films didn't have any plot holes, AVP is so illogical, filled with expendable stereotypes, cheesy effects, poorly lit scenes, occasionally inaudible dialog, and an embarrassingly short running time (100 minutes).<br /><br />Even its predecessors had brilliant scores from the likes of Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner, respectively, that heightened the tension in the films.<br /><br />I think that another factor in the film's failure is the PG-13.  While I'm not a big fan of violence and gore, the two series' respective storylines are deserving of R-ratings and the plot development that such classifications may yield.<br /><br />I'm glad to see the usually incredible Sanaa Lathan in a non-typical role for an African-American female, although I wish the actress had picked a better vehicle for which she could make her sci-fi mark.<br /><br />As for Lance Henrikson, he would've done better by letting "Bishop" die in the third Alien.<br /><br />And totally ignore the laughably awful "commentary" by director Anderson, Lathan, and Henrikson.  I can't believe the latter two were aware that they were being recorded!</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Finally, after 14 years of anticipation, the ultimate monster slugfest arrived for moviegoers to witness the epic battle that is "AVP: Alien Vs Predator". Fans of the two franchises thought that this movie would have arrived to theaters much sooner than it actually did, since at the end of "Predator 2", audiences got a glimpse of an alien skull in the predator's trophy case, hinting that the two races had already met in combat. For some reason 20th Century Fox had trouble getting the movie off the ground, more than likely the scripts for the film were never good enough to do any kind of justice to either of the two franchises, so the execs at Fox decided to put the film on the backburner until a proper story could be crafted that would please fans of the series'. Eventually Fox found the right man to bring the two monsters together on screen, a director that has had plenty of experience with the science-fiction genre, none other than Paul Anderson (director of "Resident Evil" and "Soldier"). With the cast assembled, a talented sci-fi director behind the camera, and a story that would hopefully do justice to these two hugely popular franchises, it was time for the battle to begin.<br /><br />"AVP: Alien Vs Predator" begins when a team of archaeologists are brought together by Charles Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the co-founder of the very corporation that Sigourney Weaver's character Ripley worked for in the `Alien' series, to explore an ancient temple hidden under the Antarctic. When the team arrives they discover that this is no ordinary temple, it is actually a proving grounds for young predators to hunt the most dangerous prey alive, the xenomorphs (aliens). Now, the archaeologists are in for the fight of their lives as they are stuck in the middle of a war that no matter who wins, we lose.<br /><br />Director Paul Anderson has skillfully crafted an exciting monster smackdown that lives up to the quality of both character's respective franchises. It was interesting to see how this movie set into motion events that take place in the `Alien' franchise (which occurs many years after this movie), by setting up Charles Weyland's interest in the aliens. The movie also takes time to explore the rituals that the predators must go through to become the ultimate hunters, by showing how they achieve their vast array of weaponry and skills. There are other aspects of the story that links into each franchises established storylines, but I don't want to ruin everything for those that may have not seen this movie or any of the other films from the two franchises either.<br /><br />The movie featured a solid cast of character actors led by veteran actor Lance Henriksen in the role of Charles Bishop Weyland, a nod to his character Bishop from James Cameron's impressive film "Aliens". Along with the talented cast, the film also boasted impressive visual effects and costumes that brought the aliens and predators to life, and made their brutal fight scenes incredibly entertaining to watch. Even though it took 14 years for this film to finally be made, the wait was definitely worth it, plus, any sooner may have been too soon, because the technology of the film industry was finally advanced enough to bring this epic war to life in a realistic fashion that will make the creators of the series' proud and entertain fans worldwide.<br /><br />"AVP: Alien Vs Predator" is available in both PG-13 and unrated editions, both contain violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>What do you get when two popular science-fiction characters are pitted against each other in a Hollywood movie?<br /><br />"Alien vs. Predator" has made a dream showdown between science-fiction creatures.

If you were a fan of the Alien creatures or the Predators, then this film should be added to your collection.  The script could have used some fine-tuning. Did there need to be humans involved in this film? Probably not! Sanaa Lathan (Alexa Woods) fits nicely in a human lead role.  Lance Henriksen (Charles Bishop Weyland) is nothing more than recognizable character from the Alien series.<br /><br />Maybe the sequel should go something like this; eliminate the human element and go to the Predator and/or Alien's home planet. See how the Predators live, grow and utilized advanced technology.  And of course the question on how the Aliens would travel to each planet would have to be answered.

There may be hundreds of excuses as to why we are stuck with this version of the finished film...but to be honest, no excuse can justify AVP as presented. What was great about "Freddy vs. Jason" was that the film had the appeal of both series. "Freddy vs Jason" felt at times like a "Friday the 13th" film, and at others a "Nightmare on Elm Street" film, and the result was a really fun movie that took away nothing from either of the title characters. With "AVP" both the Alien creature and the Predator came out looking worse for wear, with humans looking stronger than both??!! The Alien creature, who terrorized humans for at least the first 3 films of that series, are treated as though they really didn't pose much threat to humans or Predators. The killing-machine-like Predator from the original film has evolved into a sympathetic creature, that actually allies itself with it's "cattle and prey"...humans? I think what also really hurt this movie was removing both creatures from their element. The Alien's should have remained in space, sometime in a distant future...not here on Earth in the present time. One of the key ingrediants of the Predator series, was the focus on heat and warm climate, the jungle in the first film, the heat-wave in the second. Suddenly the Predators are running around the Arctic? Too much was changed from both series backstories. Why suddenly throw in the "every 100 years" rule for the Predators? Why change the time-line regarding the Alien egg hatching and chest busting? It seems like this was just really lazy film making, and thrown together just to get this out for a Summer release. I mean really if this film represents the 45th script re-write...maybe they should have waited for number 46. I really wanted to like this movie....but I just can't recommend this one to anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>I just wanna let everyone know that they should not waste thier hard earned money on a terrible film like this. I personally hate fox studios for letting Paul W.S. Anderson direct this god-awful movie. I don't know where to begin but i will start with the setting of the movie. Antartica give me a break! Predator only lives in hot climate, i mean common a jungle, Los angelas. The acting was pretty horrible, im just upset they put Lance Henriksen in this movie becuase he was probably the only good actor, and of course he dies off half way through the movie. Anyway besides the corny so-called "emotional scenes", which displays terrible acting by sanna lathan, she becomes friends with the predator!!! Since when does predator become friendly!!! He makes her weapons too, unreal!!! All we needed was a love scene. it pretty much went down hill from there. Another thing which makes me angry is the make up effects, predator looks to human, they make him run with Sanna lathan, they were almost holding hands for godsakes!!! Way tooo much computer graphics. I didn't come into the theaters with high expectations but i mean give me a break this was complete garbage. Another thing, if your gonna make a movie with two sci-fi icons like alien and predator don't make the film pg-13. Big mistake! Alien and predator are sussposed to be extremely violent. My Whole review sums up that i Hate Hollywood and i hate how untalented directors are just remaking movies, and trying to make money by using stupid titles like ALien vs. Predator. I also hate Fox studios for ruining Americas two sweet sci-fi icons. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sigourney Weaver must be very upset. the only reason why i am glad this movie was made is so they could make a special edition dvd out of the original predator. Which i have to admit am grateful because it is about time. Thank god i didn't pay 10 dollars to see this i got a free movie ticket from the dvd. It was still an hour an half waste of my life. I hate FOx!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>Turn on the wipers because AvP just hit the windshield. 20th Century Fox has just mocked all of the fans of Alien and Predator.<br /><br />1979 - Alien hits theatres.  Groundbreaking.<br /><br />1986 - Aliens is released.  Even better than the original.<br /><br />1987 - Predator - An earthbound Alien.  A stunning blend of Action and Science Fiction.<br /><br />1990 - Predator 2 - Schwarzenegger is no where to be seen.  Audiences are underwhelmed.<br /><br />1992 - Alien 3 - The movie David Fincher set out to make is never released. Instead, a butchered version is sent to theaters.<br /><br />1997 - Alien Resurrection - What was once a great and dramatic trilogy is now a sci-fi popcorn movie for the average movie-goer.<br /><br />2004 - Alien vs. Predator - Since at least 1990 fans of Alien and Predator have wanted to see the two creatures face off on the big screen.  What us fans get is a mockery of the two franchises.  20th Century Fox had over 10 years to make AvP.  The movie that we finally got is embarrasing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The people who put together "Alien vs. Predator" learned absolutely nothing from Mel Gibson's "The Last Temptation of Christ."  One thing they should have learned is that you can have a successful American movie in which nobody speaks English.  This movie should have been set on a planet far, far away, but writer-director Paul W. S. Anderson sets it on Earth so that a bunch of characters who can speak English get to explain what is going on before they are killed by one side or the other.  There is some irony here because the opening credits are translated from the language of the Predators into English, but the key thing is the more these Happy Meals with legs explain the harder it is to make what is happening in this film make sense in terms of the "Aliens" and "Predator" series.<br /><br />That is because not only does Anderson set this movie on Earth, he sets it in October of this year.  The basic premise is that a satellite belonging to super rich guy Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) discovers a pyramid 2000 feet beneath the ice on an island in Antarctica.  So in the grand tradition of "Jurassic Park" (Anderson rips off a lot of familiar movies in cobbling together this story) he hires some experts to rush down and get there before anybody else.  Of course, the race is already lost but Weyland will not know that until it is way too late.<br /><br />Of those who are to probably die the three bodies that stand out are Alexa Woods (Sanna Lathan), the guide who knows about traveling on icy-snowy terrain, Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova), the archeologists who apparently knows about all of the pyramids on Earth and the languages of those who built them from Mexico to Egypt to Cambodia, and Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner), a mechanical engineer with a Scottish accent.  "Lex" is the sole voice of reason in the endeavor, Sebastian provides the exposition, and Graeme gets to be scared to his own shadow and worry about his two laddies back home.  Lex also has the advantage of being female as well as being the only sane one in the group, so you have to like her chances.<br /><br />While the ease with which Sebastian explains the meaning of everything in the underground pyramid is bothersome enough (the predators are kind enough to use Earth languages and an Earth calendar in the pyramid), the entire back story of how Predators come to be hunting Aliens is even worse.  I do not think having your audience trying to figure out how what you are doing fits into the continuity of the first movie in each series, let alone each series in its entirety, is a good thing.  I also bet I am not the only one who will notice the strong comparisons between this movie and a video game, which is not surprising given Anderson's experience with "Resident Evil."<br /><br />Another major problem is that everything on that Antarctic island or down at the pyrmaid happens in the dark (despite the fact that October in the southern hemisphere would "summer" and not the long winter), so that it is hard to tell what is going on or where it is happening.  This would be another lesson missed from Mel Gibson's film, which went to the other extreme in letting you see everything that was happening.  But "AvP" is like all the rest of this generation of specific effects movies where scenes are shot in the dark and constant cutting is used to give you a vague sense of the fight.  There is nothing comparable to the memorable encounters between Sigourney and the Queen in "Aliens" or Swarzenegger and the original "Predator."  They set the bar and this film faces some mandatory deductions.<br /><br />Fortunately the fight at the end of the film is the best of the bunch in terms of being able to see what is going on so that the film does try to end on a relative high note.  You will probably guess how things will play out in the end and you might even be willing to go along with the film's end game.  But if you have watched the "Alien" and "Predator" series with any degree of appreciation or affection, you are going to burst out laughing at the final shot of the film.  That is not a good thing in a monster movie.<br /><br />Final Note:  The Zenith City is so off the beaten path that we do not have enough screens to accommodate all of the movies this summer.  Consequently, when I went to go see "Alien vs. Predator" the markee outside the theater announced one of the other movies to be "Exorcist Without a Paddle."  Admit it.  Already you can envision the story line about how Father Merrin is up the proverbial creek and the deep announcers box intoning "Exorcist Without a Paddle."</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I haven't seen the Director's Cut version of the movie but suffice to say that this movie is average.  I have to give the Director credit for coming up with a logical plot to link Predator and Alien together.  Humans in this movie bring it home to the meaning, "at the wrong place, at the wrong time".  The entourage of explorers entered into the "forbidden zone" is an alibi to add to the headcounts and to keep the movie rolling along.  I really have to say that the nature of this movie is to make money and everything seems to be well-thought off by the studio.  One of the reviewers said it well that the age is pushed down to thirteen so that it would entice more audience and thus, profitability.  Then, you think of the additions of cast such as Lance Henriksen, who is there to entice and appease the original Alien's fan and then, there's Raoul Bova, arguably one of the more famous Italian actor and is certainly there to appeal to the European market.  Sanaa, the African American lead character and a younger and more dynamic version of Ripley plays quite an okay role but she doesn't have Sigourney's charisma and weight to carry the movie upon her shoulder.  Anderson, the director is good in making a straight up movie and he doesn't have the gravita of James Cameron, the moody appeal of David Fincher and Ridley Scott.  In the interview, he said it himself that the earlier versions of Alien and Predator franchises are classics and the last thing he wants to do is to bastardising the franchise and because of that, his reservation can only produce a half baked and unsatisfactory AVP movie.  His poster shots and the close up shots of Alien and Predator hitting on with one another are commendable but they don't make the total sum of the whole movie.  Overall, a could have been movie.  I find the making and the interview more intriguing than the movie itself.  However, on a wet and cold day, it's quite a nice way to spend an afternoon all alone.  Commendable effort.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>OK, this is a silly movie.  That being said, it is yet another in a long tradition of movies such as "Frankentstein meets the Wereworlf" or "King Kong versus Godzilla".  The history and science is all wrong and the action is clearly preposterous.<br /><br />Those statements out of the way, this is actually a pretty good monster flick.  The effects are all good, the story is involving if predictable (you can see you will die and who will live pretty early on, but so what).<br /><br />Sanaa Lathan is very effective as the lead in the movie (a female lead is a tradition in the Alien flicks).  She says all the right things, is able to pull of the physical stuff, relate to the correct monster, and do all the things a strong lead has to do.  It was also nice to see Lance Henrickson bringing his wonderful presence to another Alien film.  Note the name Charles Bishop Weyland recaps the name of his name "Bishop" in Aliens.  While it will help you to have seen "Predator" and the first two "Alien" films (or even all of each), you can watch this without any knowledge of the monsters.<br /><br />This movie is rated PG-13 because it does scare young people and there are some swear words, and while there is fighting, killing, and some alien blood, it is not full of gore and awful human suffering as any of the original films.  The fright here more comes from anticipation and what you know just happened off screen.<br /><br />So, for the kind of film it is attempting to be, it is pretty good.  Get some popcorn and enjoy it with your young teenage kids.  We watched it in the extended version and I recommend that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>As a hard core fan of the Alien series, and a guy with almost no interest in the predator series, I liked this movie.<br /><br />Poor Anderson (the director) had a lot to live up to.  Make a movie that satisfies fans who have been waiting upwards of ten years for a movie that successfully combines two popular franchises.  And don't forget that expectations were set astronomically high, so it was pretty much gauranteed that a lot of people would be dissapointed (Anybody remember "The Phantom Menace"?).<br /><br />I for one, enjoyed the movie.  I thought it had an average amount of action scenes that were well done.  The idea behind the pyramid and the artic setting was interesting, and the CGI and practical effects work were spectacular (Oh, and the use of red flares was a very nice touch).<br /><br />True, 90% of the charachters are alien fodder with almost no interesting charachteristics (except for Sebastian, Lex, and Weyland), but you all came to watch two intergalactic species fight each other, not to see well developed charachters.  A lot of people seem to hate the idea of humans and predators joining forces, but I for one liked it.<br /><br />I thought the action in the movie was quite enjoyable, especially during the last half hour, which features a lot of explosions, implosions, and green goop flying everywhere.<br /><br />Of course, the movie isint perfect.  At less then an hour and a half long, it's very short.  Blink an eye and it's done.  Not a good thing, because there's very little time to develop the charachters or the plot.<br /><br />But overall, I enjoyed the movie.  I for one, look forward to Alien vs. Predator 2.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>After watching the extended version and both commentaries [which gives an insight to what it takes to make such a movie]<br /><br />It is hard to take comic book characters come alive with any great success but this is the best ever with regards to any type of alien.<br /><br />I was glad to see Lance Henricksen back [the forrunner of Bishop]and my Predator was great.

YOU DON'T SAY A REVIEW ISN'T HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE OPINION EXPRESSED! GET A LIFE!<br /><br />i thought i'd hate this film but i actually ended up liking it more than alien ressurection and predator 2. i was amazed at how into the movie i was and how well the action was, being that it was pg 13. i liked the story and thought it was a pretty good idea, the whole right of passage thing and the link to the aztecs and egyptians. my only problem is during the last half hour, the whole team up with the human and predator could have been acted out more convincingly. i also didn't need the leading actress to do the arnold swarzanegger line "you're one ugly mfer" it came across so lame, it pissed me off. this lady could never fill arnold's shoes!!! other than that it is a good movie and it was great to see bishop again and i loved his dying scene. "don't turn your back on me!" flame thrower! also this movie feels more suspenseful than Resurrection and Predator 2, which is what these movies should be all about. what trips me out the most about this film is that Dan O'Bannon wrote this film, who wrote the original Alien. Cool!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I know that purist are not fond of what's been going on with their beloved Alien and Predator franchises, but truth be told this film isn't bad. All things considered they have come up with a story that works to bring the two classic creatures together to do battle in this fun action flick!<br /><br />I love movies and appreciate great works of art in film. I also am not above loving a good popcorn flick! Movies are here for our enjoyment, but unfortunately, some people are so pompous they forget what it's all about! ....... entertainment! I'm not knocking world class films like Gone With The Wind, Citizen Kane, The Godfather etc..etc., but all films don't have to be so profound......do they?<br /><br />This gimmick is no different than what was done in the 40's when classic films like 'Frankenstein' and 'The Bride Of Frankenstein' had sequels like 'Frankenstein meets the Wolfman'! Although it's not a classic, it's still a memorable and fun movie.<br /><br />These films don't destroy what was great about the classic, they actually pay great respect...a homage if you will to the original. If you don't like these films....fine, but for me I have to admit I enjoy them ...if done right. The unrated version is the best version I've seen and this film edges out the sequel, mostly because you can see all the action! Grab some popcorn and a beer and watch this Sci-Fi Battle Royal!</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>If you forget that this is the continuation of two very successful franchises, and consider this as a graphic novel adaptation, then it is actually a bit more successful than people give it credit for.<br /><br />In tone and spirit, this is much more of a Predator movie than an Alien movie - it is as an Alien movie this most disappoints. However, as Predator movie I would suggest this is better than Predator 2 was.<br /><br />The plot is set in modern time, when a heat signature revealing a hidden pyramid under the ice is seen by satellite. The owner of the satellite, played by Lance Henrikson, brings together a team of archaeologists, biologists and `security' (the equivalent of Star Trek redshirts I guess) to investigate. What they find is a pyramid used by Predators to hunt the ultimate prey - the Alien.<br /><br />The rest of the story is just bunkum, and don't think too hard about many of the continuity points because much of it does not quite work, but the action scenes are handled adequately, mostly by pilfering ideas from the previous movies and reproducing them in watered down form for characters we have not yet come to care about. Best original (-ish) idea was that the pyramid reconfigures every 10 minutes once activated, to add spice to the hunt and help split our characters up to be picked off one at a time.<br /><br />Saana Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver, but a stronger character than one might expect from Paul W. S. Anderson (who also directed Mortal Kombat). Nice to see Colin Salmon, the English actor of several Brosnan era Bond movies, in another role - shame it wasn't in a better movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a disaster as a movie given its rushed production and low bdget - but don't go in with any expectations of anything approaching even the worst of the Alien movies. Think of it as a so-so Predator sequel and you get the idea.<br /><br />3 ? stars - I'll opt for 3, because of the corny script at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>Acceptable blend of franchises. ALIEN vs PREDATOR delivers purely on popcorn action and comic book sensibilities to please hardcore fans. However, what we need is memorable characters and the humans are generic and not memorable as they are lost in the backgrounds and special effects (which are pretty well done). Also, one would think that the combining of these two modern cinema behemoths would be of epic proportions.  The movie is slightly over 90 minutes with only a few of each of the creatures running around. The movie plays more like a SCI-FI CHANNEL original movie than a major motion picture release (and will end up on that cable channel anyway). What the producers should have done to make this worthwhile, and hopefully someone will read and think of this review when the sequel of A vs P is in pre-production. That is to have the two franchises merge with another franchise...JURASSIC PARK!! Wouldn't it be great to see a Raptor and/or T-Rex fight an ALIEN and/or a PREDATOR. Now, that would be something!</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>I have to admit that the movie delivered more than what I had expected. The special effects were excellent with minimal use of CGI (I think....) and the storyline does have connections with the original alien quadrilogy as well as the predator saga. Expecially the Weiland corporation and it's owner were keys to tie this film to the alien ones. There were a few shortcomings however; The acting of the italian archeologist was poor, the change in interior ambiance of the predator ship compared to the one seen in Predator2 and the fact that some of their stabbing weapons melted, when in contact with the alien blood, but some of them didn't were puzzling. Also the use of the alien skull as a shield would have been impossible because the acid would have burned the girl's arm. Otherwise I did enjoy this movie and it was intense and bloody enough to keep me tense. Overall: GOOD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"AVP," as the cool kids call it, isn't that bad of a movie.  It isn't great either.  I'm a fan of the original "Predator" movies, so that's why I went to see this flick.  "Alien" and its successors never really grabbed my attention and the books that this movie is supposed to be based on can't be found at my home.<br /><br />Now that you know my background on this thing, let's get to the film, which was actually pretty good, if you go in expecting PG-13 fights and gore.  I knew from the get-go that there wouldn't be any major violence, language or sex, but the action that does appear on the screen is very good.  The special effects were flawless, and both creatures looked very believable.  In this aspect, the movie was excellent.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a really good plotline about an ancient pyramid found 2000' below the ice in Antarctica.  A crew, funded and joined by the king of solid, but average sci-fi, Lance Henriksen, investigates what's going on down there only to find the place to be a battleground for our title heroes.  The film then goes into a really, really good explanation of how these two critters came to arms against each other.  From there, the story goes into standard, but above-average action mode with plenty of violence for the adults but not so much that it turns away the always important thirteen to seventeen year-old demographic.  Before it's all over, the film actually gives you reason to pull for one of the bad boys, and it might even tug at your heart, but just a little.<br /><br />All in all, this film could have been really good if it was allowed to be an R-rated film full of really violent action.  Let's be honest, folks didn't come to see the Alien and Predator fight it out in close-ups and dim lighting.  They came wanting to see an all-out brawl between two of the sci-fi genre's biggest muscles.  I can understand why the boys at Fox wanted to keep this movie teen-friendly, since they probably make up the bulk of the audience who reads the comic that this movie is based on, but fans of the original films may be a little disappointed if they come in expecting too much.  Perhaps a sequel will come out(the ending almost guarantees one) that will be geared more towards an adult audience.<br /><br />In closing, this isn't too bad, just don't expect folks to be skinned alive or Sigourney Weaver to pop up.  I feel like I didn't waste my money on this one, and I'll probably get the DVD when it comes out.  I recommend it with reservations to big fans of either franchise.  This will probably go over better with the general audience, since they don't have anything to poke or prod the film with.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>went to see it with low expectations, so I was happily surprised. Its wasn't a great movie, but it didn't stink either</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>"No matter who wins... We lose". If the "we" they are refeering to in the marketing slogan for Paul Anderson's "Alien Vs. Predator" is the people who have to sit through it than they certainly should be rewarded for honesty. Fox's latest attempt to cash in on the success of dueling movie icons that caught on with last summer's "Freddy Vs. Jason" could not be more shameless and embarassing if they added Jim Varney's Ernest character to the mix. I can say from the very start that I wasn't expecting this extraterrestrial grudge match to be anything special, especially considering its "PG-13" rating but despite my low expectations, this one talk "bad" to a whole other level.<br /><br />"Alien Vs. Predator" involves a billionare who hires a team of random weirdos to go on an exploration of an Antartic pyramid. As it turns out, the title creatures are waiting for them. The Predators, a team of alien hunters who use invisible cloaking as a camoflauge are the first to attack. Anderson more or less recyles all of the killings from "Predator 2" but waters them down to the point where you feel like you're watching a bad made-for-cable movie. He also seems to conviently throw in new ideas for both creatures that lack any logic whatsoever. The "aliens" in this film seem to grow in minutes while in every other "Alien" film, it took many hours. Subsquently, while in the past, the Predator almost never came out of camoflauge during its hunts until the final act of the film, it seems to like to give away its locations at inappropraite times to give its human counterparts a chance to escape and its less-technical enemy a fair chance to kill it.<br /><br />Speaking of the humans, if there were ever a more boring set of characters thrown together for a monster movie, I certainly have never seen it. Sanaa Lathan's female hero is no Sigourney Weaver and it's amazing that despite all the damage she takes, she doesn't seem to have a scratch on her. She is punted like a football across the pyramid by the Predator but manages to run away after and even parades around in zero-degree weather in a T-shirt. Of course, all the characters are given pointless backstory that has nothing to do with the story at all. Ewen Bremner's obnoxious character in particular can't shut up about his two children. Even the reliable Lance Henriksen is all over the place as Charles Bishop Weyland (a "wink at the camera" homage to his android character from the Alien movies).<br /><br />"Alien Vs. Predator" isn't just a traditional bad movie, it is bad on an epic level. The first act is tired and dragged out with the characters explaining all of the pointless elements of the plot for about forty-five minutes. The second act has the humans, Predators, and aliens going at it with one another with no regard for logic, the series mytholigy, or good filmmaking. Not only are trademark elements and characterstistics from both series either toned down for the MPAA or just all together thrown out the window but Anderson manages to come up with his own cheesy rules for both. By the third act, anyone who loved both or either series has either gone crazy and walked out of the theatre or just begun to laugh out loud. I opted for the latter. Without giving away anything, I will say that the concluding act of this movie is so outrageously ridicilous that I honestly think Anderson just gave up and let his nine-year-old son write it. Think "Jaws: The Revenge". By the time the movie has ended, we are treated to a Queen Alien that moves like the T-Rex from the "Jurrasic Park" movies, a Predator that seems more like a poor clone of the ones used in the other films, and a sequence where face-huggers dive out in "bullet time".<br /><br />You don't need to have seen any of the "Alien" or "Predator" movies to watch this (apparently Anderson didn't when he wrote it) but it helps in enjoying the all-out rape of both franchises. Paul Anderson got a lot of negative criticism before this film came out for being a hack. I felt a lot of it was unfair as "Mortal Kombat" and "Resident Evil" (both of which he directed) were at least slightly entertaining. After watching his work as both a writer and directer on this project, I am starting to understand why there was such a collective moan from many fanboys across the world when he was signed on for this one. Fox will end up being the real winners here as they stand to make a great deal of loot off this embarassing mess of a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Alien vs. Predator" brings together the two most popular sci-fi monsters from the 1980's to duke it out in a winner-take-all battle.  The question is not "who wins?" but "does anyone care?"<br /><br />The tale begins when scientists discover an ancient pyramid mysteriously buried deep beneath the frozen surface of Antarctica.  In no time, a team of explorers and archaeologists is dispatched to the site to investigate the puzzling phenomenon.  While there, they discover that this is no ordinary ruin, but a temple established long ago by outer space aliens who have made their presence known in order to lure fresh human sacrifices into their trap.<br /><br />With a premise that feels an awful lot like a warmed over version of "The Thing,"  "Alien vs. Predator" spends virtually no time on character development and, instead, heads straight to the action - not an unusual course of events in a film of this kind, until one realizes that what distinguished both the original "Alien" and the original "Predator" from the typical action flick was having charismatic performers in the lead roles (Sigourney Weaver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, respectively).  In contrast, Alexa Woods makes for a pretty wan heroine and the supporting players are not much better.  And although this film predictably registers high on the goop meter, there isn't much inspiration to be derived - even for diehard action fans - from what is, essentially, two CGI effects going at one another for nigh unto two hours.  The sad truth is that the fight scenes quickly become monotonous and boring seeing as there is nobody on screen whose fate we really care about.<br /><br />About the only real surprise in this film is that the obligatory "fake scare" scene, usually given to a cat to deliver, is here performed by a penguin.</p></br><a href="../users/A39VJRIW7HC5C0.html">A39VJRIW7HC5C0</a><br/><p>A cast member is cocooned by the aliens.

After a Herculean effort, he reaches the gun and fires right as the facehugger is about to attach itself.  He yells with triumph...but then half a dozen other eggs open up and the camera pans away as we hear gunshots and see muzzle flashes.<br /><br />I highlight this scene because it was the only thing done well in the entire movie.  Aside from this scene, the movie was pure mercenary filth, an attempt to make a quick buck. Most people critisize the screenplay in this type of movie, which of course was awful, but the direction and special effects, and acting were lousy too.  This was just a bad, bad movie.<br /><br />Slow-motion is used in virtually every action scene, a human teams up with a Predator (who, incidentally, taught us how to build pyramids and used us as "cattle" to breed Aliens, their ultimate prey), and a former whaling village isn't found near a shore.  Continuity errors abound, the fight-scenes are chaotic and clumsily-handled, and characters are able to discipher thousands of years of buried history in five minutes so that the audience can have some idea of why Aliens and Predators are dueling in Antartica (and incidentally, we learned in the first movie that the Predator is drawn to heat).  The Predators are not fluidly moving creatures but husky 250 pound football players thumping along, and their once-frightening facial features have been reduced to money-saving masks that look like they were bought from a CVS.<br /><br />Oh, and just in case you figured you'd have a bet with your friends on who'll win, don't bother, the movie decides its better, even in a movie called "Alien Vs. Predator", to have no winner in the battle.  Pathetic.  1.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>What a challenge ! To take two characters like Aliens and Predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge. It is unimaginable. Each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been. Then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film, those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us, the audience. The situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension. The film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the backshop of the store known as ? The Old Curiosity Shop ?. So we revisit pyramid civilizations (three : Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian) and the great myth of all times : the Antarctica from which all these pryramid civilizations are supposed to have come from. Then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens. The general idea is that the space-visitors are the Predators, that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the Antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid. Of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born, for the hunt. Easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus. That's what we are told happened on October 10, 1904 and is going to happen again on October 10, 2004. Unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt. In a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life. Of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators. The result is absolutely perfect. The human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators, hence saving the world and the human race. The details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular. It reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation. All those vain people who believe in money, guns, science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain, so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences. But at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it. Though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round. The film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book, I guess. The DVD has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>We recently had re-editions of the two Predator movies and the unbelievable Alien Quadrilogy collection. These new versions or editions tried to prepare the audiences for what promised to be a match to remember, Alien vs. Predator.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie did not fulfill the expectations of the fans of the two alien creatures, but on the bright side it was more interesting and less campy than the previous crossover of Freddy vs. Jason. The film has some interesting points in the story but it takes too many liberties with the origin and purposes of the two main characters. The movie begins with Weyland enterprises (the same company who sends Ripley and her team to space on the first three alien films) assembling a team of specialists for a special mission to Antarctica, an interesting fact is that Mr. Charles Bishop Weyland is the same actor (Lance Henriksen) who played the characters of Bishop and Bishop II in the Alien series, which helps make the relation that he was the template for the droids.<br /><br />From then on, the story loses direction every passing moment, a pyramid was found in Antarctica and they must research why is it there and who built it. The answer? Predators built it so they could have fun hunting Aliens every 100 years. The team gets trapped in the middle of a pyramid filled with Aliens and Predators fighting each other.<br /><br />There are however some memorable sequences, the first encounter between the two creatures is just incredible, and even though the Predator ends up being the sidekick of specialist Alexa Woods (Saana Lathan), seeing the two alien species fighting each other is worth the movie. Even though the ending is basically the same stuff we already saw in Predator 2, the writer tried to give it a twist to let the door open for a sequel. I did enjoy this film because of the fighting and the visuals, but I have mixed feelings at the moment of deciding if the movie was good or not, I dare to say it is more of a visual feast than good storytelling and well, I kinda liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The aliens and the predators were cool, awesome, tough, nasty, and wicked stellar, and the woman who was the protagonist was a hot babe, too! There were a lot of fights, much suspense, very good special effects, and on top  of it all a happy ending. I won't give away the ending or the movie  but I will say that anybody who likes science fiction or monster movies should see this without a second thought. It gets 9 stars out of 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Way back when, a short story appeared in the pages of Dark Horse Presents that made a link between the creatures from the movies Alien and Predator.  Readers wanted more.  Many stories, comics and books later the match up finally made it to the big screen.  Unfortunately it did not have the lure and fascination of its lineage.<br /><br />Satellite imagery uncovers a buried pyramid in Antarctica near an abandoned whaling station.  A team is sent to check it out.  Apparently a team from space is also arriving to check it out.  The pyramid has characteristics of several ancient civilizations.  The features are all on the outside for inside the pyramid has more open space than any pyramid should.  This is a hunting preserve.  Every one hundred years alien hunters arrive to battle horrible serpents.  The archeological team accidentally sets things in motion a little too early.  An alien queen is revived, eggs are laid and the game begins.  From there the movie becomes straight action with little suspense until the ending.<br /><br />The Alien movies all take place in the future.  The Predator movies are contemporary.  This movie is contemporary.  Predator movies were action oriented while Alien gained fame through suspense.  This movie is action oriented.  By the end I wasn't sure why this film had been made.  While an Aliens vs Predator movie is a good idea this one seemed to bring in the wrong elements, or at least not the right ones.  Some scenes from the trailers are actually not part of the main movie, but part of a "history lesson" provided so the viewer has some idea what is going on.  I was also taken aback by how easily the pyramid was damaged.  Every fight crushed huge amounts of stone yet the pyramid had been intact after seemingly being used for millennia.  Definitely a disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>When I saw the trailer for this, it really looked great. But when watching it you watch a bunch of humans find a place buried 100's of feet below ground and end up stuck in there as a war between the Aliens and the Predators begins. But the stupid thing is, the first half is setting up the charactors, then the next half they have been killed off before you've blinked and it's just focused on one person, one Predator and there partnership. (They may as well have given her and the Alien a love scene to put the nail in the coffin)<br /><br />There was too much charactor development to just off everybody suddenly and focus on the warriors from another world. The ending was completly predicted and it revealed nothing memorable or worth remembering.<br /><br />How does this crap end up with a sequel? "we screwed up the first time, where gonnah try again, we only have have half a script, lets shoot it already" (another flop in the making)</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>"First comes LOVE---then comes MARRIAGE---and then the Pred-Alien in a BABY carriage!!!"<br /><br />Sorry, I couldn't help myself. And oddly enough, the old schoolyard taunt is strangely appropriate, as you'll soon see.<br /><br />Look: I wanted to see "Alien versus Predator" for one reason.<br /><br />I didn't want to see lovingly detailed human characters working through their conflicts and solving problems together.<br /><br />I didn't want to see a banal, sappy, feminist hero (Sanaa Lathan, a usually decent actress who did what she had to do as the awful Lex) spend some quality bonding time with a Junior Predator Hunter.<br /><br />All I wanted---and all I suspect you wanted---was a total interstellar smackdown between the Galaxy's two most-wanted Xenomorphs: H.R. Geiger's Alien and the 2nd-Amendment loving intergalactic hunter Predator.<br /><br />In short, I wanted killing, deep space style.<br /><br />Did I get it?  Yes and No.  But let's dig right into the guts of this interstellar pot-boiler. Tycoon industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (the great and nearly immortal Lance Henriksen, who is too cool for school in this outing) founder of the Weyland-Yutani corporation that figures so heavily in the "Alien" series, has reports of bizarre heat signals emanating from Antarctica. Being a rich, paranoid, somewhat delusional, completely obessive guy, he rounds up a team of scientists to go figure out what's going on.<br /><br />What's going on? You probably know: it's the smackdown of the millennia---the intergalactic space cockroach Alien versus the gun-totin' kill-it-n-grill-it Predator. Fun times!<br /><br />Right? Well, sort of.<br /><br />At its best, Paul W.S. Anderson's "Alien versus Predator" backs off and gives us what we want. We get a total ultimate whup-a** thrashing session between an Alien drone and a uber-confident Predator. We get slicing. We get dicing. The Aliens have never looked so sleek, so deadly, so menacing. The Predators are super-sized: bigger blades, sleeker weapons, hipper masks. Give Anderson's Special Effects team kudos for this (headed up by Roland Blancaflor, who has done every single sci-fi special effects gig ever---you doubt me?---try "Blade:Trinity", "Wild Wild West", "Planet of the Apes" (Burton version), "Titanic" and so on. The rest of the special effects team have equally awesome resumes. Look, stuff looks good here.<br /><br />Yes, the characters, and the characterizations, are awful. I prayed for all of them to die horribly---with the exception of project financier Charles Bishop Weyland (Henriksen), who brings a nice smoldering chunk of cool to the proceedings. Yes, Alexa is meant to be the heroine. And yes, I wanted her to die brutally, humiliatingly, and miserably from the moment I spotted her tyrannical, uber-politically correct little smirk. Barf.<br /><br />Yes, Lance Henriksen is admittedly cool. Like Clint Eastwood, Henriksen is one of those actors who can charm the camera merely by sleeping. "Alien versus Predator" is cooller by his mere presence.<br /><br />Really, though, there are three issues that will determine your enjoyment level here---and incidentally, why I'm giving this strangely subdued little flick four stars (and frankly, I just picked up the DVD of the flick if *only* as a pretty screen saver---gorgeous picture/sound tailor-made for showing off your new home entertainment rig---but otherwise not very loaded):<br /><br />1) Best film representation yet of an Alien Queen Mother stomping around and showing us her `War Face'.  I'd have the Alien Queen signed up with my Squad any day of the week, Master Chief Sir!  You go girl!<br /><br />2) The Antarctic ziggurat idea was nice---nicely delivered, nicely envisioned, gorgeously executed.  It was a handsome, well developed setpiece that could have served as a superb arena of death, pain, suffering, bloodshed, and carnage.<br /><br />Anderson uses it for what seems like maybe 15 minutes.  And wouldn't it have been a little more fun to see the characters threatened, challenged by, crushed to bloody fragments by the shifting walls and crashing barriers?<br /><br />3) The critters have never looked better.  The flick delivers four-score and seven years when Anderson just pulls back and lets them pound out their deep-space loving.  The Alien is happy, the Predator is happy, and we're happy.  Like the light saber duel in that first Star Wars prequel---that's what we're here for!  Would it really have been so bad to give us more?<br /><br />I'm an Aliens & Predator franchise fanatic: bear that in mind. Half the joy of the flick (apart from the signature critters going mano a mano in a pre-Colombian labyrinth) comes from seeing my two beloved franchises brought into a bloodthirsty close encounter: from the brutally practical Aliens-style green computer block lettering in the opening credits shunted out by the Predator blood-red tactical lettering, to the surprise visitor at the end of the flick.  If you came to see Beast on Beast, then you'll go home happy: otherwise avoid.<br /><br />And remember: per official Company directive, this movie is totally expendable---and so are you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>I can't stand the director of this movie , Paul W.S.

PREDATOR was pretty much exactly what I thought it would be. The movie could have been a lot better, but it could have been a lot worse, too. The movie kind of explains part of the history between the two different races, but doesn't go into much detail. The movie takes a while to get going and because the people in the movie are killed rather quickly, it doesn't leave much room for suspense.<br /><br />One thing I am curious about from the film. Lance Henriksen play Charles Bishop Weyland, a man who is the father of modern robotics and likes to dabble in archeology. In ALIENS, Henriksen portrayed the android Bishop who was responsible for saving Ripley's life.  I don't think the connection is a fluke:  did Weyland create Bishop?  I don't know, but it's kind of fun to think about.<br /><br />Overall, ALIEN VS. PREDATOR is a decent movie and average sci-fi flick. Perhaps it will make more sense in the future once more of these films are made (and they will be).</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>this ALIEN vs PREDATOR is ok...nothing brilliant, but a decent movie for the clash of the 2 coolest aliens of the galaxy...While Alien is some kind of alien parasite, brutal and without much thoughts, the Predator is a more humanoid form, with interstellar weapons and some war techniques...They are soooo cool!

Predator (2004)...seems for many reviewers, the second part of that statement holds true, although not in the context those who made the film meant it to be taken, and that's too bad, especially since many of us have waited some 14 years for this event to reach the silver screen, first taking notice of the possibility while watching Predator 2 (1990) starring Danny Glover (I would have liked to been in that casting meeting...'We can't get Arnold Schwarzenegger for the Predator sequel, so who's our next logical choice?  Danny Glover?'...in his defense, he was a hot property, appearing in Lethal Weapon 2 a year earlier).  The sequel was certainly mediocre, but the ending, with the appearance of the Alien skull in the trophy room (and the illusion that someone someday would make a film worthy of these two monumental characters), almost made the whole experience worthwhile (actually, those of us who read comics throughout the 90's were treated to a number of Predator/Alien match ups, which really only served to fuel the fire).  Written and directed by Paul `You either love him or hate him' Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Resident Evil), the film stars the very curvaceous Sanaa Lathan (Blade), the extremely Italian Raoul Bova (Under the Tuscan Sun), and the always crusty Lance Henriksen (Near Dark, Pumpkinhead, Alien?).<br /><br />At the start of the film we see a satellite, own by the Weyland Corporation, orbiting the Earth, taking pictures, focusing on an area in the Antarctic.  Thermal imaging indicates a large power source sitting underneath a ancient pyramid (all under 2,000 feet of ice), which peaks uber rich industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland's (Henriksen) interest enough to warrant a full scale expedition, and so begins the gathering of various specialists together, including ice climber and guide extraordinaire Alexa `Lex' Woods (Lathan) and archeologist Sebastian de Rosa (Bova), among others...but they're not the only ones making the trip, as we also see a Predator spacecraft arriving into Earth's orbit.  The expedition does find the subterranean pyramid, but their presence activates the emergence of a shackled Queen Alien, who begins laying gooey eggs as part of some as of yet undefined process that will eventually include not only the humans, but the Predators as well.  What's the purpose of the pyramid, and how are the Predators and Aliens involved?  Well, I could tell you, but I don't think that would be fair to those who haven't seen the film (I purposely avoided reading anything about this film, as I wanted to go into it `fresh'.)<br /><br />So, was our lengthy wait for a Predator/Alien match up justified with this film?  According to many the answer would be no...and, for the most part, I would tend to agree.  The main problem is, in my opinion, that expectations were very high, so high in fact many had doubts prior to the film even before it was released.  I, on the other hand, came into this movie with limited expectations, and still was a trifle disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, I really liked the fight scenes between the Aliens and Predators, what little of it there was (it takes almost a full hour before we first see the two tussle)...and the creatures effects were handled very well...there were just so many inconsistencies in the story.  One problem, among many, was the gestation and subsequent maturation of the aliens themselves...prior Alien films indicated this wasn't a process that took only a couple of hours (as in this film), but at least a day or two...maybe these were aliens of the `quick gro' variety.  Also, what was the point of the interior of the pyramid changing its' configuration every ten minutes?  The only reason I could think of was because it was in the script...and the film indicates Aliens and Predators have been on the Earth for hundreds, if not thousands of years...how come no one had found evidence of this prior to the events in this film?  Okay, I can see how the Predators, with their advanced technology, could keep their arrival on Earth a secret given our current state of technology (via the use of cloaking devices, I suppose), but what about when they fired that intense laser beam from space, melting a giant hole 2,000 feet through the ice to access the pyramid?  Seems to be if we can detect a comparatively minimal heat source beneath the pyramid, we should also be able to detect the sustained laser blast, if not the source...the story is full of stuff like this, things that just don't make sense.  The acting wasn't bad, but the human characters are lifeless and serve no purpose other than to facilitate the story...I know, I know, the human element isn't what we came to see in this film, so their role is in accordance to the story, but I would ask why have them in the movie at all?  Just give me the Aliens and Predators...imagine that, and entire film with these two alien species, no dialogue at all...that would have been interesting.  Anderson's direction is passable, but borders on shoddy more than I would have liked.  Oh, and let's not forget the PG-13 rating...strange that the individual films featuring the Aliens and Predators were all R rated, and yet a meeting between the two would be reduced to kid friendly material.  All in all I'd call this a film of missed opportunities worth renting for a few scenes, but not much else.<br /><br />The picture looks good (some scenes were a bit murky, though), and the special features are listed on Amazon, so I won't bother rehashing them...one thing I found annoying about the extras was the amount of plugging by Fox...just gimme the film, for crying out loud, and quite trying to bury me in all your promotional junk.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>This film is a comedy, I cracked up in this film.

S. Anderson, 2004)<br /><br />I've been a fan of the Alien movies for almost twenty-five years, and a fan of the Predator movies for almost fifteen. (Yes, I even liked Predator 2 and Alien 3.) So honestly, I walked into this movie expecting to loathe it, even though Paul W. S. Anderson was responsible for Resident Evil, one of the few videogames-made-movies worth watching.<br /><br />But first, a few words on one of the strangest theatergoing experiences I have ever had. I was in Akron, OH, this weekend, and went to see the movie while my wife was in class. So I was somewhat out of my usual sphere of cinemas, and went instead to the closest place to where we were, a Regal Cinemas outpost just off Rt. 77 in Fairlawn, OH.<br /><br />While the floor wasn't littered with trash or anything, "dirty" was the word that kept coming to mind. There was just something inexpressibly grimy about the place that kept me from feeling comfortable at all. This could well be because I'm used to the insanely-well-kept Cinemark in Valley View, which is pretty much the king of theaters, but there you go. Add to that the insane matinee price (I've paid less than the matinee price at Regal for evening shows at some theaters within the past year) and the insane drink price-forget popcorn (six bucks a tub!)--and I was set to hate Alien vs. predator even more, because it gypped me out of eight bucks more than it should have had I gone to see it at Cinemark (and let's not forget Cinemark has free refills on popcorn, making back-to-back moviegoing such a pleasant experience).<br /><br />Then I got into the theater about twenty minutes early, and instead of the usual projection of still-frame trivia and the like, I walked in on a short promo piece about both the upcoming special-edition DVD of Resident Evil and the upcoming film Resident Evil: Apocalypse. It was followed up (with, of course, commercials in between everything) with short features about other stuff, like the new animated NBC series Father of the Pride. This, folks, is what we should be doing with our time twenty minutes before a movie, not trying to unscramble such difficult-to-fathom-when-scrambled names as Ali Larter. Sheesh. Cinemark, most everything you do right, but this is one place where dingy, dark Regal outscores you big-time.<br /><br />(Also, a trailer for Paparazzi, the first picture from the mighty Icon since The Passion of the Christ, and my, my, does it look fine.)<br /><br />But now. Aliens. Predators. A slew of good reviews from critics and a cadre of fans over at IMDB who have trashed it right into the ground. Basically, they're saying all the things I thought I would. But I'm not going to.<br /><br />Sanaa Lathan (Love and Basketball, Life) is Lex, basically a Sherpa guide who happens to come from somewhere in America. She, along with a bunch of other folks, is approached by Maxwell Stafford (Resident Evil's Colin Salmon), a rather twee representative of Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the ancestor, if you will, of the AP in Aliens and the Weyland character in Alien 3 (both also played by Henriksen). One of Weyland's satellites has discovered some kind of heat signature over a small remote island off the coast of Antartica; judging from the walls, it's a pyramid, two thousand feet below the ice. Everyone is rather excited; this could be a major archaeological find, and Weyland and co. want to be the first ones there (over Lex's objections, since no one in the party is trained for this sort of thing). But you can probably tell by the title of the movie that archaeology is not what will be going on in this movie. And as soon as you see the pyramid, you will know the what, the who, and the when (as in, during the next hour and change of film). The how and the why will be explained to you, don't worry.<br /><br />Anderson here does a fine job of keeping with the parallel structures of both franchises (you don't actually see a monster for a while, letting tension build), except there's not much tension to build. Anderson has made the mistake that both Richard Donner and John McTiernan avoided: he's simply got too many characters running around to give us enough empathy with them in the space of forty-five minutes or so before the action begins. A possible budding romance between Lex and the team's chemical engineer, Graeme (Julien Donkey-Boy's Ewen Bremner) wanders off the face of the movie, never to be seen again; an opening shot featuring an archaeologist (Under the Tuscan Sun's Raoul Bova) ends up being a shaggy-dog joke; some of the characters are never introduced to us at all before the team is assembled, so we know very little about them except, if you're paying very close attention, their names (and in one case, what a character does; the rest seem to be there to provide predators with appetizers before they move on to the main course of Raw Scientist). And despite Anderson's beliefs as stated in the AvP special shown on Fox last week, Sanaa Lathan's character ain't no Ripley, by any stretch of the imagination. Lathan is a fine actress, but she has massive boots to fill, and I'm not sure anyone could have done it.<br /><br />So, all that said, why was I so awed by the spectacle that was Alien vs. Predator? Simple: the special effects.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of special effects. I'm the guy who didn't even notice bullet-time in The Matrix, and had no idea what people were talking about until I saw The Art of War (on video!). But every once in a while, a movie pops up with special effects so brilliant, and so well-integrated into the scenes, that you cannot help but sit there, jaw agape, at how well they fit everything together. One scene in particular is so well-rendered that I actually wished Elias Merhige would have directed this picture, because he would have lingered on it longer.<br /><br />Of course, the movie does go over the top into SFX cheese territory a few times (the bullet-time facehuggers provoked a laugh from the audience, as I figured they would after seeing them in the TV promo special), but for the most part, Amalgamated Design, Inc., earned whatever they got paid for this film, and whatever it was, it wasn't enough.<br /><br />Even though I went into this movie with high hopes, I realized about halfway through (while I was formulating that too-many-characters bit in my head) that I wasn't going in expecting Alien or Predator; I'd have had to be nuts to think I was going to get a film with that level of expertise from Paul W. S. Anderson, who's a fun director, but not a creator of deathless art. Once I allowed myself to think the film was going to be brainlessly entertaining, that's exactly what I got. The little in-jokes were fantastic, and some surprisingly subtle (did you catch the homage to an earlier franchise film with Lex and the bottlecap?), the action was fun, the effects were monstrous. One thing I did wonder, though-- why were all the aliens so little? Though, granted, the time frames in this movie were stretching anything remotely resembling reality, the original Alien burst out of John Hurt's chest and grew to full size in an exceptionally short period of time (remember that Ripley, in Aliens, puts the timeframe of the original movie at "less than twenty-four hours" when addressing the soldiers), so it's not like these guys take a long time to grow up. And has anyone noticed how, with each successive movie, the gestation time of an alien, once it reaches its human host, has gotten shorter and shorter?<br /><br />Still, despite all the nits to pick, Alien vs. Predator is the kind of effects extravaganza that's going to appeal to a goodly portion of the masses. And, for some reason I can't understand, this time I'm one of the masses it appeals to. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>I don't get it.  The Cave got 2.5 stars overall on Amazon.  I liked it.  AVP is getting ripped on and I liked it.  First of all fans should have had their expectations very, very low when they heard Paul W.S. Anderson was directing.  I didn't really like Alien, but if you were a big fan of that and Aliens you should have known that this movie wasn't going to have great acting or a good plot.  If you take AVP for what it is, its pretty fun to watch.<br /><br />Now, yes I know.  It kinda takes any scare away that the Predators and the Aliens had.  I thought that when the girl and the Predator were outside they were gonna start kissing or something.  Also some of the parts of the fight scenes did make you unintentionally laugh.  But thats the director they have.<br /><br />This movie could have been a more horror-like movie like Alien, but the director chose to make it a lot more action oriented.  Was that a bad idea?  No.  Would this have been a better movie with a different director?  Probably(Unless they got Uwe Boll!  Give me Anderson any day over him)  Is the acting subpar?  Yes.  Is it fun to watch Predators and Aliens fighting to the death?  Heck Yes!  Does the movie do what movie are supposed to do, which is entertain?  Yes.  So therefore this is not a bad movie.  If your not a big fan of Alien you'll probably enjoy this movie a lot more, I know I did!<br /><br />Oh, they are making AVP 2.  Filming starts this September and it will be directed by.......UWE BO....No, its not that bad.  Its gonna be directed by two brothers.  It will be their directorial debut.  I say better than Anderson.  The title is<br /><br />AVP 2:  Survival of the fittest.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>It will blow you away when you see those those Predators fighting the aliens and being a ally to the humans. The battle is in Antarctica. The Predators have a device were it too many aliens are coming up to them then they have no other choice but to blow themself up. I wish this movie was rated R cause the original Alien and Predator movie's were this being rated pg-13 is what miss it up.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Forget "Spiderman 2," this was the film I was looking so foward too.  That was until I saw the TV spots and I heard those dreaded words, RATED PG13.  My heart sank.  How can a movie based on 2 hardcore R rated film series compromise itself with a lesser rating?<br /><br />The storyline was clever.  The special effects were great.  The alien was relentless in his pursuits.  My problem lied with the Predator.  (...)  We want gore, blood, guts. Instead we get a friendly predator who makes nice-nice with a woman and they tag team the queen.  Still, I enjoy seeing any monster movie.  At least after many years of rumors, it was made.  My main objection is that it could have been so much more.  Maybe the sequel will go for it and not worry about attracting the teenie bop market.  Oh, yes!  Look out for the lamest ending.  I mean, please.  So much material in these legacys and that is the best they can do?</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>But if you are to truely enjoy this film forget alot of what you know about the Predator and Alien films and just enjoy it for what it is. This is by no means a good film but it is entertaining anf fun, even though it does not make alot of sense at times. I wish it could have been better or even have an R rating. But this is what we got so just enjoy it. Also I know there is a 2-Disc Collector's Edition coming I just don't know when, but wait for an announcment but it will proabably be here by the end of summer or fall...</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>The special effects were okay, but the story was weak, silly, and predictable.<br /><br />As a kid I loved the Alien movies.  Aliens (the 2nd one) is considered a classic in our house as we still laugh about how my mother caused M&M's to rain down on the theater after an alien scared her.  So, with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some of the memories.<br /><br />What a disappointment.  It wasn't scary at all.  People in the theater were actually ***SLEEPING***.  I was jealous of them.  I was mostly glad that this was a short movie.  Sadly, the scariest thing in this movie was a penguin.<br /><br />Don't see this.  If you are a big alien or predator fan and must catch it, wait for video or HBO.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Before this film even existed I was never familiar that there was a whole universe of Alien vs Predator type stuff like comics, games etc so I was quite shocked that they made this movie and felt it would simply be another vs movie much like Freddy vs Jason. In a way it became what I expected it to be but with a little more on top, it was disappointing yet enjoyable at the same time. The major tag line for the movie was "Whoever wins, We lose" which when you watch this film you come to learn that actually that's not strictly true. The story is about a team of Archeologists who discover that there may be an ancient Aztec temple 2,000 feet under the Antarctic ice and they want to go on an expedition to explore this temple, however they find themselves in the middle of an even greater problem, a war between Alien species.<br /><br />This wasn't a reflection of what you would expect from a typical Alien or Predator movie as there is very little blood and guts and little genuine horror. We are given, however, a more human look at the Predators as we come to learn that them being on our planet is simply a hunt and they don't injure or maim those who are un-armed. To those familiar with the comics or graphic novels of the AVP series this may be a regular thing to see but to those who are just familiar with both sets of movies, this is a surprising dimension to be given to the Predators.<br /><br />Paul W.S. Anderson received a lot of criticism for this movie and to some it may be rightly so but to me I feel it's unfounded as I saw this to be a very good and entertaining movie that most everyone should own.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>It was the franchise slugfest fans thought would never happen except in comic book form. After years and years of failed attempts and false starts, the powers that be finally got it together. Hoping to capitalize on the surprise success of the merging of two successful horror franchises with Freddy vs. Jaso, two of science fiction's most popular creatures go toe-to-toe in Alien vs. Predator with those pesky humans caught in the middle.<br /><br />There's not a clich&eacute; that this film doesn't like. The disposable characters are broadly sketched. For example, a bottle cap worn around a character's neck is considered a defining trait. The film even manages to include that old chestnut where characters outrun a fireball explosion.<br /><br />Fans waiting for the two alien races to start slugging it out will have to wait almost an hour until their first battle but it is pretty impressive as they toss each other around like something out of a comic book. Admittedly, the fight scenes are pretty cool in all their CGI-assisted glory but this is hardly an endorsement.<br /><br />Poor Lance Henriksen is slumming it here as an egotistical businessman who provides the only human link to the other Alien films (it is hinted that he is the inspiration for the Bishop android in Aliens). He's only in maybe a quarter of the film before being quickly dispatched.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson and actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They plug along gamely seemingly oblivious to the narrative mess that is this movie.<br /><br />Also included is an audio commentary by visual effects supervisor John Bruno and creature effects designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. Anyone who likes to listen to these kinds of details will find this track informative.<br /><br />There are three deleted scenes totaling two minutes and include a little bit of Predator humour that was rightly cut.<br /><br />Also included are two trailers and a gallery of the comic book covers to Dark Horse's Alien vs. Predator series.<br /><br />Alien vs. Predator was not worth the wait and fans of the comic book will feel cheated. The film starts off slow but once the Aliens and the Predators start pounding each other the weak script and clumsy plotting fades mercifully into the background. It's a shame because both of these alien races are ripe for countless story ideas that subsequent sequels have not been able to capitalize on effectively. All we are left with is a good looking, paint-by-numbers movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>AvP is every bit as good as the previous films. What did everybody expect, Sigourney Weaver and a very fake robot? That truly is the only difference. This film is excellent. It is a very good mix of Stargate, the Mummy, Alien, and Predator.<br /><br />This film is FULL of suspense. That scene in the camp with the Preadators gave me the shivers. It is also very surprising, and intense. I won't tell you too much, but let's just say the one lady left with a gun "and in this case an ally" is used once again.<br /><br />See it, and let yourself get into it. Don't be skeptical please.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Oh so much unrealized potential in this movie.<br /><br />The best elements of this film have been borrowed from better films.  The rest of the elements are copies of other crappy films.  That about sums it up.<br /><br />Films like this don't have to be necessarily plausible, but they should be plausible within the context of the suspended disbelief we are asked to come to the theatre with.  This film again fails miserably.<br /><br />Worst part?  The script.  It is just plain LAZY.  Lame dialogue executed by bored or undertalented actors.  You know INSTANTLY which characters will die because they either don't have names or they talk about how much they miss their kids.  In B-movie land, that is the kiss of death.  Lead actress Sanaa Lathan reads each line the same, and her acting range runs the gamut from A to, well, B.  Not entirely her fault, though.  Any moviegoer with any sense of narrative sense knows that the script and dialogue are weak, weak, weak.<br /><br />Watch the movie and see how many moments or ideas you see that are stolen directly from other films:<br /><br />"Armageddon" and "The X-Files movie" are the primary theft victims.<br /><br />20th Century Fox had YEARS to develop a decent screenplay and hire a decent director.  Apparently they chose to do neither.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  If you are just super gung-ho on seeing it just out of loyalty, a sense of completion, or morbid curiosity, then go ahead.<br /><br />But you'll be sorry.<br /><br />Okay, a couple of specifics so I don't just sound like I'm ranting for the sake of ranting:<br /> --The team of "experts" called in from across the globe to investigate..... wow, that's original.  And all of them are young and good looking (at least the central characters).  One of these experts can even decipher within moments, with stunning confidence and ease, an ancient heiroglyphic language that is a hybrid of three ancient cultures.  Good job, buddy.<br /><br />---The sick, aging billionaire who appears at the top of the stairs and, with no prior introduction to the audience or the characters, launches into his fantastic story about how and why the "dream team" was assembled.  This is an oft-overused cliched movie moment, ain't it?  Answer - yes.<br /><br />-- To hide the fact that it is too difficult to make fight scenes between the Aliens and the Predators look realistic, they shoot the scenes in extreme close-up and with rapid-fire editing so you never really get any kind of sense of space or size.  You just see 1/2 second glimpses of fists flying, weapons firing, and acid dripping.<br /><br />-- The alien ship carrying the Predators comes closer to the Earth than the Moon is, launches a cutting beam and 3 Predator-carrying pods to the surface, and apparently no space agency or defense agency takes notice.  Just like "Independence Day" - remember how those big ships got so close to the Moon that Neil Armstrong's footprint in the dirt was vibrated into oblivion, and ONLY THEN did some lone yahoo at a super-high-tech observatory notice something?  I mean C'MON!  We can spot planets and asteroids hundreds of millions of miles away, but we can't spot alien ships until they are as close as the Moon?<br />That is simply another example of lazy, grade-school B-movie screenwriting.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but you should get the drift by now.  I'm not claiming that "Alien" or "Predator" were based on actual events and thus beyond criticism for their liberties with plausibility.  But those two movies at least kept their foundation in CONTEXTUAL plausibility.<br /><br />This "AVP" movie exists solely for the sake of pleasing the undemanding fan who just wants to see an Alien fight a Predator under any cirumstances filmable.<br /><br />We deserved a better effort from the filmmakers and the studio.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>My first instinct is to report that this movie really isn't all that good, but when you think about it, how wonderful and subtle and artful could a movie called "Alien Vs. Predator" actually be?  So, I'll be charitable and say that some of the scenarios are interesting (like the continually shifting walls in the pyramid where most of the story takes place) and many of the battles between the two alien species are cleverly staged and fairly fun to watch.  Also, the DVD offers a slightly extended cut of the film in addition to the version offered in theaters, as well as some commentaries, so you get a good bit more than just a movie for your rental dollar or purchase price.  Still, I wouldn't choose watching this film over actually going out and doing something.  But, if it's raining outside and you'd be sitting home anyway, give it a whirl.  It's a respectable time-passer.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Let's face it, folks: there's no way this movie could be perfect.  Even the basic premise of the flick--bringing together two of cinema's most beloved extraterrestrial villains--is bound to fail on some level.  Doesn't mean the movie isn't entertaining, though.  The special effects are astounding (the aliens have never looked so alive, the predators never so...predatory).  And there's the guilty-pleasure of seeing the insectile creatures that took on Sigourney Weaver fighting the humanoid monstrocities that almost killed Danny Glover and the Governor of California (and DID kill the former Governor of Montana).<br /><br />The acting isn't always up to par, though Lance Henrisken sinks his teeth into his minor role (as always), and Sanaa Lathan makes her stereotypically-shallow role at least watchable.  The script leaves a lot to be desired, and there are plot points that got left out (due to the studio, from what I've heard, though I can't prove a thing).  All these negative things might make you thing you're in for a bumpy ride...and you are.  The GOOD kind of bumps.  This one isn't scary, no, but it's entertaining, and that's all it has to be, in my opinion.  A good entertaining movie that you won't mind seeing again sometime down the road.</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>Here we have the long awaited (by some, anyway) "Alien Vs.Predator" film.  Not as bad as I thought it would be, the movie still fails in some areas due to bigtime plot holes and worn-out dialogue cliches from past Alien and Predator films.<br /><br />Hey, the Predator species has apparently been visiting Earth for a long time before they got hold of Arnold and Danny Glover!  They've built a pyramid with three major Earth cultures on it-but the only one that is recognizable to any degree is Egyptian, and that is done pretty badly (some of us moviegoers ARE intelligent enough to recognize Khmer and Mayan/Aztec architecture, P.W.S. Anderson).  I do seem to remember that the Predator race likes hot places from the previous films, but for some inexplicable reason they decided to build their structure in the coldest place on the planet-Antarctica.  Unfortunately, this is but one of the many plot contradictions in the film-but enough of logic.<br /><br />Sanaa Lathan plays a paper-thin artic explorer/ice climber.  Lance Henriksen is a corporate mogul type; I guess this was before he got he got ripped in half by a Queen Alien.  The dialogue is rife with cliches lifted from the other films, like 'You are one ugly (fill in the blank)!"  It gets old pretty quick.  The real stars of the film are the Predator and the Aliens, complete with Queen, Facehuggers, Chestbursters, and adult 'workers'.  The fight scenes are pretty good, even up to the big finale.<br /><br />"AVP" is about 90 minutes of weak plot and some decent action, but not much more.  2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>As long as *we* is construed as referring to the hapless cinema-going public, then you have to give the promoters of this witless film credit for at least being honest.<br /><br />For the huge problem this film has (leaving aside small matters such as a lousy script, complete lack of originality etc.) is precisely the point that the tag line - wrongly - addresses: No matter who wins, we (the human race, that is) WIN. For surely it would be better to have just one set of genocidal bad guys roaming the antarctic wastes, and not two.<br /><br />As they're slugging away at each other *we* just don't care a jot who wins.

Even though it's a sci-fi movie, it has mass appeal. The characters, action and unique plot development deserve attention. Every element is well done. I've never watched any of the Alien or Predator movies, but I wasn't lost. Nor did the movie resort to lame explanations to 'catch up' the viewers who haven't seen the other films. It's sci-fi, so, of course, this isn't a 'based on a true story' kind of film. Expect the excitement and futuristic ideas that would characterize a film of this nature. It's an exciting rush. I was not disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Loved the Film, Loved the Sound, Loved the DVD.<br /><br />I got the Version from Best Buy ( Which has an extra that supposedly no place else has), the extra being a booklet of decent quality.<br /><br />Anyway, the leading Lady is superb.<br /><br />I chose the version which is the extended edition ( I have no idea if this an unrated or an R rated  version),  and I totally  enjoyed myself; the sound just worked brilliantly in 5.1<br /><br />This is layered with Mythology, and works on so many levels. The scope for expanding the franchise works well in this adaptation of the two myths.<br /><br />Lance Henrikson's performance is just great. And contrary to some people's  comments, the other characters are quite good, and very relatable; but for obvious plot reasons a few of them are 2 dimensional  characters, since they are there to bounce comments off, and only a few characters are developed  enough to be considered 3 dimensional.<br /><br />Great fun, excellent  addition to the mythos.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>This is a great DVD transfer of the non-stop special effects of Alien vs Predator (AVP). Enjoying even the great special effects of this film isn't enough to make for a really memorable sci-fi experience as it takes an engaging plot to make a good film, even in science-fiction.<br /><br />I don't believe anyone would think of this movie as part of the Alien series or try to compare it with prior Alien films. It obviously represents a "knock off" intended to attract from a large number of satisfied customers of the Alien vs Predator magazines. This doesn't mean that it shouldn't be considered good sci-fi film and I purchased the DVD hoping for a satisfying film experience.<br /><br />The story line does a nice job of connecting the film histories of the Alien and Predator races together and linking these two fictional accounts with the history of man on earth in a plausible way. Most people agree that the history of ancient monuments all over the earth appear to have a common link, which is probably one of the sources of the Atlantis myth.<br /><br />If anything I think AVP attempted to recapture the action and line up of good characters from ALIENS. Also, rather than the one-on-one bug hunt of the original film, this movie was about war between a defacto army of humans against an army of Alien creatures and their very dangerous Queen.<br /><br />In terms of special effects I would give this movie four stars, however, I couldn't get all that interested in the basic story and AVP left me with an overall one to two star impression and the feeling I was watching an animated comic book.<br /><br />I must admit that I never had the large screen theater experience and first saw the film on DVD at home. I assumed I would at least like AVP since I own the entire Alien series on DVD and enjoy seeing every one of them over and over again. However, I did find it worth watching and am looking forward to purchasing "Alien vs Predator Requiem"</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>You want a quick assessment? Here it goes. AvP doesn't measure up to the original Predator movie or the first two Alien films. While it works as a mindless action/thriller it completely fails to make the grade on the story level and the continuity level. Essentially what you have is a good looking package with little depth behind it. So if that's your think knock yourself out. I prefer something more.<br /><br />I don't know what it is with director Paul Anderson. He either has some good idea that ends up not following through completely or he has a not so good idea that turns out not so bad, but still doesn't really make the grade. AvP is no different. While the concept of Predators and Aliens battling out is very cool the way Anderson does it isn't. The idea was first conceived in a comic book by Dark Horse and then hinted at in a brief cameo shot on Predator 2. While this movie does borrow a mess of ideas from these the end result is still weak. The premise of Predators hunting Aliens as a rite of passage is a good idea, even if borrowed from the comic book and the whole Weyland tie in is interesting as well. So I'll admit props to those. The rest of it is tripe.<br /><br />Essentially the movie is half-baked. The whole origin of the mysterious pyramid in the Antarctic was not only laughable but also technically impossible. The reasons for the pyramid being there is even more ridiculous. While the characters are diverse and interesting nothing is really done with them, thus making them rather useless. The potential for character development was great but it never happened. The cast was very good yet they were hardly used effectively. Don't even get me started on how painfully little they did with a talent like Lance Henrickson. The continuity with previous movies is rather dubious. For instance the whole incubation period for the aliens seems a LOT shorter with aliens popping out of chests in about an hour instead of days. Also the Predators (save for one) seem to be painfully lacking in any hunting skills as they get picked off as easily as the humans. It's as if this was a clan of accountants or something. Rite of passage or not, you got to be at least good enough to take on the prey.<br /><br />So the story and character development are bad and there are plot holes that challenge Alien 3 on how major they are. The action and suspense aspects of the movie, however, are very impressive. You might find yourself at the edge of your seat at times with much of the action scenes. The special effects are also on the high quality level with nice animatronics, sets, and computer effects. The only special effects that I feel fall flat were the make-up and animatronics for the Predator's face. It just didn't look good compared to the previous movies, which seems strange since we're looking at over 15 years of technological advancements compared to the original films. Did I mention a stellar cast of relative unknowns that I hope I see more of in the future?<br /><br />This movie could have been so much better if more thought was put into it, but since that's not the case it's left to being weak. So if you're a stickler for continuity in the Alien and Predator universes you probably will find plenty to not like in this movie. However if you just want some mindless mayhem with cool effects then Alien vs. Predator will probably deliver the goods for you. If you want a good story you're not going to get one here. At best you will get a serviceable script that moves you through the action, but no depth whatsoever. Aliens vs. Predator is a somewhat sad take on what could have potentially be a fantastic merge of franchises.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>OK, let's get serious - 4 stars is a little generous, but this movie was EXACTLY what I expected, ridiculous, CGI stained, wispy plot, and GREAT FUN!!!. A PG13 rating precluded the usual gore fest that was associated with the previous Alien & Predator movies, and that will probably be this films biggest asset as a draw at the box office. Brief synopsis - Rich industrialist discovers mystic pyramid 2000 feet below Antarctica, assembles top notch team of experts to help unveil his prize, they all get caught up in a "every 100 year" traditional hunt of Aliens, deliberately cultivated to test visiting Predator warriors.

Since the Jurassic Park films, these aliens sound and behave a bit like dinosaurs.  The Predators are vicious, with some devastating weapons.<br /><br />The story begins when a group goes on a scientific expedition deep in Antarctica.  Satellite photos have revealed an ancient pyramid deep under the frozen ground.  The photos have also detected a heat source at the pyramid.  Little does this large group of explorers know that they are headed for a conflict between a hunter and his alien prey - a conflict for which the humans are used in horrible ways.<br /><br />The film's sets, effects, and music are amazing.  Can't say the same for the acting.  Fans of the Alien and Predator films will love this movie, as well as Sci-Fi fans in general.

But who knew the average viewer (i.e. me) would find so many mistakes...<br /><br />-Alexa's "warrior" marking on her left cheek disappears in overhead shots.<br />-When Alexa and the Predator are running from the explosion, across the whaling station, her "shield" changes hands.<br />-The full moon for October 2004 would be on the 28th, not the 10th.<br />-The large pulley and winch setup for lowering equipment and people down the ice tunnel completely disappears when the equipment sled comes rocketing back out. If it was in place, the sled would have slammed right into it.<br />-Icebreakers have round prows, not angled ones.<br />-The film gives confusing and inconsistent accounts of the geology of the area around the pyramid. It is supposedly buried under 2,000 feet of ice on an island, yet the pure-ice tunnel leading down to it begins at sea-level (as proved by the existence of the whaling station at the upper end). The whaling station is thus supposedly built on ice instead of rock; this is a ludicrous proposition as it would only be constructed in a region where ice melted enough each summer to allow whaling ships to dock. Anything built on ice that thaws significantly each year would not last 100 years. This arrangement also places the pyramid and a large amount of ice below sea-level; the buoyancy and natural flow of the ice pack makes this highly unlikely and not is not something that could be accurately described as an island in the first place. Further confusion is caused by the scene at the end of the film in which a large tank falls into the water and plunges hundreds of feet towards an unseen ocean floor, supposedly directly offshore.<br />-The story is set in October (summertime in Antarctica). It should therefore be daylight on the surface, and yet it's dark as night.<br />-When the Predator and Alexa turn around after the whaling station falls into the ground, the shot of them is reversed (notable by the marking and pressure tubes on the predators helmet).<br />-The second Predator is killed by an Alien when his head is punctured by the Alien's inner mouth. When the shot changes and the Predator tilts his head back there is no wound.<br />-Alexa is wearing only a thin sweater (and no hat) after the Alien burns her jacket, yet she doesn't even shiver while outdoors in Antarctica.<br />-The captions show the icebreaker approaching the island/pyramid from the Ross Ice Shelf. The island is in fact on the opposite side of the Antarctic continent.<br />-After the collapse of the whaling town, the "T" shape on the Predator's mask is backwards.<br />-Despite detailed satellite imagery of the pyramid, the expedition is surprised to find a whaling station at their intended drilling site. They must have missed this, as well as the large ship-worth bay it was undoubtedly located on: despite their haste, they choose a more remote anchorage that required a land journey over some significant elevation.<br />-Sebastian refers to "the Long Count" while describing a calendar that he refers to as "Aztec". The Long Count was a feature of the Mayan calendar system; the Aztec calendar, although based on the Mayan, didn't use the Long Count.<br />-It is said by one of the team that the whaling station is directly above the pyramid. However a geographical survey (as well as the obvious in-story shots) show that the ice tunnel slopes gently down towards the pyramid entrance, therefore not on top at all.<br />-Graeme Miller's description of the aurorae as being caused by protons and electrons in the atmosphere is inaccurate. The aurorae are caused by the interaction of oxygen ions with oxygen molecules in the ionosphere, leading to chemiluminescene.

However, the Aztec would not have known how long a minute is.<br />-When Alexa and the Predator are shooting up the tunnel, she isn't wearing the Alien head on her hand. She is clearly holding on with both hands. As they are thrown on the surface, the head reappears.<br />-The Predator cuts off the tip of the Alien's tail, spewing green acidic blood, and then tosses him through a column and into another room. As the Alien flies in slow motion, you can see that there is no blood on his stump, but immediately after, it's covered again.<br />-Sebastian erroneously says that the Aztec calendar was metric (based on 10).

Anderson has f*cked up once again.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>What can one say about a film based on a comic book franchise? One hardly expects high drama, an insight into society or a considered view of the world. What one expects is some reasonable form of escapist entertainment. This is probably not such a bad thing as some of the better films can hardly be seen to have been made with ponderous seriousness. Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, Casabalanca are effective films but in the intellectual stakes they hover around the Mills and Boon romance thriller level.<br /><br />One of the surprising things with this film are that the director appears somewhat brighter than for instance the film makers of the European Dogma movement who get a superior press. (I note however that among the fans of the genre he appears to be not highly regarded.)  The extras provided by the DVD have the director talking about the construction of the characters the development of the plot the attempt to make some logically consistent world in which the events take place. The impression one gets in watching him talk is of a talented and thoughtful craftsman rather than a dullard churning out a hackneyed plot. Still one would expect that as the amount of money riding on a project such as this would be considerable compared to a film made by a Danish film maker using a hand held camera and an improvised plot.<br /><br />The difficulty is however that if one makes a monster movie how to make it interesting. Part of the attraction of films such as Alien and Predator is that the films reveal the nature of the monster and his world during the course of the film. Surprise and fining out what is going on is part of the enjoyment of the film. By the time that this film is made the types of monsters one is dealing with are well known it becomes difficult to make the plot interesting. Of course Alien, Predator and Aliens had the same plot. A number of characters are put in a position of vulnerability. The role of most of the characters is to die at intervals increasing the tension with eventually one or two of the characters surviving by besting an adversary of supernatural power. Now with Alien, Aliens and Predator we did not know that the plot was going to work out on those lines. However by the time we get to Alien and Predator we have monsters whose characteristics are well known and we have some humans who we know will end up as cannon fodder with maybe one or two being destined to survive. It is hard to watch a film of this type when you can predict the drift and the main interest is to figure out who will be the Arnie or Sigourney character.<br /><br />In this film there is an attempt to vary the mix by making one of the predators a character. In fact they are like humans in that they use tools, computers and have a verbal culture. The aliens can act as a group, open doors and so forth but they play the role of Hemingway like big game to be hunted by the predators.<br /><br />The filmmakers try to give the film some overall logic by suggesting an Eric Van Daniken theory for the development of human society. Interstellar visitors have given man certain skills so that they can use Earth as a sort of game reserve or training base.<br /><br />The film sort of works if you try hard to lock out the various plot absurdities. The human characters act irrationally and stupidly in such a way as to make themselves vulnerable to both the alien species. Even in doing something like climbing a mountain or exploring subterranean caves real people take more precautions than this lot does. However the characters in this film not only discover a vast subterranean feature that emits huge amounts of energy but a gigantic tunnel is drilled mysteriously.  One would think that this might lead to some radio messages home or a bit of discussion about how to proceed. Not in science fiction movie land.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This movie is not as good as the original Alien or Predator but it is entertaining from start to finish nevertheless. A large corporation detects a pyramid under 2,000 feet of ice in Antarctica and assembles a team to explore it.<br /><br />The company is headed up by a mega millionaire, played by the same actor who was the android in the first two Alien movies. The star of the team is a mountain climber who is an expert in climbing ice walls. She is joined by a bunch of experts including an archeologist whose biggest prize seems to have been a Pepsi bottle cap found at one of his digs and another one who seems to only be interested in taking digital pictures.<br /><br />When the group arrives at the site they discover a hole has already been mysteriously burned into the ice all the way down to the pyramid. Rather than take time to assess the situation they head with reckless abandon down the hole to the pyramid.<br /><br />The pyramid seems to be a combination of Egyptian, Aztec, and Asian culture. Also, there are carvings of Predators and Aliens and a warning that only those who are "worthy" may enter. The pyramid has other surprises such as moving walls that cause the pyramid to rearrange itself every 10 minutes so its tunnel system is always different.<br /><br />As everyone knows that has seen the trailer, the pyramid is a training ground for Predator's to hone their skills by battling Aliens. Of course the humans start getting wiped out, first by invisible Predators and then by Aliens that want to drag them back to the Alien nest to implant Alien hosts in their bodies.<br /><br />The movie seems to waste no time in introduction and we seem to get to the action immediately. If you can ignore some of the downsides such as why the Predators don't use their invisibility against the Aliens, why the people are in the frigid Antarctica but have no visible breath, why they seem to be outside in the frigid cold sometimes without a jacket and not be cold, how they can be there with fingerless gloves and not have their fingers freeze, also the movie gives no explanation how whoever survives at the end will get back to civilization considering they are about 1,000 miles away from it.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>A satellite identifies an unexpected heat source in Antarctica, leading corporate bigwig Weyland (Lance Henrikson) to hastily form a search expedition.  Foremost among the team is Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan), a guide with experience traversing frozen terrain; Lathan's quite likeable in this movie, although she's certainly not on par with Ripley as a protagonist.  The team is told that their search will be risky, but the payoff seems worthwhile -- a giant pyramid buried under 2000 feet of ice.  When the crew arrives in Antarctica, they are stunned to find that a giant tunnel has been dug to the pyramid.  Before they know it, they're being attacked by two different species -- however, are they the prey or just unfortunate observers?<br /><br />AVP is a decent sci-fi thriller with fairly good effects.  Unfortunately, we never get to know the expedition team well enough to muster any sympathy when they find themselves being attacked.  In addition, most of the scenes are staged in near-dark -- the film ends up looking dingy and the action is sometimes hard to follow visually.  Finally, the plot doesn't really kick into gear until about an hour into the movie, when the crew puts together the pieces.<br /><br />AVP pulls from the mythology of both movie series.  As such, it's likely to please some fans of the Alien and Predator flicks.  I really enjoyed the Alien movies; however, I found myself fairly disappointed by AVP as it could have been so much better.  AVP is a decent b-movie, but not worthy of the Alien series.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>2.5 stars. With the phenomenal success of the comic book series it was only a matter of time and slicing of red tape before this film was made.  The result is about what you'd expect.  Having read and collected a few of the comics in years past I knew that if the film was done right it could be an entertaining ride.  I was a little surprised to find myself geniunely concerned for at least half the humans caught between the monsters.  However, nothing can save the film from eventual plot failure.  Not even some elegantly brutal fights between the beasties, which were staged effectively and were easily among the brightest parts of the film.  There is actually too much plotting going on, some of which purists of the orignal films will shriek "Blasphemy!" when they hear it.  There are some creepy moments, at least for viewers who know what squirms within those as yet unopened eggs.  There are even some humorous scenes, as in "nervous laughter," where you know the character is doomed but he doesn't.  Early on in the film, however, characters were jumping at shadows for no reason.  The creatures hadn't been introduced yet but the director thinks that the audience will somehow buy into the shock tactics anyway.  Not this audience member.  What carried me to the end of the film were the visual effects, some of which are excellent CGI creations worth a second look some day in the future.  But the story truly falls apart when one of the human characters befriends a Predator.  Right.  That's believable.  I could go into all the reasons why I think that shift in the plot is ridiculous, but other purists will understand.  When two franchises are floundering they stay afloat through a merger, combining their forces in the hope of regaining the glory days of the past.  There will never be another "Aliens."  There will never be another "Predator."  All the sequels that followed both of those landmark Sci-fi creations are evidence of diminishing returns.  Why get creative and come up with another fiend that enchants the throng when you can rehash old monsters and basically beat a dead horse?  I would expect nothing less from Hollywood.  To take a quote from the film "L.A. Confidential":  "Something has to be done.  But nothing too original.  'Cause hey! this is Hollywood!"  The visual effects are good, but the plotting and toying with the respective mythologies will drive purists into a frenzy.  This film is only a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>Perhaps one of the most high-profile, if not the most successful movie of 2004, was the sci-fi thriller `Alien vs. Predator'. The film, starring Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen, sought to double the thrills and suspenseful horror of both the Alien and Predator series of movies by bringing the two together in a monumental battle. With the majority of the action occurring inside a pyramid discovered underneath the Antarctic ice, this movie is essentially a prequel (as discussed in one of the commentaries) to the 1986 movie `Aliens' (which was itself a sequel to 1979's `Alien.' In fact, director Paul Anderson admits during his audio commentary that the James Cameron sci-fi thriller is his "default" movie that he is inclined to watch again (and again) whenever he is bored.<br /><br />Taking place in the present day (well Oct. 2004), Henriksen plays multi-billionaire Charles Weyland (and founder of the company which rules pretty much everything in the earlier futuristic movies) whose satellites have spotted what appears to be either an Aztec or Cambodian (opinions are split) pyramid below the Antarctic. Weyland assembles a team to investigate and upon arrival at the site, the group finds itself caught in the middle of a centuries-old battle between the Predators (from the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie) and their age-old quarry Aliens.<br /><br />Adapted from stories published by Dark Horse Comics, Anderson is able to stay true to the original movies while still setting his story in the present day. In fact, the actual reason and history behind the struggle between the two alien species surprised this reviewer. Henriksen, of course, has the standout performance in this picture, but Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver (star of the `Alien' franchise). This movie really shines in the special effects - which surprisingly rely more on traditional methods (as explored in a second audio commentary by the effects team) than the present-day reliance on computer generated imagery (CGI).<br /><br />In addition to the two commentaries, (the lighter Anderson, Lathan and Henriksen one and the second more technical special effects one) we also have a surprisingly involving half-hour documentary on the production of the feature. Separated into chapters, the featurette covers such areas as the development of the story (apparently numerous writers took a stab at the concept, but Anderson "hit it out of the park" on his first try), casting and special effects work (mostly miniatures and animatronics).<br /><br />The DVD also includes an extended edition of the feature that includes, among other things, an entire prologue set on the whaling station that is found abandoned in the theatrical cut. Presented separately from this are three "deleted scenes" which are actually more accurately extended scenes. There are also some rather lame Fox promos, including one for a `King of the Hill'-type cartoon named "American Dad" and the new Jennifer Garner movie `Elektra" as well as some examples of the artwork from the Dark Horse AVP comics.<br /><br />Generally of interest to the sci-fi crowd, if you enjoyed either of the two franchises on which this takes its inspiration then this should prove an enjoyable ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>First, I have to say that I have not seen any of the other Alien or Predator films. A friend really wanted to see this movie, and as a film buff who does not discriminate against any film, I tagged alone. I found the movie to be entertaining and fun, but nothing special. In development for almost 14 years, ever since a skull from the title characters in the Alien film series appeared in the spaceship trophy room in Predator 2, this film has been highly anticipated ever since. The Alien Vs. Predator story has crossed over virtually all forms of media before becoming a feature film. There was a successful comic book series, toy line, multiple video games, sound track (of the PC game) and even a card series, so it was about time a screen version hit theaters. While the film was very enjoyable, I think the PG-13 rating hurt it quite a bit. There were moments of pure tension that were cut short with bad editing so as not to show any gore. I found that unneccessary and bothersome. A solid R rating would have benefited the film quite a bit and added to the tense atmosphere. Also, at 87 minutes, including credits, the film was a bit too short. I would have loved to see some backstory and more character development. Other than that, the film was a pretty decent entry in the Sci-Fi/Horror genre, fun and fast-paced, and makes me look forward to seeing the rest of the films in this "prequel."</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>The plot is full of holes.  The characters paper thin.  The logic nonexsistant.  With all of the above bad qualities ALIEN VS PREDATOR still remains decently entertaining.  This film will probably be a better view when released as a spec. ed. dvd with the vast ammount of footage obviously cut out restored.  Here's what it is; a cheesy sci-fi actioneer with some great fx and a heap of bad dialouge that caters to fans of both franchises that are just tuning in to see some battling space nasties.  That's it.  AVP is not a good movie.  It is satisfying in some strange manor, though, and would fair better if so much meat was not cut off.  Some disspelling; the acting isn't bad at all, it's the character development and lack of plot that suspends believable players.  The fight scenes with the Aliens and Predators are cool.  They don't resemble wrestling matches, but would benefit from some more limber Predators (they are, after all, giant stuntmen in heavy suits).  This movie is great entertainment on a Saturday afternoon when you don't want to use your brain and like to witness some halfway decent extraterrestrial carnage.  Sure, it could've been made ten times better, but at least it's ten times better than the lowest point in the series- ALIEN: RESURRECTION.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"What type of room did you say this was?"<br /><br />"Sacrificial Chamber."<br /><br />- Two members of the Weyland expedition team are about to get date-raped by two alien facehuggers in "Alien vs. Predator"<br /><br />As a die-hard fan of both "Alien" & "Predator" films, I found that "Alien Vs. Predator" is an insult to fans & is about as scary as a kiddie-fart in Church, on a cold Sunday in January. The film is an unscary, videogame style mess that can't compare to any of the installments in either "Alien" or "Predator" films & comes in last place when ranking both series together (in all honesty, I tried to like this film, but, I just couldn't). What really pissed me off was, I had high hopes that this film would get the special type of treatment that could, possibly, revitalize both series. That ain't gonna happen.<br /><br />Its October 2004. A satelite (owned by a company thats led by Charles Bishop Weyland) has picked up a mysterious heat signature 2000 feet below the surface in the No Man's Land style section of the Antartica. Weyland forms a rag-tag expedition to check out whats exactly up there and what specifically is going on.<br /><br />The expediton is about to pay for this excursion with there very lives, as they find out that the heat sig. is a pyramid constructed by the Predator species hundreds to thousands of years earlier. Every hundred years the structure is used as a rite of passage hunting ground for young Predators (what the f*ck?!?). What are they hunting? Aliens. The team finds out that there actually bait and sacrificial sheep for the Aliens, with little hope of survival.<br /><br />With the popularity between both film series, not to mention the first official smackdown in the "Aliens vs. Predator" Dark Horse comic book series, & the engrossing video game of the same name, you would actually think "20th Century Fox" would grow a brain and give this project to someone who, at least had a clue, as to what they were directing. Unfortunately, Paul W. S. Anderson can't grow a brain or buy a clue and the result is like watching someone else play a video game. Badly. Anderson continues his career path on becoming the planets suckiest director (I don't think he could direct himself out of an asthma attack!).<br /><br />The characters are so cardboard a Domino's Pizza box could emote more emotion! Lance Henrikson is o.k. as Weyland, in a nice nod to "Aliens". Other then that, I could care less about anyone of the characters (Ellen Ripley isn't this film and she's missed. a lot).<br /><br />The special effects are what save the film somewhat. The battle at the end of the film was cool and "AVP" gets a small repeal in this respect, but not much. Both species have never looked better (but in the defense of the original films, once an Alien/Predator, always an Alien/Predator).<br /><br />The film isn't without its loopholes. The first one I noticed is - if the pyramid hunt is a rite of passage for the Predator then what the hell were the first two Predators (from "Predator" and "Predator 2") doing on Earth?! The other loophole is that the Alien incubation cycle is longer than 15 min. In "Alien" it was suspensefull, errie, and disgusting to watch the Alien go from chestburster to the full size, slimy creature. In "AVP" the Aliens are reduced to the screen version of Sea Monkeys! During some of the fight scenes between the Alien & Predators, some of the Predators metal weapons melt on contact from the Aliens acidic blood, yet, in some scenes there weapons come back unscathed.<br /><br />Worst of all, "AVP" is rated PG-13, taking the edge out of both creatures, and insuring mommies, who have wittwe boys under 13, that they won't wet their beds from having nightmares.<br /><br />Thats like Mike Tyson licking Holyfields ear instead munching on it!<br /><br />"Alien vs. Predator" is like the soccer mom version of "Alien" or "Predator".<br /><br />Its like a porn movie without the sex.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I know most have criticized this film for a wide variety of reasons that I completely understand, but for some odd reasons I still enjoyed this film although I know I should not have.<br /><br />The plot of this film has been reviewed to death, so I will go the route I've been going lately and simply discuss what elements I liked and disliked about this somewhat controversial film for which most were disappointed.<br /><br />The Misses:<br /><br />(1) Shoddy, dark cinematography used to disguise a low-budget film for a film that really should have had a massive budget considering the great success of both franchises and the concept of the film.<br />(2) Slow pacing for a film that should have been a non-stop action flick on par with Cameron's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDE">Aliens (Special Edition)</a> -as if that were really possible.<br />(3) Some run-of-the-mill stereotypes of forgettable characters (yeah, I know, the aliens are supposed to be the stars).<br />(4) Lazy approach to great concept.<br />(5) Lack of research (respect) to the original franchises.<br />(6) The PG-13 rating is both a hit and miss with me.  ALL of the prior Alien films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)</a>, and the only two Predator films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GUJYQ0">Predator / Predator 2 - 2-Movie Gift Set</a>, where ALL R rated films for violence and language.  To some purist for these films and genre, that should have required an R rating for this film and anything less implies a departure from these films' roots and I agree (to a point . . . see #6 below).<br /><br />The Hits:<br /><br />(1) Great concept for a film (but rather lackadaisical implementation).<br />(2) Some spot on casting with Lance Henrikson returning as the human Bishop, the familiar face of Raoul Bova, and the stunningly beautiful and solid acting talents of Sanaa Lathan to whom this film owes an awful lot as the one character who is developed well-enough that we are rooting for her to survive in a situation where we expect all to die.<br />(3) Decent special effects and set designs when not shrouded in darkness.<br />(4) Occasionally humorous moments to ease up the tension.<br />(5) A terrific ending that clearly opens the door for what can be a sequel that may be better than the original AVP.<br />(6) The PG-13 rating has caused much fuss by fans of these franchises and I generally agree with them that these aliens thrive on violence and to downplay that here in a match up between the two is most annoying; however, I never cared for violence and gore for violence and gore's sake alone.  I think this film succeeds well enough under its more family friendly PG-13 rating and I, personally, prefer to watch movies with my whole family than with just my wife (which R would require).  This is just a matter of opinion here and personal preference, so keep your light sabers holstered if you disagree (just funning here).<br /><br />I generally enjoyed this film even though it is a considerable letdown from what it could have been.  I think sometimes we have to put that notion aside and just look at what we have and not all the "could have been's."  In addition, just because we disliked a film doesn't mean we should exaggerate the lack of success a film had (or vice versa).  This medium budget film, since $45 million isn't really "low budget" the film comes across as, went on to gross over $172 million world-wide, I think one is hard-pressed to call this film a flop and before one can say most of that was earned outside of the U.S. the U.S. take was slightly over $80 million.<br /><br />A hit in Hollywood is generally looked upon as film that rakes in about double what it cost to make, and that is especially true if the cast has no A-list stars like this film.  There are bigger expectation when a film has one or more A-listed stars like Will Smith, Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts or Jodie Foster.  AVP had no A-list stars and ended up grossing nearly 4x what it cost to make after world-wide distribution.  For all the criticisms of this film, I think its box-office receipts means somebody liked it and that I'm not alone even though I will admit that this film has many flaws.<br /><br />With the recent entry of AVP2 you might want to take a second look at this film.  It is better than most think it is (in my view).  And with that I will exit my 200th review.  Peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>It's a good movie, even though it has less story, too much action and fails. Fails like: when the last bullet in the gun is not the last; when storm passes by too fast; when a host that was attacked by a facehugger dies too fast (like seconds after waking up); when the main actress doesn't even shiver standing there on arctic circle doing nothing with only a shirt on; when predators use cloak they have to press at least some buttons, it doesn't happen on it's own. I didn't like the main actress, how she behaves and the destiny of Michael Bishop. Predators looked okay and behaved too much like humans. Despite that, I enjoyed this filled with action movie. It's okay, not bad.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The title of my review obviously refers to the PG-13 rating that this bad-boy received when it was released.  Seriously, did anyone see that coming?  I was blown away, and I actually almost boycotted seeing the thing, but then again, who am I to judge before actually seeing the finished product.  After watching it I can say that it is a very weak attempt to capitalize on geeky fanboyism, and it's a shame because a lot of people were willing to shell out hard-earned (or at least their parents hard-earned) money to see two of the most iconic creatures in sci-fi history duke it out on the big screen.<br /><br />Am I the only one who was bothered by the fact that there was like ONE Predator in this entire movie?<br /><br />The film has its fair share of deliciously claustrophobic sets, and so I'll throw credit where credit is due.  It serves up some nicely manipulated chills and there are some jumpy moments and even some surprisingly edgy violent moments considering the rating (which is only one of the films hindrances) but overall the film cannot get out of its own way.  The script offers some interesting connective tissue when concerning the relationship between the two species of alien, but it also seems to dumb down nearly everything else until it becomes just another generic science fiction movie.<br /><br />Run of the mill.<br /><br />I will say this; I'm thankful that this film stars the magnificent Sanaa Lathan.  I seriously adore her in everything she does and will watch her in anything, even this half-baked creation.  She is just perfection on the screen.  Even while meandering through this films murky waters, she manages to make her presence believable and engaging.  If a lesser actress had been cast, this film would have fallen apart rapidly (see `The Ruins' for an example of poor acting destroying a mediocre film).<br /><br />While I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this movie (in fact, I refuse to recommend it since it really doesn't need to be seen) I will say that if you happen to stumble onto it you won't be completely devastated.  It has some things going for it.  It's not a horribly bad movie, it's just a big disappointment.  Knowing what this movie could have been makes the experience so much less than rewarding.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Alien vs. Predator: 5/10: Aliens check; Predators check; Space Marines; umm Space Marines? Okay who took out the Space Marines and put in this fodder.<br /><br />Some surprise moments and some thrills but not nearly enough and AVP is over way to fast. Everything in the film seems speeded up and suspense as a result is simply zero. Both the entire series of Alien movies and the first Predator film depended upon moments of silence to build up the suspense. (Nothing really happens at all of the first hour of Alien for example.)<br /><br />This movie, on the other hand, moves so much like a video game you will be reaching for the controller. The Predators look okay but the Aliens are too cartoonish and seem to change size at random.<br /><br />The plot and the back-story are simply inept. What is wrong with an alien Queen in the New York subway system or Predators fighting in Iraq? Heck putting them in an office block, cruise ship or shopping mall at Christmas would be preferable. (The Predators take out the Orange Julius while the Alien Queen makes her nest in Victoria Secret.)<br /><br />The fun of aliens on earth is watching them walk into a Seven-Eleven and taking out some customers not fighting in a silly pyramid that could be on any planet in the universe.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Alien vs Predator is a science fiction film, made in 2004, that bring the two beloved sci-fi franchises of fans all over together. It was a concept that was brought together in a comic series of the same name in 1989. Directed by W.S. Anderson(best known for "Event Horizon"& "Mortal Kombat"), it stars Sanaa Lathan, Lance Henriksen, Raoul Bova, and Colin Salmon. Alien vs. Predator follows a group assembled by billionaire Charles 'Bishop' Weyland (Lance Henriksen) for an expedition near the Antarctic after discovering a mysterious heat signal. Hoping to claim the find for himself, Weyland and the group discover a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station. Little do they know that it is a hunting ground for Predators who kill Aliens as a part of "coming of age" ritual. Despite harsh critism about the movie from movie reviewers and fans alike, it did well at the box-office ranking 33rd over all for the year as the highest-grossing film of that year. It has also did well by DVD sales and whatnot. In my opinion, AVP is a fun romp definitely worth owning just to see my two favorite space lifeforms duking it out til the end. It's a heck of a sight better than "Freddy vs Jason"(I truly mean that, I'm afraid). The unrated edition contains the special features from the Extreme Edition, CGI and an extra eight minutes of footage. That goes a long way in making  the movie that much better. So, regardless of what you hear about it, check out AVP:Alien vs Predator. It's a really good movie.</p></br></body></html>

Harry is able to slip away from the cops by stumbling into a movie audition and, to his surprise, procuring the part! He's whisked away to Hollywood where he meets up with Gay Perry (Val Kilmer, TOMBSTONE), a private eye who's supposed to help train Harry for his upcoming movie role. But things aren't as they seem. The only reason Harry was sent to Hollywood was to be the fall-guy for the murder of a young socialite. Harry also meets up with his childhood sweetheart, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan, NORTH COUNTRY) and sparks begin to fly ...right after she slams Harry's hand in a door, causing him to lose a finger.<br /><br />Harry and Gay Perry are forcibly teamed up together due to their circumstances. Harry turns out to be one helluva detective with the oft needed help of Harmony and Gay Perry. He also becomes deadly with a gun, forming a sort of running cliche throughout the film (this was pulled off VERY well, by the way).<br /><br />KISS KISS, BANG BANG is one of those films you have to watch to believe. So many stereotypes are ripped apart and so many cliches manhandled that it truly boggles the mind. Most -- if not all -- of this is done through dialogue, and it's wonderfully ridiculous how well Kilmer and Downey Jr. play off each other (there's even a kiss between them that makes for an interesting scene). Example: when Kilmer (who plays a tough homosexual) watches Downey pull a tiny gun out from his glovebox, Kilmer remarks, "That's my faggot gun." We also get to see Kilmer use the "faggot gun" in a very trouser destroying manner.<br /><br />The comedy in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is dark, similar in tone to THE MATADOR (another flick I absolutely loved). If you're "in to" those kind of films, you should most definitely check out this one. I'll be watching it again!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Shane Black's "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is about as profound as its title - this is pure pulp entertainment, a sloppy, tasty concoction of violence, sex and humor wrapped up in a big old tortilla of wit.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. may not be able to carry a major Hollywood film by himself (see, "Chaplin"), but there are few actors better suited for colorful roles in independent films.  I always enjoy Downey, but my favorite performance of his came in Curtis Hanson's "Wonder Boys."  Effortlessly downplaying his manic energy, Downey more than held his own with stellar actors like Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Francis MacDormand.<br /><br />In "KKBB," Downey plays a perfect Downey character, Harry Lockhart.  Lockhart is a small-time hood in Baltimore who stumbles into Hollywood in the most unlikely of coincidences.  Once in Hollywood, Lockhart is completely outmatched - he's the kind of guy who stands up for a woman's virtue and gives a couple of good quips, but still gets his head beaten in by the offending cad.<br /><br />But Lockhart never stops trying, even if he's not exactly sure what is going on.  In a plot inspired by the trashiest of pulp fiction, immortalized by the "Johnny Gossamer" novels featured in the movie itself, Lockhart finds himself immersed in two investigations involving murder, incest, and good old fashioned cash.<br /><br />Lockhart also forms a twisted Mod Squad for the new millenium with Gay Perry (Val Kilmer, apparently on the Alec Baldwin diet) and childhood crush Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan).  As these three semi-intrepid souls dig deeper into these mysteries, Lockhart also serves as the Narrator, giving the audience plenty of information and laughs at the same time.<br /><br />Ultimately, "KKBB" is too witty to be a great movie - the suspension of disbelief cannot be sustained thanks to both Lockhart's narration (he insists on reminding you that you're watching a movie) and some incredibly contrived set pieces.  That doesn't mean that "KKBB" is not entertaining - far from it - but it does keep the movie from getting that coveted fifth star.<br /><br />Destined to become a cult hit, "KKBB" is a must for fans of trashy movies.  Straight from the Quentin Tarantino school, this is a movie to be enjoyed with good friends, greasy food, and cheap alcohol.  We need movies like that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is a comedic murder mystery written and directed by Shane Black, based in part on the novel "Bodies are Where You Find Them" by Brett Halliday. It honors and spoofs many of the stylistic conventions of film noir and hard-boiled detective fiction: subjective voice-over narration, flashback sequences, an Everyman caught in desperate circumstances, an aloof, savvy private detective, tough-guy masculinity, and six-shooters. The titles that introduce each chapter as the mystery unfolds are titles of Raymond Chandler stories.<br /><br />Harry Lockart (Robert Downey, Jr.) was a small-time crook in New York when he stumbled into an audition for a detective film, was snatched up by an agent, and whisked to Los Angeles. Attending a party at the home of socialite Harlan Dexter (Corbin Bernsen), Harry is introduced to private detective Perry Van Shrike (Val Kilmer), who is consulting on the detective film. Harry also spots a pretty aspiring actress at the party, Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan), whom he discovers is his old friend and big crush from high school. Harry's agent has arranged for him to take detective lessons from Perry, so he accompanies Perry on a surveillance job. It turns out to be a harrowing evening when they witness the disposal of a murdered corpse and then learn that Harmony may have killed herself. Are the incidents unrelated, or is everything connected, in the style of a pulp detective novel?<br /><br />"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" has some fun moments. It sends up both film noir and Hollywood culture but seems to be primarily concerned with getting laughs. I don't think I laughed. The parody is a little too in-your-face, cheesy, and superficial. Film noir and Hollywood lifestyles are so present in American media that I think audiences will find the spoofs in "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" too simplistic. People have a relatively sophisticated view of these subjects at this point. I was distracted by the film's lighting, which is oddly inappropriate in some scenes -to the extent that I repeatedly found myself wondering where the light was coming from. Harry and Harmony could not have attended high school together. The actors are 10 years apart and look it. "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" does have a quick enough pace that it didn't bore me. But it never engaged me either, so details that are amiss became glaring.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006): There is a "Gag Reel" (4 min), a theatrical trailer (2 min), and an audio commentary with writer/director Shane Black, Val Kilmer, and Robert Downey Jr. The commentary is conversational, with Kilmer talking a lot, Downey hardly ever, and Shane Black contributing some comments on camera work, audience reactions, performances, and filming. There is some commentary in every scene, though it isn't always informative. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Shane Black is a hard driving propulsive director who seems to value speed highly.  In some films it works: In KISS KISS BANG BANG the result is just a silly, self-absorbed 'in joke' that quickly wears out its welcome.<br /><br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, looking a bit long in the tooth) escapes his career in minor petty crime in New York and flees to Los Angeles where he serendipitously lands in an acting studio tryout and is picked up as a method actor for a part in a crime movie.  He is assigned to Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) who is to train him in matters detective, but instead ends up in a crime investigation that involves a lot of unfocused characters and corpses and Lockhart's old high school sweetheart Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan).  The plot is convoluted to say the least and it is made more annoying by the technique of voice over by Downey's character that flash forwards, static pauses, and flash backs in an amateurish way that begins as funny and rapidly becomes irritating.  The film seems to be a parody of the genre and as so often can happen in parody, unless it is sensitively written, it becomes too infatuated with itself to make us care about anyone or any event.<br /><br />Downey, Kilmer, and Monaghan give it their best and it is good to see Downey back on the screen: he is a gifted actor after all.  The saving grace of the film is thanks to cinematographer Michael Barrett who shows us a Los Angeles of spectacular beauty. But in the end Shane Blake shows us that trying to be ever so clever can result is a sort of a mess.  And if you can make it through this film and watch the Gag Role featurette, you'll see the reason the film got so off track: 'in jokes' that are so 'in' fail to be entertaining.

Robert Downey JR plays a petty theif who goes to LA and gets thrust into acting.  A murder mystery develops, but it seems mostly just there to provide a vehicle for Downey Jr's jokes and stunts.  The movie had several parts that dragged along, but unfortunately it is already too short to cut more out.  The picture quality is OK, but I still hate combo discs-I want to see HD DVD with minimal compression!  Worth renting, but nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (Shane Black, 2005)<br /><br />I sometimes forget that under Robert Downey, Jr.'s deeply troubled exterior lies a world-class actor. Then I see one of his good movies, and the late eighties come flooding back. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, despite its awkward title (and how strange is it that this is the sixth movie to carry that title?), is definitely one of those.<br /><br />Downey plays Harry Lockhart, a small-time crook who stumbles into the beginnings of an acting career while fleeing from some nasty men with guns. Lockhart is transplanted to the other side of the country and under consideration for the lead in a detective series; in order to get him some ideas about what happens on the job, he gets paired up with real private detective Perry (Val Kilmer). Meanwhile, he's run into Harmony (Unfaithful's Michelle Monaghan), the girl he had a major crush on in high school who went out to Hollywood to become an actress. Perry is planning on keeping Harry out of danger, but the two of them quickly become embroiled in an ugly, complex case.<br /><br />I don't watch too many comedies; not because I don't like them, but because I prefer other genres of film. So I don't laugh terribly much when watching movies. This month, though, I've laughed more at movies than I have in the past year. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was half the reason. (He Died with a Felafel in His Hand was the other half.) Kilmer and Downey are great foils for one another, and both have very good timing here. Add in a few overly weird minor characters and the mother of all Rube Goldbergian plots, and you've got yourself a winner. No one will mistake this for deathless cinema, but then again, it never aspires to be. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>KISS KISS BANG BANG is one heck of a good movie.  Fresh.  Original.  Funny.  Suspenseful.  And well done all around.  Writer/director Shane Black who burst onto the scene with LETHAL WEAPON has created a film that pokes fun at the very genre which made him famous.  Its complex but sensible plot takes lots of twists and turns and holds your interest throughout.  There are some wonderfully creative scenes especially when Harry (our hero) decides to play Russian roulette with a bad guy orderly.  It's totally unexpected.  The casting is superb:  Robert Downey Jr. is marvelous as the reluctant hero who finds himself caught up in a complex web of deception, murder and everything else.  He's also given a very witty narrative that aids rather than hinders the action.  Val Kilmer is at his best as Gay Perry, the "gay" detective who is also a consultant on Downey's supposed film.  Kilmer's comic timing is wonderfully controlled.  Michelle Monaghan (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3) plays the love interest with a nice mix of seductive flirtation and hard boiled no-nonsense.  Corbin Bernsen, who has been in some really bad films in the past few years, redeems himself playing the nasty villain of the piece.  I really enjoyed this movie; it's so much fun and is one of the best I've seen this year.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>Violent, sarcastic and very, very funny!<br />The cast was great, the story line was great and there's a mystery to solve too!<br />How can you beat that ?</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this unusual detective story. Most good detective stories have narration, but this wasn't at all like those others. The movie pokes some fun throughout and it doesn't distract from the story so it enhances the experience. Robert Downey Jr. plays a small time thief that lucks into an audition for a detective movie. When he becomes involved with consulting a real gay detective played by Val Kilmer and a high school crush, things get weird but interesting. The mystery will keep you guessing till the end. I recommend it. Good quality DVD with good replayability.

An incredible movie to say the least.  Humor, suspense, and a little action for taste.  The movie has all star performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer.<br /><br />The movie starts off rathe innocently in Indiana as innocence seems all the part.  You may start wondering if you are watching the right movie.  Quickly come in to narrate and essentially telling the story is Robert Downey Jr.  The story tells a rather good tale about three characters.  Downey plays a character named Harry who seems to be trying to find himself as a small time crook nobody.  Kilmer plays a guy who goes by the name of Gay Perry and yes he is gay.  Lastly the rather unknown Michelle Monaghan plays the attractive Harmony who is trying to make it as an actress.<br /><br />This is about as far as the story gets from where it goes.  The mystery begins quickly and never gets too dark.  What makes the story so good is the great chemistry between these three actors and the comedy that ensues.  Shane Black knows how to make a great mystery with comedy since his name is best known for Lethal Weapon.  There are times where I couldn't stop laughing even during the darkest scenes.  Don't let the fact that there is a lot of humor since the story still is great.<br /><br />Watching the Blu-ray version was well worth it.  The picture was vibrant and filled with life.  Bringing out most of the scenes the way they were intended to be seen.  The sound was great on my speakers.  An excellent movie for a great price.  Despite the extras lacking.  If you are looking for a wonderful movie that will keep you laughing with a great story then Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a must have to any collection.  This is now one of my favorite movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>KKBB is one wild trip of a movie.  Dark, comic and genre satirizing, it takes you over and over again on one crazy trip after another.  Downey is excellent here and his narration is an example of perfect deadpan humor.  I have never been a big fan of Kilmer, but here he is quite funny and a lot less hammy than he has been in the past.  They, along woth Monaghan make a great comic, if bloody, trio.  The film is also gorgeously photographed and beautiful look at.  Great, breezy entertainment!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>A semi-ridiculous plot born out of the old pulp detective stories. Semi-ridiculous but wildly entertaining. The cast, the writing, and the direction were more than enough to turn unrealistic into fun on screen.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. impresses me time after time. Any chemical dependencies in his past aside, I think he has a lot of talent. He turns in a very enjoyable performance as Harry Lockhart. I would be hard pressed to decide if I like his work here better than in Wonder Boys, which, partially due to his influence, is a movie I love.<br /><br />Michelle Monaghan is a relatively unknown name, though she makes heads turn. She was certainly a knockout in this movie, but she may be a bit too much like Liv Tyler for me, in looks, innocence, and mannerisms.<br /><br />The show was absolutely stolen by Val Kilmer. When you watch the movie you wonder if he can sustain the exalted level of sarcastic wit and incredible timing. Some credit is due to Robert Downey, Jr. for his part in how well they worked together, but Val was great. This just might be his best performance, if I may be so bold.<br /><br />There will be a time or two where you wonder if the suspense is overdone, but by the end of the movie you will probably be too entertained to remember. The writing was probably the best part; from Robert Downey, Jr.'s monologues as narrator to his constant banter with Val Kilmer, I was impressed. It was a unique film and I appreciate seeing something that is a break from the norm, especially when it is as funny and fun to watch as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>This is genre-bending noirish dark comedy at its self-referential best.  I had a lot of fun watching this film, and laughed out loud more than I have in a long time.  Val Kilmer and Robert Downey, Jr. are at the top of their game; the script is clever; and writer Shane Black pulls it off in his directorial debut.  They were enjoying themselves when they made this film, and it shows!  This is the kind of movie I was expecting when I watched the "Ice Harvest" -- while there were elements of that film that worked the whole left a bad taste in my mouth, even the funny elements seemed serious and forced.  In kiss kiss bang bang it all came together -- and worked, even at moments that should not have been funny (like a finger getting slammed OFF in a door, and then a dog eating the finger).  Nothing brilliant, nothing profound, just well-made solid madcap dark laughter enjoyment.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I'm not quite sure how to describe Kiss Kiss Bang Bang; it's not quite a crime drama, as it has plenty of great offbeat jokes, but it is no light comedy.  The film contains a good mystery plot revolving around two mysterious murders in Los Angeles.  And the characters that inhabit the world of the film are very off-kilter.  In fact, there is no one in the film that I can even label as a straight man.<br /><br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a two-bit con from New York City.  One night after a heist-gone-bad, he stumbles into an audition while fleeing from the cops.  Despondent over the death of his partner, which he may have caused, he is handed a script for a detective movie in which the character he is reading for JUST WITNESSED HIS PARTNER'S DEATH AND MAY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR IT!  His emotional state allows him to give a heartfelt performance, and he is asked to come out to LA to get ready for the part.<br /><br />Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan) is an ex-small town girl who came to LA to become a famous movie star.  Well, she did become famous, but for something very different (which I won't spoil).<br /><br />Perry (Val Kilmer) is a homosexual detective who is known around town as Gay Perry, and he is a no-nonsense PI in charge of giving detective lessons to the moronic Harry.  To say that he is less than thrilled to have to babysit the pathetic con man is an understatement.  However, things change when the three of them are inexplicably pulled into a murder plot involving Harmony's sister and the daughter of one of LA's most powerful men.<br /><br />The film is narrated by Harry, but he takes on the job in a way very few before him have; he is self-aware as a narrator, and he often criticizes his narration style, kicking himself for omitting critical details, and actually "stopping" the film to go back and show us the scene in question.  At one point, he even yells at two people in the film who are obscuring something to get out of the way.<br /><br />In addition to Harry's bizarre narration, a lot of the humor stems from Perry's constant insults towards Harry, which Kilmer always delivers in a delightful deadpan.  Also, there are numerous situations in the film that are just so strange that one can't help but laugh as they break the tension of the gritty plot (which is perfectly set against the grittier side of LA, though lately, that is the only side that is showcased in film and television nowadays).<br /><br />I will say that the solution to the mystery is a little convoluted, but they go through it enough times to allow us to wrap our heads around it.  Overall, this film is very enjoyable, and while it may put some people off (at the end, they actually apologize to "all the nice people in the midwest" for using the f-word so much), it is worth checking out, if only to hear Downey's hilarious narration techniques.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang falls into the category of one of those movies that you just want to love. D&eacute;buting to rave reviews when it was in theatres, the film purports to be a gritty re-imagining of the Los Angeles noir film, a modern day spoof of the hard-boiled detective genre. And in all fairness, the film does deliver up some irreverent fun, and some sly, dark humor, but the wacky voice-overs, like so much else, proves just too tiresome.<br /><br />Kiss Kiss Bang Bang also has a plot that is just so convoluted. By the end of the film you will neither care nor want to know who and what the body count is. It's not that director Shane Black isn't stylish and inventive - the film is gorgeously shot and the production design unsurpassed - but Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang ultimately turns into a film that is too flagrantly pleased with itself, so smugly love with its own cleverness, that the jokes wear thin long before the movie has ended.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. stars as Harry Lockhart, the narrator and small-time from New York City who after a spoiled robbery runs away from the cops into an audition and is mistaken for an actor. He winds up in Los Angeles for a possible acting gig as a private detective on a pulp movie. The studio teams Harry with the tough private eye Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), nicknamed "Gay" because of his sexual orientation.<br /><br />Harry also hooks up with Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan), who at sixteen left her small Indiana town to make her fame as an actress in Hollywood. He had a crush on her back then and her arrival in the City of Angeles is a portent for the fact that two unrelated young girls have just been murdered and one of their bodies shows up the a lake.<br /><br />The plot becomes increasingly hyper-complex, filled with shootings, corpses, and references to old-fashioned crime fiction novels. It's as though Harry is almost tempting the viewers with all the devilish plot machinations, asking us whether we have solved it yet. Robert Downey Jr. is indeed a great actor and here he looks hotter than ever, and while his character is momentarily fun, after a while, his voice over narration and silly antics just become irritating.<br /><br />Los Angeles viewers will certainly get a kick out of some of the stunning location work - particularly the use of Downtown and Macarthur Park for some of the main action scenes. But the violence eventually comes across as rather over-baked and the joke-fuelled and casual camaraderie between Harry and Perry often seems forced and over-written.<br /><br />Kiss Kiss Bang Bang isn't offensive even though it's quite violent. Indeed it has a cuteness and hippness that a lot of viewers are going to like. The problem is that it's just trying too hard to be in vogue. By the third act, I'd had enough and fast-forwarded it with the subtitles on to see how it ended. Even talented actors like Downey and Kilmer couldn't save it from wallowing in its own showiness and meaninglessness.

While trying to steal something he stumbles into an acting audition where he wins them over and winds up at a big party where he finds the girl he loved way back when in School Harmony played by the delicious Michelle Monaghan (Mission: Impossible 3, North Country). Lockhart winds up in a situation involving a dead girl with private detective Gay Perry played by the rock solid Val Kilmer (The Doors, Spartan). Lockhart takes interest in Harmony when he finds out that her sister was murdered and she asks him to help her so he does that. Kilmer and Downey, Jr. give fantastic performances as does the gorgeous Monaghan in this great film which deliver some outrageous hilarious moments and yes I'm talking about the peeing scene which I admit I laughed.  Not for  all tastes but surely a look if you're fans of the actors. Also starring Corbin Bernsen (Carpool Guy, General Hospital), Shannyn Sossamon (The Order, Rules of Attraction), Larry Miller (Carnival of Souls, Best in Show) and Dash Mihok (Dark Blue, The Thine Red Line).

This was the funniest and most intriguing murder non-mystery I've seen in a long long time.<br /><br />Here's a non-sequiter:  Who the hell is Shane Black? How does Amazon come up with the  name of the "star" to put under the title of the movie?  I don't know what movie they saw, but the one I saw starred Robert Downey, Jr, and Val Kilmar. This movie was sort of like a roller coaster.  It was full of funny and scarry ups and downs.  It really was very interesting.<br /><br />I loved how the director mixed humor with scariness.  It was a blast to watch.<br /><br />It could have had more bonus features, but I'm glad to see a commentary from Robert Downey, Jr and Val Kilmar.  Very nice.<br /><br />Great flick!<br /><br />Two thumbs up!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Don't you hate it when a movie character also serves as the narrator, continually interrupting the film to tell us what he forgot to tell us a minute ago or to throw in general smart remarks?  Of course you do.  We all do.  So why do directors keep doing it?  I assume there is supposed to be some level of spoof-iness to this film, though, so I'll just leave it at that.  I generally enjoy dark comedies, but I just didn't find Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang to be at all funny.  There are plenty of comical situations, but actual moments of comedy are few and far between.  Maybe it's just because I don't like Robert Downey, Jr. (who, along with all of his well-documented problems, basically ruined Alley McBeal single-handedly).  Then again, maybe I shouldn't complain - after all, I only watched this movie because Michelle Monaghan looked all kinds of hot in that little Christmas outfit of hers.  The problem is that the film tries to be even cuter than Monaghan - and it's not even close.<br /><br />So what do we have here?  I won't go too deeply into the plot because it's designed to be full of twists and turns.  Robert Downey, Jr., plays Harry Lockhart, a common thief who accidentally auditions for a movie as he is trying to evade the cops.  Next thing you know, ole Harry's in L.A. preparing for his acting debut.  While attending a party, he makes a human punching bag of himself for a girl (thereby ensuring he can never return to New York, since they don't let you back in if you get beaten up by Richie Rich); apparently a glutton for embarrassment, he then pursues that same girl, Harmony (Monaghan), later on that night, never even realizing - until she tells him - that she is the girl he was in love with back in high school.  Let's just pause here for a second.  Who in the world would not be able to recognize the girl whose beauty haunted him day and night during his formative years?  It's not like seventy years have passed since he's seen her.  Don't even get me started on what he does next.  But I digress.  Actually, this is where it all starts to get tricky.  Harry starts tagging along with the aptly named private eye Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) in preparation for the detective role he's supposed to play, and he quickly finds a lot of things happening in real life that aren't supposed to happen in real life - such as corpses turning up at the rate of one per hour.  The whole thing turns into this huge mess involving Harmony, Gay, several mystery guests, and just about everyone Harry's ever met in L.A.  With pieces falling into place at odd moments, and plenty of dead ends along the way, expect more twists and turns (and bumps) than you'll find on an old, washed-out mountain road.<br /><br />To me, the movie just doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  Well, I guess it wants to be a dark comedy, but most of the comedy falls flat, in my opinion.  Screwball comedy needs more than just screwballs.  I blame the script because the acting really isn't that bad.  The whole thing's just too cute and obvious for its own good, especially the increasingly irksome narration bits.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, is one of those films that leaves you wondering if there were "production problems." The cast is good (Val Kilmer, Robert Downey Jr., and Michelle Monaghan), and there is genuine chemistry between the three.  But the story is something else.  It's a mess, and has you thinking this might be a cut and paste effort at comic noir from a 5 year old, except 5 year olds don't think (hopefully) about such things as severed fingers and corpses in showers - and more importantly, they still retain a sense of wonder that invests whatever they do. In contrast, KK, BB, is as stale a cut and paste effort as you will find.  Even the "funny" moments seem tired and familiar.  If you were to sit down and watch "Fargo", or "The Ice Harvest", and then try and watch KK, BB, I doubt you could even finish watching it - the movie is that embarrassing.  One thing about noir, even if the story doesn't make sense, the fallback is Style.  And again, KK, BB, falls short.  Yeah, it takes place in LA, and you get to see the inevitable party scene, but it goes nowhere.  Gunfire, bodies here and there, a car chase, a goofy bed time scene, a whiff of incest that is delivered in the most ho-hum way.  Wet noodles from Sin City.  Two stars for the acting trio trying to stay afloat in a story that never really meshes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>Well casted, well acted, well filmed, and almost well written - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang intrigued me and turned out to be what I expected it to be: a quaint, slightly offbeat dark detective comedy.  Nicely set up and compelling in the beginning - Downey and Kilmer make an unlikely but highly watchable duo.  Downey is spot on as ever, but it's Kilmer who shines.  Past the a-list, it's interesting to see Kilmer in different roles now.  The plot however, turned out to be more complicated than Robert Towne's Chinatown and several other mysteries combined, and that turns out to be the film's undoing.  We end up keeping up with it because of Downey's predicament, but ultimately this isn't quite an action, comedy or thriller but more of a headscratcher instead.  Worth watching mainly if you're either a Downey or Kilmer fan - or really desperate to watch Corbin Bernsen!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Shane Black's directorial debut has a lot going for it: a good cast, fast paced action, witty dialogue. Unfortunately it also has an overly complicated plot line that has a tendancy to confuse more than it reveals.<br /><br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a small time crook who escapes a botched robbery into an audition for a detective film. Whisked off to Hollywood he is paired with a gay PI, Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) hired to get him ready for his casting call.  While in Hollywood he meets  an old flame Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan) who gets him embroiled in a pulpish noir mystery.<br /><br />The film throws every cliche at its viewer that it can muster and the overly contrived plot gets somewhat tiresome but there is great dialogue here written by the man who created Lethal Weapon. The acting is good and the chemistry between Downey and Monaghan feels genuine.<br /><br />The disc presents a near perfect transfer but is a little lacking in extras. A four minute gag real and a commentary track with Black, Kilmer, and Downey are featured. This could have been a great film with a little work on the plot. As it stands it's a merely good film.<br /><br />Worth a rental for a few laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>As much as I want to jump on the bangwagon and praise how clever this movie is and wow look how they poke fun of all the action/thriller sterotypes...but I'm not too aware of many action thriller with gay private eyes and mumbling narrators.  Silly me, I was actually trying to make sense of the story I was watching...which truley turned out to be a waste of time.  Why?  Because the movie audience has no idea about this mystery crimer writer that everyone in this movie holds in such high regard.  And when the whole story unfolds-it does absolutely nothing for me.  Downey and Monaghan have absolutely no chemistry.  And Gay Perry made no sense to me-unless he was just there to solely feed the audience the plot.  I laughed maybe once and then afterward forgot the joke I found amusing.  Overall, it might be up your alley...it just wasn't up mine.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I love both Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer but I don't have a lot of positive things to say about this movie. I found it too talky and its plot was not believable. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief while watching it. None of the characters were endearing and it was a challenge to care about what happened to them. Also, in real life, there would be no chemistry between Downey's character and the female lead, Ms. Monaghan. Her history and the reprehensible manner in which she treats him would preclude his devotion (unless he was a complete masochist). Further, and to my disappointment as I'm an extremely politically incorrect person, I found all the gay jokes about Kilmer's Perry obtuse. I really don't think anyone cares about that stuff much in this day and age. Overall, the interactions are too clever by half, and Downey's narration is a bore. Most of what's supposed to be funny...is not--a waste of time in my view.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A small-time crook (Robert Downey Jr) stumbles into an audition while running from police and ends up with a free ticket to LA, where he becomes involved in a complicated scheme along with his high school sweetheart (Michelle Monaghan) and a gay PI (Val Kilmer).  There is much to enjoy here, including some laugh-out-loud moments and some enthusiastic skewering of action movie cliches.

Black made a splash as a screenwriter, breaking his own records for money paid for a screenplay for "Lethal Weapon", "The Last Boy Scout" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight". Then he disappeared. In "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", Black reteams with his former producer Joel Silver, and directs his own screenplay, a homage (or some might say a parody) of Film Noir.<br /><br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.), a petty thief on the run from the cops, stumbles into the middle of an audition in Manhattan. The producers are so impressed that they fly him to Hollywood to do a second audition. In Los Angeles, the producer's pair him with "Gay" Perry (Val Kilmer), a private investigator who acts as a consultant on their films, for training. They are considering Harry for the role of a cop. Before you have time to say the title of the film, Harry and Perry are involved in a twisted story of murdered young women, crooked businessmen and Hollywood gone bad.<br /><br />I'm all for clever films. You know, the type that make you think and try to figure things out. The best mysteries let you in on a little of the secret and allow you to figure it out as you go along. All of the clues should be there; it's just a matter of figuring out how they all fit. Maybe on the second viewing, you understand how they fit and you appreciate the film for including everything.<br /><br />"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is a different kind of clever. It is the type of clever a film writer or director wants to be to prove how good they are, how witty, how funny. "Kiss" has some funny lines, but the writer and director are so intent on making us `laugh' and so intent on proving how `witty' they are, that the film suffers. For most films, the director might tone down the writer's excess, or vice versa. In the case of "Kiss", the writer and director are one in the same, so there is no sounding board to say "Hey, this is excessive. Let's fix it."<br /><br />From the first frame, Harry's narration brings attention to the fact that we are watching a film, about an actor, in Hollywood. Harry, the narrator, frequently breaks the fourth wall ("Let's take a look at how I got to "the party") and addresses the audience directly. Yes, this is funny, to a point, because it serves to call attention to some of the conventions of the genre. At one point, Harry says something like "Don't you hate it when a film shows a shot of a mental institution and it ends up being a big part of the plot? Oh, look. A mental institution!" But it gets real old, real quick. Because Harry and his high school sweetheart, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan) both read a series of pulp James Bond-like detective novels growing up, chapter titles are frequently superimposed over the frame. They contain titles like "Chapter 2: The Lady in the Lake" paying homage to the dime store novel and Mickey Spillane at the same time. These two elements frequently mention various things about Hollywood, including terms like "Best Boy" and others. Who, outside of Los Angeles and New York, knows what these terms mean? Who cares?<br /><br />This "wink, wink, nudge, nudge" look at Hollywood overlaps a mystery. Remember what I said about clever films and mysteries that actually have everything there? "Kiss" is not interested in being a clever mystery. It wants to be a clever film about Hollywood. The mystery element is secondary, merely serving as the framework for the Black's attempts at Hollywood parody. Too many of the elements are revealed ala "Scooby Doo", either Harold or Perry stop the other person and start reciting how or why something happened. Yet, we never see actually see the action or the clues. In the end, the mystery is extremely convoluted and makes little sense.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. certainly works very hard to make Harold seem like a real human. In some scenes, he actually takes a breath and tries to hold the gaze of Harmony or to talk to Perry as a normal human being. In others, his arms are flailing about and he is running around in circles resembling one of the Marx Brothers on crack. Kilmer seems to be trying to channel the spirit of Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, as he tries to make "Gay" Perry seem funny.  At one point, Harold and Perry are both being held captive. Perry begins baiting the guard by calling him a closet homosexual, etc. Perry reaches into his pants. "You want some of this, I know you do." This continues for what seems years until Perry shoots him with the small gun he keeps in his underwear. "Homophobes never check there." Are you laughing yet? Neither was I.<br /><br />In order for a parody or homage to work successfully, the filmmakers need to make the base material believable. In "Kiss", the mystery doesn't work, which detracts from the funny jibes at Hollywood and the Film Noir genre.<br /><br />"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" has some funny lines and references, but you will have to wade through a lot of insider jokes and a poorly constructed mystery to get to them. Personally, I think it's a waste of time. Check out "The Big Picture" or even Alan Alda's "Sweet Liberty" for a better, funnier look at the excess of Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>for the script, if you could let go of yourself of all the logic and decide to have a good time before stepping into the dark theatre, then this movie is quite all right and sometimes funny. but robert downey jr. or the screenplay writer turn director, both failed to make funny things convincingly believable. the most bothering scenario and the scenes that bothered me so much was the left pinky finger, broken so easily by a shutting door, broken so evenly, at that moment it's still fine with me.<br /><br />but at least downey jr should act that's really hurt. because one of the most painful things in the world is hurt one of your fingers, albeit a finger totally broken off from your hand, i think that might make a guy faint, and the pain would not go away so easily and so fast. re-attaching the finger back in an emergency room by just one nurse? still fine with me. but from the moment that finger fell to the floor to that finger reattached back to his hand, downey jr. still kept using his left hand so naturally comfortable, that's an unacceptable big overlook. i'd like you to watch carefully how and why robert downey jr was a good actor but never a great one. he could only  focus on interpretating a certain part of the character he played but never did a thorough study and control of how and when he should look more legit or more believable to perform that character. great actors always covered all the basis he played with consistency and logic. like this broken finger, a good actor and a good director could both do a lot good on this scenario, but in this movie, they both lost it. downey jr. kept forgetting that he got a useless left hand with a broken finger and the director never reminded him that he should be more conscious about his left hand by not using it too much or not at all; not even let his left arm drop down, guy with a broken finger would never let that hand drop straight downward, because that throbbing pain would be too much to be bearable.<br /><br />the screenplay is not a serious one and almost every setting is full of inconsistency and bad logic, sometimes even very ridiculous.  the matured val kilmer actually acted better and better and he never exaggerated the acting and overdid anything, his performance was very solid in this melodrama.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>It would be nice if every actor could age gracefully, like Sean Connery.  But time is not always that kind and in this movie we have a collection of actors who just look awful compared to our memories of 30 years ago.  If we had never seen them when they were young, it probably wouldn't bother us that this or that character looks burnt-out or bloated or bald.  But since we do remember what they used to look like, it is hard to not be distracted from the story by thinking how awful they look now.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Harry's a burglar in New York who, to escape arrest, winds up auditioning for a part in a Joel Silver like film that's destined for Colin Farrell.  He's whisked away to the phony world of LA, where every girl named "Jill" spells it "Jylle."  At a fabulous cocktail party he meets Harlan Dexter, once a B-movie actor and now a very rich enterpreneur whose daughter has only recently returned from a long sojourn to Paris.  Harry also meets his high school sweetheart, a girl who never gave him a toss back then, but now she's seeing him with new eyes.  The two of them share an appreciation for the pulp novels of the 1950s and 1960s featuring a Mike Hammer type PI called "Jonny Gossamer."<br /><br />KISS KISS BANG BANG is a lot of fun.  Walking into the theater you don't expect such a rambunctious, talky, endlessly yakking movie.  You have to be on your toes, narratologically speaking, the entire time, and don't try leaing your seat to use the restroom, you'll have missed probably the entire point of the movie.  Does even Shane Black know the story he's written, and why the three women who meet their maker got so confused that neither the police, the detectives, nor the gang that killed them seem to be able to piece them apart, like the old shell game.<br /><br />The movie is stunning to look at besides.  The credits are impeccable; we've seen numerous movie credits designed to resemble the old time look of the Bond films, but this one, in rusty shades of orange and black, is stylish and exciting.  In general the designers of the movie deserve awards.  The use of the hotel Standard is brilliant<br /><br />Downey Jr and Kilmer are both pretty entertaining, but the excitement here is the performance of Michelle Monaghan as Harmony Faith Lane (a name that, oddly enough, strings together  the names of two of Buffy's betes noires).<br /><br />As Harmony Miss Monaghan, a Denise Richards lookalike, shows a talent that can stand right up next to the fast talking dames of the thirties like Rosalind Russell or Carole Lombard, and plus she has a genuine American beauty tht makes it believable she could come from somewhere central, like Indiana.  You root for her to succeed, even when she shows the more disagreeable sides to her personality.<br /><br />I can imagine some people disliking the movie and its constant air of being in love with itself, and yet when the dust is cleared we are always searching for an American cinema with wit and flair, and here it is in this giant, heaping portion, and you would be a fool to turn away such bounty on account of its presumption.  I hope it does well enough to merit numerous sequels, as THE THIN MAN did.  It's on that level if you ask my opinion.<br /><br />PS, what happened to Shannyn Sossamon?  Seems like just yesterday she was Hollywood's it girl, enjoying leading lady parts in such films as A KNIGHT'S TALE or THE RULES OF ATTRACTION.  Here she plays, get this, "Pink Hair Girl"?  Are they trying to punish her for being beautiful and talented, or what?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is so full of energy and forward propulsion that it often trips over its own frenzied notions and plot machinations. This is screenwriter ("Lethal Weapon") Shane Black's first film as director and he is very keen on making the most of this opportunity: the 3rd wall is smashed and cleared away, the story is told both in flash backs and in flash forwards and Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart narrates in deadpan fashion that manages to be extremely witty and droll on the one hand and banal and silly at others.<br /><br />"KKBB" opens with an explosion of activity in which Harry a petty thief, while in the process of a robbery and running from the police, accidentally bursts into a room in which actors are being auditioned for a movie dealing with private eyes. He is thrust into service as an auditionee and is asked to screen test...moving closer to actually nabbing the movie role. And so it goes: one incredible and often hilarious plot twist after another.<br /><br />Downey, always a charming performer and who may be a bit too old for this part, in that he is supposed to be the same age as the smart, funny and adorable Michelle Monaghan who plays his childhood friend, Harmony Faith Lane...a great name, by-the-way. But be that as it may, the interplay between Monaghan and Downey as well as that with Val Kilmer as Gay Perry, a gay P.I. (I kid you not) is priceless: all are operating on the very highest level of their performing careers.<br /><br />Not every thing works in "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" but at least Black, by way of his throw in everything but the kitchen-sink style of directing, exhibits the cojones to play with the conventions of the detective story/thriller movie and make it work...most of the time: you must often risk the ridiculous in order to achieve the sublime is a lesson that Black has seemed to have learned very well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>I just had a blast watching "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang".<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is so funny as the actor who pretends to be detective. And Val Kilmer is perfect as Gay Perry.

The writers know just when to really go over the top. Some of the scenes made me laugh harder than I have at any movie in a long time.<br /><br />Very rarely do I enjoy dark humor. And very rarely do I see a movie twice. But I enjoyed this film so much, I am thinking of going back and seeing it again. It was that funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>I don't know, how do you not love a movie that includes lines like this one, about women in Los Angeles:<br /><br />"I swear to God, it's like somebody took America by the East Coast, and shook it, and all the normal girls managed to hang on."<br /><br />And that's what Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is like: Relentlessly clever dialogue, witty screenplay, extremely self-aware without crossing the line into being eye-glazing about it.<br /><br />Essentially an update of a second-tier LA-based noir film, the film moves so quickly and is so funny that many audiences may not catch that they're watching a film that could have once starred Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart. There's the beaten-to-a-pulp detective in over his head, the rich movers and shakers who can crush him at will, the dream girl who's alternately sexually available and loathes him, dead bodies that get moved around, seemingly on their own and lots more standard bits.<br /><br />Toss in Robert Downey, Jr. doing his best work in years, Val Kilmer, funny again for the first time in decades and the new-to-me-but-ought-to-be-a-star Michelle Monaghan, and you've got a solid, solid cast capable of making the clever script pop. Heck, there's even some footage from a truly awful 1980s Corbin Bernsen action movie, which isn't something you see every day.<br /><br />It's hard to figure how this got overlooked in theaters, but no fans of buddy movies (the film is written and directed by the creator of the first -- and vastly superior to the sequels -- Lethal Weapon movie), Downey or Kilmer should miss this.<br /><br />Sensationally great fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>If you've never seen a Robert Downey Jr. movie in your life, this is the film to pick up and watch. Now. Without fail. If what you really know about Robert is what you've read in the press about his addictions, then you need to educate yourself. I needed to be educated. I was. Here I am, four star review.<br /><br />The film starts off with a thief, Harry, running from the police, and landing himself in an audition. He cries, he gets the role. Bang. (Or bang bang, if you will.) He gets invited to a random party, meets a gay private investigator, played brilliantly by Val Kilmer, and meets the girl of his dreams from a few years ago. Dead bodies appear, and they must find the clues, and solve the murders before it's them up next.<br /><br />But Harry is also narrating the movie. He can pause the film and fill you in on the background, remind you about something that happened previously in the film, or hilariously rewind the movie. (So funny.)<br /><br />The one liners in this movie are hilarious. Basically every line that comes from Robert & Val's lips are nearly always funny. This film has everything else a murder mystery lacks - a sense of humour. And Robert of course. There's lots of trademarks in this - death, trashy clubs, sex, the beautiful blonde, wrapped up corpses, crazy clues, and lots and lots of twists.<br /><br />Every male watching this as probably aspired to be someone as cool as Harry at some point in their life. He's cool, he's a 'good' criminal, and he makes the audience root for him. Paired up against Perry, the gay PI, every scene will raise a smile (if not something else!), and the two actors have perfect chemistry together, and they probably had a laugh off screen as well as on.<br /><br />I won't spoil the movie any more for anyone who hasn't seen it, but for god's sake pick it up! It's definitely one I'll be looking out for, cheap, as the one liners are quick and witty, and the actors are amazing in it. Also, it'll be good if I can figure out (and remember) the twists and turns before they come this time. But pick it up. Robert is actually an actor, not just press fodder.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Harry Lockhart is a petty thief who has a turn of good luck when he's running from the police and enters an audition for a movie.  The cops don't find him and he's shipped to LA to screen test for a role.  Along the way he encounters Gay Perry, a consultant who is supposed to help Harry get into character for his role as a private investigator.  In preparation for the role, they unwittingly become involved in a real LA murder mystery involving Harmony, a struggling actress from Harry's past.<br /><br />This film was very funny and wasn't afraid to make fun of itself by using stereotypical Hollywood cliches.  In fact, one of the funnier things about it was the storyline revolving around how fake and ridiculous life in Hollywood is.  Good examples: A woman who comes up to Harry and says, "I do a little acting" is then shown to be the type of actress in late night Cinemax movies, or when a catty girl says Harry is checking him out he notes that they must have taken America by the East coast and shaken it, only the normal girls stayed and the others rolled down to LA.<br /><br />Overall this movie was funny and full of self-deprecating humor.  Val Kilmer's role as Perry was the highlight for me, as he was understatedly amusing in his supporting part.  The murder mystery takes a backseat to the comedy in this worthwhile film and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>I was hesitant to take on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) primarily because I was unsure if it would be any good based on some of the more prominent cast members, specifically Robert Downey Jr., who seems pretty flaky due to his continual problems with the drugs (he couldn't get enough!) and Val Kilmer, who's had more misses than hits, in my opinion (the last really good feature I saw him in was 1995's Heat).  Based partly on Brett Halliday's novel "Bodies Are Where You Find Them", adapted and directed by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, The Long Kiss Goodnight), the film stars, as I've mentioned, Robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin, Natural Born Killers) and Val Kilmer (Real Genius, Top Gun, Willow), along with Michelle Monaghan (The Bourne Supremacy, Mission: Impossible III).  Also appearing is Corbin Bernsen (The Dentist) and Larry Miller (Best in Show, A Mighty Wind).<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays the character Harry Lockhart, a small time New York criminal who falls bassackward into an acting gig after bungling a burglary and soon finds himself in the land of superficiality aka L.A., up for a role in a film as a private eye...well, sort of, but for more on that you'll have to watch the film.  Anyway, along the way the producer that `discovered' Harry hooks him up with a real private eye and flaming homersexual named Gay Perry (Kilmer), who, when not doing his normal gumshoe routine or chasing sausage provides technical expertise to actors with regards to his profession.  Soon after arriving Harry runs into a woman named Harmony Faith Lane (Monaghan), someone he grew up with in the Midwest and has now come west like so many others to be a star.  Here's the thing, Harry had it bad for Harmony since way back when and seeing her again he finds his desire hasn't diminished over the years.  Anyway, soon after meeting up with Harmony, things get seriously complicated as Harmony, believing Harry's a private detective (I guess telling a woman you've got the hots for you're a private eye sounds a lot better than telling her you're a two bit crook), hires Harry to find her little sister, who's come west for reasons revealed in the film.  What follows is Harry, Harmony, and Perry becoming entangled in a completely outlandish series of events involving a homicide, gunplay, torture (electrical shocks to the genitals no less), an attempted frame-up, a severed finger, more gunplay, more homicides, a suicide, a wealthy heiress, some henchmen, some romance, bubble headed blondes, an errant corpse or two, a car chase, a flying coffin, police, various weirdoes, and so on...seriously, so much stuff happens it'd be a ridiculously poor effort on my part to provide an more detailed summary.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier I was hesitant to take on this film, but I'm really glad I did, as this is probably one of the best black comedy/action/mystery thrillers I've seen in awhile.  Writer and first time director Shane Black manages wonderfully to take the essence of those pulpy fiction detective novels (which literally figure into the actual story) and fuse it with some modernly icky sensibilities in a kooky amalgam that never takes itself too seriously, the result being some kind of weird fusion that works and works well, for myself at least.  Black does an outstanding job directing, especially given the amount of things thrown at the viewer in terms of twists and turns.  Not only that, but the pacing seems to be stuck on warp speed, as viewers barely have time to catch their breathe.  The only downside I could see where a couple of minor plot holes (how did Harry manage to shoot so well near the end of the film?  It's not like he had extensive experience with firearms) and a few, menial continuity errors, but given the fact the feature kept me thoroughly engaged and entertained throughout, it was easy for me to overlook this aspects.  I thought Downey, who supposedly cleaned up his personal issues, did a remarkable job in the main role, and I especially liked his narration, which, at times, became self aware as his character would make critical comments on the film itself.  Could I have pictured someone else in his role?  Yes, but I think few would have brought the controlled, manic energy he possessed.  I also thought Kilmer did an excellent job as the gay, streetwise detective, and the pairing of him and Downey provided a weird and interesting chemistry that worked surprisingly well.  I though the exchange below, which occurred after a stakeout that ended miserably and Perry's dropping Harry off at his apartment, adequately defines their sketchy hate/hate relationship...<br /><br />Perry: Go. Sleep badly. Any questions, hesitate to call.<br /><br />Harry: Bad.<br /><br />Perry: Excuse me?<br /><br />Harry: Sleep bad. Otherwise it makes it seem like the mechanism that allows you to sleep...<br /><br />Perry: What, f***head? Badly's an adverb. Who taught you grammar? Get out. Vanish.<br /><br />The rapid-fire dialog throughout the films snaps, crackles, and pops although if you're adverse to the excessive usage of profanity, you'll probably have a real problem with this film.  I did find the final ending (there were a few) kind of sappy and unnecessary (it features the confrontation of a sickly, bed ridden man responsible, in a roundabout way, for a good deal of what happens in the story), but all in all I thought this a very sharp, entertaining, darkly humorous film that should have probably done better than it did when originally released, but will most certainly find it's audience now that it's been released to DVD.  Given Black's obvious talent for direction, I hope he's planning on helming some more features in the future.<br /><br />The picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, is sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 audio, available in English, French, and Spanish, comes across strong and crisp.  Special features include a gag reel, an entertaining commentary track with Downey, Kilmer, and writer/director Black, a theatrical trailer, and subtitles in English, French and Spanish.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Oh My Gawd!

Stylized, somewhat self-satisfied, so pleased with it's own cleverness--this type of movie can easily rub me the wrong way!  But the odd thing is, "Kiss Kiss" walks that fine line so precariously--yet falls onto the side of good entertainment.  It's fast paced, funny and filled with good performances.  Even though the picture tries so hard, I ended up admiring that effort as opposed to being put off by it.<br /><br />The ostensible plot of "Kiss Kiss" really isn't that important.  Let's just say that Robert Downey, Jr., is a small time crook masquerading as an actor masquerading as a detective.  The film works as a homage to every pulp fiction detective story you've ever read and/or seen.  Following all the necessary conventions, yet tweaking them with abundant humor, it's a twisty and fun ride.  It's not the most difficult mystery to unravel but with "Kiss Kiss," it's all about the journey.<br /><br />But in addition to being a send-up of pulp detective and noir films, "Kiss Kiss" actually works as an effective satire on Hollywood as well.  It's pretty spot-on in it's depiction of the Hollywood "scene" and the community on the cusp of success.  And this, blended with the mystery, provide an absurd and magical backdrop to the story.  But the success of "Kiss Kiss" relies most heavily on it's screenplay.  One of the funniest, self-aware (but in a good way), and fastest scripts I've seen in a long time--most of the lines are delivered so quickly and in such a dead pan manner, it takes a moment to process just how witty they are.  This is an intelligent comedy for someone that appreciates cleverness, and you miss a lot of humor if you're not paying close attention.  It once again balances well--this time mainstream humor with "inside" industry jokes--so that everyone can enjoy this sly film.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr., has a certain loose, hangdog appeal as the lead.  This is the type of material he excels at.  Val Kilmer has received a lot of attention as a gay private eye and it's a nicely controlled performance.  It's good to see him return to sophisticated entertainment.  And Michelle Monaghan also does nicely in the sexy, smart girlfriend role.<br /><br />Recommended to mystery and comedy lovers, and particularly suited to film geeks and noir enthusiasts--"Kiss Kiss" works on that rare level of absurd, but intelligent, entertainment.  KGHarris, 11/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>There is something about this movie that makes people want to write reviews longer than the tax code but suffice to say, if you've seen enough Hollywood action spectaculars to realize how silly they are, you can't help but enjoy KKBB.  Its well written, everybody in it is perfectly cast and its surprisingly easy to follow for an intentionally non-linear mess.  It also manages to be funny and exciting while being totally absurd.<br /><br />The plot is intentionally too complex, the coincidences utterly implausible, the stunts are laughably over the top.  But that's the idea.  After seeing so many movies with "messages" about good, evil, life, death and infinity (usually based on comic books) its refreshing to something that's all in fun.  This is one movie where both the actors and the audience get to have a really good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>What witty action!  I really enjoyed the humor of this film. Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in his role, as were Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan.  The three had fantastic chemistry and every scene showed that synergy.  I loved the layers of the murder mystery allying goofball antics and smart twists.  Color also played an important role in the film--vivid comic book-esque scenes enhanced the edginess of the dark comedy.  Downey's narration was consistently amusing.  This film's ability to mock itself made every scene move the plot at a pretty intense pace.  As I am wont to love, really smart lines abound.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This movie is original and funny, with descent suspense and twists.  Robert Downy plays Harry, a man from out east who had a less than desirable past thrust into the hollywood scene by accidently stubling into a casting call after a botched robbery.  The role that the call was for is a detective part, he manages to get selected, and then has to shadows Val Kilmer, AKA Gay Perry, a detective who gets pushed into his biggest case that he never expected, dragging Harry with him.  Along the way they meet Michelle Monaghan at a party, who is an old friend of Harry's from Indiana.  Of course, the stories continue to get more conveluded and intertwined as the body count goes up, to an ending that is a nice surprise.  Funny, entertaining, suspenseful, a movie that could have been promoted more by the company.  Rent it now, buy it now, either way, you will be happy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>On the run from the law, hapless petty thief Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.) crashes into a film audition and ends up with the part. He is flown to Los Angeles, where he is taken under the wing of tough private eye and moonlighting movie consultant Gay Perry (Val Kilmer), called that because he's gay. At a party, Lockhart bumps into Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), a Hollywood starlet and also Harry's unrequited childhood love from back home. Very quickly, the three become embroiled in a complex, bullet-ridden case involving a murdered socialite and, possibly, Harmony's little sister.<br /><br />Shane Black (famed for his screenplays on the Lethal Weapon series) makes his directing debut and comes up with an unmitigated winner. In this lively, darkly funny feature, Black successfully integrates slick production values with a witty, tangled, self-referential script and smoking performances from his actors. At the same time, Black turns topsy-turvy several conventions in the action buddy genre to which he himself has amply contributed.<br /><br />The actors are very good here; one could sense the fun they were having. The three leads have combustible chemistry. Val Kilmer endows Gay Perry with a perfect balance of  machismo, intelligence and world-weary air. And wicked,  deadpan sarcasm. I haven't seen Michelle Monaghan before but she is a revelation as Harmony Faith Lane. Harmony is decidedly smart, is delightfully down to earth, and has had life experience. Yet, she retains a modicum of adolescent innocence. It's pretty obvious why Harry's jonesing for her. Hopefully, we see more of the sexy Michele in future films. But it is Robert Downey, Jr. who shines the most. His charisma is still intact, his wry, droll acting skills still very much present for us to savor. He's still very, very likable. I had fun listening to his dry, teasing narrative voice-over, which he delivers in a laid-back, natural fashion. I think Downey, Jr. is an actor I'll always root for. Two words: sequel, please.<br /><br />The Special Features section could have had more goodies. But what it does have is pretty sweet: A funny film commentary by Shane Black, Robert Downey, Jr. and Val Kilmer; an outtake reel; and a theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>As its title suggests, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is a film noir spoof whose energy and style  compensate for its overall dearth of laughs.<br /><br />The highly complicated plot begins when Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr.), a petty thief living in Manhattan, literally stumbles into a movie acting career while fleeing the police on a heist gone wrong.  Before he knows what's happened, he's standing by a pool in Hollywood surrounded by a slew of moviemaking hotshots and wannabe starlets including Val Kilmer as a gay private eye and Michelle Monaghan as an aspiring actress who also happens to be a childhood chum from Harry's days growing up in Indiana.  Then, as if he had suddenly fallen into one of those dime store crime novels, Harry finds himself plunged into a dark mystery involving not one but two unexplained murders.<br /><br />Writer/director Shane Blake has a great time lampooning not merely the conventions of film noir and Chandler-esque pulp fiction - the convoluted plotting, the self-conscious dialogue, the smart-alecky narration and the casual popgun violence - but Tinsel Town phoniness as well.  In both storyline and style, the film often blurs the fine line separating mundane "reality" from the contrivances and absurdities of movie fiction, most notably by having Harry frequently address the audience directly in his narration.<br /><br />There's no denying that "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"  is a high energy lark, filled with creativity and imagination and featuring sharp performances from Downey Jr., Kilmer, Monaghan and a whole host of excellent supporting players.  The problem with the film, though, is that for all its cleverness, it really just isn't as witty as it should be.  Although we can sense what it is we're supposed to be finding humorous, for some reason the laughs just never seem to come with any great regularity.  Too often the humor feels forced and strained so that at best the movie elicits a chuckle here or there instead of a series of full-throated guffaws.<br /><br />Still, this is a fast-paced, clever, if not particularly memorable film that captures the quintessence of L.A.-derived fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>This is one of those rare and delightful films that gets noir and also has no problem whatsoever stretching the genre and making fun of it.  Kilmer and Downey are unusually well paired in their love/hate relationship.  But the best part is the narrative flow and how it ties into the story yet is still surprising and/or humorous.  This isn't a movie you can watch while doing something else.  It will require your full attention if you wish to spot all the nuances.  Lots of jokes about LA people, especially women in entertainment.  Mostly true.  WHEN WATCHED: August 2010; MY GRADE: A minus.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Thanks to a recommendation from fellow Ammy-friend, Jeffrey Miller, I decided to go ahead and check out `Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.  I didn't know anything about this movie except that Downey Jr. was in it, Val Kilmer likes men and Michelle Monaghan was the love interest (and I'm totally interested in being in love with her) and so I was taken by surprise as the mock-noir vibe of the film set in, complete with sketchy narration and one preposterous premise after another.  Directed by a screenwriter, the film has a clever way of poking fun at the things we all tend to hate about movies.<br /><br />Clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />The film starts at an industry party (well, it starts with a children's magician act) where we meet Harry who is there with Perry where he meets Harmony.  Harry is a thief who, in an attempt to escape from the cops, stumbles into an audition for a movie and lands the role where he is paired up with private detective Perry who plays consultant for movies.  Accompanying Perry on a stakeout he happens to witness the dumping of a body that somehow happens to coincide with the suicide of Harmony's sister, instantly calling to mind a story straight out of a crime novel that happens to have ties to a very influential (and controversial) man.<br /><br />I have a few issues with the film, most of which come from the construction.  I love the way they go full force into attacking the genre and trying to pull it apart and reconstruct it, but in the process I feel like confusion is born.  Some of the plot points, while understandably unbelievable, are borderline preposterous, which kind of takes you out of the vibe at times.  I also felt that the relationship between Harmony and Harry was verging on annoying and even obnoxious, and it was a part of the film I was not a fan of.<br /><br />That said, there is also a LOT that I really liked about this movie.<br /><br />The acting, for starters, was top notch.  Even though I wasn't a fan of the scripts treatment of Harry and Harmony, both Downey Jr. and Monaghan were fantastic, especially Michelle, who really understood the balance between borderline psychotic and tactlessly seductive.  Downey Jr. had a few spotty moments, but he handled the wit of the script very well, and sold quite a few scenes that could have tanked the film had they not been handled properly (his whole lost finger scenario was pricelessly handled, and that was a part of the film that could have easily been a flaw but he turned it into a highlight).  All said and done though, I was a little disappointed with him because I expected more from an actor who I generally LOVE (his performances in `Tropic Thunder', `Less than Zero' and `Chaplin' are just a few examples of his supreme talent).  For me though, this movie BELONGS to Val Kilmer.  I have never truly been a devoted fan of his, but I have liked his work in the past (and feel that he should have an Oscar for his work in `The Doors'...because I feel he was better than Hopkins in `The Silence of the Lambs'!) and I consider this to be a shining star performance, one I never expected from him.  Not only is he effortlessly hilarious, but he gets the small nuances of his character, and he even convinces you to second guess him with his playful subtleties (and that final scene, with the face slaps, was such a nice tonal shift but so authentic).<br /><br />I totally recommend this one.  It is a modernized film noir that uses the director's knowledge of the writing process to create something that you've never seen before.  Yes, at times I found the narration (and that whole `stop-go' flow of the storyline) to be a tad distracting, but it's a small infraction.  In fact, this is one of those films that I strongly feel will continue to grow on me to the point where, in a few months or maybe a year or two from now, I'll be wishing that I gave this an A grade instead of a B+.<br /><br />Jeffrey, thanks for the recommendation!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>In "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" you get everything you want to see on screen; murders, actions, wickedly funny dialogues, two cool guys and one beautiful lady, Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. are superb an incongruous pair who find themselves caught in the intrigues of the underworld in LA. Plus, the film is directed by a person who knows the industry of Hollywood, so what else do you need?<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is Harry, a thief who has managed to escape from the police by being mistaken for a method actor. After flying to LA, he meets a PI named Gay (Val Kilmer) and his (Harry's) childhood friend Harmony (Michelle Monaghan). The convoluted story unfolds in a film-noir fashion after Harry stumbles upon two dead bodies in three hours. Obviously he is in trouble, but how?<br /><br />Writer/director Shane Black's screenplay is full of violence, but like "Pulp Fiction" the violence is of comic-book kind, nothing you should take seriously. The film is also successful in surprising us with unexpected twists and turns of the narrative and the tone of the story, which is sometimes very dark, and then suddenly becomes uproariously.<br /><br />There are references to Hollywood or noir genre, but Shane Black cleverly avoids the pitfalls of making it too self-referential (like so many cameos popping up). Instead he created an intriguing trio of characters integral to the story, which is the driving force of the film. The three leads are all fantastic, and I knew Robert Downey Jr.'s talent for credibly showing a variety of emotions of the character, but I never knew Val Kilmer could be so good with a nuanced performance, which is also a great asset of the film. And don't forget sexy and delightful Michelle Monaghan, who is much better than in `Mission Impossible III."<br /><br />"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is, as its title suggests, a modern version of noir film made with wit and humor, exactly what "Miami Vice" should have been.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>Although this movie commits the usually worst sin in Hollywood filmmaking (voiceover narration) thanks to the abilities of Robert Downey and the writer to poke fun at that technique, it works.<br /><br />Definitely a convoluted plot that you really need to just forget worrying about figuring out and just follow the violent fun. Val Kilmer is classic as a wise cracking smartass gay (yes, you heard that right) P.I. but every character commands the screen either dead or alive.<br /><br />The whole update on the film noir genre also works thanks to its ability to integrate a wide world of El Lay landscape from Hollywood parties, MacArthur's Park, a mental hospital (reminiscent a bit of the old folks' home in "Chinatown"), hotel rooftop pools and the ubiquitous roads and freeways of the county.<br /><br />Having said all this, I would rate this more a rental than a purchase given the DVD has lousy extras--just the usual commentary track.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I passed on this film when it was in theaters.  I guess I thought it was going to be all shooting and car chases.  Well there was a certain amount of those.  But it was so much more!  A very clever script, brilliantly brought to life by a terrific cast.<br /><br />I love Robert Downey, Jr. although I fell out of love temporarily at Sherlock Holmes.  I was very happy to see him in top of his form.  He's perfect as the hapless petty criminal who stumbles, literally into a job as an actor, and a huge mess.  Downey and Kilmer spar beautifully as the crook and the gay PI who fall in together to make sense of their revolting predicament.  Michelle Monaghan is just right as Downey's love interest.  She's good hearted and cute and really dumb at times (manages to cut off Downey's finger) and brilliant and heroic at other times.  I'd love to see a sequal with the two of them.<br /><br />The dialog is as clever and snappy as anything you'll find in a 30's screwball comedy and there are some hilarious sight gags.  I loved it when Downey finds himself under the table with the pink-wigged girl.<br /><br />I did get lost in some of the plot twists but it didn't make any difference.  The three stars are so compelling that the plot just serves as a vehicle for watching them do their stuff.<br /><br />I hope this film gets the audience it deserves.  I had more genuine laughs here than at anything I've seen in quite a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A wonderfully funny movie for people who have seen too many movies and know every single cliche, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is often accused of being "too clever by half" but let me be the one to assure you that its cleverness and wit are distinct virtues; if you want a smart, amusing movie that'll have you laughing out loud and quoting it endlessly to your friends, watch this hilarious comedy.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Part of me clearly appreciates the clever, loving riffs on noir movies, but part of me is seriously put off by the nudge, nudge, ain't I being clever pretensions of writer-director Shane Black. At one time, and maybe he still is, Shane was Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter, proud author of such big-time drek as the Lethal Weapon movies, Monster Squad, Last Action Hero and The Last Boy Scout. In other words, he knew how to hit a bulls-eye with the 18 to 28 male target audience. In Hollywood, that spells quality writing with a cap Q.<br /><br />With Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, we're witness to one of Hollywood's power players with a potty mouth wrestling with style and witty parody. The witty parody wins, but it's a close call. Why? Because Black can't resist self-congratulatory in-jokes and reveling in his own cleverness. He's the smart-mouth kid who tries to be the nonstop laugh and life of the party.<br /><br />The set-up is nice...petty thief Harry Lockhart is running from the cops in New York when he busts in on a talent call for a movie. In short order he's sent to Los Angeles for more tests for a part of a private eye. Real private eye Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) is assigned to prep him. Then at a party he encounters Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan), a woman he fell for when they were school children in Indiana. Before long Harry, who isn't too bright but is well meaning, is finding bodies in car trunks, on floors and in beds. He's beaten, shot, tortured and has a finger swallowed by a friendly mutt. Gay Perry keeps rescuing him, Harmony keeps tempting him and hit men dog them all. The mystery is almost irrelevant. It's the brittle style, smart-mouth dialogue, loving reverence for the noir sensibility and the acting that gives us pleasure. For my taste, Black's Hollywood insider cleverness in both the writing and the directing starts to get tiresome...not enough to be a complete turn-off, but enough that I wished he'd stop nudging us with his elbow. The movie chapter headings he gives us, each one a title of a Raymond Chandler novel, is a case in point. Clever and amusing the first time, tiresome the second time and "alright, all ready, we get it" each time after.<br /><br />Kilmer and Monaghan do fine jobs with their roles, but it is Downey who really shines. He now has a hard-earned, lived-in face that serves him well. He can handle drama as easily as comedy. With Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, his Harry Lockhart is not exactly a loser, but he certainly is slow at grasping essential facts. Downey gives Harry a great deal for us to like. Mainly, he gives us a well-intentioned guy to whom all sorts of things happen. Harry survives because he's serious, because he's loyal to Perry, because he loves Harmony and because Downey has superb comic timing.<br /><br />The title comes from Pauline Kael by way of an old Italian movie poster. Says Roger Ebert, "These four words, she wrote, `are perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of the movies. The appeal is what attracts us and ultimately makes us despair when we begin to understand how seldom movies are more than this.'" Hmmm...like the Lethal Weapon movies, Monster Squad, Last Action Hero and The Last Boy Scout?<br /><br />The movie looks just fine. The extras include a commentary track by Kilmer, Downey and Black as well as a gag outtake reel. I didn't bother with either.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Satiring many of the conventions of the action movie genre that he helped create; Shane Black weaves and directs the enjoyable and fun Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.  Robert Downey Jr. plays Harry; a small time hood who inadvertantly gets confused to be an actor.  After flying out to L.A., he gets embroiled in a devious plot of mistaken identity and murder, while teaming up with a gay private detective (Val Kilmer) and trying to win the love of his life (Michelle Monaghan).  Black does a wonderful job, and his cast is even better as they are clearly enjoying themselves; particularly Downey and Kilmer whose quick witted quips and interplay are enough of a blast to carry the film on it's own.  The only downside of the film is that at times it takes itself too seriously, but Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is an enjoyable ride regardless.  Fans of action movies, particularly those who have seen a number of ones from the 80's and early 90's, will get a real kick out of this film, and should definitely check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought that this movie was really funny. It wasn't the greatest movie ever made but for a comedy it was smart, unpredictable and different. This is something that is a rarity these days as most comedies are stupid and confuse vulgarity and shock for humor. Robert Downey and Val Kilmer as Gay Perry are both excellent choices for their roles and do a very good job. The dialouge is smart, quick and funny.<br /><br />I recommend this movie highly. Check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang bears more than one watching for its tangled plot (although nicely explicated in the end), its numerous throwaway funny lines, and its sheer entertainment.  Robert Downey Jr. is a small-time NYC theft artist who stumbles into a movie audition while fleeing the police.  The audition leads to Hollywood,a friendship with gay private detective Val Kilmer, and the chance to at last sleep with the old high school flame who went to bed with every boy in the school but him.  It also leads him smack into a murder mystery and a body in his apartment.  Downey and Kilmer have great fun with their roles and the supporting cast is fine as well.  LA also stars, looking as glitzy and tawdry as it did in other LA noir classics LA Confidential and Chinatown.  Round it all out with snacks and a nice bottle of wine and you've got a great night of at-home entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I wouldn't normally dish out 5 stars unless something was a classic or an Oscar winner in my opinion. Yet, the last few years have been dismal when it comes to making memorable, unique, quality films that will stand the test of time, and KISS KISS, BANG BANG was one of the most satisfying and entertaining films I've seen in a LONG LONG LONG TIME.<br /><br />Sharp. Crisp. Creative. Great screenplay. Unique. Different. Characters you can get behind and feel for. Personalities that capture your interest. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is a stylish, fast paced, in your face, suspensful, violent, funny, modern, slice of film noir.<br /><br />You can tell that SOMEBODY took their time with this one. Made sure they had a tight, solid and flawless script. Unlike most movies these days that are slopped together to beat deadlines, KISS KISS, BANG BANG made the rarely done these days decision to make sure they had it all covered before finishing.<br /><br />All that being said, the real quality of KISS KISS, BANG BANG comes from its stars... and I do mean STARS. Too many actors and actress are showing up these days who's only talent is being rich and related to someone who's good. It's nice to be reminded who the real stars are.<br /><br />Michelle Monaghan is a charming and shining delight throughout the film. From the moment she curled up to the detective novel she finds at a Hollywood party to going after the bad guys in her Santa Claus costume with gun in hand, she wins you over and proves she's gonna be a BIG BIG star.<br /><br />VAL KILMER is always an underrated talent and one of my favorites. He's been robbed of an Oscar twice (Tombstone & the Doors), and he's been shunned in some circles, but Val has always been unique and takes chances. No matter what movie he does, you never look at him as... "that's Val Kilmer", he becomes his characters, like Doc Holliday, like Jim Morrison & like the brash, not-a-nice-guy, gay Perry in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.<br /><br />And Finally, Robert Downey Jr. Please Robert... keep making movies. Don't ever get sidetracked again, and don't ever forget how stickin' good you are. I don't know if his dialogue is scripted or if he is improvising from time to time, but Downey Jr. is ALWAYS in KISS KISS saying something witty, interesting or just making you think. He proves in this movie how good HE IS and ALWAYS has been.<br /><br />KISS KISS, BANG BANG is a fast moving creative minded joy and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies like I do.<br /><br />I only have one question???  So, seeing as though, this has very very few special features... a gag reel, that's it, when is the special edition DVD coming out? and is it pointless to buy this one now? Stinkin' greedy hollywood. Don't they make enough money already?</p></br></body></html>

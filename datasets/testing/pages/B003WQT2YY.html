In "Amadeus" he shatters all preconceptions of his talents as an actor, deserving credit for fully realizing a complex, satisfying character with pure sincerity and wham-packed emotion.  He has guts that far outweigh Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham (the villainous Salieri who is contemptuous sarcastic, and jealous of the genius whose life is splayed before him.)  Hulce taunts, whoops and wallops the part out of the ballpark, with a childish relish that makes the audience long for the days when men wore white wigs and women corsets.  <p>The music is exquisite, needless to say, and Milos Forman once again proves his mettle as a fierce director - even "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" (Forman's first Oscar film) seems novice-like after you witness the depth and beauty of "Amadeus."  The film easily ranks as one of the best biographical portraits ever imagined from Hollywood, and on your DVD player, you'll experience SOUND unlike anything you ever imagined was possible.  Turn it up and let Hulce steal you away!  This is the perfect film for anyone who doesn't REALLY enjoy classical music, because here, the music is transforming and you become caught up in its lyrical melodies as much as in the story.  A wonderful film with a magnificent performance by Tom Hulce!</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This is one heck of a Blu Ray release!!!

The movie swept the Academy Award ceremony the year of its release, winning Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, and five others and it holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 List (#53). This is odd for a movie about classical music that features a lot of opera singing in it. For me, the most appealing thing about the film is the two lead performances. F. Murray Abraham (as Salieri) and Tom Hulce (as Mozart). Throughout the film, Salieri is a sympathetic character despite the fact that he's a jealous, only quasi-talented man jealous of someone else's gifts. Meanwhile, Mozart is the character we should feel for and yet, throughout the whole movie (until the end), we want to kick him in the face. The movie opens many years after Mozart has died and Salieri, a once great composer, tries to commit suicide claiming he killed Mozart. The rest of the film is a flashback, as Salieri tells a priest the story. A story about how he longed for greatness and then saw the most brilliant musician of all time in the form of Mozart, a young man with an obnoxious personality and an annoying laugh. Salieri is jealous that these great gifts have been bestowed on such an immature person, he begins plotting to kill Mozart...But not until he's acquired some of the man's final writings. Anyway, enough with the synopsis because I'm pretty sure you've already heard it anyway. The movie is, obviously, a period piece and it does have lavish costumes and people writing with feathers. I know a good many people who won't watch a movie for those reasons, but "Amadeus" feels extraordinarily modern. Forman, a Czechoslovakian director who made films there and then came to America to great success, is a great director and this film is one of his greatest triumphs. It's funny, has great dialogue, and the performances are (once again) DYNAMITE! Even though Abraham won the Academy Award, Hulce could have just as easily scooped it up. I think, in the end, it's not that one performance is better than the other...It's just that Hulce is really annoying and Abraham is just incredible. Even people who aren't fans of Mozart (I've never listened to him myself) or aren't fans of these kinds of movies, I promise that you won't regret watching this film.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>Tom Hulce as Mozart is without doubt the irreverent bad boy of classical music in AMADEUS. F. Murray Abraham as composer Antonio Salieri is enamored by Mozart. Salieri recognizes his genius yet simultaneously loathes Mozart's irreverence for his gift. Both lead destructive lives. One is shattered by jealousy while the other is destroyed by uncontrollable self indulgence. This is innovative film making both engrossing and at times almost irreverent in its approach. But that is what makes it stand out from more conventional filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>AMADEUS, a great work of cinematic art, brought to the screen by the great Milos Foreman, is perhaps (in my opinion) one of the greatest films of his career.  It was a career-making vehicle for F. Murray Abraham, who went on to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his role as the sadistic and insane Antonio Salieri, a jealous rival of the late, great Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce).  This film is part fantasy (a fictionalized account of the life and untimely death of the title composer, through the eyes of the elderly Salieri, who has been confined to insane asylum (or maybe the better word is "imprisoned," from his perspective), part musical tribute to some of the most well-known and beautifully written Mozart compositions.<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail about the plot.  That would easily ruin this film for you.  I will say that the acting is great, the music is gorgeous, there are moments of great humor, followed by high drama and the whole plot concept of this film is not so much crafted to romanticize Mozart as a man and an artist (far from it).  Instead, it examines the forces behind evil, jealousy and (ultimately) deception.  This is a very distinctive, evocative and compelling work of art.  I only hope that they re-release it in the movie theaters again.  You can't really experience it in its full glory (in my opinion) unless you have seen it on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>I have seen very few operas, but this still remains one my very favorite films.  It's wonderfully done in every way.  From sets, to costumes, to characters, to the story, to the perfomances, everything about this film is high, high quality.<br /><br />I really like how the narration is done from the antagonist's point of view, and speaking of the antagonist, I've never seen anyone do a better acting job.  It was as if you could see exactly what he was thinking the whole time.  Let's see Paris Hilton do that.<br /><br />The focus of this film isn't really on Mozart.  It's on a contemporary of his that no one knows about.  It's really a great story.  A must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>An old and senile Salieri sits at the piano playing some of his tunes to a young priest.He asks him whether he recognises any of the melodies he is playing. With a polite smile and a blank expression, the priest responds that he did not.Then Salieri stops for a second, and then asks, what about this tune? He plays another, and suddenly the priest's eyes light up in instant recognition and shouts: oh yes I know this one, is this yours?<br />Salieri with a very bitter sigh responds: this is Mozart!<p>What a way to start a film and what a scene to introduce that masterpiece that is Amadeus.<br />A genuis child prodigy that was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart took Europe by storm, and success,fame,admiration,sponsorship and financial protection was the natural result.But there was a  darker side to that fame: the excesses, the gossip, the conspiracies, the politics of the court, Mozart's own inner demons, and his peculiar relationship with his father, respect that hides fear. And of course there was Salieri!<br />A veteran at the royal courts, a mediocre composer who has found a secure place for his limited talent,only to find its very foundations threatened by this newcomer..Jealousy and  bitterness were the natural outcome, but carefully hidden by the guise of friendliness and protective wisdom, while Mozart still retaining a trusting naivity that would eventually hasten his downfall.<br />This is the story of THE best musical biography ever filmed(Period!), from a director who is no 'hired hand' but an artist in his own right. It is a very ambitious film, very lush, beautiful to watch and hear, an epic of dramatic and musical propotions.<br />There are good music biographies,like Ken Russell's Music Lovers (Russell has a life long passion for classical music), his own unique version of Tchaikovsky's life, in addition to Lizstmania and Mahler. Beethoven had an excellent and underrated biography in Immortally Beloved, but still Amadeus remains in a league of its own.<br />This status comes from the fact that the director and writer successfully manage to give an equal treatment to the music,the genuis of Mozart, and to the human drama, the essence of Mozart. The opera/concert scenes are not hurried but remain an integral part of the plot.(more of these scenes were added for the extended version)<br />F Murray Abraham won a deserved Oscar for playing Salieri so perfectly, but I would have loved for Tom Hulce to have won his nomination too: a pity since he has brought so much life and creativity to his role.<br />Now another scene,<br />A dying,weak and delirious Mozart lying in his bed is dictating his latest composition to Salieri (pretending till the end to be the trusted friend)..<br />Mozart is slow at first, but then as if suddenly possessed by the demon of music, the notes started flowing, faster than Salieri could write them, and not only flowing but the Italian composer is in a state of sheer disbelief at what he is actually writing, music  that would become the most haunting classic piece ever composed, the Requiem.<br />You too will stare in disbelief at this creativity unfolding in front of Salieri's  eyes and yours too!<br />Now how many films manage to do that??<br />Hmmm..let me see.....</p></br><a href="../users/ACVNA57PI4DLV.html">ACVNA57PI4DLV</a><br/><p>I have to confess that I really, really don't like historical dramas. I usually find them overbearing and tedious. This may sound hypocrite coming from a guy who loves three-hour movies, but when there's nothing engaging in the material, 1.5 hours of dreck can be quite long. <p>Amadeus is not such a movie. It is a historical drama done right. Despite its title, its main character is not Amadeus Mozart, but rather Salieri, contemporary composer and rival who has claimed to have murdered Mozart. The movie is not based on the real facts of the matter (we will probably never know, anyway), but on an interpretation of the facts. Amadeus is historically accurate, as far as it goes, even down to Mozart's annoying laugh, which was described by a contemporary as "metal scraping glass". <p>Here, Salieri sees Mozart as God's incarnation on Earth - and since God has refused to give him the ultimate talent to sing his praises, and instead gave it to that vulgar iconoclast kid, he will do everything in his power, use all his wiles, to defeat and kill him. <p>It is a story of religious delusion, yes, but clearly also about mediocrity. The mediocre always seek to enslave the successful, be it in politics (suffice it to see the success of social programs and socialization of vital institutions) or otherwise. Salieri suffers : he is good enough to know that Mozart is an absolute genius, but cannot be elevated to his level. <p>For sure, the sets are sumptuous, and the acting right on the note. The accents are distracting, the acting can be slightly overbearing, and the music is overwhelming at times. But there is no point in overaccentuating those : this is a masterpiece, deserving of all the praises it got.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Difficult to say, actually.  Some scenes have been fleshed out, some with minor additional dialogue and some with lengthy additions.  But for those of us who have seen the film repeatedly over the years and know the film's tempo rather intimately, the additional scenes disrupt the pacing more than they contribute to the story.  <p>Viewers might have been better served by having the addional footage relegated to the Bonus Features section rather than spliced into the film.  Or, better yet, the makers of this DVD could have offered two playback options - original version AND Director's Cut.  Other movies on DVD have integrated that option seamlessly.  David Cronenberg's film &quot;Crash&quot; comes to mind.  On that DVD you can opt for either the R rated version or the NC-17 version, and the DVD player plays or skips the chosen footage.  That would have been my preference for this &quot;Amadeus&quot; Director's Cut.<p>But what do we get with this new footage?  Insight into Constanze's dislike of Salieri at the film's end (courtesy of a brief bit of nudity on Elizabeth Berridge's part that seems gratuitous now), an extension of the scene in which Christine Ebersole's character discovers that Mozart is two-timing her, snippets of addtional dialogue between the aged Salieri and the young priest, a middle-act bookend sequence about Mozart's attempts to hire himself out as a music tutor to the daughter of actor Kenneth McMillan's character [surely McMillan would have been pleased to see his role restored in a Best Picture winner], and a few assorted other scenes/lines that clarify a few points here and there.  The best and most interesting addition to me, however, was a rather ominous line reading by F. Murray Abraham's Salieri early in the film after he recounts first hearing Mozart's music.  &quot;[music that good by that young, foul-mouthed child] must be an accident.  It MUST be.  ...It better be!&quot;  Here we get an earlier indication of the depth and maliciousness of Salieri's jealousy.<p>As of this writing I still prefer the original version better, but I may eventually grow used to this longer cut.  Fortunately I have the THX-treatment Pioneer LaserDisc Signature Edition from several years ago.  The LaserDisc set has the same running commentary by Milos Forman and Peter Shaffer (though the &quot;new&quot; footage on the new DVD has newly-recorded commentary behind most of it), and a different behind-the-scenes documentary called &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;.  A few moments of &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; are incorporated into the DVD's b-t-s doc, but they otherwise contain different material.  <p>Some of the most interesting footage of the new documentary, however, is the footage from screen tests and auditions of other actors who sought the major roles.  Their faces have been masked by digital blur (so the producers wouldn't have to pay them for appearing in this documentary, among other reasons both legal and for sake of courtesy), but you can make out Mick Jagger and Elizabeth McGovern fairly easily.  You can also see a page or two of audition/screen test schedule sheets with times reserved for Sam Waterston, Rebecca DeMornay, and others.  There is also footage of actress Meg Tilly in rehearsals as Constanze.  The producers have not hidden the fact over the years that Tilly was cast and set to begin shooting as Constanze, but a leg injury sidelined her at literally the last minute.  Berridge and an unnamed other actress survived the winnowing process to select Tilly's replacement, and they were flown to Prague for test shoots.  That story is covered in greater detail in the documentary.<br /><br />Matter of fact, why didn't the makers of this Director's Cut DVD include &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; in addition to the other new documentary?  There certainly is room for it on Disc 2.  All in all, the bonus extras on this 2 Disc Special Edition are in short supply, when one considers the amount of Disc Two's unused potential space.<p>But if you weren't one of the fortunate ones to get the LaserDisc Signature Edition back in the day, then the whole of the running commentary will be new to you, and I'm sure you will be most pleased with it.<p>Well, there it is!</p></br><a href="../users/ATE5SA1VTJNP8.html">ATE5SA1VTJNP8</a><br/><p>This is one I can never get sick of! The music sounds magical (especially on DVD) as one would expect. Yet the best thing to me about this is F. Murray Abrahams performance as Saliri...just plain brilliant!

Check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>&quot;Amadeus&quot; has been one of my all-time favorite films since High School. While the details of the film are not 100% historically accurate, I was always impressed by the fact that Elizabeth Berridge, Simon Callow, and Nicholas Kepros each bear a striking resemblance to contemporary illustrations of Constanze Weber Mozart, Emmanuel Schickaneder, and Archbishop Collorado. As for Tom Hulce's irascible Mozart, the blue-eyed brat among Emperor Joseph II's court composers, I still have the oil pastel drawing I did of him in a scene from the movie hanging in my house. I've always felt that he was cheated out of the Oscar for Best Actor of 1984. It's as if the Academy felt it would be too scandalous to let an &quot;Animal House &quot; alumni have an Oscar. In truth, Hulce's Mozart seems to be a carry-over of his role in &quot;Animal House&quot; at times. But he was absolutely brilliant in the part. In the more serious scenes as Mozart's career problems mount, and he first encounters the Man in Black (who, in reality, was a man in gray), his face resembles that of Ryan O'Neal's &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, another 18th century character, and I wonder if Milos Forman hired him for that reason. Roy Dotrice was solemn and dignified as the father who is no longer able to keep his child prodigy son or his career on track. In Jeffery Jones' first scenes as the Emperor Joseph, he resembled a one-dimensional painting; There was nothing one-dimensional about his performance, in which he could be very indecisive about the technicalities about music, but very firm on the issues of appropriate pieces for theatre. Some years ago, a revamped version of Peter Shaffer's stage play of &quot;Amadeus&quot; made its debut in the town where I live, and the play was definitely Salieri's show. In this film, F. Murray Abraham's Salieri, who, in reality probably didn't have a thing to do with Mozart's death, is a somber, embittered character, who could have had an easier life if he had confronted Mozart head-on about his shortcomings instead of scheming to destroy him. Elizabeth Berridge's Constanze is strong and supportive as Mozart's wife. She could hold her own against her husbands' unsavory cohorts when she had to, proving that the women of that era weren't always as passive as they may have seemed, although she still seemed overwhelmed by her husband's excessive behavior. A contemporary magazine review of &quot;Amadeus&quot; complained that the other Court composers were too subservient, but apparently, this is a realistic portrayal of the 18th century Austrian Court, and what American audiences tend to overlook is that people close enough to world leaders understand how difficult their jobs can be, and aren't as likely to contradict an Emperor on comparatively minor issues such as the theatre. In a smaller, less complex country like 18th century Austria certain forms of censorship, such as those advocated by Joseph II, may have been necessary to keep order. A pre-&quot;Sex and the City&quot; era Cynthia Nixon is a wide-eyed and frightened servant named Lorl, who witnesses the decline of the Great Composer, and is paid for her services by Salieri. The decline of Mozart is depicted with all the modern sensationalism of the demise of any young celebrity. We watch as Mozart's supporters either die or slip away, and as his impracticality with money affects his lifestyle, health, and his closest relationships. One wishes that there had been more understanding of child prodigies back then, and of their need for some normalcy in their lives, even though Mozart himself may not have been saved even by that. Ultimately, we see his life as a glorious, musical romp through a Rococo-decorated kaleidescope with a world of palaces and opera houses, the spreading of his music's popularity among the commoners of the land, and finally spiraling downward to an early and tragic death, which was poignantly, but not accurately portrayed in the movie. The final scenes of the Mozarts together tug at the heartstrings as the dying composer reconciles with his wife, and the funeral scene is devastating. Amadeus...The name means beloved of God, and happily, the film bearing this name was the beloved of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>Don't skip this if you're not an opera buff, and don't know much about Mozart. I don't, and am not, and this film did a lot for me. It's the opera buffs and the Mozart experts who get annoyed by what they see as the liberties taken with the facts. Which is understandable, but didn't bother me at all. Nor did I worry about the various accents, which didn't seem to matter in the slightest. What this fascinating and extremely interesting movie vividly conveyed to me was something of the life of 18th century Vienna, as well as the beginnings of an understanding of the divinity in classical music. The sound was uplifting, in a way I never really experienced previously. The script was intelligent, the acting excellent. I thought Elizabeth Berridge was extremely endearing in her role as Mozart's wife, even though it may well not have matched the historical reality. It was obvious that many of the characters were, in a sense, caricatures: eg the Emperor, the Court musicians, even Mozart's father, and of course Tom Hulce himself. This really did not matter, either. Murray Abraham's face spoke volumes, and I thought his performance was superlative in the part, as written. One of the main themes of the story, and I thought it was very well explored and demonstrated, was the essential inequality of man: the simple fact is that all men are NOT created equal. This is a truth which Americans, especially and self-evidently, find difficult to accept. Another theme is the evil nature of bureaucracy, and the inevitably devious politics of the salaried employee. Stay in with the boss, and eliminate rivals --- that's the message. A third theme is man's longing for immortality. Why is it conferred on only a select few? It's also a partial truth that those whom the gods love die young.  This film is a mind-opener, whatever the musical perfectionists may say.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Milos Forman's Amadeus is a hugely entertaining adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play.  The movie is told in flashback style from the memory of Antonio Salieri.  Salieri was a successful and popular composer who was a rival of Mozart's.  History has speculated on the death of Mozart and some people are of the opinion that Salieri had a hand in his death (possibly even murdered him).  The film explores this angle of the legend.  Salieri is consumed by his jealousy and hatred of the infantile Mozart.  Mozart is a musical genius, but a wild spending and is always looking for the next good time.  His operas are utterly brilliant, but are unsuccessful.  He is in constant debt.  Salieri concocts a plan for Mozart to compose a requiem.  This work is actually planned as Mozart's own requiem.  Mozart is shown as slowly going mad and at the end of the film, Salieri helps him by writing the musical score down for a very weak Mozart.  The morning after Mozart and Salieri work together, Mozart is found dead and we are left speculating whether he died through natural causes or if Salieri did something to him.  F. Murray Abrham is absolutely amazing as Salieri.  He brings across the jealousy and hatred, but doesn't make Salieri a fiend.  He has major respect for Mozart's musical talents, but doesn't understand why God would give them to such an obvious heathen.  Tom Hulce is equally as good as Mozart.  He plays him with a reckless abandon and in an over the top fashion that is perfectly suited for the role.  The film took home the 1984 Best Picture Oscar, Mr. Forman won Best Director and Mr. Abrham beat out Mr. Hulce for Best Actor.  This was a case where a tie would have been more than appropriate.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>my roommate and i both enjoyed this film on the life of Wolfgang<br />Amadeus Mozart.it's basically told from the perspective of Antonio<br />Salieri(F.

While I perfer the latter for a number of reasons, the feeling and flow of the original theatrical version differs somewhat from the "Director's Cut".  The most important part are extended scenes that include Salieri agreeing to help Constanze if she has an affair with him. He ends up rejecting her when she shows that she so loves her husband that she would be willing to do so. A number of the opera scenes are extended as well with more business after the show between Mozart and his leading lady. There's also a longer sequence involving Salieri's visit to Mozart comissioning the "Requiem". Most of the material adds to the power of the film while a few sequences just give additional back story on various characters. The original theatrical version which won an 8 Oscars runs about 25 minutes shorter than the 3 hour "Director's Cut". Forman also provide a fascinating commentary track for the film along with writer Peter Shaffer ("Equus").<br /><br />The image quality for the "Director's Cut" is superior to the original theatrical version. The film was restored to its original luster for re-release resulting in much more natural flesh tones and a sharper visual image as well. The colors which play in important part in conveying the themes of each sequence are more robust and vivid. The theatrical version looks quite good although it was first issued on DVD as a "flipper" (meaning you had to flip it over) DVD after roughly two hours to watch the last third of the movie. The big advantage for the theatrical version is Neville Mariner's score on an isolated track.<br /><br />The second disc of the "Director's Cut" has one terrific extra, a brief talent list and the original theatrical trailer. The marvelous behind-the-scenes documentary covers the highlights and difficulties that Forman faced in translating Shaffer's stage play to the screen. At nearly 40 minutes it could have provided more background including outtakes, rehearsals and auditions but it's quite a few documentary as it is. There was plenty of room on the second disc to include Mariner's isolated score but the documentary is really all we get.<br /><br />As to which is better--it's a toss up. Both versions of the film work extremely well although I prefer the "Director's Cut" for the added footage, the sharper more robust image quality and the higher definintion anamorphic transfer. I do miss the isolated Marriner score of Mozart's music that appeared on the original disc in 5.1. Given the capacity of the second disc, it could easily have been transferred and would have added value to this special edition.<br /><br />A story of envy, lust and anger "Amadeus" focuses on the brief life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart (Oscar nominee Tom Hulce giving a terrific performance) was a child prodigy who composed his first piece at the age of 4 and produced a remarkably large body of work for such a brief life. His nemesis is court composer Antonio Salieri (Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham in a remarkable performance). This is really Salieri's story as his jealousy drives him to destroy Mozart. Salieri is so consumed with his jealousy, that while recognizing the beauty and originality of Mozart's music, he can't help but want to destroy its creator. Salieri's quaint compositions can't hold a candle to Mozart's complex, original and brilliant pieces.<br /><br />Featuring inspired supporting performances by Christine Ebersole, Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow ("Three Weddings and a Funeral"), the only performer that doesn't do anything for me is Elizabeth Berridge as Constanze. She replaced Meg Tilly just prior to shooting. The stunning production design, cinematography and sharp direction make "Amadeus: The Director's Cut" an experience worth savoring. This deluxe edition features a running commentary by director Milos Forman, writer Peter Shaffer ("Equus"), a great 30 minute documentary on the making of the movie and a terrific 5.1 Dolby Digital remastered soundtrack. Restored from the original film elements, the film hasn't looked this robust and colorful in quite some time. The digital anamorphic transfer looks marvelous and almost rich enough to eat. This version doesn't replace the original theatrical version but is more of an enhanced experience for those who loved the first film. Since this version runs roughly three hours, be prepared for a long evening.<br /><br />Highly recommended, this examination of the destructive power of jealousy still resonates with power, passion and wonderful music. If you're not an opera buff, I'd suggest skipping this for, while the film is powerful, part of the power comes from appreciating the music that Mozart wrote. We see a lot of excerpts from a variety of Mozart's operas throughout the movie. Whichever version of the movie you choose, you'll sure to be delighted. I'd give the "Director's Cut" a slight edge for better picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>I've purchased every disc release of this movie:  the expensive LaserDisc collector's set, the original DVD release and the subsquent Director's Cut, and this new Blu-Ray of the Director's Cut.  The Blu-Ray release stands head and shoulders above the rest for picture quality, color, and sound.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the original theatrical cut is not available on Blu-Ray as a separate item or as an alternative viewing option on the Director's Cut.  The theatrical cut is the one that most of us saw first and saw over and over again over the course of some 20 years before the Director's Cut was released on DVD.<br /><br />The additional footage in the Director's Cut is interesting but, to me at least, seems intrusive.  It interrupts the flow and tempo I am used to.  There is also a brief scene of female nudity that seems a bit gratuitous.  The scene does, though,  lend some weight to a scene later in the film where you see Constanze's open hostility toward Salieri.  Normally I'm not one to complain about a little female flesh being exposed, but I think the film works well enough without it.<br /><br />Other "new" scenes follow pretty much the same description:  they are interesting but their necessity is debatable.<br /><br />There is one small addition that I did enjoy, though.  Early in the film, during one of the scenes where the elderly Salieri is confessing (?) to the young priest, Salieri is recounting the episode when he first met the young composer Mozart he'd heard about for so many years.  He was blown away by his talent but outraged and offended by his peurile behavior.  He insisted to the priest that such talent (evident in one composition in particular) could not and should not exist in such a vile and vulgar child.  That brilliant composition simply HAD to be an accident!  Salieri's lines are briefly extended in that moment, and it adds a wonderful touch of menace.  I can't understand why it was cut from the original release.<br /><br />The LaserDisc release included a wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary called "The Last Laugh".  So far I haven't seen it included in any DVD or Blu-Ray release.  I'm holding on to my LaserDisc player for precisely that reason.  Add that documentary to this Blu-Ray release and you have a slam-dunk 5-star product.<br /><br />Depending on the release version, this Blu-Ray movie may come in book form and include a short bonus CD of some music from the film and a picture booklet.  If you bought/buy the version that comes with the bonus Digital Copy of the film (available at some retailers but harder to find online), bear in mind that the Digital Copy is NOT compatible with iTunes and cannot be loaded to your iPod.  There is no wording on the package to indicate this.  One has to open the Digital Copy booklet to find that out.  The Digital Copy booklet looks the same on the outside as the booklet for the Digital Copies of other movies that ARE compatible with iTunes, so a consumer who has purchased iTunes-compatible Digital Copy-included DVDs before could reasonably assume this one would be compatible also.  That consumer would be wrong. Nice bait-and-switch, don't you think?<br /><br />If you got the non-book version of the Blu-Ray, it probably didn't come with the bonus CD, booklet, or Digital Copy.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This review refers to the shorter 153 minute version of the film, although I have also seen quite a few of the extras on the two disc special edition as well.<br /><br />This is a truly epic film based on Peter Shaeffers's play, which tells the story of Mozart from the point of view of the aged Court Composer Salieri, looking back. Salieri is played by F Murray Abraham, who undoubtably steals the acting honours, if only because his performance is always entirely believeable, if not neccessarily any more factual. Tom Hulse gives a fine performance as Mozart, but I always felt that there was more artistic licence in his performance than in Abrahams.<br /><br />The music is superbly performed and the operatic settings deserve special mention. Certainly this film gives you every opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary talent that Mozart was blessed with. Whether the play the film is based on is in any way factual is unknown to me but this is an irrelevance. The music and performances are fact and that is enough for me.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Amadeus' was one of the most refreshing spectacles I have had the pleasure of witnessing in quite some time.  I was personally blown away with what I was presented with and have thus concluded `Amadeus' to be one of the best motion pictures in the history of motion pictures.  If you have not had the privilege of witnessing this powerful film then please, stop everything you are doing and track this movie down, order it straight from this webpage if you need to, but please watch this movie immediately.  I don't think I've been this passionate about a single film since I saw `The Godfather' for the first time.  Truly all the praise and admiration that has been associated with this masterclass of a film is well warranted.  `Amadeus' is astounding from start to finish, a truly mesmerizing and utterly flawless production.  Milos Forman is God; seriously.<br /><br />As the film opens we meet Antonio Salieri, a man gone crazy.  He is living in an asylum and claims to have murdered Mozart.  In the opening scenes of the film Salieri is met by a priest who wants to hear his story and so Salieri proceeds to tell him how it was that he came to meet, grow to despise and eventually kill Mozart.<br /><br />Antonio Salieri was an aspiring composer who has reached a certain level of fame as court composer to Emperor Joseph II but he has achieved nothing in comparison to the fame and recognition as the esteemed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Salieri himself feels that Mozart's music is divine, something sent from God above (kind of the way I feel about this movie) but when he has the chance to finally meet this messenger of God he is let down.  Mozart is not the noble gentlemen he had expected but instead is a pompous arrogant vile thing that sends shivers down Salieri's spine.<br /><br />How could God use this disgusting man in such a beautiful and miraculous way?<br /><br />It becomes apparent that the Emperor is smitten with Mozart's talent though and this bothers Salieri, not to mention others close to the Emperor.  Salieri then decides that he is to make it his life goal to destroy Mozart, to strip him of his power and social standing and ruin him, yes, kill him.  He concocts a plan all his own to accomplish this and sets it all in motion, waiting for the time to be right to strike and make his dreams come true.<br /><br />`Amadeus', as I mentioned earlier, is perfect.  I seriously cannot find a single flaw.  The script is deliciously absorbing and never loses the interest of its audience.  The direction is nothing short of phenomenal and the acting across the board is superb.  The two leads are brilliant.  F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar for his performance, captures the very dire frustration and conflicting emotions that drives Salieri to madness and Tom Hulce (who should have won the Oscar in my humble opinion) dominates as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, completely fleshing out his talent as well as the demons that choked out the flame that was his life.  Elizabeth Berridge was sorely robbed of an Oscar nomination.  Her portrayal of Mozart's doting wife Constanze is brilliantly crafted and expertly executed.<br /><br />The only word I can use to describe this film is ecstasy; pure, unbridled ecstasy.  Since seeing this film I've thought of nothing else and have a feeling that I will think of nothing else for quite a while still to come.  Please, I beg of you, experience this film for yourself.  You will not regret it.<br /><br />Consider me entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>Movie making at its best.

Whether or not you've seen this production, further babble from this reviewer can do nothing to heighten viewer interest. Let the show begin!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>'Amadeus' is an all-around well-crafted masterpiece.  It is one of those rare movies that is both frolicking fun and an epic classic.  How much of the movie is true or revisionism doesn't matter as much as how they use true elements to frame the enigma of Mozart's persona and genius.<br /><br />There are two stories really:  The main story is about Mozart (Tom Hulce), but it is told by an aged Solieri (F. Murray Abraham), Mozart's envious nemesis, at an asylum where a priest comes to hear his confession.  Bitter about life, Solieri rails against God Himself for feeling scorned by the eclipse of Mozart's talent.  Every time we leave the narrative into the flashbacks of Solieri's telling recount, we often are shattered as we come back to the cell with the sympathetic but perturbed priest--so absorbing is the story.  Amadeus is reckless and playful.  Having a wealthy father who scorns his son's frivolousness, Amadeus evaporates his monetary resources through wine, women, and song.  For the latter he only squanders through his venue.  For if he weren't such a serious composer and gave lessons, he wouldn't be in such a financial bind.  Considered an eccentric, he is, nevertheless, hired by the Emperor of Austria, to be a court composer in Vienna.  Solieri, an admirer of Mozart, has a big hand to play, for he is in charge of all the court music.  In the company of two other Italian composers, Solieri outnumbers and outpowers Amadeus in many ways.  Solieri has a plot by which he thinks by vanquishing Mozart, he will perversely reek revenge on God.<br /><br />'Amadeus' encompasses the genius of its subject matter.  With eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Abraham, it is one of the greatest films assembled.  The craftsmanship is marvelous.  Neville Mariner's score makes the whole experience worthwhile by itself.  Elizabeth Berridge's portrayal as Mozart's wife yields are sympathy, and Tom Hulce makes the whole affair an entertaining romp.  Even the priest frames our interest with his facial expressions, accentuating the audiences' horror and fascination.  Not to mention the scenery and costumes that have a splendour of their own.  After almost twenty-five years, 'Amadeus' is an untarnished jewel for the eyes, ears, and heart.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>The basic plot revolving around Salieri's jealousy is overdone if not fictitious, but just to enter into Mozart's music and to imagine what it must have been like to know him in his own day and time is fascinating.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I picked up a copy of "Amadeus" a few months ago because I had never seen it before and I thought it would be worth a look.  I admit that I postponed watching it because it runs practically 3 hours and I never seemed to have that much spare time.  When my daughter's friend looked over my video collection, focussed immediately on "Amadeus" to the near exclusion of everything else, and called it his favorite movie of all time, I figured that maybe it's time to take a look.  I'm certainly glad I did.  This is an outstanding movie that should please the history buffs, the costume drama buffs, and, especially, the music buffs.  The story of Mozart is compelling enough but the writer and director found an angle to view his life that reaches a level of excellence rarely seen in movie biographies.  The little-known composer; Salieri, is the protagonist and is played with excellence by F. Murray Abraham.  Frankly, I knew so little about the movie that I always thought the little-known Abraham got his Best Acting Oscar for portraying Mozart.<br /><br />This angle of viewing Mozart through the eyes of a jealous composer humanizes Mozart so well that a person can't help but be touched even more so by his life.  In the end, we bemoan the loss of both men's lives in the waste of a one-sided competition.  In the midst of this brilliant script is a bountiful gift of Mozart's music and it is delivered in just the right dose and just the right visual accompaniment.  Even if Mozart isn't your cup of tea, I doubt that you'll fail to be moved by his movements.  Well, I could go on and on but the point is, I am glad that I finally sat down to watch "Amadeus".  It is a reminder that artistry well-focussed has an appeal all its' own.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>This brilliant film written by Peter Shaffer and directed by Milos Forman brings out the genius of W.A. Mozart: one of the most recognized classical composers. The film shines in all areas: cinematography, direction, acting, and costumes.<br /><br />  The film is based on the rumors that the court's royal composer, Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), brought Mozart (Tom Hulce)to an untimely death out of jealousy and spite. Although the rumors have little weight in history, they form a great foundation for a drama such as this film. Tom Hulce plays the childish Mozart to perfection with his spurts of laughter and giggles. Abraham received an Oscar for his role as the brooding Salieri. Supporting this great film is the beautiful music of Mozart performed by The Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-fields: Sir Neville Marinner conducting: one of the finest symphonic groups for Mozart's music.<br /><br />  Don't miss this breathtaking film. The drama and humor in the film are, like the music, suited for all ages. A great film for the entire family.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>I loved &quot;Amadeus&quot; the first time I saw it and every time thereafter, on tape, DVD and now in this DVD package. It is a very great film, exceptionally worthy of its Oscars, and the role of a lifetime for Tom Hulse. The operatic and musical scenes in this film succeed on a scale never seen before. The finale of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; is better in this movie than in the two live performances I've seen and the performance Herbert von Karajan led that was shown on PBS in 1990. The direction, acting, script and locations are all sumptuous. It apparently does not follow the play on which it is based, but artistic difference is the basis of enjoyment. Having said all this, I would caution viewers not to judge the real-life Mozart by the portrayal of Hulse in this film. The real Mozart, I have read, was a prudish workaholic that would never go out drinking with his buddies. He also played by the rules of the day and adored Salieri, respecting his role as the musical director in Vienna. Still, it's fair to set history aside in a work of art this fine. Anyone that likes great music or great movies will enjoy this.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>So what can really be said about a film in a review that arrives 24 years after the film's first release?<br /><br />First, I cannot believe that it's already been that long. I saw this film in a theatre in England as a boy and it was one of the highlights of my movie going youth. And yes, I'm that old ... or young. Take your pick, dear reader.<br /><br />So, what did become of Tom Hulce? He was absolutely shocking in this movie as a portrayal of one of the greatest composers / humans ever to live. Well, for the record Tom Hulce, kind of decided that it must be cool to put on some weight, because that's exactly what he went and did. He also became a producer doing projects of his own liking. He was also recently in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LXH0AE">Stranger Than Fiction</a>, but if you don't look fast you just might miss him.<br /><br />Regarding the film ... a lot of viewers often come away with the belief that this is an intensely accurate story about the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, which in fact it is a story about Mozart, but it is not all that accurate. This is a movie that was based upon a stage play called "Mozart and Salieri". What it does capture though, is period set design, wardrobe and atmosphere and it does it so well that any story told within this shell could be utterly believable and engrossing.<br /><br />However, all these things aside, this is an incredibly strong film to say the least and one of my all time favourites. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000XBT">The music</a> is beautifully woven throughout this to carry you back to the life of a would-be madman and reckless drunkard. It's a blessing that he did not wallow in obscurity and is still esteemed as highly as he is today, for WAM, so deserves it.<br /><br />If you are the type of person that prefers accurate portrayals in their bio-pic features, then you should probably see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TN">Immortal Beloved</a>, as it is about as true of an account of that Composers life as you're going to see and is wonderfully captured by Gary Oldman.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>Certainly a fantasia on the life of one of the world's greatest composers, &quot;Amadeus&quot; is more much more than merely dreamed biography. It soars above the retelling of a wonderous life, presenting to us a mosiac of deep meaning, wonderful performances, sensational music, and one of the best movies ever made.<p>Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abrams take control of this movie the first time they appear in it, and refuse to let it go. Whereas the power in their lives rests in the monarchy, they are the true power of this film as they dance and weave around each other. Salieri, a now forgotten composer, apparently once revered in his time, secretly adores and publicly abhors Mozart, gifted prodigy.  By giving us some creative if not accurate context for Mozart's music, we see the true brilliance of his greatness, by comparing and listening to his music through Salieri's simple ears.  The finest moment of the film perhaps comes at the ending, with Salieri, an old and feeble man, realizing that his life has added up to nothing but mediocrity and meagerness. As he's wheeled through the halls of the sanitorium, he blesses the crazy and insane, reveling in the pain of the irony his life has become. Incredible.<p>As mentioned, Hulce and Abrams both soar in their roles; each embody the true spirits of their characters, there is not a moment's doubt or hesitation in their performances.  Their acting is so perfect, so refined, it is not acting, it is being. On the screen, the real Salieri and Mozart are before you. No finer gift can an actor give to his craft.<p>And no finer film can a group of professionals give the world. Amadeus is all about brilliance at the same time being all about mediocrity. This duality drives the tension and the drama, making the film so wonderfully complex and deep. I never tire of watching this, each time finding a new glimmer previously not realized. <p>It is well worth your time, if you have not yet done it, to settle down and allow &quot;Amadeus&quot; to soak over you, and prepare to marvel.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>How did Mozart die?  Was he murdered?  Was Antonio Salieri responsible?  These questions will never be answered.  The great film, Amadeus, does not even try.  It presents Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) as a punk kid, with pink wigs and an annoying high pitch laugh, who comes to Vienna searching for work in music.<p>It's obvious immediately to Salieri (F. Murray Abraham)that Mozart is a prodigy.  However, he is appalled to see what a brat he appears to be.  Consequently, he swears to bring Mozart to ruin.  <p>It's a fact that Salieri, later in life in an insane asylum, claimed to have murdered Mozart.  Historians are split on whether this claim has any merit.  The film, as I stated, does not take a side either way.  <p>The movie is great because the characters are so fresh and fun.  Mozart is a real hoot with his laugh and Salieri's intense hatred of him is obvious.  I also love Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor (remember his failed attempts to run down Ferris Bueller).<p>No one will ever know what happened to Mozart.  This film shows us a reasonable guess at what his last 10 years were probably like.  The music is great, the acting superb, and the film was definitely deserving of its Best Film award.  I find it interesting that Abraham and Hulce, after such a great performance in such a highly publicized movie, really have slipped into oblivion.  In this film, however, they were golden.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>A marvelously acted, flawlessly directed story about jealousy, obsession, and perfectionism, Forman's stunning "Amadeus" mixes suspenseful drama with historical fact to create a winning fictional biography.

Winning Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (Abraham), "Amadeus" is a triumph that will delight anyone with a soft spot for cracked genius.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Amadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)~ F.

It also adds valuable scenes for instance when Constanza Mozart is turned down by Salieri. For my part they could have added even more since I absloutely love this movie and I think they could have fleshed out some scenes even more (like another 30 minutes or so). F.

Murray Abraham) relates to a disbelieving priest the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical genius and how it led to jealousy, betrayal, and possibly even murder...<br /><br />Sumptuous evocation of a time and place, using Mozart's glorious music both to propel the story and underline the emotional dynamics of Peter Shaffer's extraordinary script. Based on his well-received stage play, and completely reworked for the screen, AMADEUS (1984) - and its updated version, reviewed here as AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT, released in 2001 - portrays Mozart's world as a romantic marriage of Royal palaces and candle-lit garrets, populated by eccentric emperors and their devious, toadying lackeys.<br /><br />The composer himself is played by Hulce as a spoiled, egotistical brat who indulges his passion for earthly pleasures with all the enthusiasm he brings to his musical compositions. But the film is anchored by Abraham in an Oscar-winning turn as Mozart's nemesis Salieri, consumed by envy and hatred whilst simultaneously awed by his rival's genius, the genius which Salieri had wished for himself, only to be denied by a mischievous God. The scenes in his asylum cell - where the elder Salieri confesses his 'crime' to a naive priest (Richard Frank) - are a tour de force, played with an intensity that simply burns up the screen.<br /><br />Beautifully designed and photographed, and bolstered by a magnificent supporting cast (including Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow and Kenneth McMillan in a role completely excised from the original theatrical print), the movie unfolds like an operatic melodrama which builds to a shattering climax, as the two central characters reach an understanding (of sorts) during the writing of Mozart's 'Requiem', only to be divided forever by an unexpected tragedy. A masterpiece.<br /><br />NB. Incredibly, the MPAA has given the film an R rating for a brief sequence in which a female character bares her breasts to the camera. Surely this kind of sexual squeamishness belongs to the Dark Ages, not the 21st century?! There's nothing here which warrants anything more than a PG-13.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>Sometimes hilarious, sometimes somber and always tragic, this is the highly entertaining dramatized story of Mozart.

As composers of note, they definitely were aware of each other's  existence at the time, but the fictionalized tale here should not be  watched as though it is historical fact.<p>The wardrobes, backdrops and  everything you see in this film are breathtakingly accurate and believable.  The acting is flawless by every single person you see on screen, whether  it's the un-credited extra in the background or the main characters  themselves.<p>The music is incredible and you'll never hear these pieces  the same after you see them being performed on screen.<p>I wish the DVD had  included more extras, perhaps some clips of the Oscars when Abraham won for  best actor and interviews with the cast and crew.

Murray Abraham) and felt towards Mozart practically the same as Salieri did. 15 years later I watched the movie again. As I allowed myself to perceive it more in the position of Mozart, I couldn't help swinging my vote to Mozart this time. The more so as the movie depicted how Mozart, deprived of wealth and success, was initially reluctant to take a mystery man's proposal - to work on Requiem. He simply could not face his own demons and revisit his guilt towards his father, plus he lacked the energy to finish such a grand project. But for that promised pay, he took Saleri's bait, forced himself to meet the impossible deadline and work until his last breath. The final hours of Mozart was brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hulce. The last scene where Mozart was thrown into an unmarked mass grave was devastating.<br /><br />The script was ingeniously written and tightly knit. The music score powerful and touching. The movie presented sympathetic and unbiased views of Salieri and Mozart at the same time. Coupled with fine performances of the two actors, the movie allowed the audience to see and judge for themselves. Abraham's brilliant portrayal of Salieri won him the Oscar - Salieri could not accept how Mozart, in a life style so different from his, could write such magnificent pieces.  Consumed with envy, he set out to block Mozart from any recognition of his talent. Even to this extreme, he was Mozart's admirer as much as Mozart's enemy till the end, secretly watching Mozart's play, the Magic Flute, and eagerly helping Mozart record his last notes for the Requiem.<br /><br />The movie inspires. One Chinese proverb about two competing talents with only one as the ultimate winner can be adapted to the movie: "If Salieri is already born to this world, why bring Mozart also?" - a remark made by the loser as to his misfortune to be a contemplary of the winner and thus the loser failed to make his own mark in history. It also supports the idea "Who knows oneself better than one's deadliest enemy?" The movie also reminds me of the biblical parable of Lazarus and the wealthy man. While Lazarus, unlike his wealthy neighbour, was poor and constantly starving in his few days on the earth, it was Lazarus who was in Abraham's bosom to enjoy a happy after life while his neigbour suffered down below. Thus set eyes not just on the present but on the eternal. So went Mozart and Salieri according to the fiction and the movie.<br /><br />A great movie! Incidentally, 27th January, 2006 marked the 250th Anniversary of Mozart's birth.</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>How long does the impact of brilliance last?

Amadeus tells us the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart from the perspective of contemporary Salieri, and the device makes for a richer viewing experience because the Mozart depicted in the movie is a divine musical genius, but an immature, prideful man-child in his life.  The film makes the point that he died in poverty, unthinkable today for an artist of his stature.<br /><br />Tom Hulce was nominated for Best Actor as Mozart, not only a musical genius but taking a joyful pride in his music.  This Mozart is presented as an 18th century rock-star, chasing skirts and drinking wine the moment the music stops, in addition to having a certain disrespect for all who are musically beneath him - in other words, pretty much everyone.<br /><br />F. Murray Abraham won the Academy Award as Salieri, who is vastly less talented, but at least understands and appreciates Mozart's music.  Salieri's music is a calling, and we're shown early in the film that Salieri has become a kind of musical priest - asking God for enough ability to rise out of his working class background to be able to hobknob with royalty.  He lives an otherwise monk-like life, and when he sees the irreverent Mozart showing scarcely a care for anything, yet apparently touched with an ability that could only come from Heaven, something in Salieri snaps - he vows to crush God's favored musical son. (The film is based on the 1979 play by Peter Shaffer.  The thought to depict the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri is based on one of Mozart's letters in which he wrote that he thought Salieri was so jealous he might poison him, but there appears to be no evidence that Salieri was involved in any way with the early demise of Mozart.)<br /><br />Prodigiously prolific, Mozart composed 41 symphonies (to 9 by Beethoven) and 23 Operas (to 1 by Beethoven), along with a horde of genius concertos, chamber pieces, piano works and sacred music.  Genius musicians cannot comprehend the creative gift that would allow Mozart to do all this before dying at age thirty-five.<br /><br />There are a few framing devices in the film - we first see an elderly Salieri many years after Mozart's death, consumed with guilt that he killed Mozart.  Most of the story is told in flashbacks with old Salieri confessing to a Priest.<br /><br />We see the boy genius Mozart, playing piano and violin for royalty as a toddler.  We see the first meeting between Mozart and Salieri - Mozart has been invited to Vienna to perform for the Austrian Emperor Joseph.  Mozart works for his patron, the Bishop of Salzberg, but Mozart is irreverent and disrespectful.  Emperor Joseph (played in a comic turn by Jeffrey Jones) sees an opportunity to woo the promising Mozart to stay in Vienna and commissions an opera - The Marriage of Figaro.  This causes some consternation among the royal house since the opera is based on a play that has been banned in Vienna (due to its satirical view of aristocracy just prior to the French Revolution). Many of Mozart's other unconventional methods are scrutinized and criticized.  After the eventual premiere of Figaro the Emperor comes back stage with his entourage and offers lukewarm encouragement.  When the Emperor can't think of a musical term to characterize his lack of enthusiasm he turns to his Kapelmeister who admonishes Mozart that there are "too many notes".  Mozart asks "which would you like me to remove?"<br /><br />Milos Forman won the Oscar for direction, one of eight academy awards for the film.  I saw attempts to recapture the epic proportions of Amadeus later in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008RV1S">The Red Violin</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TN">Immortal Beloved</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MV8AE0">Copying Beethoven</a>, but Amadeus still stands atop the heap of artistic film interpretations of musical greatness.  Amadeus is immense in scale and ambition, but also intimate in moments, serious and light.  Forman's balancing act may take historical licenses, but it engages our attention, our sympathy, and our enthusiasm.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>This is not the Director's Cut version and hence clocks in at "only" 160 minutes but I found myself enjoying the film so much that I didn't really feel the time.  I'm a big fan of all kinds of music and Classical music is among my favourite genres and although Handel, Bach, Vivaldi and Beethoven hold greater esteem for me than does Mozart, I'm still able to appreciate his genius and so a film like this is a real treat.  Irrespective of whether or not Salieri really was behind Mozart's death in real life as it is depicted here in reel life you have to admit that this is a very good film that shows how much hypocrisy and envy can conspire to destroy the truly beautiful in life.<br /><br />The problem with this one-disc dvd version though is the picture quality which hasn't been restored and so you get imperfections such as black and white spots on many frames and the resolution isn't as sharp as I would like it to be.  The sound quality, however, is very good having been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and is the aspect of this dvd that I enjoyed the most.  There are no Special Features here worth mentioning such as interviews with cast and crew or making-of documentaries either.<br /><br />If you are not too fussed about picture quality and/or special features though, this one-disc dvd version is a bare bones non-Director's version of a very good film for classical music lovers.  Believe me when it comes to this genre, very few performers can top Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields and you get them here on Dolby Digital Surround sound too!<br /><br />As for me, I'll "upgrade" to the Blu-ray version of this film as soon as I come around to getting a Blu-ray player.  Hopefully, the picture quality has been restored well in that version.<br /><br />Updated 17 July 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to do this here: the digibook director's cut blu-ray of this film is now the definitely version.  This together with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001992NW4">The Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] are now the best blu-ray releases that I've seen and I wish all blu-ray re-releases are made this way.  Firstly, most of us already have vhs or dvd versions of our favourite films and so what should the studios do the entice us to double-dip?  Putting the film on blu-ray and in a digibook format certainly helps and here we also get not only the best version of the film on one disc plus improved special features but also a very nice cd of a selection of Mozart's best works as well.  Both the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved over the standard dvd version that I reviewed above as well.  Although a digital copy is included I have no views on that as I don't have any use for a digital copy really.<br /><br />This is a very fine blu-ray release and is among the best that I've seen so far.  Great content, great picture and sound quality and improved special features makes this an easy review:  Very highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>This thoroughly enjoyable, pneumatic movie tells the story of Mozart's rise-and-fall on the music scene in 18th-century Austria. Told in flashback form from the point of view of musical rival Antonio Salieri, it covers with a broad hand the more salient points of Mozart's life, and dispenses with historical accuracy for a more expressive and emotionally communicative feel.<br /><br />The acting's of a very high standard, with F. Murray Abraham giving a committed, layered and impressive performance as the jealous Salieri - not overshadowed by Tom Hulce's flashy, deceptively superficial turn as Mozart - which is a big deal, considering Hulce's performance is one of those show-stopping, scene-stealing turns that you don't really see anymore. If Abraham won the Oscar for this, then Hulce, for his part, is fantastic at portraying the decadence and the fevered genius behind the screenplay's reading of Mozart's character, but also gives the man impressive depth and pathos, when necessary. These two principal actors are more than amply supported by the excellent Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's plagued wife Constanze, Jeffrey Jones as Emperor Joseph II and a very young Simon Callow as Mozart's friend-and-colleague Emanuel Schikaneder. Also, a pre-pre-pre "Sex and the City" Cynthia Nixon does an excellent job in her tiny role as the Mozart family maid.<br /><br />The behind-the-camera talents of director Milos Forman, art director Karel Cerny and cinematographer Miroslav Ondricek are the real stars of "Amadeus", though - the film's style is as operatic and fantastical as its treatment of Mozart's biography, and the tone and pacing of the sumptuous visuals lend a very palpable sense of doomed-genius-reaching-critical-mass to the film. There are no slow points, nothing is visually flat, and every detail and flourish imaginable has been crammed in - like the painted fantasies of Mozart's opera sets, "Amadeus", works beautifully as a baroque spectacle, and, 24 years after its original release, remains a testament to the creative genius of its crew. Mozart's operas are staged with a wisely underplayed sense of drama, furthering the viewer's connection with the more important driving forces behind their creation - the lives of those involved - and the visual feel of the movie is that of floating haphazardly through a chaotic swirl of decadence, art and high-octane drama.<br /><br />I'm no big fan of classical music, and remain unconverted - but as an exercise in storytelling, "Amadeus" is a treat for any and all fans of solid, gripping films. It hits home runs on all the fronts it chooses to show you, and, while not an exhaustive or particularly accurate account, is a deeply engaging and thoroughly enjoyable piece of cinema. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>I recently watched AMADEUS for the second time and was amazed by what a perfect film it is.  Totally historically accurate to the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart?  No, but the script faithfully follows the basic facts of his life and death with a heavy dose of speculation.  Tom Hulce is simply wonderful as Mozart and he believably creates a vulgar, annoying (who can forget that awful laugh?)often socially clueless little man who still fulfills the meaning of his second name "Amadeus" in being beloved by God at least in terms of musical talent.  F. Murray Abraham is perfect as Austrian Emperor Joseph's, court composer, Salieri.  Salieri possessed social skills, musical talent and training, burning ambition and at least in the beginning piousness.  It seems plausible that Salieri's realization of himself as a mediocre composer compared to the musically great though often bizarre Mozart could have driven him to obsession and madness.  The costumes and interior furnishings in the film are beautiful and the Prague filming location which stands in for Vienna fully creates the atmosphere of an 18th century European city.  Though Hulce and Abraham are the obvious acting standouts the rest of the film is very well cast.  I'm no music scholar but Mozart's music which comprises the score seems to be perfectly presented.  And the scenes from his operas are so well recreated in the original 18th century manner that they alone are reason enough to watch the film.  Yet the rich universal themes are the biggest strengths of AMADEUS.  It is a movie that can be enjoyed by those who think they hate classical music or films with historical settings.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IE0P2JMWW0H7.html">A3IE0P2JMWW0H7</a><br/><p>Life and music of of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

I've read many books about him; I try not to miss any concert where his music is performed. I know that "Amadeus" the movie is not exactly his biography, and his relationship with Antonio Salieri, with his father Leopold, with his wife Constanze Weber, with the Emperor Joseph II and with the court musicians in Vienna of 18th century, might not have been exactly like it was shown in the movie, and Mozart himself might not have laughed as Hulce did but I LOVE the movie. I've seen it many times and I still love it. It is about a conflict between a genius for whom to create was as easy as to breath, and a talent that realized that no matter how he tried, he can not be a genius. It is very easy to admire a genius from the distance; it is unbearable to be next to him and to realize that you never will reach the same heights. Admiration, contempt, hatred, denial, self-hatred and above all of these "monsters with green eyes" -divine music that will live forever, music oblivious to the dark passions, music that makes us feel the presence of perfection and harmony...<br /><br />Once again, "Amadeus" is not a biography, at least I don't see it as such. It is a work of fiction and a wonderful film that did not make me see a real Salieri as a villain. Having read many materials about Mozart and his time, and having listened to the music from his epoch, I have a respect for Salieri and his music which is quite charming.<br /><br />Amadeus - beloved of Gods and taken by them too early because those whom they love die young</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>This Academy-Award winning film based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), my favorite composer of all time, is very well done, in terms of costume and set design (as well as the make-up job on F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar Best Actor, beating out his fellow actor Tom Hulce, who portrayed the man who was "Beloved Of God.") The brief bits of opera which were shown were staged very well by the legendary Twyla Tharp (especially "Don Giovanni"). For that and the utter beauty and timelessness music of the Master itself, I give it three stars. I withold the fourth and fifth stars because of some HUGE historical inaccuracies AND the unneccessary nude scene (inserted for the Director's Cut). I shall begin.<br /><br />I. I have read several biographies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, including one by Victor Seroff, and NEVER did I read of Mozart cheating on Constanze (as is implied in the film) or vice versa. If Mozart had done such a thing, his wife would have left him and, as far as I know, she did not desert him for another man (she married again after his death after waiting the decent interval).<br /><br />II. Constanze and Mozart had six children, of which only two survived to adulthood (but they never produced children of their own). In the film, only one child is depicted (I'm not sure which, as he is never named in the damn picture). Serious blunder.<br /><br />III. Constanze NEVER destroyed any of Mozart's work; in fact, she published them herself, recognizing her husband's God-given gift to write sublime music.<br /><br />IV. Mozart was a vulgar man, as shown, but he "Spoke a crude or coarse word" to Constanze, as the movie clearly shows.<br /><br />V. The scene where Constanze undresses in front of Salieri was unneccessary and NOT TRUE. Constanze loved Mozart with all her heart and would NEVER have done such an atrocious thing.<br /><br />VI. Mozasrt DID NOT die in the morning. He died on the night of December 4, 1791. That morning, he gave his pupil (somehow, the movie skipped the fact that he HAD pupils) Franz Sussmayr instructions for the completion of the "Requiem Mass" and that night, the great Mozart died. According to a photograph I saw (and the biography I mentioned earlier in my first point), he died surrounded by his family. He was given a pauper's funeral because HIS FAMILY WAS POOR, NOT because a noble (Baron Von Sweiten, in the play and movie; they omitted his line for the funeral from the script for the movie) sugessted that it was "Vain Show."<br /><br />VII. Why the devil would Salieri want to help Mozart, if his ultimate aim was to destroy him "By any means neccessary"? THERE IS NO PROOF OF THAT!! Please see my previous point for more information on this.<br /><br />VIII. Mozart briefly taught the young Ludwig Von Beethoven (1770-1827) and immediately recognized his genius. Another HUGE error in not depicting this fact.<br /><br />Excellent period piece, but I DO NOT recommend it as a history lesson. The nude scene, as I stated earlier, was unneccessary and has no basis in actual fact. Rated PG-13 for brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>This is just one great movie. It'll make you laugh with it's querky sense of humor, and will awe you with it's wonderful story. A note-perfect cinematic event whose immortality was assured from its opening night, Amadeus is an unlikely candidate for the director's-cut treatment. The last thing you would expect a high school junior to go ga-ga over is a movie about long-dead classical composers. Screenwriter Peter Shaffer adapted the work from his own play, a fictional history meditating on the lives of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and musical rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). All is told in flashback through the eyes of Salieri, who sees Mozart as a vulgar creature with divine gifts. Eventually, Salieri views Mozart's music as an insult from God, and he tries to undermine the young composer at every opportunity. During this time you just can't help but laugh, because everytime he thinks he's got something Mozart shows him up. It's a great film, and must be seen by everyone. It's to good to be kept to one's self.</p></br><a href="../users/AWEOR1WZSMBEZ.html">AWEOR1WZSMBEZ</a><br/><p>Albeit fictional, this film has raised my curiosity tremendously about Mozart's life.

It is one of the most brilliant and breathtaking, if not one of most abstruse, films I ever seen. Amadeus is much more a complex film than it seems. The performances of Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham are engrossing. Oh the story...it's so fascinating and different. Imagine a different kind of a murder without actually committing it directly or indirectly. Call it a genius. Another kind of genius is shown in Wolfgang Mozart Amadeus, played royally by Tom Hulce, who sadly never came to rise out of this role in successive roles. Some might say Amadeus is boring. Some might say Amadeus is pointless. Some might say Amadeus was overlong. Some might say Amadeus was nothing much more than the music. To all those who said them, they missed out a masterpiece. Who was responsible for it? Saul Zaentz along with Milos Forman. I had never seen a story so brilliantly based on true accounts and written down like Amadeus. I found Amadeus an extraordinarily difficult film to ponder because in one way sensible, and in another way, no. A fascination and deep adoration by Antonio Salieri, played...how can I say...breathtakingly by F. Murray Abraham, yet he remains madly envious of something beyond him that was transposed into the wrong type of a person. Amadeus is a film that is beyond itself. I regard Amadeus a film of the decade.<br /><br />9/10: I am going to drop the rating of Amadeus from `10' to `9'. Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent movie. But it gets boring at times, especially in the final thirty minutes. Perhaps Amadeus is a bit too long? The acting is great, especially by Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham, and Jeffrey Jones. They all are scene stealers when they can. I just wished the movie was a bit more interesting to watch and enough for me to open my eyes wider. All in all, Amadeus is a marvelous picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Looks like I should have waited since now this Blu-ray edition of this Oscar winner is now $14.99 instead of $26.99 which I paid about a week and half ago!!

A plus definitely is the CD of Mozart selections by Neville Mariner.  As for Digital Copy, I didn't find the image on computer to be much worse than it would be on Standard Def.

The movie is told in flashback style from the memory of Antonio Salieri. Salieri was a successful and popular composer who was a rival of Mozart's. History has speculated on the death of Mozart and some people are of the opinion that Salieri had a hand in his death (possibly even murdered him). The film explores this angle of the legend. Salieri is consumed by his jealousy and hatred of the infantile Mozart. Mozart is a musical genius, but a wild spending and is always looking for the next good time. His operas are utterly brilliant, but are unsuccessful. He is in constant debt. Salieri concocts a plan for Mozart to compose a requiem. This work is actually planned as Mozart's own requiem. Mozart is shown as slowly going mad and at the end of the film, Salieri helps him by writing the musical score down for a very weak Mozart. The morning after Mozart and Salieri work together, Mozart is found dead and we are left speculating whether he died through natural causes or if Salieri did something to him. F. Murray Abrham is absolutely amazing as Salieri. He brings across the jealousy and hatred, but doesn't make Salieri a fiend. He has major respect for Mozart's musical talents, but doesn't understand why God would give them to such an obvious heathen. Tom Hulce is equally as good as Mozart. He plays him with a reckless abandon and in an over the top fashion that is perfectly suited for the role. The film took home the 1984 Best Picture Oscar, Mr. Forman won Best Director and Mr. Abrham beat out Mr. Hulce for Best Actor. This was a case where a tie would have been more than appropriate. The new director's cut adds 20 minutes of footage, but the real standout is the remastered sound.  The Dolby 5.1 version brings alive the sounds of Mozart in brilliant detail.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Okay, we all know that this multiple Oscar-winning film is wonderful on all levels, but be forwarned:  the video transfer to DVD pales in comparison to the laser disc collector's edition from several years ago.  The sound is fine, and you certainly better have a good sound system to  take full advantage, but the picture isn't as great as it should be.  Granted, it is at LEAST as good as the best VHS copy you will ever watch,  but it lacks the THX treatment the $150.00 laser disc edition got, and boy  is THAT worth every cent! A great transfer, running commentary by Milos  Forman and Peter Shaffer, hour-long documentary, and several deleted  scenes.  Until such a time as that version is released on DVD (and I hope  it will be someday), your DVD copy of &quot;Amadeus&quot; will not be the  best copy available.  And the laser disc edition came with the soundtrack  CD's in 24 karat bit somethingorother, which I believe is the best version  commercially available.  A treasure!  So buy the DVD so you can have a  good copy of this film, but keep your eyes peeled for the THX version, with  bonus features, if it ever becomes available.  Then buy that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>People always gripe about Hollywood executives who smoosh directors' visions, but if this movie is any indication, they sometimes see things much more clearly than the directors.<br /><br />"Amadeus" has always been one of my favorite movies, but I've never had a copy.  Finally I thought, "Why not?" and ordered this.  Heck, let's get the director's cut, as that's bound to be better.<br /><br />No way.  The movie is much worse.  All those scenes that wound up on the cutting room floor?  Watch this and you'll realize why they were left there.  Constance's topless visit with Salieri poisons the emotion of the rest of the film, and many of the other scenes that were included slog the pacing and focus.  The original film made every point it wanted to make without any of them:  why couldn't they just have been added as "deleted scenes"?  Or why couldn't we have the option of seeing film "in original theatrical format" or "with deleted scenes interlarded" or something.<br /><br />Argghghghh.  Now somebody's gone and ruined one of my favorite films.

Late in life, Salieri confesses to having poisoned Mozart. Scholars generally agree that Mozart died from Rheumatic fever, Another conspiracy theory debunked! Amadeus won 8 Academy Awards. Saul Zaentz is the producer, the guy who clashed with John Fogerty over rights to the songs Fogerty wrote for CCR.

It wasn't available when I bought the movie. This standard version is pretty basic, with not much other than the movie on it. Because I'm a fan of extra features, I'll probably buy it as well.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>This is not really a film about Mozart at all. Peter Shaffer the English playwright read some of Mozart's letters which suggested that his sense of humour was rather focused on fart jokes and chamber pots. He wrote a play which was basically about the composer Antonio Saleiri who was older but a contempory of Mozart. Saleiri was a person who was succesfull in material terms and was also a person who had considerable skills and became a court favourite in Vienna. As a musician however he was not that talented and although his music was alright it has not ever been seen as the work of a genious and is played only occasionally as a curiosity. <p>Schaffers play was about Saleiri and his jealously over Mozarts talent. Through the play he is tormented by the fact that whilst Mozart writes music as beautiful as that heard in heaven Saleri's music is at best pedesterian. Further that this is all so undserved as Mozart was so crass. It of course is a further irony that although Saleri hated Mozart he was one of the few who could appreciate the genius of his work. Otherwise Mozart was not that popular and many thought his music overly complex. <p>Now what has happened is that this play has been sort of adapted for film. Instead of Mozart cracking fart jokes at every spare opportunity he is made to appear vulgar. His music in played through the film in short bits and his father is made to appear a tyranical character. <p>The reality of Mozart's life is of course different than this. He very much reflected the time with his sense of humour and the way he expressed himself. The notion of him being a vulgarian is simply a creation of Schaffer's play. The film thus presents a rather unrealistic portrait of his life and it also paints others of the period in the same way. The Emperor Joseph is played as a clown despite the fact that he could sight read music play the piano well and was a person of considerable interlect. <p>If one knows a bit about Mozart the film is thus a bit irritating. It is also unfortunate that a perception has grown up that this is an authentic biography. Still its not the worst film of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>Someone, I forget who, once said "Art is knowing what to omit," or something to that effect. They should have told this to Milos Forman before he undertook his way-too-long director's cut of Amadeus.<br /><br /> It's become marketing myth that the "director's cut" or "special edition" is always superior. I was racking my brains the other day trying to think of one film that had been improved by "the director's version" of things. Aside from the re-cut of Judy Garland's A Star Is Born, which started the whole trend, I couldn't think of one: Lawrence of Arabia, The Abyss, the Star Wars Trilogy, E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Brazil...every movie I've seen was better in its original incarnation. And it's not just a matter of me liking what I am used to, because in some instances I saw the director's cut before the original, and still liked the original better. I don't know if directors are just not good at objectively editing their own work or what, but we always get more scenes that tell us nothing new, yet the sheep critics always say how much more "depth" and "resonance" (their two favorite sheep words) we get in the new version. Don't take my word for it--check out the reviews of any movie that had scenes restored.<br /><br /> Well, I don't see it in Amadeus, which may be the worst director's cut I've ever seen. The movie was long enough as it was, though I have nothing inherently against long movies. But this movie didn't need to be any longer. Despite the critical accolades, we didn't need a single new scene. They just told us what we already knew--with one exception, and that was better left on the cutting room floor. (Without providing spoilers, it revolved around Constanza bearing her breasts.) The sequence as it originally was cut was my favorite in the whole movie, because to me it marked the single biggest turning point in the film: Salieri's anger turns from Mozart to God. With the use of a flash back, flash forward and flash back again, it managed in a few minutes and a few deft cuts to move the story along in a quantum leap. The new version inserts an entire unnecessary trist in between the edits, that slow the plot down and have no effect upon the later plot. Some people have maintained you now learn more about why Constanza disliked Salieri so. What "more" did we need to know? There was already clear motivation in the previous cut: she went to him in a time of great need and begged him to help her husband. He was moved to tears by his genius, but instead of helping he walked out the door, purposely stepping on Mozart's manuscripts in the process. For those who need Jackie Collins-style melodrama we apparently do. The first cut was sublter, faster, and leaner.<br /><br />The change upsets the dramatic balance in other ways as well.  Originally, there was this clever irony in that while Constanza distrusted Salieri--based on her one lone encounter with him--her husband never really did, never realized Salieri was trying to thwart him, never saw the true man.  (Since Stanzi went there in secret, she presumably never told Mozart what happened.) In the third act, however, we got a clever reversal: It is Mozart who distrusts the man in the mask (Salieri), while Constanza takes him at his word ("Here is a real man, who puts down real money.") even though once again the motive is to thwart Mozart.  This clever construction is not present in the new version, with a different motivation for Stanzi's hatred of Salieri.  Again, the changes hurt, not help, the movie.<br /><br />Then there are repetitions in the plot that make this movie unnecessarily long.  After Salieri refuses to help Constanza on behalf of her hubby, Mozart himself goes and begs for a loan. Again Salieri refuses. (Surprise!) Redundant. After the scene where it is announced Mozart is engaged to Constanza and Madam Cavalieri shows her great displeasure, throwing her roses at Mozart and storming off in a huff, we get a scene in her dressing room where she blows off more steam. Nothing is established in this dressing room scene that wasn't already known before. Every new scene is like that. (We already know of Mozart's uneasy relationship with his father; we didn't need a line dropped in "What's the matter, aren't you glad to see me?" when Leopold first appears in Vienna. Obviously Wolfie isn't--we can see by the look of fear on his face. Is this the "Mozart for Dummies" version?)<br /><br /> If the recut film is a disappointment, the director's commentary is not. Forman may have made some questionable choices, but he's a lively narrator. The one-hour "Making of" documentary is also excellent, with many fascinating anecdotes.<br /><br /> It's too bad we can't get these extras on the disc of the original cut. As it is, I learned nothing new, found no new "resonance" and "depth," and in fact found one of my favorite scenes now diluted with a titilating sex scene (pun intended) pointlessly tacked on. As the Emperor Joseph II might have said, "Too many scenes. Cut a few, and it will be perfect."</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING.

COLORS ARE STUNNING AND SOUNDS GREAT.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>It is hard not to love this movie.  I give it an &quot;almost 5,&quot; only because I can't help but compare it to &quot;Immortal Beloved,&quot; a film that struck me as superior both in tone and subject matter.  (I prefer Beethoven to Mozart, and also tend to favor Beethoven's brooding presence and inner demons.  I also like Gary Oldman a great deal more than either F. Murray Abraham or Tom Hulce.)<p>But make no mistake.  This is a beautiful, rich film that centers on a personal conflict that ought to resonate in most of us--the conflicting admiration and jealously we often feel for those who are both better than us and so naturally gifted that excellence seems effortless to them.  Salieri shows the worst of human nature in a perform that is both true and revealing.  Hulce's Mozart is an audacious character, and whether it is true to Mozart's persona (a frightening thought, suggesting that silliness, arrogance, and genius go hand in hand) or not, is interesting and engaging.  But Abraham is the star here.  He is the heart of the movie.  And if I had to point out one flaw, it is that the character of Mozart simply isn't sufficiently fleshed out.  He ends up being a caricature in many respects, which is disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>I'm going to assume that most everybody has seen this now classic film,<br />so I'll spare you a blow by blow of what happens because you already know<br />for the most part that it was based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.<br />This movie recieved 8 Oscars in 1984 (including Best Picture), and the<br />principal actors Tom Hulce (Mozart) and F.

The film 'Amadeaus' is a prime example of how a completely fabricated story can pass off as something genuine.  The film has created a bogus story for the sake of drama and sensationalism.  It makes Mozart look like some God who had everything easy and then goes on to say his father's death had something to do with his death.  Hollywood will anyting to create mystery out of nothing.  Most embarassing of all, Mozart's wife calls him "Wolfy".  Boy, I'm sure people in the 1700's talked like that!!</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>this movie is great. the dvd thats another story. no special features , second side doesnt work in my dvd player. geeze was i wrong to put this on my christmas list. well buy the tape. not the dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>&quot;Amadeus&quot; dares to tell the story of mediocrity, and in the words of the mediocre some astounding truths are told.  <p>Essentially narrated by the aged and suicidal Salieri in a &quot;confession&quot; to a young priest in the &quot;present day&quot; (actually 1823), former musical giant (composer of the &quot;greatest opera yet written&quot; that has been consigned to the ashbin of history) and now a wrinkled has-been, &quot;Amadeus&quot; ponders the plight of an ambitious man (Salieri) confronted by genius that he can never defeat on its own terms.  According to &quot;Amadeus,&quot; the results of this clash are not pretty. <p>The film opens spectacularly, with Salieri screaming &quot;Mozart&quot; against a black screen.  Soon we see Salieri, blood gushing from his self-slashed throat, being whisked through the streets of Vienna as the city dances and whirls to Mozart's exhilirating Symphony No. 25 in G Minor (don't worry -- you'll recognize it).  With an amazing economy, the film, directed by Milos Forman (and adapted  Paul Shaffer from his own stage work) establishes a world of wondrous palaces, hyper-elaborate dress, and astounding music.  No mere costume drama, &quot;Amadeus&quot; drops the viewer deep into the late 18th century in Vienna, then one of the most powerful cities in Europe and a cultural touchstone for the Western world.  This is the city to which all composers flock.<p>Salieri, with his crabbed hands and scratchy voice, tells of his early years, when he promises his soul to God in return for the ability to make music to honor God. He pledges his industry, his chastity, and his eternal devotion.  And, wonder of wonders, his dad (a merchant with no ear for music) dies, choking to death at lunch!  So Salieri is free to pursue his love of music, and it appears that God has granted Salieri his wish -- Salieri rises to become Court Composer for Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). <p>Well regarded, Salieri has his world turned upside down by the arrival of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce, in an inspired casting coup).  Vulgar, impulsive, hedonistic, and supremely talented, Mozart's reputation as a genius has preceded him, but Salieri is horrified to see that Mozart is (almost) as concerned with debauchery as his music.  Even more horrifying, Salieri realizes that Mozart is more talented than he -- reading over Mozart's pages, Salieri groans, &quot;It was like he was taking dictation from God.&quot;<p>Why, God, why?  Salieri cannot fathom why God would make this creature the vehicle for such talent . . . talent that only Salieri seems to appreciate.  Mozart is popular with the masses, but cannot make a big splash with the Court . . . in part because the Emperor, who defines taste for the Court, has no ear for music.  When the Emperor yawns during one of Mozart's performances, Mozart is doomed.  The Emperor also has some priceless advice for Mozart -- don't use so many notes, becuase the human ear can only hear so many notes before it gets tired!  <p>Driven to despair by the continued genius flowing from Mozart's pen, Salieri rejects God and vows to destroy God's creature.  What follows is a descent into madness for both Salieri and Mozart.  Without getting overly sentimental, Forman and Shaffer spin a tale of surpassing beauty (Mozart's music) and tragedy (Mozart's death).  <p>Ultimately, Salieri proclaims that he is the champion of mediocrity everywhere.  As he is whisked away from the shell-shocked priest, Salieri absolves the various patients in his insane asylum, he also absolves the audience (who cannot help but feel mediocre in the face of Mozart's genius?).  In a pitch-perfect note, as the screen dissolves to final black, we again hear Mozart's aggravating, infuriating high-pitched giggle, and we know that it will forever haunt Salieri.<p>&quot;Amadeus&quot; throws us into the mania of composition for both Mozart and Salieri, the world of court intrigues, and the triumphs and agonies of success and failure for composers.  We understand Salieri's torture as his music grows fainter as Mozart's popularity soars -- even after Mozart's death.  This is a powerful film with a surprisingly dark theme, but it is required viewing for any fan of classical music.  <p>The soundtrack, by Sir Neville Mariner of the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, is astounding, and will have you rushing out to buy Mozart CDs as soon as the movie is over.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>For those about to see this film for the first time, they can expect a feast for their senses...at least in terms of sight and sound. Both the production values and the music are magnificent. In 1984, it received Academy Awards for best director (Milos Forman) and leading actor (F. Murray Abraham) as well as for adapted screenplay, art direction, costume design, makeup, and sound. It was also nominated for cinematography and deserved that award also, losing out to The Killing Fields. Although Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) is the subject, the film's focus is really on Antonio Salieri (Abraham) who is offended by young Mozart's vulgarity and resentful of the fact that such an immature boor should be entrusted by God with such exceptional talent. He considers himself the victim of a cruel practical joke, although he appreciates Mozart's "divine" talent which only serves to exacerbate his resentment. Unlike other films such as The Red Shoes which also offers so much that is pleasing to the eye and ear, Amadeus has a complicated plot which involves equally complicated human relationships, notably Mozart's with Salieri and with his father Leopold Mozart (Roy Doltrice). The supporting cast is first-rate. As the film progresses, we realize that young Mozart is literally working himself to death as he struggles to complete a commission to compose "Requiem," not realizing that Salieri is his "benefactor." There is so much to enjoy in this film even as Mozart's health deteriorates. What to make of Salieri? His jealousy is certainly understandable, if reprehensible. As the film draws to its sad conclusion, and as his own health deteriorates, Salieri's attitude toward Mozart seems to me ambivalent. Yes, the disapproval and resentment remain but I also sense a certain pride in his association with the young genius. The tone is bittersweet, in fact poignant as the old man realizes that Mozart's art -- not his -- will be remembered and cherished.<p>This DVD version also provides several supplementary items which include commentaries by Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer as well as a behind-the-scenes 37-minute documentary, "The Making of Amadeus."</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>THE DVD:  If you like this movie at all, it MUST be viewed on DVD (or in the theater of course).  Not only is this one of the best SOUNDING movies of all time - with Neville Mariner's wonderful renditions of Mozart's music - it is also on of the best LOOKING movies ever filmed.  As the documentary shows, it was filmed in Prague -which is the most eighteenth-century-looking city in Europe.  The film would be ruined in pan-and-scan - you need letterbox to be able to take in the breathtaking compositions.  The film looks and sounds great.  <p>That having been said, I don't think that they needed to offer a "two disc" edition.  The ONLY thing on the second disc is the documentary, which could have easily fitted on the first disc.  This is merely another instance of the studio jacking up the price by offering a "two disc special edition."<p>THE DIRECTOR'S CUT:  Amadeus was a long movie to begin with; now, with the extra footage, it clocks in at almost exactly three hours.  This is a LONG movie.  However, having now seen both versions, the Director's Cut does make more sense.  For instance, we get to see what really happens between Salieri and Mozart's wife.  It is never quite clear why they hate each other in the original.  Even better, we get more of the old Salieri talking.<p>THE FILM ITSELF:  Peter Schaffer is one of the best, most underrated playwrights of our time.  Equus is one of the great masterpieces of modern theater.  The title credits get it right with "Peter Schaffer's Amadeus".  As the documentary shows however, the play was altered radically on its way from the stage to the screen (and not always for the better).  I can't help but feel, however, the Milos Forman is overrated as a filmmaker.  With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, he found a movie formula - that of the plucky iconoclast - and he has been remaking that film OVER AND OVER as The People vs. Larry Flint, Man in the Moon...and Amadeus.  Whenever he deviates from that formula, the films flop.<p>The main complaint people have against this film is the acting - specifically Tom Hulce as Mozart.  Perhaps it is because Milos Forman's first language is not English he misses the subtleties of performance.  In the documentary, he pontificates about how thousands of actors were tested, and how important casting is.  But the question remains - why didn't he do better?  He casts mostly American actors and, for some reason, you just can't buy eighteenth-century dialogue coming from contemporary American accents.  The exception to this, of course, is F. Murray Abraham, who won an Oscar for this performance.  He is an accomplished theater actor who knows how to use his voice.  Even though he does not affect an English accent, he knows how to do elevated dialogue so we believe his Salieri.  The best parts of the movie are of the old Salieri reciting Peter Schaffer's wonderful dialogue over the music of Mozart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Milos Forman<br /><br />Cast:  F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Elizabeth Berridge, Simon Callow, Roy Dotrice, Christine Ebersole, Jeffrey Jones, Charles Kay.<br /><br />Running Time:  160 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for some violence, nudity, and language.<br /><br />Based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played a terrific and hilarious performance by Tom Hulce. This also has the life of Antonio Salieri, a great and well deserved Oscar winning performance by F. Murray Abraham. Despite the story not being accurate, come on! This is a great movie that was a gigantic Oscar waiting to happen. Congrats to Amadeus for bringing the beauty of classical music into out living rooms.  The story is that we start off with an older and more suicidal Salieri who blames himself for Mozart's death. When a priest comes to ask Salieri to plead forgiveness to the lord and wants to council him, Salieri describes who he was and how music inspired his life, he plays a few notes from his opera's that were masterpieces, the priest just looks at him not knowing the music. Salieri just looks at him with a smile and says "Ah, how about...?" he plays Mozart's most famous work and the priest gets excited saying "Oh, how charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that!" smiling and knowing how it will please Salieri, Salieri just looks at him with an emotionless face "I didn't. That was Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart" and you see the priest's embarrassment. Just great and a perfectly played out performance by Abraham and Frank.<br /><br />Tom Hulce gives Mozart this crazy and annoying yet nevertheless funny laugh that you can't help but laugh at it every time he does it. He brings such life to Mozart and an immaturity that I think some of us can relate too in being spoiled and always knowing you're the best at your talent. He marries Constance played by Elizabeth Berridge and she does it remarkably well. Constance is obviously the more mature one and is the only woman who can try to tame Mozart's crazy ways. When Salieri gets a little jealous that the emperor played by an under rated Jeffrey Jones, since he is the emperor's tutor, then the emperor demands more of Mozart and his music.  Like other landmark movies, "Citizen Kane," "Psycho," "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly," and "Jaws," "Amadeus" hits you a different way each time you see it. It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly. Salieri is especially rich in this regard; the way F. Murray Abraham plays him. There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service. Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it.<br /><br />Abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place. Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high-living fellow with a juvenile mind and a poor understanding for the lesser talents of other composers, yet at the same time he makes you care about his many trials. Elizabeth Berridge is believably coquettish and lower-class as Constance, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good. Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good-naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.  That's a good way to describe "Amadeus," as the kind of film Shakespeare might have made had he plied his trade a few centuries later. The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W.S. did so well.<br /><br />Director Milos Forman achieves greatness through making a movie about music and opera, and representing his film in just such a way. Even when no performance is being given, the music in the background sets the mood for what we see on screen in an operatic way making it twice as meaningful. It is also beautifully shot, and using all natural light and no artificial lighting, we are treated to an immersing experience that makes one forget it's just a film and these are just actors. Few do this correctly, but when it is, it's truly magnificent and makes the film. The costumes even further add to this atmosphere of realism, as "Amadeus" is one of the most beautifully constructed, eloquent films of the last twenty-five years.  Truly exceptional, entertaining, and engrossing even if you aren't a Mozart fan or a devoted fan of music in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>Prior to owning this director's cut, I had only seen the theatrical version. At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984, back when the theatre was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.<br /><br />This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.<br /><br />The director's cut adds some additional scenes that flesh out the motivations for the characters, and you would think that this adds to the film, but actually it detracts from it. I rather liked imagining what went on between the characters and having some of the sexual situations and conflicts insinuated and largely left up to the imagination of the viewer. This is all stripped away with the director's cut. Also, as unsavory a character as Salieri was, the extra scenes make him even more unlikable, and in a way that I thought was even beneath of what he was capable. I would elaborate, but I would give away key plot points.<br /><br />The commentary is the same as what was on the previous director's cut standard DVD, and to tell you the truth, the pair doing the commentary did not take the film seriously at all, which surprised me since one of the commenters is director Milos Forman. The comments were often completely distracting from the film's atmosphere, although they were well informed in their narrative. The other major extra, the "Making Of" documentary was quite enjoyable, and was also previously available on the standard DVD release of the director's cut.<br /><br />The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness,  and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. I highly recommend the film, and if you never saw the theatrical cut I doubt you will be bothered by the added material of the director's cut.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Amadeus' was one of the most refreshing spectacles I have had the pleasure of witnessing in quite some time.  I was personally blown away with what I was presented with and have thus concluded `Amadeus' to be one of the best motion pictures in the history of motion pictures.  If you have not had the privilege of witnessing this powerful film then please, stop everything you are doing and track this movie down, order it straight from this webpage if you need to, but please watch this movie immediately.  I don't think I've been this passionate about a single film since I saw `The Godfather' for the first time.  Truly all the praise and admiration that has been associated with this masterclass of a film is well warranted.  `Amadeus' is astounding from start to finish, a truly mesmerizing and utterly flawless production.  Milos Forman is God; seriously.<br /><br />As the film opens we meet Antonio Salieri, a man gone crazy.  He is living in an asylum and claims to have murdered Mozart.  In the opening scenes of the film Salieri is met by a priest who wants to hear his story and so Salieri proceeds to tell him how it was that he came to meet, grow to despise and eventually kill Mozart.<br /><br />Antonio Salieri was an aspiring composer who has reached a certain level of fame as court composer to Emperor Joseph II but he has achieved nothing in comparison to the fame and recognition as the esteemed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Salieri himself feels that Mozart's music is divine, something sent from God above (kind of the way I feel about this movie) but when he has the chance to finally meet this messenger of God he is let down.  Mozart is not the noble gentlemen he had expected but instead is a pompous arrogant vile thing that sends shivers down Salieri's spine.<br /><br />How could God use this disgusting man in such a beautiful and miraculous way?<br /><br />It becomes apparent that the Emperor is smitten with Mozart's talent though and this bothers Salieri, not to mention others close to the Emperor.  Salieri then decides that he is to make it his life goal to destroy Mozart, to strip him of his power and social standing and ruin him, yes, kill him.  He concocts a plan all his own to accomplish this and sets it all in motion, waiting for the time to be right to strike and make his dreams come true.<br /><br />`Amadeus', as I mentioned earlier, is perfect.  I seriously cannot find a single flaw.  The script is deliciously absorbing and never loses the interest of its audience.  The direction is nothing short of phenomenal and the acting across the board is superb.  The two leads are brilliant.  F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar for his performance, captures the very dire frustration and conflicting emotions that drives Salieri to madness and Tom Hulce (who should have won the Oscar in my humble opinion) dominates as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, completely fleshing out his talent as well as the demons that choked out the flame that was his life.  Elizabeth Berridge was sorely robbed of an Oscar nomination.  Her portrayal of Mozart's doting wife Constanze is brilliantly crafted and expertly executed.<br /><br />The only word I can use to describe this film is ecstasy; pure, unbridled ecstasy.  Since seeing this film I've thought of nothing else and have a feeling that I will think of nothing else for quite a while still to come.  Please, I beg of you, experience this film for yourself.  You will not regret it.<br /><br />Consider me entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>The bit a lot of people miss about Amadeus is not so much that it's a fiction (this really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone: it purports to be the recounted story of a person in a madhouse, after all), but that it's an adaptation of a play. Like most playwrights, Peter Shaffer (he of Equus) was not interested in historical accuracy to documentary standard - and nor is this picture. In fact, it's much cleverer than that - what we get here is a beautifully scripted essay on Envy, God and your Just Deserts (and why you don't always get them), played out between light and dark in the beautiful setting of Prague. As befits a theatrical adaptation, the symbolism is stark - Mozart's white (even manifesting itself in a dove at one point, for heaven's sake) plays the establishment's black. For the most part, you can judge the sympathies of a given character at a point in time by the colour of his or her wig. Salieri, the great tormentor (and tormentee) is finally rendered head to toe in snowy white, being wheeled down the corridors of the madhouse, himself absolved and offering absolution to his fellow in-patients. And Mozart disappears, in a hessian sack, into a cloud of quicklime of the purest white.<p>I suppose the American accents shouldn't have grated - historically they're no less accurate than English ones, or the speaking of English at all, for that matter. Still, a pity that Simon Callow traded his English accent for a silly American one. <p>Good tip (especially for those stuffy types who don't dig Tom Hulce's hyena impersonation): watch the film with the alternative music only soundtrack. Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martins in the Fields playing Mozart to the accompaniment of pretty Czech snowscapes is about as it good as it gets.</p></br></body></html>

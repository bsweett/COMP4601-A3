The cool thing is that you can completely trash your expectations.  Heck, I couldn't rent it twice at blockbuster for this money.  Needless to say, I jumped in with both feet and landed safely into a film I thought was pretty cool.  Let's run with Lola!!<br /><br />-DUBBA DUBBA...<br />I had to watch the dubbed version.  I started with subtitles but this is a very visual film.  The limited dialogue simply sets the stage for the physical action and reinforces the point of the film.  So, it was more important to watch the action than hear the actor's actual German voices.  Most of the dubs were fair enough accept for Lola's boy friend; "GODDAM# IT! HE'S GONNA KILL ME!!!  WHAAAHAAAAHAAAA!!".  After that scene it got better.<br /><br />-THE POINT OF THE FILM<br />Though not a completely new concept, the film revolves around the idea that one little word, act or decision will dramatically change your fate and the fate of others.  This film, though a bit overly deliberate (what, we Germans?) still managed to be unique.  I'm not even going to tell you how this is presented because that's half the fun.<br /><br />-A FILM OF FAIR QUALITY<br />I would never call this great film making.  However, it's not at all bad either.  Like the concept, the execution was fairly deliberate.  I thought this made it more fun.  The acting was at least adequate, the story was unique enough and it actually had some exciting visual dynamics without going over the top... ...most of the time.<br /><br />-JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGED<br />Well the heck with that.  This film is full of stupid people.  Of course the question is never asked; "how could they be so stupid to begin with!"  I guess we're expected to roll with the premise as it was set up.  That's ok, but it certainly lurked in the back of my mind that these are not particularly good people we're investing our emotions in.  That kind of ruined the ending for me.  Possibly the dumbest thing about Lola is her unique talent which borders on being a super power; just ridiculous.<br /><br />-INTERESTING ANIMATION<br />I almost feel like I'm giving too much away by mentioning that there is animation at all.  But it's too late; there are animation sequences in this film.  They were actually visually exciting and accentuated the entire concept of the film.  It was almost like "Schoolhouse Rock" meets "Lizzy Maguire" meets "The Simpson's"; very Euro-groovy.  Please; no smart remarks about me even knowing about "Lizzy Maguire".  I do have a young daughter after all.  Anyway, I actually liked these somewhat crude but stylish interludes.<br /><br />-WAS MUSS ICH DENKEN? (What do I think?)<br />I thought it was "sehr gut".  It is actually a riveting film that has lots of action and only a little violence (mostly running, duh!).  If you like unique story telling with good production values and fair acting this might satisfy you.  The ending is a bit irksome to me for reasons I don't want to explain here for fear of spoilage.  However, it was inevitable considering the type of people we're dealing with.  I recommend watching with the dubbing due to the visual nature of the film.  I found it helpful anyway.  If you can buy it for the same price I did, all the better.  So hop on the Lola express; BOOM CHUCKA BOOM CHUCKA BOOM CHUCKA...<br /><br />Actors....3.8 stars<br />Visuals...4.7 stars<br />Story.....5.0 stars<br />  Average...4.5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Run Lola Run is a little German film that became an international sensation when it was released in 1998.  The film stars Franka Potente as neon-red hair colored Lola who is literally running through most of the film as she tries to save her boyfriend's life.  Manni is working his way into a criminal organization, yet we can see that he is a genuinely good guy.  Manni is supposed to bring 100,000 marks to the dropoff - but Lola is late picking him up.  Thus starts a chain of events that ends disastrously, but begins again.<br /><br />Manni leaves the money on a subway.  A bum steals the bag.  If Manni does not come up with the money in twenty minutes, he will be killed.  He phones Lola from a phone booth, sobbing.  He wants to rob the store across the way.  She says, No, Manni, Wait for me.  I am coming and I will think of something.  Her father is a bank president, but his relationship with his daughter is not good, and he has problems of his own, as we can see.  Family and human relationships are portrayed excellently in this film.  The acting is great.<br /><br />In this way, Run Lola Run is disjointed and post-modernist.  People who prefer their story given straight up will say this film is weird.  My husband did not like the mix of animation, techno music, and backwards/start over time frames.<br /><br />Which version of events is the real one?  That is up to the viewer.  One thing is for sure - you will be cheering for Lola as she runs.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I usually HATE the lightning-fast, quick-cut edits in modern movies. It always reminds me of either TV commercials or mindless music videos. RUN LOLA RUN uses this technique in a way that I never thought possible, by giving us a story w/ heart and soul at blazing speed! LOLA (Franka Potente from ANATOMY and CREEP) is a warm, emotional woman w/ a fast mind. LOLA's boyfriend is in dire trouble, having lost his gangster boss' money. Now, LOLA finds herself in a frantic race against time, attempting to accomplish the impossible in 20mins! If movies have to be at light-speed, then they should be like this! Flawless and ingenious...</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>When her boyfriend, Manni, loses 100,000 German marks that belong to his mafia boss, Lola has just 20 minutes to somehow find that impossible amount and bring it to him before he does something dangerous.  She can run fast, but it may not be fast enough to save his life.  Combining animation, snapshots, vibrant colored film, with video and black and white sequences, Tom Twyker tells an exciting action adventure love story, that marked a new era of German and world cinema.  The intensity, the colors, the music, all brought together in an avant-garde style that combines classical storytelling techniques with MTV-era edits, is unique and exhilarating.  It's like a music video and video game and fairy tale and art film, all rolled into one.  It's like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WLMOLO">Last Year at Marienbad</a> on speed, where the intellectual intrigue and excitement is matched by real and visceral thrills.<br /><br />The film opens with a quotation from T.S. Elliot, juxtaposed quickly with another from a famous German soccer coach, suggesting up front the film's aims to transcend the distinction between popular and high-brow entertainment, poetry and sport, art and action.  In my mind, the film succeeds tremendously.  The acting throughout is strong, but Franka Potente channels Lola with a combination of fierce determination and vulnerability that is fascinating to watch.<br /><br />The opening scene establishes the philosophical dimensions of the story, with a light touch.  Images of anonymous humanity, with emphasis on a seemingly random few individuals here and there, are accompanied by a narrator.  Human beings ask endless questions, and every answer provokes new questions.  In the end they all come down to a single question and a single answer: the ball is round, and the game lasts 90 minutes.  If life is a game, there are some basic guidelines: at some point the game ends, and there are basic parameters such as laws of nature that can't be violated.  Beyond that: it's all theory.  Twyker employs a unique approach to non-linear storytelling, in order to explore what matters and what's in our control in the context of a life where so much is left to chance.  To say much more would be to spoil some of the delight of seeing this film for the first time.  I've seen it several, and get something new each viewing.  It's like the spiral that serves as a primary visual motif throughout the film, the circle that turns back upon itself with a difference each time.  Or like the line from Elliot that gets things rolling: the end of our adventures is when we come back to the beginning and see it fresh as if for the very first time.  I get that feeling every time I watch this film.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>Since I first saw RUN LOLA RUN right aroung the same time as I did Michael Haneke's 1997 FUNNY GAMES, the two remain linked in my mind.  Odd in a way, since I love this movie--and have watched it several times--and had quite the opposite reaction to the Haneke film, to the point where I refused to consider seeing the American re-make from 2008.  But there was one significant aspect these two late-90s films shared: both films very deliberately called attention to the fact that they WERE indeed films: artificial representations of the real world, subject to authorial intervention and variation at almost any point in the plot.<br /><br />Tom Tykwer's LOLA is, in many ways, an extremely self-conscisous film.  Its thrice-repeated basic plot, with extensive variations and elaborations, is a reminder that narratives can (and perhaps should) be subject to artistic manipulation or--as in Hollywood--to audience reactions at the test screenings.  "Don't like THAT ending? Try this one! Or this one.  We must have something here you'd like--and would pay seven bucks a pop to see."  RUN LOLA RUN is a movie for anyone who's ever compulsively watched every single alt-ending provided on a DVD.  It works for the same reason that the various versions of any other narrative work.  Endings are seldom neat and always subject to change.  Any plot suggests its alternative versions, "What if?" says the audience, "What if?"<br /><br />LOLA lets the viewer in on the secret--and, to extent, on the decision making.  This is a fiction, and you're not allowed to forget it.  There could be something depressingly Sisyphean about Lola's desperate 20 minute run, except that the camerawork, the editing and the music are so faced paced and compelling that it's easy to forget the desperate situaion Lola and boyfriend Manni find themselves in and just enjoy the ride.  After individual segments in which, first, Lola dies and, then, Manni does, we are primed and fully entitled to the fairytale happy ending the third segment brings.  This is less Nietzsche' "eternal return" than George Harrison's "with every mistake we must surely be learning."<br /><br />It is the exhilaration, the downright glee of possibility that keeps us engrossed in this hyperkinetic PoMo fairytale.  And that's probably the reason why I so preferred it to FUNNY GAMES.  The Haneke movie deliberately breaks from the narrative, tears down the fourth wall--or the moviehouse screen, if you prefer--about 3/4 of the way through.  In that grimly violent film, which seems to marching relentlessly to a violently conclusion, this break comes as a real break for the emotionally exhausted viewer.  But no sooner, does he break from the action than he picks right back up on it again.  This story, he seems to say, HAS to end this way.  It may be a fiction, but it must follow its own deadly internal logic.<br /><br />That was a nihilistic stance if there ever was one.  By contrast, RUN LOLA RUN is almost sweetly Romantic.  Fates are not sealed here.  Fictions, like the real life that informs them, have infinite possibilities. all of which have an internal logic of their own.  Third time's a charm for Lola and Manni.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is one of the more inventive movies of the last 10 years, I would think. It was new, fresh and very different when it came out in the late '90s and still is unique and enjoyable as of this review in early 2009.  The Blu-Ray edition, by the way, is terrific and worth the money. It looks tremendous.<br /><br />The movie is short - 81 minutes - but plenty long when you consider it's three versions of the same story, each version about 25 minutes after an opening introduction.<br /><br />That may sound too repetitive or boring for those who haven't seen this, but it is anything but overplayed thanks to the innovative camera-work and interesting angles on the same story. Watching it on DVD was better than the theater because the 5.1 sound is superior, plus you have the option of a good dubbed version or the original German with English subtitles. I use either, depending on my mood but I lean toward the German with subtitles.<br /><br />Franke Potente, who has since gone on to become better known around the world from the "Bourne" films, is the centerpiece of this film and very, very interesting. The looks of shock on her face, her flaming red hair and wild general appearance and the crazy things that happen to her are always fun to watch and hear.<br /><br />Added to the unique cinematography, which includes tricks here and there, is a pulsating electronic soundtrack that brings added life to this already kinetic, involving film.<br /><br />The high rating I give this film could really be summed up in two words: DIFFERENT and FUN.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>This heart-pumping, frantic, postmodern German film models itself after a video game, where different choices lead down different paths, to different conclusions, all within the control of the player.  And yet, this film is so much more than that.<br /><br />Franka Potente plays clown-haired Lola, a young woman in love with bumbling Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) and who finds herself racing against the clock to scrounge up the vast sum of 100,000 marks to save Manni's life.  As she runs through Berlin, she bumps into various people, whose fates are shown in flashes of slideshows, who may help or hinder her.  The soundtrack is thumping, almost minimalist, with a voice droning over Lola's high-stakes sprint, and it keeps the viewer as breathless as Lola herself.<br /><br />Because this film messes with the viewer's mind, the plot cannot be fully described without revealing spoilers.  Suffice it to say that viewers will have their expectations changed at every step.  The production standards are not Hollywood-slick, but director Twyker adeptly portrays both the desperate and the sweet in this story, with brilliant cinematography that takes this film to a high level.  As the depth of Lola's and Manni's relationship is revealed, the character form the heart of this surprising, thought-provoking film.<br /><br />Watch this more than once.  You'll love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>Quite honestly, I wasn't impressed at the first 20 minutes, but my lovely wife had warned me that it starts slow but turns into a movie worth watching, so I didn't hit the eject button.<br /><br />She was right.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />The beginning has very stylish music and visuals, along with a breakneck pace and a very difficult problem to solve, but what you don't know is that you're being set up for something you probably won't expect.  I didn't.  And I won't say any more because I don't want to spoil the surprise.<br /><br />Note my rating.  I'm quite impressed.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>This DVD has been reviewed nearly 500 times so there's not too much that you can say that hasn't been said. One repeating theme is the movie's comparison to the "investment projects" of Hollywood. That Hollywood has the best technique, stars, cinematography, $s, and gimmicks is all true. What it often doesn't have is that sense of taking a chance. Lola does.<br /><br />The presence of a basic problem, lovers on a downward spiral, need not be examined. The consequences of THE ACT is ignored and in its place is the examination of the details of the turns and twists we make each day which brings us to THE ACT.<br /><br />We probably cannot alter what has happened, Tykwer theorizes. But what occurs to Lola and Manni is perhaps a lesson for the future. How small changes, doing small things differently can impact the result drastically. The 'inadvertant ripple in the pond theory.'<br /><br />I found it to be a smart movie, smarter than most created on the West Coast, provocative, out of the box, with an eye towards embracing 'the what if we make just one change' question. It's no wonder it has become an international cult film with an enormous truly diverse following. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>The beginning of Run Lola Run has a narrator stating how countless questions result in answers which in turn gives rise to other questions, and so on, in a chain of answers followed by questions.  &quot;But in the end, isn't it always the same question, and always the same answer?&quot;  The main question might be, will anything I do differently have any consequences?  Or why did this happen?<p>Lola's boyfriend Manni has just botched a drug deal, losing 100,000 marks.  He has to turn over the money to his connection, a nasty and forbidding bald guy, who will kill him in twenty minutes if he doesn't deliver the goods.  Lola, calm, usually on time, and loyal as ever, does what she can to help out her man, who increasingly desperate as time runs out, considers holding up the local supermarket to get the money.  She's running a race against time, encountering all sorts of people, including a bicycle courier, a Mr. Meyer who's a colleague of her father, and her father, a humorless, ice-in-his-veins banker who's carrying on with one of his female colleagues, who is pregnant.<p>This portrays three different scenarios of Lola running to save Manni, and demonstrates how one small action or variation can have enormous consequences on other people.  An example is the blonde woman walking with the baby carriage.  Each time she responds differently to Lola dashing by her.  We then see in a series of quick still photo montages what would later happen to her.  In one version, she ends up injured from an attack; in another, she ends up winning the lottery.  Another is how long the conversation between Lola's father and his lover has progressed before Lola bursts in on them, asking her father for money.  Each time, the outcome is different, affecting her father's attitude to her and what Lola does.<p>Another interesting aspect is Lola's piercing glass-shattering scream, which becomes the emanation of her desperation, whether it to be telling her boyfriend to shut up so he can calm down, or her anger at her father refusing to help her.<p>Franka Potente's Lola really lifts the film up, her bright vermilion hair, cyan tank top, and blue jeans nearly mirroring the primary colours of light.  She gives credibility in a character who is so much more with it than her boyfriend, whose over-reliance on her makes him incompetent, pathetic, and lacking direction.<p>Director Tom Tykwer must have been influenced by music videos as the swift jump cuts in scenes, nothing that requires a bottle of Dramamine by the TV set, mind you, as the pulsing techno score, matching Lola's frantic running, attest to.  An interesting piece of cinema from Germany, great in style and structure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>An entertaining, high-energy film in which characters crash off each other like balls in a pinball game, spinning each other's lives into new trajectories.  This film tackles some serious issues but refuses to take itself seriously, thereby remaining light and entertaining at all times.  To what extent are our lives ruled by chance, and to what extent are our fates determined by personality?  Watching the different versions of Lola's run through town, we can see that the lives of various secondary characters take dramatically different turns depending on such apparently innocuous details as whether Lola runs by at a certain point in time or five seconds later.  Yet the fate of Lola and her boyfriend, Manni, always seem to be the same.  This is a rewarding film whether you or in the mood to ponder such issues or just to be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>Every year I see countless flicks that pass for entertainment.  I see too many people going to see crap and liking it, but every year I also find something out there that brings back my faith in  talented filmmakers making good movies.  Run LOLA RUN is a really incredible film.  While not preying on petty emotions and cheap plot devices to involve the audience director Tykwer relies on something more important, he gives his film a vitality I rarely see in American film.  This move has a pulse.  We feel it in every seen and then there's that red hair.  I love this movie and  I try to get everyone I know to see it. Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/A243HY69GIAHFI.html">A243HY69GIAHFI</a><br/><p>Some have remarked on the originality of the film's concept.  In fact, this is one of the science fiction genre's more cliched premises.  What makes it novel, perhaps, is that it's applied to a non-science fiction  setting.  But, as interesting as the concept is, it does other films and  television shows an injustice to regard _Run Lola Run_ as an entire  innovation.<p>What separates _Run Lola Run_ from other films is not the  story itself so much as the way the story is told.  Director Tom Tykwer is  an auteur run amuck.  From the opening sequence, we are completely at the  mercy of Twyker's powerful vision.  <p>_Run Lola Run_ is the collision of  German expressionism, Czech animation, and MTV.  So much of this film is  told though this blend of visual styles, in fact, that one could turn off  the subtitles and understand most of what was going on.  <p>This is not to  say that the film is a vacuous visual metaphor.  Far from it.  Tykwer has  crafted a genuine story here, with a great moral center.  It's just that  that morality is not exposed through pages of dialogue.  Tykwer, instead,  uses so many techniques, so well-edited together, that the characters are  largely defined visually before you even know what's happening.  <p>Clearly, this is a must-have film for anyone seriously interested in the  craft of filmmaking.  Not only will you learn a lot from the cacophony on  display in the film itself, but the commentary (only in English) is  especially enlightening.  This is one of the very few secondary audio  commentaries on DVD in which the lead actress plays a part, and her insight  is invaluable.  It's extremely intriguing to hear scenes relived from both  sides of the camera.  More interestingly, though, Tykwer's explanation of  how he pulled off his vision is something that will energize even the most  casual filmmaker.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt) is one of the best European Alternative films to come out of the past decade. Directed and written by the great Tom Tykwer and starring Franka Potente (born exactly 10 years after me) this film starts out with a clock.  You sense you are about to go on a time trip, and soon you're in the race against time.  Incredible avant-garde cinematography mixed perfectly with cartoon animation focuses on Lola, a red-haired high energy time vortex.  She has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 marks all in the name of love.  If things dont go quite right it's okay, because here alternate reality comes into play ala the great Polish film Blind Chance (Przypadek by Kieslowski).  Profound questions are asked, and the film puts forth the idea that a butterfly (Lola) flapping its wings in Japan will effect American weather.  The quantum pure spontaneity of conscious decisions effect events at every Lola turn.<br /><br />  A great soundtrack drives it all and the whole film fits together perfectly.  A rare avant-garde success which is similar to and every equal of Aronofsky's Pi in significance.  Also captures the Berlin (I think that's where it is) atmosphere great; city chaos and freedom.  You must have a taste for the underground European avant-garde to really appreciate this.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Loud enough to shatter glass.<p>There are three keys to the success of this remarkable German language film (with English subtitles): originality of conception, crisp direction and editing, and two attractive stars to play the leads.<p>The stars are Franka Potente, who plays ruby red-haired Lola, daughter of a banker.  She is smitten with Manni, handsome young man played by Moritz Bleibtreu, who forgot to keep his grip on a bag containing 100,000 Deutsche marks belonging to his mobster boss.  He is to hand over the money in twenty minutes, but he lost it on the train. (It was picked up by a homeless man.)  Manni calls Franka and tells her the desperate straits he is in.  He says his only out is to rob a store.  She says no wait, she can come up with something.  What that something is is dear old dad.  She looks at the clock.  It's twenty minutes until twelve.  So Lola starts running to get to the bank and then to Manni before the stroke of noon.<p>If you've seen Truffaut's Les Quatre cents coup (1959) then you know where director Tom Tykwer may have gotten the idea of showing us a Lola who runs like the wind.  Truffaut used a sustained shot of his young hero running to convey an uplifting sense of freedom amid action.  It worked for Truffaut and it works for Tykwer.  Franka, running in nicely fitted pants and tank top (with her white lace bra strap discretely showing) really is a delight to watch.  And like Truffaut, Tykwer does not let us see the runner sweat.  There is a kind of effortless release, without any straining of our lungs.  It is like running in our dreams.<p>What Tykwer does with time is even more interesting.  He has Lola run from her home to the bank to Manni three times, each time with a slight difference in the early events, leading to differences in the events to come.  In the British movie Sliding Doors (1998) starring Gwyneth Paltrow, something of the same sort was tried with Gwyneth playing out two different permutations of her life based on decisions leading to differing scenarios.  I'm also reminded of the brilliant American film, Memento (2000) directed by Christopher Nolan in the way some of the events are played over again.  Here the scene as Lola runs by her mother on the telephone is the same three times, but then the differences begin.  It might also be said that this movie is the "many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics brought to cinema.  Or perhaps Tykwer was influenced by complexity theory in which a slight change in initial conditions can lead to large changes later on.<p>The story (or rather stories: there are three of them) strain credulity at times.  The awful things her "father" says to her in the first accounting seems too harsh and stupid to be real.  The co-incidence of Manni's spotting the bum on the bicycle in the third tale seems a bit too lucky to be believed.  And the allotment of twenty minutes of time in the three sequences was a bit off.  However some of the other events seemed to me to be plausible or at least very clever and therefore allowable in an artistic sense.  That the man in the ambulance regains a steady heart beat because she holds his hand is something this old guy can believe.  And the cops mistaking her for a bystander in the bank robbery seems like credible cop behavior to me.  And for those who think that the casino event was too much to believe, consider this:  Assuming that the roulette wheels in Germany have both a zero and a double zero, the odds against betting on the number twenty and hitting it on consecutive spins of the wheel are 1/36 times 1/36 which equals about 77/100,000 or about 1300 to 1.  It's a long shot, but nothing like winning the lottery.  Incidentally she had in the bag 115,600 Deutsche marks (her initial 100 marks x 34 x 34).<p>For those of you who haven't seen this remarkable film, consider this: it lasts 80 minutes, but it will seem like fifteen.  The "throbbing techno score" is haunting and there are some nice action sequences.  This is the kind of (R-rated, however) movie you can see with your teenaged son, although he would probably prefer to see it with his buds.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This film may have had a tad of art to it but for the most part it looked like a practice RUN for "Groundhog Day."  I appreciate the differences but there is nothing unique about this movie.  The only pleasure is comparing this to the hundreds of other similar movies ("D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu", "Sticky Fingers of Time", "Happy Accidents", etc.)<br /><br />The story is very basic; boyfriend loses mob money to bum on subway.  Girlfriend (Franka Potente quite hansom if you discount the red hair) frantic to help must RUN to his rescuer obtaining 100,000 Deutschmarks (pre-Euro 2002) on the way. We are treated to several versions and there could have been more.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br />This film lends its self well to Blu-ray. And there are a few DVD extras worth watching. Unfortunately they spoke to fast to interpret so I needed the English subtitles. I would have preferred German subtitles then I may have been able to keep up.

Everything else is pure theory." He kicks it into the sky.<br /><br />Well, Tom Tykwer certainly knows how to get our attention. And it's only a few minutes in the kinetic, high-octane, colourful world of "Run Lola Run" -- a wild action/romance that studies the ripple effect of our lives, and the changes we can make in the name of love.<br /><br />Lola (Franka Potente) receives a call from her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), a drug courier. Because Lola's moped was stolen, Manni had to take the subway home -- and he accidentally left behind a bag of money. Now he has twenty minutes to somehow get 100,000 marks, or his boss Ronnie is going to kill him.<br /><br />Lola races across Berlin to her father's bank -- only to find him with his mistress, and hear that he's leaving his other family. Desperate, she runs to where Manni is waiting, and helps him rob a convenience store. But as they flee, the police catch up to them -- and Lola is shot.<br /><br />"But I don't want to. I don't want to leave," she mutters. And time rewinds to where she left her apartment -- and this time, Lola's determined to do things differently. As she runs from one end of Berlin to another, she sends ripples through the lives of those she passes -- and she'll keep running until she finds a hundred thousand marks to save herself and Manni.<br /><br />"Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt)" was what propelled Tom Tykwer to international fame. And given that his other movies tend to be slower and more dreamlike -- though no less striking visually -- this movie is striking not only for its speed, but the sweet romance and the lesson about the old "butterfly's wings" adage. (Also see: "Happenstance")<br /><br />Admittedly, a woman running through Berlin is not terribly interesting in itself. But the world of Lola is filled with brilliant rave colours -- Lola's blazing red hair, colourful room, the sights of Berlin -- and her race against the clock is punctuated by little vignettes of the future lives of various people she bumps into. That momentary contact is enough to change their lives -- sometimes for better, or worse.<br /><br />And Tykwer's style is a spicy mix -- arty shots (going through a clock mouth or  an apartment building?), German techno, cartoon interludes with an animated Lola running for it, Lola changing reality with her screeches, and the snapshots of people's futures, seen only for a second -- but very revealing. Not to mention the equally colourful, MTVesque cartoons of Lola running down stairs, evading dogs, et cetera.<br /><br />But even aside from Tykwer's artistic flair, it's a great movie -- the atmosphere is painful and taut during the scenes in the bank, including Lola's robbery. And periodically, we see some sweet red-tinted interludes of Manni and Lola in bed, discussing their feelings for each other. They're little oases of calm and love, in the middle of all the running.<br /><br />Franka Potente does a solid job as Lola, an ordinary punky girl who loves Manni more than anything, and must find the RIGHT way out of their shared dilemma. She gets some nasty surprises from her uptight, adulterous dad, though. And Bleibtreu does magnificently as Manni, who is overcome with fear, frustration and anguish because he knows that his boss is going to kill him.<br /><br />"Run Lola Run" is a kinetic, vibrant, and a romantic little look at how a moment can change your life. Everything else is pure theory.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>I don't think this movie was really so much about the untypical heroine versus hero.  I think it was more about the what-ifs situations.<p>This movie is an interesting take on public perception with a heavy emphasis on the Butterfly effect.  Lola has 20 minutes to produce 100,000 Marks or her boyfriend Manni gets killed. As she's running through the streets of Berlin figuring out how to come up with the cash, she bumps into people along the way who see this red-headed stranger in a hurry. No one really knows why she's in such a hurry nor is she aware of what's going on in their lives. Lola bumps into a woman with a baby carriage; what little importance she has for this woman as she struggles to save another life.  The feelings are mutal from the woman, yet, three times we get a glimpse into her three possible futures. The uniqueness of the movie is depicted in three alternate endings based on different choices Lola makes in her desparation to get the cash for her boyfriend. <p>Lola doesn't make discoveries about people until she stops for more than a minute to realize what is going on around her, and vice versa.  Had she never gone to her father for money, she never would have found out he was having an affair.  Had she stopped to talk to the woman with the baby carriage she might have found out she was buying a lottery ticket she would later win or was beaten or which ever scenario panned out.  But then she would have missed the chance to meet her father.  Etc.  Etc.  Etc.  Questions  leading to more questions to more questions.<p>The butterfly effect is seen throughout the movie even in the beginning when Manni blames the loss of the money on Lola not showing up on time to pick him up after the drug deal which caused him to take the train to bump into the homeless man who distracted him from the sack of money he was supposed deliver and leaving it on the train.  At first you scoff at the boyfriend's irresponsibility for blaming Lola for his own mess up, but that's where the butterfly effect really begins and, like it or not, Lola started it all. <p>In the final scenario, Lola makes a different choice...she stops running lon enought to spend a few minutes with a dying man in an ambulance as he recovers. In the end, the running was for nought.  Her boyfriend ends up solving his own problem. Lola wass useful in one man's life but useless in helping another. Is it all inconsequential?  Just a passer by?  Probably not.<br /><br />If you're not into alternative films then this might not be for you.  Even I was left a little confused. Yet, it's a worthwhile movie taking on a curious angle on how in some form or another our actions affect others just in the nature of our being.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Tom Tykwer`s &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is a breath of fresh air.  There is so much creativity and vision in this small film that it stands alone against the overblown star vehicles the major studios keep forcing upon us.  It is a film brimming with energy and inspiration and a powerful salvo against Hollywood conventionalism.  <p>Lola (Franka Potente) is told by her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) that he has lost a bag with 100,000 deutsche marks in it.  She realizes that he will most likely be killed if the money is not delivered to the gangster Manni was supposed to meet.  This realization starts Lola off on a quest to come up with the funds on her own.  With time running out, Lola bolts out of her apartment and runs . . . and runs . . . and runs . . . <p>"Run Lola Run" is a treatise on the infinite possibilities a single situation can spawn.  It is a metaphysical examination of how the choices we make will affect us forever and how the actions of others can profoundly influence the circumstances of our lives.  Yet, on a more simplistic level, it is also an energetic display of filmmaking at its most creative.  Its unique use of freeze frames, novel camera angles, instant replays, and animation is proof that Tykwer is determined to give us a viewing experience unlike anything we've ever seen before.  With a pulsating soundtrack and a bravura performance by Potente to complement his boundless creativity, Tykwer succeeds in creating a truly original work.  Here's hoping that his example will inspire the current generation of filmmakers to test their own creative limits in the hopes of surpassing the standard set by "Run Lola Run."</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Wird sie es schaffen?  In diesem tollen Film haben wir Lola, rothaerrig und laut.

Basically I loved the movie because of its originality and fun.  I recommend it highly.</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>Run Lola Run is the result of a great experiment in film. Despite little characterization, scattered dialogue and a very basic plot, it fully succeeds in its intentions.<p>The simplistic plot concerns Lola receiving a phone call from her boyfriend Mannie, who has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 deutsch marks or faith the wrath of a crime boss. Lola sets off to find a way to come up with the money before Mannie resorts to robbery. That's it. But the trick of the film lies in the retelling of those 20 minutes in three separate scenarios as Lola is given multiple chances to get things right.<p>But the filmmakers don't need a second chance to get this film right. The pulsating techno soundtrack perfectly connects with the beautiful images of Lola running, trying to beat destiny. There's just something about the urgency in her eyes and the gracefulness with which she runs that won't let you take your eyes away from her. The film also explores how extremely minor events, such as brushing against someone, can have profound impacts on the rest of a person's life.<p>There's really not a whole lot more I can say about Run Lola Run. It's just a very small, short film (an 80 minute running time) that perfectly captures its subject. This one is definitely recommended, even for those that normally may avoid foreign language films. You just can't miss out on it.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>I've frequently found German cinema to be too depressing for my own taste as has my husband.  However, this film got rave reviews on my film listserv so I had to give it a chance.  I was drawing when I put it on the video  player and, five minutes into the film, I had put away my drawing, not to  touch it again until the movie was over!  That is how much this movie  grabbed my eye.  The director has quite the artist's eye and takes us  through 3 different visual versions of reality for Lola as she runs to try  to save her boyfriend's life.  We see how very small increments of time can  make vital changes to the opportunities and chances one has in life,  including whether one will even continue living!  There is not a second  wasted in the telling of this story and it is told very visually instead of  being laden with dialogue.  Lola has some very dramatic encounters with her  father, a banking executive, in these 3 versions of her running. At the  end, you feel very aware of how close you might live to momentary disaster,  especially in light of the effects of Lola's runs to the pedestrians and  drivers on the streets where she runs.  We found ourselves very caught up  in the film and wanted our own copy of it as soon as it was over, which we  did get.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ.html">AQ8DU6XVA3USJ</a><br/><p>This is a whole new experience in film.

(Love the ambulance/glass shot !). This  incredible movie will still interest you after many viewings. It's a keeper  !</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Tom Tykwer must've been hopped up on seven pots of Cuban coffee when he wrote the screenplay to RUN LOLA RUN. It's a nervy, jolting 1998 German thriller that hurtles like a runaway train. It's packed with urgent, kinetic moments. It's goaded by a pulsing techno score. It ambushes you with an unusual plot twist a third into it. It won the 1999 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and plenty of other awards, so it can shout that from the rooftops.<br /><br />What ever happened to Franka Potente? She'd amassed so much cachet after her electrifying performance here, I'm surprised I haven't seen her more on-screen since. RUN LOLA RUN doesn't ef around. It right away establishes the two leads and the story's central conflict. Potente plays "Lola," a redheaded whirling dervish of a girl who dashes off to rescue her frantic boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) who only has 20 minutes left to recover the 100,000 German marks that he'd lost, and then hand that over to his boss... his very testy mob boss. You wonder what an ordinary girl like Lola can do. I mean, besides run really fast and with arm-pumping abandon. One third thru the film, when things seem at its bleakest, maybe she'll surprise you. Because the thing that happens, I think she wills it into happening.<br /><br />***Hey now, SPOILERS alert for this paragraph!!*** Some say that this film is comprised of three parallel realities that showcase the same characters. Me, I prefer to regard RUN LOLA RUN as a time travel story, because it's cooler that way and it presents a stronger connective tissue. Sort of more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BZN1NM">12:01</a> than, say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305210411">Sliding Doors</a>. RUN LOLA RUN tweaks your senses with some metaphysical themes: free will versus determinism, pure chance versus conscious manipulation of events (see Lola's actions in the casino)... In each of Lola's run, she encounters various passers-by and demonstrates that even the most incidental contact can have far-reaching consequences. I really dig the flash-forward sequences as we learn, in quick-hitting snapshots, what befalls those passers-by, dependent on how their run-in with Lola went. Lola gets three do-overs, and each one presents a different outcome for one and all. That butterfly must be getting tired, flapping its wings so much.<br /><br />Artsy yet unpretentious, visually arresting and generating a frenetic energy, RUN LOLA RUN exhilarates. It makes me not resent reading foreign sub-titles. It makes me want to see more of Franka Potente, if only she would do more movies I had heard of. I mean, there's this one and then the Jason Bourne movies. I may have to tune in to her new show on BBC America, COPPER.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (in English) by Franka Petente and director Tom Tykwer<br />- Music Video featuring Franka Petente's vocals<br />- Talent Files - brief bios and selected filmographies for Tom Tykwer, Franka Petente, and Moritz Bleibtreu<br />- Theatrical Trailer for RUN LOLA RUN</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>Two lovers are caught in a bad situation to say the least, Manni (Moritz Blebibtreu) calls his girlfriend Lola (Franka Potente, "Blow") and says he's gonna be killed by a mob boss if he doesn't come up with 100,000 marks very soon (20 minutes in fact). He begs Lola for help and says if she can't help him he's going to rob a supermarket to get the money to save his life. Panicked and frantic Lola takes off running out of her apartment to help Manni, what follows is 3 different showings of Lola's sprint to save Manni by getting this money.<br /><br />Each situation shows how little things can either delay or help someone get somewhere faster, like not tripping over someone on a sidewalk, catching a casino at just the right time to gamble and win said money, so okay its more like just a game of chance and with her boyfriends impending death Lola feels the compulsion to do whatever she can to help. Each showing of her run has little differences to it and the first two don't end well for obvious reason (what need would there be to show the next one if the first or second one ends with everyone happy).<br /><br />Between the pursuits are some drama scenes with Manni and Lola talking that are decent but the film really shines during the running scenes. There's a pulse-pounding German techno soundtrack during most of the movie which does get the adrenaline pumping and I personally enjoyed looking at Franka as she's quite stunning and gives a good performance here (though she would go on to do better movies after this).<br /><br />This flick is a perfect example though of style over substance and the 81 minute running time is just right as any more would've made the experience tiring in my opinion. If it was rated on plot it wouldn't score much above average, but as a fun and fast film its quite entertaining and thats all this movie could've hoped to be. ***1/2 out of 4 stars, simply as a fun experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I watched "Run, Lola, Run" without any real insight on what to expect.  I had gotten the idea that it would probably be of more interest to young adults but I can attest that us older folks can enjoy it too.  I admit that I was initially wondering if I was going to be watching a movie or a cartoon but I got to like the animated version of Lola running down the stairs.  The lifestyles on display leave a lot to be desired but I let myself glide past that once I realized what a multi-facetted movie this is.<br /><br />"Run, Lola, Run" is a movie that shows us a lot of stories within the stories and a lot of alternate scenarios.  If you're one of those "if only" second-guessers, this is your chance to find out "what if".  I liked the variables and I thought that the movie was quite unique in that regard.  I won't give anything away although that, itself, may be misleading.  This film challenges our expectations and, in doing so, might be giving us a glimpse of the future.  I recalled a pavillion at the World's Fair Expo '67 in Montreal.  It was, I believe, the Czech pavillion and they showed a movie that stopped at different points in the film when there was a major development.  There was a "time-out" and the audience was asked to vote for one of several directional options that they were given and the movie proceeded with the requested option.  "Run, Lola, Run" looks like a movie in which the production staff got several chances to vote on their options and decided to include them all.  It works!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>When the film first started, I have to say I was ready to write the film off. I notice a lot of films who use wild filmmaking techniques to cover up the lack of substance in the film. With this it seemed as if anything and everything was used to tell the story for wild, fast-paced editing to animated sequences to split-screen. But whereas Requiem for a Dream also had a myriad of visual tricks to make up for the lack of substance, this film is a rollercoaster and knows it and uses it because it needs it. This was not meant to be some tearjerking drama; it's just good energetic stuff.<br /><br />Manni is in trouble because he lost 100,000 of a mobster's money and he isn't happy and he gives him 20 minutes to find it or else. His girlfriend Lola isn't going to just sit around and has to run all over the place in order to help find it before Manni robs a supermarket. But this 20 minutes is told a couple of times over as possible alternatives. Instead of not knowing what will happen but rather where the same story will branch off into different outcomes.<br /><br />Now I should mention the opening sequence which is as kinetic and obvious MTV influenced than anything. By this time I was thinking "I don't think I'm going to be into this very much". That is until the film jettisoned that idea and it becomes more energetic and it works better. One of my favorite ideas is at times Lola will bump into someone in a scenario and a series of photographs will show you where that person's life will lead with different outcomes. Example: one guy on a bike will crash and meet a woman and get married while in a different scenario he becomes homeless. It's basically kind of like a butterfly effect and it helps the idea of unpredictability and if different actions would bring different outcomes.<br /><br />Acting is spot-on and no better heroine than Franka Potente. Physically fit with big red hair, it's a good main character as anyone but I have one annoyance. At certain times (3, I think) Lola basically screams her head off and shatters glass and it just seemed unnecessary. Yeah we want to win at Roulette but screaming over recommended decibel levels. But other than that, she's as solid with everyone else pulling in respectable performances.<br /><br />Don't mind the 8-year-old-on-a-placebo-kick opening and you'll find a good example to kill an hour and 20 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KROYMQ61M7A.html">A3KROYMQ61M7A</a><br/><p>Get your VHS / DVD copies of this Franke<br />Potente thriller while you can.

The driving force of this movie is choices.  Little choices and big choices can have untold effects on one's life and the lives of others.  That is what this movie is about.<br /><br />To get these ideas across, we meet Lola and her current boyfriend.  They are shady characters in that they are involved in illegal activities.  Lola is the real thinker and the one who maintains control.  Lola is late and the boyfriend gets in trouble.  He gets scared and loses the money he is supposed to deliver to a drug lord.  He has twenty minutes until delivery time.  He turns to Lola.  She has twenty minutes to come up with the money and get to him.<br /><br />Lola runs.  She runs and runs.  Her mind races for solutions even as her feet race across the city.  She interacts with a number of characters.  Some of these are affected by her and we get glimpses of their futures.  There are two pauses in the film where Lola and her boyfriend are discussing important issues.  In the first, Lola asks if he loves her.  In the second he asks what she would do if he dies.  While these at first seem strange ways of dividing the film's three separate sections, they give great insight into the characters.<br /><br />As the film progresses, we also get to see what can happen when some of the choices that were made are changed.  What new paths can occur.  Who get affected.  All in all, it is simply brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I have always tried very hard not to say a movie was awesome, but I feel compelled to say that this German gem from 1999 is as awesome as awesome can be.  I've never seen anything like Run, Lola, Run; it's a film that doesn't sound as if it should really work, yet its presentation is dazzling and mesmerizing.  Franka Potente gives an incredible performance, her talents as visible as her bright pink hair.  There's nothing misleading about the title.  Lola runs and runs some more; Franka Potente could probably have tried out for the German Olympic team after all the running she had to do here.  <p>The strengths of this movie are its unique vision, stunning cinematography, and pulse-pounding soundtrack, but here's a breakdown of the plot.  Lola (Potente) and Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) are in love, and like most couples in love we find the man doing something really stupid and blaming the woman.  Manni does a little work for a mafia-type fellow, and his latest job involves the delivery of one hundred thousand marks to his boss.  Lola was supposed to meet him in town, but she was late, and Manni ended up accidentally (yet still very stupidly) leaving his bag o' cash on a train for a bum to pick up and run off with.  Now he has twenty minutes to come up with one hundred thousand marks before having to face Mr. Big.  Lola was late because her bike was stolen, yet of course the whole mess is her fault, according to Manni.  I'll cut the guy some slack here, though; knowing you are about to be rubbed out tends to put a little stress on the system.  Lola takes off, trying to come up with the money and get it to Manni before the top of the hour.  Lest you think the film cannot last longer than thirty minutes tops, just know that there is something a little bit different about Lola; the old saw &quot;if you don't succeed, try, try again&quot; takes on special meaning with this girl, and the transitions of what might be considered silly by some are handled very, very well.<p>Run, Lola, Run does much to show us how our decisions impact both ourselves and those around us, even strangers, in a big, big way.  The movie provides us with a quick series of revealing snapshots of the future lives of several individuals who cross Lola's path, and it is really quite fascinating to see how these peeks at the future differ under slightly different circumstances.  One may not be able to say that fate is kind or unkind, but she (fate) is certainly capricious.  Irony abounds here, just as in life.  The visual presentation of this film is just stunning, combining all sorts of illustrative elements.  There is an animation sequence that mimics part of Lola's run, split screen shots of two scenes at once, and almost dizzying camera pans that do indeed compare with a lot of the elements of music videos.  The whole movie is also infused with a powerful, beating soundtrack (a significant portion of which is provided by Franka Potente herself) that never allows the viewer to take a breath; there is very little danger of your nodding off while watching this cinematic masterpiece.  Voted the best film by the audience at the Sundance Film Festival of 1999, Run, Lola, Run is a visionary piece of cinematic art that every lover of good movies should see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I see hundreds of movies a year, but somehow, I had managed to miss RUN LOLA RUN until the first week in August, 2005.  YEARS after the film had come out, and years after imitators had their shots at ruining the style (like imitators of PULP FICTION kinda cheapened that whole genre).  Not to fear...this film is a kick of PURE ENERGY!!<br /><br />I felt honest-to-God jazzed watching this movie.  Originality and ENERGY pop off the screen.  Basically, we're watching three little movies...each of the same scenario, but playing out in different ways.  We see how one or two tiny little changes early on can snowball into HUGE changes once the story reaches its end.  Lola has to come up with a HUGE pile of money in 20 minutes flat, or her boyfriend will either be killed by a mobster, or take the foolish step of holding up a grocery store for the cash.  Can she "fix" his problem in time?  That's about the plot...but this summary tells you NOTHING about how this film feels.<br /><br />I'm a 41 year old man.  Not the target audience.  I don't listen to the kind of music played here (techno...for lack of a better word).  I speak some German, but not enough that I didn't have to read the subtitles.  I always look for holes in the plot of films.  I'm always skeptical of "artiness for its own sake."  And yet, while the film is "artful," I thought it was a perfect blending of a filmmaking style with a story-telling intent.  Lola is under a deadline...and everything reminds us of that.  The pulsing, repetitive score...the fast camera work...the color choices...everything.<br /><br />But the best part of all is Franke Potente, the star of the film.  US audiences know her from the "girlfriend" role in BOURNE IDENTITY...and she was the best cast part of the film...she seemed real, smart, sexy, foreign and fully-realized.  In RUN LOLA RUN, she shows why an American director casting a big-budget American film would have gone with her...she's GREAT!  The film spends many minutes focused just on Lola running.  From the side, from head-on...we see her run, run, run.  Red/pink hair sailing wildly behind.  Her face is a masterpiece...at one moment she's got fear, intelligence, determination and exhaustion etched there.  She's very young, and in over her head...but we immediately want her to succeed as much as SHE wants to succeed.  It's a riveting performance in a film full of fun ideas.<br /><br />If I sit back and think about it...I realize that what Lola is running for is to save a criminal boyfriend (who's also stupid and a bit of a whiner), and that performing criminal acts is not beyond her either.  Most of the characters she encounters along her way (especially her father and his mistress), are quite unlikeable too.  From a surface level, we should have NO business getting behind these schmucks.  But Lola's ferocity is an undeniable magnet.  And the film moves WAY too fast to do anything but leave you breathless.<br /><br />It's rated "R," mostly for some strong language, and for some unsavory scenes with the father and mistress.  I don't recommend it by any stretch for kids...but I suggested it to my 17 year old son, and he loved it.  He's showing it to his friends.  It's a COOL movie...simply put.  It deserves all the accolades that have come its way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DWUM6SN3N3NR.html">A3DWUM6SN3N3NR</a><br/><p>A heart racing, pulse surging and foot stomping ride of a movie that is adventurous in its filming and reverberating in its effects.<p>A pleasure to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>This is the second film by the director. His first film although interesting was rather static. This film is full of energy and never stops for a minute. <p>The basis of the plot is fairly simple. The heroine's boyfriend has lost a large amount of money belonging to gangsters. Lola has a very short time to get the money or her boyfriend will be killed in an unpleasant way. She has to run from her flat and work out some scheme to raise the cash. <p>The film intertwines a series of different plots and endings which could have arisen from that one scenario. Each is in its own way amusing although some are grim. <p>As Lola desperately searches for ways to raise the cash there is a grinding techno beat soundtrack which pulsates with energy. Lola herself is played by an actress with total charisma and screen prescence. The only slight negative to the film is that one wonders how she could end up with such a jerk. The film also uses animated sequences and still photography and is quite inovative in style. <p>Not only do Lola and her boyfriend face different fates in each scenario but so do the bit players that they meet. One of the more interesting and dynamic films in years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Run Lola Run' is like `Groundhog Day' on speed, with maybe a hit of `Kill Bill, Vol. 1' in there for good measure.  It follows Lola (Potente) as she races to get 100,000 deutschemarks for her boyfriend Manni (Bleibtreu) who is in debt to a seedy gangster with no patience or mercy.  She has twenty minutes to do so and what makes this film unique is that it is very time conscious.  Tom Tykwer accurately takes twenty minutes (or VERY close to) with each of Lola's attempts to save her boyfriend.<br /><br />Lola's first attempt is to ask her father, a bank manager, for the money.  This goes horribly wrong and Lola is forced to take another route.  She makes a few attempts, and each one explores cause and affect in a strange way, showing the outcomes of everyone involved and all whom Lola interacts with until the film ends unexpectedly.<br /><br />The camera style here is great, fast paced and edgy, and it keeps you glued to the screen until the credits begin to roll.  I was also very impressed with the acting on the parts of the two leads, Franka Potente in particular who embraced her character with pure panic and conveyed a very convincing and realistic portrayal of a woman fighting for the life of her lover.  I haven't seen too many foreign films but after this one I'm surely going to give them a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>RUN LOLA RUN is one of those films that actually delivers what it promises. In this case, a heart-pumping, action-filled flick with an excellent soundtrack, and plenty of artistic weirdness to boot.<br /><br />Clocking in at a mere 80 minutes, this German-made film is infused with a quality normally seen in the cars this country produces. Tom Tykwer wrote the script and directs (as well as contributing his voice and music to several songs/remixes), and gives us a movie that contains more than just artsy material. He takes the viewer on a journey of existentialism thanks to the unusual abilities of its main character, Lola. She's a dye-dipped redhead with a high-pitched, soprano voice that can shatter glass. And she has the ability to change her future. Problem is, though, every time she changes something, everything changes, not just the one thing she wants. So when her boyfriend, Manni, loses 100,000 Deutsche marks that are owed to a local mob boss, Lola has to save him. But she's only got 20 minutes, and everything doesn't go as planned ...the first time. Or the second. Or maybe even the third.<br /><br />Not being very familiar with German cinema, I'd rarely watched anything from this country. But I'd often heard people comment on Run Lola Run and how great it was, so I decided to check it out. And I'm glad I did! The film opens up with a bang and doesn't stop until the final scene. Franka Potente stars as the hair-color-enhanced Lola, and her portrayal is believable, beautiful, and bizarre. In short, a great combination. Her boyfriend, Manni, is played by Moritz Bleibtreu, and his ridiculous behavior is pulled off well, especially when he loses the money and calls Lola in a blubbering panic.<br /><br />I loved, too, the incorporation of overlapping animation, something I enjoyed in the movie THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS.<br /><br />Connections within connections is the main theme here, but one that is brought to life by a vivid script and excellent camera work (the dizzying slow-downs and speed-ups may drive some to distraction but are vital to the story).<br /><br />I mentioned earlier the great soundtrack and that the director contributed his own voice and songs to it. And so did Franka Potente. The European beats mixed with old American titles were laid down in topnotch fashion.<br /><br />This is another foreign film gem, and one that won't take up much of your time. But it's one you'll be glad you visited.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Ever since MTV arrived on the scene back in the early 1980s, the attention span of Americans has dropped like a stone. The mindless superficiality of the programming hasn't helped boost IQ scores, either, but I won't get into that here. MTV's propensity for rapid-fire programming, replete with jump cuts and other fast editing techniques, eventually found a home in the moviemaking business. Unfortunately, the use of these methods became commonplace, often relegating if not downright replacing such tried and true formulas like plot, character development, and dialogue. Throw in a cut every few seconds, the reasoning must have went, and it gives the audience the impression that the action is more immediate and exciting. In more than a few cases these new techniques worked effectively, usually in films that still adhered to the old ideas of centering the film on the characters and the script. The first "Matrix" film comes to mind as an example of a movie that successfully fused the new editing with traditional film practices. Another film that works just as well is "Run Lola Run," a low budget German film written and directed by Tom Tykwer and starring the amazing actress Franka Potente.<br /><br />The plot of "Run Lola Run" is surprisingly simple. Lola (Potente) must find a way to come up with 100,000 deutsche marks in twenty minutes or her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) will have some serious explaining to do. He took a job for a big time crime boss involving the sale of a bunch of stolen cars but accidentally left the money on the train. A bum stumbled over the bag of cash and walked off with it before Manni could stop him. If Lola can't find a way to replace the bag of money, Manni tells her on the telephone, he will go across the street and rob a supermarket. Losing the money is that serious of a matter, apparently. Twenty minutes. With no time to lose, Lola dashes out of her apartment and runs across town to see her banker father, hoping against hope that he will somehow loan her the money. Yeah right. This guy has his own worries involving a female employee and he isn't about to drop everything to help his troublesome daughter. Lola dashes on, but through circumstances beyond her control arrives too late to stop Manni from committing a robbery. Will tragedy ensue because of her tardiness? Will the crime lord arrive on the scene and bust her boyfriend up for his lackluster handling of the assignment?<br /><br />"Run Lola Run" answers these questions in different ways because once Lola arrives at the supermarket, the movie starts over at the point when she hangs up the phone after finding out about Manni's quandary. That's right, we see the same event begin again with a slightly different variation and outcome. Once again, Lola dashes across town to visit her recalcitrant father in order to beg him for a loan. Once again, her father is dealing with his own problems concerning a female employee. But the encounter between father and daughter is slightly changed. So is the ultimate outcome of the eventual Lola/Manni reconciliation. Then the film STARTS AGAIN at the point where Lola hangs up the phone after learning about Manni's predicament. Again, she dashes across town to visit her father in order to seek his assistance with the couple's fiscal problems. And again, her father is dealing with his own issues. And again, many events change from the previous versions. Three separate times Lola dashes across town to save her boyfriend, with the ending of each variation differing significantly from the previous version of events.<br /><br />"Run Lola Run" uses everything from animation to fast editing to a thundering soundtrack in order to create a sense of dire urgency, and it works spectacularly. You'll be sitting on the edge of your seat wondering how Lola will overcome the obstacles in her way, or even if she can overcome them. Tykwer gives the film additional depth by occasionally showing us, through a quick series of still photographs, what happens in the future to various people Lola runs into or passes by on her journey through town. A woman pushing a baby stroller and a lady walking down the hallway in the bank are just two examples of this interesting technique. Obviously, their fate changes in each version. The inclusion of intriguing concepts like this and others highlights the fickle connections between each living person on the planet. We've all thought along these lines before, usually when something disastrous happens and we say something like "If I had only turned left instead of right, I wouldn't have wrecked my car." "Run Lola Run" simply poses this question on a larger scale by showing how an event could change based on one or two minor variations in the actions of a character. If the movie's existential ponderings prove too much for you, you can sit back and enjoy Franka Potente's performance as the grungy, red headed Lola. She's a real hoot, with a voice capable of shattering glass when she screams.<br /><br />Extras on the disc include an informative, fun commentary with Tykwer and Potente, a music video with a brunette Potente singing a song, cast biographies, and trailers for "Run Lola Run," "The Dreamlife of Angels," and "Orlando." There are a few problems with the story, such as the nonsensical scene when the cops refuse to let Manni reenter the train to get his money. Why would they do that? Because the script needs that bag of money out of Manni's hands, that's why. Yet despite a few logical problems, "Run Lola Run" is a heck of a film everyone can enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>filled with fast paced camera work blended together with the racing of Franka Potente's movement. exciting and bloody great. a must see for anyone. one of the best movies of 1999</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>Run Lola Run isn't well served on a small TV screen and its energy is diminished when experienced at home, but this is a truly excellent DVD edition.<p>A small criticism is in the chapter-selection screens.  Though  the division of the film is quite logical, the layout of the pages is quite  bad.  I also couldn't figure out how to turn off the commentary track after  turning it on, forcing me to take out the disc and restart the machine to  restore the original audio.<p>But now to the legions of good points.  The  commentaries by Tom Tykwer and Franka Potente are righteously involving,  both director and star eloquent and affectionate about the film.  (It's  especially amusing to note that they seem reluctant to acknowledge that  they are dating.)  The  technical details Tykwer offers are great for a  deeper understand of the execution, and their anecdotes are fun, well  phrased, and exciting.  Thumbs up to the commentary tracks.  There are also  biographies on each, subtitle options, and the picture quality is good  though, again, if you missed this in the theatres, you didn't quite get the  full impact of this movie.<p>Run Lola Run was an enjoyable experience for  me at the theatre and, much to my surprise, has grown on me since.  Potente's lead performance is Oscar-worthy, emotional at just the right  moments and comic and spunky at others.  Moritz Bleibtreu is wonderful as  the bumbling Manny, and the script is a great innovation.  The music-video  stylings sometimes detract from the story, but as a whole, it's like a  whole new way of seeing the world and, technical innovations aside, the  movie is fun, comedically superb, and involving on a human level, a rarity  for such a technically oriented film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the DVD edition of "Run Lola Run" (or "Lola Rennt")....<br /><br />I had been meaning to view this film for quite some time. I had heard many good things about it, but kept putting it off. From what I knew of the story,about a girl only having so much time to save her boyfriends life, I was expecting something more like the Johnny Depp film "The Nick Of Time". So when I finally got around to it...wow..was I surprised and delighted by this cinematic treat.(and I was mad at myself for not watching it before this!)It's one of those you want to watch again immediately.<br /><br />The film is heart pumping, creative, innovative and fresh. The story will have you thinking about it for quite sometime. Our heroine Lola, finds herself with only 20 minutes to save Manni's life. It seems he has accidentally lost a huge some of money and the men it belongs to are not exactly the forgiving kind. He frantically calls Lola, as she is the one with the ideas.Lola immediately goes into action to try to prevent the horrors of what will happen if Manni doesn't come up with the money. So right from the start we are intrigued to see if she will pull it off.<br /><br />The film doesn't stop here though, it's just beginning. In 20 minutes, many things can happen to alter the course of a life. 'What if's' are the question here. What if that car was just a little slower, or what if a conversation went just a little differently? These are little things that can make big differences when it counts. It's a roller coaster of a ride, as we watch, and cheer for Lola,as she attempts to change the fates.<br /><br />The photography of this film is exceptional. Imagine trying to keep up with a running person all the time, and still coming up with incredible shot after shot. The music is fabulous and very much a part of the story.Franka Potente(Barbara from "Blow")is wonderful in her performance of Lola. Directed by Tom Tykwer, this German film is a must see for anyone who loves foreign films or just fine filmmaking.<br /><br />The DVD is presented in German(DD5.1 or Stereo Surround), with English or French subtitles. It may also be viewed in English(also DD5.1 and 2.0) if you prefer. There's a music video and commentary by both the Director and Potente that may be viewed during the film. It may be viewed in either the original theatrical widescreen aspect ratio or a full screen version. I highly recommend the widescreen that takes in all the great photography.<br /><br />Don't miss this exhilarting ride...go for it...Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UYX4S6">Winter Kills</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGYR0E">Luzhin Defence (Full Screen Version)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00079HZQ6">Blind Horizon</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>I liked it.

He will be killed by his gangster bosses in twenty minutes if he doesn't come up with one hundred thousand deutsche marks, the amount he lost in a botched money transfer. So Lola runs, literally, into the streets of Germany, hoping to find means to the money in twenty minute's time.<br /><br />Lola is sweet, worldly and young and so is her boyfriend. They need be, to gain our sympathy against the common but evil financier status quo of Europe. Their attempt to beat the clock against an impossible task, is the one and only subject matter of the film. The story, or idea, is told in a fast paced, rock video style narrative, part light humor, part sharp suspense, with lightning strike synonymous time frames of the same characters and situations, projecting Lola's stressed mental state of adrenaline rushed physical endurance and high powered decision making.<br /><br />By the time Lola starts out on her third attempt to save the day, (it's the charmer), you might begin to wonder  how the film will pull itself out of it's self-imposed infinity, as it flails deep into a hole of pretense tempting filmmaking and already dated Euro-trash musical score. But it does, as happily as an adult, lust rewarding fairy tale. While we view a detailed visual feast of a gothic German metropolis as backdrop,  it is the sight of the shapely, but not particularly athletic Lola running that captures our attention. Indeed, there is a lady or a tiger at the end of this road, or in this case, a pot o' eurodollars or certain death. Like a modern day 'Diana and the Golden Apples', our heroine radiates stamina and endurance and beauty as she runs down yet another crooked path. So run, Lola, run.

The money belongs to a gangster who will kill Manni if he doesn't get the cash.<br /><br />There are three different scenarios on Lola's mad dash to rescue her boyfriend.

It got a little too far out with the very brief moments she brushed by people. But the main parts of the story was good.<br /><br />Well, great idea for a script. Just needed a little tweaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>For me, this movie got off on the wrong foot when it posed a question and left us hanging for the answer.  It basically asked us what the one question in life is, and what that answer is, then suggested that both the question and answer were obvious, and left it there without providing its answers.  I could have done without that bit of annoying stupidity.<br /><br />The annoyance factor from that nonsense was strong enough to detract from my enjoyment of the next few minutes of colorful cartoons.<br /><br />To my surprise, the movie got better.  After a dismal beginning it became absorbing.<br /><br />The main characters are Lola (young German girl with vivid red hair), her worthless, immature and moronic boyfriend Manni (who you hope will die), and her rich and philandering father.  You kind of root for Lola to achieve her goal of saving her boyfriend from execution, but then again, you'd kind of like to kill her boyfriend yourself.<br /><br />Manni was entrusted with a wonderful opportunity in life, the opportunity to complete a drug deal and give the proceeds to the boss.  This will help him climb the ladder of success in crime.  What an enterprising young man.  He does complete the deal, but then he stupidly leaves the fortune on a train because he sees some cops entering the train and he stupidly just gets up from his seat, without the money bag, and leaves.  Dumb bunny.<br /><br />He then telephones Lola and whines and panics to her.  She swears she will help him.  His solution is to rob a supermarket and get the money that way, to avoid being executed for not producing the drug money.  He gives her a narrow time frame to show up and help him, because he is on a narrow time schedule himself, due to meet up with the drug boss.<br /><br />That is the background of the film.  Lola wants to get the money from her father, but that doesn't work.  Her attempts to help the witless and extremely annoying Manni do not succeed, and we have a sad ending for our two heroes.<br /><br />Next thing you know, the happy couple is in bed together, and alive.  None of this happened.  Was it all a dream?  Lola is asking questions about Manni's love for her.  They are idiotic questions, but he is patient with them.<br /><br />Presto.  The scene starts to play out again.  Lola has another chance to help her idiot boyfriend out of the same jam.  This time she does it a little differently and the outcome is also different, but still not very satisfying if you are actually rooting for Manni, which I was not.<br /><br />Once again, the happy couple are alive and well, despite the ending to episode two, and they are in bed having another philosophical discussion.  This time it is Manni with the questions.  Guess what.  The scene is redone for us.  Take three.  Can Lola make things work this time?<br /><br />Other reviews on this site say that we are shown "cause and effect" based on different strategies and decisions that Lola makes.  No we're not.  We're just shown different stories.  It's a little like the tv series Quantum Leap, if you remember that one.  There was more cause and effect in Quantum Leap than there is here.  In Run Lola Run, freak accident or dumb luck determine the outcome as much as any cause and effect.<br /><br />The fact that the third outcome is happier for the dubious couple than the first two outcomes seems to be telling us that Lola finally got it right, but if you use even half your brain you will realize that some very improbable things were happening all along and this is just a fantasy with no moral, no cause and effect, just an interesting story.<br /><br />So, what is that one question that everything boils down to, and what is its answer?  The question seems to be, umm, that life gives you the opportunity to interact with your environment, and it's up to you how it all comes out.  Maybe not.  I don't know what the hell the question and answer are, that are supposed to be so obvious that they don't even have to be told to us.<br /><br />In the end, the script writer needs to get hit over the head with a frying pan for that idiocy at the beginning, and Manni needs to be whipped with a wet noodle to knock some sense into him.  I'm sure that torturing him appropriately would help his maturity and character development.<br /><br />This is the only movie I can think of where the idealized happy ending would include the successful completion of an illegal drug deal, followed by a warm pat on the back given by the drug dealer to his brain dead protege.<br /><br />Lola is actually playing Manni's mommy.  Manni is a crying, whining, stupid baby getting himself into a jam and then putting it all on mommy to fix, and demanding that she fix it within a specified very limited time frame, and she has to run to do so, to save her idiot baby, and he petulantly blames her if she doesn't perform the miracle, or at least show up, in the allotted time.  Being stupid and amoral, Manni is a waste of skin and bone.  But mommy helps him and loves him anyway.  That's what mommies are for.<br /><br />Oh, and if there is a cause and effect to this movie, the moral would be that you need to ask a higher power for help, and you need to not rob supermarkets. Gamble instead.  Get lucky instead, one way or another.  The moral is - get lucky!  Don't you know that if you just ask the heavens for help you will win the lottery?  But if you try to rob a supermarket you will not be happy.  Thank you for that wonderful bit of philosophy.  Very deep.  At least an inch and a quarter deep.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>This pic reminds me a bit of Amelie, but much better.

And I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Basically, this is just a "one-idea-film" that would have made a GREAT short feature. Instead, they stretched it into a feature film.<br /><br />And it is all offensively idiotic.<br /><br />1 - Lola is at home. Her boyfriend calls her and explains his problem: he forgot some gangster's money on the subway... and some homeless guy found it.<br /><br />This gives birth to one of the most uninspired explanation scenes in movie History. Who's the bad guy, what was the money for, what will happen if he does not get it back, etc... one stupid phone call that lasts forever with Lola and her dumb boyfriend talking... and talking... and talking...<br /><br />Halfway through their ridiculous conversation, I'm already thinking: "this guy is sooo stupid and incompetent that I DO WANT him to get killed! I hope Lola gives him the boot!"<br /><br />But she doesn't. Instead, when he says something idiot like "help me or I'll just rob the supermarket close to this phone booth" (to which I'd simply reply "do it, you stupid punk. Then drop dead!") she just says "I'll be there in twenty minutes and I'll think of something. Don't do anything stupid!" - like if that wasn't the rule so far... LOL<br /><br />Then I started thinking: "Wow, I can't wait to find out what will she do in order to get the money. I hope she'll do something brilliant".<br /><br />And what does she do? She runs aaaaallllll the way from home to the bank where her dad works. Exactly: the "running" you see on the title is to daddy!!!<br /><br />Hello!! Can't we be brilliant and creative?<br />No.<br /><br />Daddy (by far the most fascinating character in this film) gives her the boot (hurray!). And she does not get the money. When she meets her stupid boyfriend, the moron is already robbing the supermarket. She helps him and (guess what?!?!?) she gets killed by the police on the way out.<br /><br />What follows next is (we go back in time) a long and boring bed scene (put there to make some time - so this can be a feature film) where the two lovers are talking... and talking... and talking... for almost 8 minutes things like "do you love me?" "Yes" "How much?" "A lot" "Are you sure?" "I guess so" "So you are not sure?" "I am" "what would you do if I'd die?" "I don't know"... -things like that.<br /><br />...No wonder why teenagers love this. This is bad teenager screenwriting.<br /><br />And then we see two variations of the same story:<br /><br />B) Lola goes to dad and ends up robbing the bank. She gets the money, but this time it is her boyfriend who gets killed (hit by an ambulance).<br /><br />C)Lola goes to the bank but takes a while longer to get there. Does not find dad and goes to a casino (A CASINO!!!!) that just happens to be there where she gambles some change money and wins all the money she needs... -talk about deus-ex-machina.<br /><br />Is this supposed to be a masterpiece?<br />Would someone please explain to me, like if I were a four-year-old child, why is this film so praised.<br /><br />I do not get it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>This film from German director Twyker is a real treat.  In it we follow Lola try to raise 100,000 marks for her boyfriend Manni to pay back some gangsters, the only catch being that she has to do this in only twenty minutes!  And so the audience is treated to three different ways in which Lola gets the money.<p>This film has several things going for it - a pulse-pounding techno soundtrack (with Franka Potente who plays Lola on vocals), stunning visuals and a fast story that you really get caught up in.  All of this makes for a very flashy movie that will completely draw you in.  However, what gives it that extra twist is the way in which the movie shows that the slightest thing can set the course of our future, demonstrated by snapshots of people that Lola meets in her travels through their lives.  Plus there's some extraordinary acting from the two main characters that makes you really care for their plight.<p>What's also different is the fact that the movie manages to be sad, funny and gripping.  And film that can achieve that has to be recognised.  There are also some highly interesting scenes in between each story in which the young couple discuss love, the future and other such topics.  It's little wonder that this was so highly acclaimed, and is likely to become a cult classic in years to come.</p></br></body></html>

However, I must also give the remake credit. Unlike boring remakes like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (why did they even bother), The Fog eschews the blood and guts and goes in for plot and character, much like Carpenter's original. Yep, there's some bloodletting, but there is also a gothic love story that is quite interesting. And, for once, Tom Welling (Smallville), who is totally cute, is playing his own age. Just get out the popcorn and enjoy it. The Fog is old-fashioned horror with special effects that rock.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This would have been 1 star save for a few nice special effects.  I can't think of a single thing they improved upon from the original.  Most everything is much worse.  The story has been altered and most of the bite has been taken out.  The director goes for a few jump scenes, rather than making the entire movie creepy ala the Carpenter version.  The original ending was so good and dark.  This one ends with a whimper that makes no sense.  As for this being unrated, it is still a PG-13 cut.  No nudity, little swearing, and very little blood.  Stay away.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>Keep in mind while reading this, I've never seen the original "The Fog" by John Carpenter.  So I'm reviewing it from that perspective.<br /><br />There was a lot of potential I could see in this movie.  However, very little of it was delivered.  The characters were very thinly developed and the story was just plain silly and bad.  The acting by most of the people was very unconvincing.  But what do you expect from a horror flick?  In the end it really wasn't scary at all and opportunities they had to make it truly scary they passed over.  Maybe this was to prevent it from getting an R rating, which finacially is probably a better move in this day and age.<br /><br />But I will give it thumbs up on the special effects.  There was some pretty amazing stuff that I'm sure the original could not even come close to copying.<br /><br />Unless you are a horror or special effect nut, I wouldn't bother with this movie.  Otherwise, go at it but don't expect much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>I was looking forward to this remake of The Fog.After all, no John Carpenter film could be bad could it? Well, this one was. I saw the unrated version thinking this will be scary. That is not the case in this movie. It is quite boring at times and a let down from the original. By the end of the movie, you are sick of seeing so much fog, which actually looked like smoke to me. I think the only reason this film might be popular as a rental is the fact that Tom Welling from the show Smallville is one of the main characters in this film. There were a couple of scenes that made me say "cool" but other than that, this remake needs to be remade! I'd suggest renting...... not buying this movie if you are curious.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Watched The Fog last night. It was John Carpenter remaking his own movie for todays audience. I hadn't seen the old one in so long I can't remember much about it except the basic plot premice of curse, fog, ghosts, ship, scream, kill, scream. The new one is about the same if you go by my description of my memory of the first one. Selma Blair is just a really bad actress. She is monotone and has no charisma and delivers her lines like she is zonked on prozac or something. The Smallville guy is the main hero and he isn't very good either. The rest of the cast is pretty blah too. This is a straight forward ghost story, no gore and little effects. In some ways that is refreshing cause I don't think a horror movie has to be all blood and guts and shock. But this movie just isn't that great. Its worth watching but not great... not sure its really good either though. Rent it before you think about buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I never thought that much of John Carpenter's original version of "The Fog," but I have to admit that I think better of it now that I have endured this 2005 remake by Rupert Wainwright ("Stigmata").  At least with that one there are fond memories of John Houseman as an old sea dog with a story to tell and Adrienne Barbeau as the DJ in the lighthouse.  Now we have Tom Welling from "Smallville" with a three days growth of beard as fisherman Nick Castle and Maggie Grace from "Lost" as his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams who gets back in town just in time for the fun with the fog.  At first she is the requisite damsel in distress, but then that part takes a twist.  Anyhow, they are the ones that things happen to outside the lighthouse as people are dying in horrible ways while Selma Blair as Stevie Wayne is doing her DJ thing while the fog rolls in and frets about what can happen to her son on a night like this.<br /><br />One complaint I want to make right away is that the fog in "The Fog" rolls in too quickly, which seems a strange comment to make for a film that seems overlong at 103 minutes (including three that makes this the "unrated edition," a label whose cache value is next to nil given what has been foisted on us to date).  Slower would be more ominous, but apparently that is not what Wainwright wanted in this movie, even in the parts that demand some ominosity (or would it be "ominousness"?).  Here the fog comes in fast and it comes in against the wind, so it cannot be a good thing.  But if the titular weather condition is not as creepy as you can imagine it being, that is not a good sign, whatever the instrument readings might be.<br /><br />This is one of those films where once upon a time, a long time ago, some people did something bad and now years later the people living there are going to have to pay for what those other people did.  We get a taste of what the founders of Antonio Bay did at the start of the movie, but you have to wait for the climax to get the rest of the story and understand, so to speak, what is now happening.  But I was sort of distracted by the idea of who was the catalyst for all this nonsense since it seemed such a chance occurrence to set everything in motion even with Cooper Layne's screenplay helping things along.<br /><br />I was bored to the point of distraction for most of this film, even as the body count climbed.  When we got to the twist at the end it barely registered (usually I would be thinking of how it could have worked better, but I just did not care).  I would be worried for Welling's film career but I saw the 100th episode of "Smallville" last night and "Reckoning" will certainly stand out on his resume more than this film.  If everybody else forgets about it, then he can too.  Final thought: This version of "The Fog" also made me think more highly of "La Noche del terror ciego" and the rest of Amando de Ossorio's "Blind Dead" movies.  At least they understood the idea of horror as something slow and creeping. Oh oh.  Now it strikes me that "Pirates of the Caribbean" was a better horror film than this version of "The Fog."</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>I love the original The Fog.  John Carpenter is one of the best horror directors of all time.  And really, who better to helm a remake of one of Carpenter's films than Rupert Wainwright, the director of MC Hammer videos and the classic film Blank Check.  Man, Hollywood sure does know what its doing with horror films these days.<br /><br />Here's the basic plot: the town of Antonio Bay, Oregon is a peaceful little town, with Selma Blair as the DJ of the town's only radio station.  I'm immediately interested.  So over the course of a couple nights, a big fog cloud rolls into the town, and with it come spirits of ghosts from sea.  The back story behind the fog isn't all that terrible, but it is executed very poorly.  The main characters are useless tools, that we care nothing about.  In fact, we aren't even told what their relationship really is, just that Elizabeth left 6 months ago, and is ready and willing to sleep with Nick on her first night back in town.  Someone cue the fog cloud of death.<br /><br />I can't live with myself as a human being and recommend this film to anyone.  Watch at your own risk.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Of all the many horror remakes over the last few years, I think 2005's "The Fog" may have actually surpassed its source film by the farthest margin.  No disrespect at all to the 1979 original, but this new version is scarier, sexier, made with much higher production values, and in my opinion just plain better.  The characters felt more real to me and more relateable, the tale of the origin of the prescences that are haunting Antonio Bay - which was well-done the first time around - was something I just felt a lot more here and made the whole package more potent.  And the Fog itself, for the first time, actually Looks like what they were apparantly aiming for all along - frightening; a thing that could actually be alive; an actual character in the film instead of just a harbinger of something else.<br /><br />  Near the anniversary of the long-ago founding of Antonio Bay, something is rising from the bottom of the sea, or Returning from it.  Something old, powerful, and vengeful, and something that's going to - over the next few days - catch up not just a few people but the entire population of the island in its violent and mysterious path.  The fog effects are incredibly well done, genuinely scary, and the cinematography throughout the whole movie is outstanding.  One of the few flaws of the movie is that a couple of the characters behave in rather unadvisable manners given the circumstances; fortunately the general likability of most of the characters keeps the occasional lack of brightness from being too glaring a shortcoming.  Or chalk it all up to a hitheto unseen aspect of the fog that lulls those who come into contact with it into a subtly dreamlike state where they abandon their wits temporarily.  Actually, come to think of it, that fits in pretty well with a couple of the scenes in question; maybe it's what the filmmakers were going for all along.<br /><br />  A powerful and unexpected twist ending helps wrap things up in grand fashion.  The trailers for "The Fog" looked good, but the movie itself went way above my expectations.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>Truly, this is the worst film I've seen so far in 2006. And I've seen some stinkers.<br /><br />So, basically, "The Fog" stars a whole bunch of "That-Guy-Looks-Familiar" C-List Television Actors (Oh! And Selma Blair, too...) in a whole bunch of "This-Scene-Feels-Familiar" situations. A nasty pea-souper of a fog, containing 100% of a small town's Recommended Daily Allowance of Vengeful Ghosts, threatens one night to destroy the small island community of Generic, and it's up to Buff White Male Hero Under Thirty to try and save his loved ones from a fate worse than... ...having to star in this movie.<br /><br />If I sound sarcastic, it's because I have every right to be: moronic dialogue, confusing and plodding editing and totally bland, insipid performances by all the cast members make this remake of "The Fog" a real slap in the face for those of us foolish enough to watch it. Nothing feels genuine and nothing gels together to create a sense of plausible fear: we've seen all of this before, and, in most cases, done far better. Small coastal towns are a great setting for eerie, chilling tales - 'Dolores Claiborne', 'Treasure Island', 'The Wicker Man', and many others, including  the original version of this movie prove that point - but in the case of this remake, the setting, as with pretty much all elements of the movie, seems to provide a merely perfunctory backdrop for the mundanest of mundane special effects, and the cheapest of cheap shocks.<br /><br />If this miserably inept 'effort' is where Hollywood intends to take the Horror genre, then it's high time to quit. I, for one, am sick to the back teeth of having my intelligence insulted by lazy, pointless film-making.<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Lame pun I know. But it's a valid question, and it's one that's hard to answer without mentioning all the bad things about it. Horror movies tend to come in trends, similar to music. In the 70's we had psychological horror, 80's we had slasher films like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. 90's we get teen slashers like Scream and Urban Legend. Now we have 2 trends: the remakes of old films such as this and Ring or The Grudge and outright gory films like the Saw films and Hostel. So in a way, the horror genre didn't need this remake, it was just more convenient.<br /><br />The film centers around an Oregon community that had a dark past.  The founding fathers are having an anniversary of sorts and people are celebrating birth of their town. Only this immense blanket of fog is right outside their island and wants to creep people out. So people die, people get spooked and plot holes fit for trains fly by all the while we're going "um, this is a horror movie right?"<br /><br />On an episode of Family Guy, Brian is explaining the plot of Blair Witch Project to a blind guy and saying "nothing's happening" a lot and "something about a map".  Well there's no map here but you can pretty much say "nothing's happening....more fog, nothing's happening". That's kind of the problem with this film: it's kinda boring. There's no sense of dread for the characters so if they're in trouble, we kind of go listless.<br /><br />Another trend happening a lot lately is the reliance on CG effects. While many of these fog shots and such could obviously not be CG, the ever-growing trend of using CG and a bit poor CG at that isn't very appealing. I especially love the special feature on them: "we wanted to give them personality so you got angry fog, sneaky fog". It's like guys? It's just fog, it doesn't NEED a personality. Of course it has more personality than the actors but that's not their fault.<br /><br />One hard thing for an actor to shake is when we see them outside a signature role. So when TV's Tom Welling starts driving, we start going "can't Superman fly? And since when did Shannon from Lost go from one island to another?" It's not their fault and they try to at least give a performance but it's usually director's fault too. It's kinda sad to say attractive likable stars look so wooden.<br /><br />Here's hoping we go back to films like the Shining, Rosemary's Baby or Night of the Living Dead and freak out people because of remakes like the Grudge, the Fog or outright gory films like Hostel are an indication, we're going to suffer through more crap, and that fogging sucks.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This re-make begins lamely. Its cast of characters includes the usual modern angry young people who curse gratuitously at each other. Most of the men are out for some crude T&A; most of the women are cardboard cut-outs.<br /><br />The movie is poorly edited. I wouldn't have fully understood the reason for the haunting in this version of The Fog if I hadn't first read the blurb on the DVD cover. Too many scenes were cut out or spliced into the action too late to make sense. Director Rupert Wainwright does refer to some of the differences between the original cut and the theatrical release of this film. In his commentary, he talks about the concessions that had to be made "to the Studio" to satisfy budgetary constraints and to speed up the action of the film to hold audience attention. I hadn't realized that the studios still had so much say in film content. I thought that kind of power went out with Sam Goldwyn. All this information, along with a lot of insights into the problems connected with shooting scenes in roiling waters, does make for a better-than-average DVD Director Commentary.<br /><br />But there remain other problems with the film itself. One of these is logic. A hash of re-animation goes on here. And it's not always clear why one character becomes re-animated, while another stays dead.<br /><br />I almost had decided this movie was a waste of time and was ready to quite it mid-way through, something my penurious nature rarely allows me to do. (I paid for this thing and by golly, I'm going to see everything there is to see!) But I hung in there, and I'm glad I did. The movie gets better as it goes along. It is saved by a number of striking visuals. There is a death-by-splinters-of-glass scene that is almost beautiful by virtue of the choreographing of the glass. There are striking, Wyeth-like tableaus of the old man on the misty beach - the strange setting he sees there - the image of him being drawn inexorably into the water. Then the haunting that ultimately comes fully manifest out of the fog has real virile power. I don't think you will soon forget its final embrace.<br /><br />So this fog bank is worth peering into. Still, it left me waiting on the beach, scanning, hoping for the return of Adrienne Barbeau.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>It was really really really really SIMPLE & TYPICAL...</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>STAY AWAY!!

The original Fog, which starred Adrianne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, and Hal Holbrook, failed at the box office but was regarded as a cult classic and one of Carpenter's best thanks to the ultra eerie atmosphere and sense of dread.  This remake, directed by Stigmata director Rupert Wainwright, is not only beyond bad, it's abysmal.  The eerie atmosphere and sense of dread are replaced with attractive stars (Smallville's Tom Welling and Lost's Maggie Grace, along with Selma Blair in Barbeau's role) to go with an incomprehensible storyline that has little to do with that of the original, and an ending that isn't just mind boggling and non-sensical, it's just plain ridiculous.  I never thought that a cult classic like Carpenter's original Fog would ever be remade as a PG-13 crud-fest like this, but I shouldn't be surprised at all these days.  All in all, if you're a fan of the original film, then you already know to avoid this like the plague, because no matter how "Unrated" it can be, it can't come close to being scary or as good as the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>I've since come to accept Hollywood's re-cycling tendencies, whether it's schlepping out remake after stinking remake, or turning any halfway decent 1970s television series in to a big budget flops no one wants to see.  I've consigned myself to the notion that originality really isn't a viable commodity in tinsletown, and hasn't been for a while.  Despite this understanding, I still find myself resentful when someone takes an extremely solid past production, dissembles it,  forgets how to put it back together, slaps  a `hip', MTV spin on it, ultimately turning it into a barely watchable, incoherent exercise of ineptitude as was done with The Fog (2005), a remake of a John Carpenter film release some 25 years earlier.  This new version, written by Cooper Layne (The Core), and directed by Rupert Wainwright (Stigmata), stars Tom Welling ("Smallville"), Maggie Grace ("Lost"), and Selma Blair (Storytelling, Legally Blonde, Hellboy).  Also appearing is DeRay Davis (Barbershop, Scary Movie 4), Kenneth Welsh (The Day After Tomorrow, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), Adrian Hough (In the Land of Women), Sara Botsford (Tremors 4: The Legend Begins), and Rade Serbedzija (The Saint, Mission: Impossible II), whom I best remember as the character Boris 'The Blade', from the film Snatch (2000).<br /><br />As the movie opens we're on an old timey sailing ship (a clipper), and a fire breaks out, as an lamp full of oil is dropped.  Amongst the flaming mayhem, four men escape via a rowboat, but not all make it to shore...fast forward to the present (I'm pretty sure it's the present, given the lousy rock music) and we meet various inhabitants of Antonio Island, which, by the way, is gearing up for some sort of founder's day celebration.  There's hunky charter boat captain Nick Castle (Welling) and his extremely annoying partner Spooner (Davis), local radio DJ Stevie Wayne (Blair), who operates out of the local lighthouse, and Elizabeth Williams (Grace), who's just recently returned to town under the guise of 19th century male street urchin,  which, seems to appeal to Nick as he picks her up hitchhiking and takes her to his place for a little vertical boogie in the shower (apparently the two have a past history, or else she's just really easy).  We're about thirty minutes into the movie now and I'm wondering when the actual story is going to begin...so far we've seen a series of minor events, but nothing really conclusive...we did get to see both female leads in their underwear, for what its worth, Grace sporting an attractive light blue ensemble, while Blair favors black (you know what they say about women and black underwear...I'd be all over that if she didn't have a kid almost as old she is) ...eventually the fog does come rolling in with whatever bad vibes it contains, and we learn the founding fathers, all of whom the main characters are descendants, did something really bad a long time ago, something to which now the ghosts of the past are coming up from their watery graves threatening `Blood for blood', which was odd to me because there was no blood whatsoever in the entire film...oh well.<br /><br />All right, I think it's important for me to preface this by stating I'm a big fan of the original film, so I was a wary, but optimistic, when I heard a remake was in the works.  I didn't think it would be as good as the original, but then also I didn't think it would suck eggs as much or thoroughly as it did...Rupert Wainwright, the director, who got his start making music videos for such artists as M.C. Hammer and N.W.A. and writer Cooper Layne, whose only other main film credit is for the insufferable science fiction disaster film (meaning it was a disaster of a film) The Core (2003), which he wrote and produced (had I known Layne was involved, I would have passed this feature by), show how to take a decent, spooky little film, made a quarter of a century ago, and wrench all the goodness out of it, leaving behind a celluloid husk of flotsam that ran eleven minutes longer than the original, but featured less, actual story.  Seriously, the only thing missing from this non-frightening ghost story was Scooby Doo and the gang.  It's pretty sad when the most interesting character in the movie is the special effects, in this case, the fog, as the real characters were so vacuous, transparent, and without distinction as to barely even register on the screen, much less make me concerned for their well being (I only assumed who the main characters were based on their extensive screen time, and not due to any perception of importance to the story).  The direction, in general, features a lot of strong shots, but in terms of tying them all together, Wainwright didn't do so hot, as the various scenes felt slapped together with little, or no regard, for transition.  As far as the plot goes, there were many holes, some small, some quite large, but none worth mentioning given the overall lack of cohesion in the story.  The one aspect that really made me nuts was the character of Spooner, the homeboy fisherman, who had what I consider to be the absolute worst line in the film as he's talking to Welling's character about women and relationships...'Women have testicle telepathy, man.'  What an idiotic, meaningless statement, obviously written by someone of an older generation thinking he has a handle on how the cool, hipper, younger generation speaks, but doesn't...hey, I don't either, but I don't delude myself into thinking I do...anyway, back to Spooner...why, oh why, was this character allowed to survive?  If anyone warranted a gruesome, miserable, painful death, it was he.  At one point he appeared to have been killed, which wasn't very satisfying as it could have been specifically because we didn't witness his demise (it was inferred), but I was partially satiated given the knowledge we wouldn't have to suffer anymore of his idiotic buffoonery.  But in a cruel licorice, twist of fate  the movie gods, being the fickle lot they are, saw fit to save this tool of a character (in a completely ridiculous manner), perhaps out of pure spite, I do not know, but to be cheated out of the meager satisfaction resultant of the death of this worthless, irritating and completely pointless secondary character was the supreme letdown...or, at least I thought so, until we got to the end of the movie...what in the hell was that about?  I'm not going to give it away, but it just seemed to me not to make much sense, especially given the vengeful nature of the spirits.  The special effects were decent (I prefer the low tech effects from the original film over the CGI work here), along with the original scoring, but neither came remotely close to making up for what was lacking, which was just about everything else.<br /><br />The picture, presented here in widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1), does look sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through very clearly.  There are some extras included, the main being a commentary by track Rupert Wainwright, who, I got the impression, didn't care for the finished product very much (join the club).  Also included are three pointless featurettes (I love the one with the cast interviews, as they all gush about each other and talk about how great the others are to work with...I guess sincerity, along with originality, are not popular traits in the movie biz).  Also thrown in are seven deleted scenes, with optional director's commentary, and a whole slew of previews for unrelated films like The Da Vinci Code (2006), Underworld Evolution (2006), The Legend of Zorro (2005), Memoirs of a Geisha (2005), The Pink Panther (2006), Monster House (2006), Rent (2005), Zathura (2005), Underworld Deluxe Edition DVD, The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005), and The Cave (2005).<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, there is a saying which has served me well over the years, one which I think applies here...if it ain't broke, don't fix it...</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>If their goal in 2005 was to remake a decent, creepy ghost movie from 1980 and make it incredibly boring and stupid, then they have a huge success here.<br />Granted, John Carpenter's "The Fog" (the original) may not be as good as Robert Wise's "The Haunting" (1963) or Alejandro Amenabar's "The Others" (2001)... but I like it. It's a fun film to watch because it works. The story/screenplay, the music, and the performances seem to blend well and create a fun macabre movie.<br /><br />The creators of Halloween (1978) needed to follow up that project with something else, and they chose a more traditional and gothic tale of supernatural horror. They could have gone the 'teens stalked by slasher' route again. It's good that they didn't. (Of course they would do that again in the Halloween sequel. With the success of the first movie who could blame them?)<br /><br />This version of The Fog is not fun like the original, nor is it in any way truly scary... even though it is obvious that the director and screenwriter probably felt that they made a frightening flick. Well, they didn't. They use all the typical, tried-and-false methods that we expect from horror films. Give us something unexpected instead of this nonsense! Life is brief and I am tired of wasting time on shoddy movies that stink.<br /><br />And they altered the story significantly, for the worse. Why tamper with something that was fine?<br />At least the original film had an atmosphere of impending dread and creepiness (and a very effective score by Mr. Carpenter). But Hollywood cannot leave well enough alone. Sometimes I think that there ought to be a law against remakes. Rarely does this concept succeed.<br /><br />So if you have watched every other film ever created, and if have run out of good books to read, and if you have nothing whatsoever else to do, then you might consider watching this dreck that came up from the bottom of the sea. Chances are when it's over you will want to watch the original film and see an enjoyable and chilling ghost tale unfold.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>As a huge fan of the first Fog and also a huge fan of John Carpenter (I even like his bad movies, I loved Ghosts Of Mars and Vampires, even Prince Of Darkness was cool, sorry) I was a bit worried when I found he was 'retooling' his original, but much to my surprise, it was not that bad. In fact, if I compare the two, this one had a couple of things going for it more then the first one did. The fist thing would be that this one goes much deeper and detailed about the history of Antonio Bay and the lepers and the founding fathers who supposedly 'saved' the town and how they did it. The first one rarely made any references to this, and now that I think about it, didn't have any flashbacks at all, which are not always great for movies, but I think with this story, they were necesary. The flashbacks are rich in detail, very well presented down to the wardrobe and even the lingo. John Carpenter has always had a gift for elaborate sets and visuals and he more then continues that here. The second thing better about this Fog has got to be the special effects, they are very impressive. The fog itself is very creepy, and the ghosts and the ship are very scary and authentic.<br /><br />It does take the movie a while to get going, the first 30 minutes  are kinda slow, but once it gets going, your interest will definitely pick up. There is also some really cool death scenes and some pretty good suspense in some of the deeper fog scenes. I'd also like to give this movie some credit, you'd think with a theme like fog, some of the picture and scenery would be hard to see, the fist movie did have some problems with that, but not this one. You can see every scene shot in the fog clearly, not missing anything due to grain or too much fog.<br /><br />Sounds like I really liked it huh? well, it ain't all perfect people. The acting is pretty average, with a cast nobody would really know except for Selma Blair and if you watched alot of regular TV, which I don't, TV sucks. Tom Welling from WB's or UPN's (whats the difference) Tv show Smallville plays our main character/hero Nick. He is a pretty boy but a rather bland actor, and his girlfriend is played by Maggie Grace, from that show everyone can't live without, Lost. She suffers from the same problem Tom does, pretty to look at until she opens her mouth. Selma Blair does the only decent acting in the movie and though she is a main character, she is completely lost in the shuffle during the climax of the movie. Selma plays Stevie Wayne, the DJ from the lighthouse that Adrienne Barbeau played so perfectly in the first movie.<br /><br />I want to warn all of you, there are alot of details and plot points that are easy to miss, surprisingly, it's a pretty complicated plot that my wife and I had to watch twice because we have one of those roomates who can't shut the hell up during a movie!!! So we missed quite a bit during the last half hour and alot happened, but it all made sense after the second viewing and again I was really impressed with the storytelling.<br /><br />I read alot of your reviews and I think alot of people are tanking this for the wrong reasons. He didn't do this as a remake, or a sequel, he was very strict when he said he wanted to 'retool' it, he felt the first one was too vague and alot of people, even though they loved it, had alot of questions. Another reviewer claims he can't understand why the first one is considered a classic. I think if you look at most avid movie fans top 10 horror movies, The Fog is on 3 out 4, guaranteed!! I own the first one, and I'm pretty sure I will buy this, it's a good horror movie, and even though it also got the stupid 'unrated' tag, I highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one. I also rented Waiting with Ryan Reynolds, so I'll let ya know how that one was soon, I heard it was funny as hell...we'll see, catch ya later!!!<br /><br />acting.......2 stars, Avoided the dreaded 1 star thanks to Blair<br />directing......3.5 stars, Stigmata's Wainwright does a faithfull adaptation<br />special effects.....3.5 stars, Ghosts and the ship are way cool, the actual fog is something to see as well<br />horror rating....3 stars, Some suspense, more eerie then scary<br />quality.....3.5 stars, Had disaster written all over it, and while most think it was, I think it looked great, definite improvements over the first one while lacking the original's 'charm'</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>but you have no idea.<br /><br />Here's the thing ... sometimes a low-budget forces a director to be more creative. Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009UW0N">Halloween</a> was made on a shoe-string budget of $325,000 ($1,111,914 today) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AM6OQ2">The Fog</a> was granted only one-million ($2,677,633 today). That's not much for a film. And Carpenter crafted a work which has scarred horror-enthusiasts for life ... who among us can drive into a fog-bank and not think, "Here's where the hook smashes through my windshield."<br /><br />Wainwright was given a staggering $18,0000 to shoot this remake ... but where did it go? On television-star Tom Welling? Or television-star Maggie Grace? Or television-star Sara Botsford? No, that can't be right ... they are TELEVISION stars! And, how that small-screen quasi-talent translates to the big-screen ... as quasi-talent. And, am I the only one who noticed that many of Wainwright's actors appeared in "Smallville" ... way to reach!<br /><br />As far the writing is concerned, I do not want to have any more back-story in my remakes (actually, I DO NOT WANT any more remakes). I do not care that Leatherface had a debilitating  skin-condition (thanks for that Marcus Nispel), and I don't care that Michael Myers had a tormented childhood (thanks for that Rob Zombie) and really don't care about this long, protracted expansion of the leper-story. Who cares?! In fact, as Hooper and Carpenter know ... the less back-story the audience receives, the more frightening the film! With a scant back-story, we are only left to wonder how these things happen ... could they happen to us? Spell-out the mystery and lose the terror. Pretty simple, right?<br /><br />Selma Blair brought some life to her role of Stevie (formerly played by Barbeau). But, as written, her part was nonsensical ... why situate her in the role of a DJ only to rip her out of the light-house and have her help no one. The original story was so gripping because of Stevie's efforts to guide the town-residents to non fog-infested areas. We cheered for her ... and she was The Final Girl (see Carol Clover - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691006202">Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film</a>). She was helpful, strong, and resilient. This Stevie ... well, she's just a Mom who paints her toenails. Even Blair's sizable talent could not rescue the writing.<br /><br />Lastly, the conclusion. It was breathtaking ... breathtakingly bad. My companion and I literally gasped and shouted, "WHAT??!" If you must watch this work, be prepared for a radical change ... a nonsensical, horrendous change that you cannot even guess.<br /><br />Bottomline: this is a train-wreck you will want to avoid ... buy the 1980 original and enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>I went into the remake of The Fog with an open mind and expected a fairly decent movie, I didn't think it would be better than the original or an instant classic, but I was expecting a fairly decent movie. I heard The Fog was terrible, but to be totally honest since right now we are in remake hell I thought maybe people are just being harsh since this is the latest remake. And a remake of a popular movie by John Carpenter, that makes this movie a sitting duck.<br /><br />But I have to agree with the majority. The Fog was indeed a very bad movie. Things go from bad to worse over the course of the movie. I was amazed at how horrible The Fog was. Like I said I wasn't expecting a classic, but a fairly decent movie. The Fog didn't even have the so bad its good vibe going for it. Only the so bad it's well bad.<br /><br />I did like the original John Carpenter version, but I do believe there were some problems with the original. While the original did have a creepy feel to it there were also some slow moments. The Fog is also a bit dated, while it's still a good movie it hasn't aged as well as some of Carpenter's other movies. Overall though I did enjoy the original and I didn't think the remake would be better, but maybe stand proud next to it.<br /><br />The screenplay by Cooper Layne was quite bad. The characters are one dimensional and boring. They aren't fleshed out at all. John Carpenter and Debra Hill's script wasn't perfect, but it was well written. Layne Cooper though, well his script was bad. The concept behind The Fog was a simple story and that is why it worked. Cooper Layne takes a simple concept and creates a total mess.<br /><br />Despite the flaws of the original John Carpenter was able to make up for it with some really great atmosphere. He uses his setting to his total advantage and is able to make a movie that has a lot of suspense and tension even with the flaws. Sadly director Rupert Wainwright is not able to do the same. Ok so he didn't have much of a script, but I have seen many horror movies that weren't all that well written become a lot better cause of the director.<br /><br />Rupert Wainwright never really creates much of an eerie feeling. There were a couple of scenes late in the movie with he showed some flashes of something. But by this time do we even really care? The answer is quite simple. No we don't, not this late in the movie. Wainwright never uses his setting to his advantage his scenes are all poorly paced, he wasn't able to build any suspense or tension.<br /><br />The acting was quite weak as well. Tom Welling is just going through the motions here. Maggie Grace though gives a fairly good performance and is somewhat able to make a poorly written character a bit interesting at times, but barley. Selma Blair though is excellent. She gave a solid performance in my opinion, but it's sadly wasted here. She doesn't have nearly enough scenes and I think she could have made The Fog a bit better had she been given a bigger part. Selma Blair may not be Adrienne Barbeau, but she does manage to bring something to the character and really is the only positive thing about this movie.<br /><br />The Fog really was as bad as the reviews stated; it relies too much on CGI, which was quite bad I must say. A simple ghost story became a complete waste of time. Like I said before I wasn't expecting a great movie, but a fairly decent one. But all I got was a bad movie and not in a good way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>Perhaps one would not be so critical of the acting in the remake of "The Fog" if one has not seen the original "The Fog" directed by the great John Carpenter.  However, I have seen the original "The Fog" many times, and the remake fails miserably in comparison.  The story behind "The Fog" is unique and it takes a certain type of director and actors to pull it off, and John Carpenter and company were able to accomplish this fairly well.  However, the remake just fails to capture the atmosphere and charisma of the original.  I'm sorry, but you are not going to make an effective remake of a horror movie by replacing the actors in the original with actors like you have in this stinker of a remake.  It's just not going to happen.  The result is a movie for the teenagers and that's what this is, and a very poor one a that!  I don't like it!!<br /><br />Much like the remakes of the horror classics "When A Stranger Calls" and "The Omen", the acting in "The Fog" leaves a lot to be desired.  Hence the execution of the movie comes off laughable.  There is no doubt the acting and execution of this remake are both very poor.  The remake of "The Fog" is very difficult to get into because of this fact.  To be perfectly frank, the remake is dull, boring, and ultimately comes off like a total joke...at least that was my impression as I caught myself shaking my head in disgust repeatedly while watching this trash.<br /><br />If you're going to do a remake of a classic horror movie (not that the original "The Fog" is a classic by any means, but it's pretty good) or any good movie for that matter, you better have something more to offer than this garbage or it's going to fail and get hammered by the critics, and deservingly so.  An example of a great remake would be Martin Scorsese's classic remake of "Cape Fear" which has BRILLIANT acting and brings a character and flavor all its own to the table.  Alas, "The Fog" completely fails in this regard, not that Hollywood cares because the makers of this movie were quite obviously only interested in cashing in on the success of the original.<br /><br />My advice is to watch the original and skip the remake entirely because you won't be missin' a thing.  Fortunately, I saw this on encore and did not waste one penny buying or renting this garbage.  As eluded to above, it should be noted in any review of this movie that much like the remake of "When A Stranger Calls", the remake of "The Fog" is rated PG-13 and seems to be catering towards the teeny-bopper crowd and this conclusion is supported by the cast chosen for this movie and the undeniable teenaged or early 20-something theme throughout the movie.  In other words, it's got the teenaged feel to it.<br /><br />One quarter of a star for attempting to re-tell the story of the original...that's the only thing that kept this trash from garnering my dreaded 0 STARS grade.  Of course, a 0.25 STARS grade from me represents a terrible movie, but the sad thing is that I have seen much worse as impossible as that sounds.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>This is a short review, because basically this movie is all CGI smoke and mirrors and no substance at all. The digital transfer to DVD is awful; the "FOG" is nothing but Pixels. As for being a frightening, creepy or even slightly scary film it falls on its face. There is nothing at all thrilling about this boring remake. Its disappointing that this cast was given such a vehicle of banality to act in, we all have seen these people shine in other roles. The Original, as many have pointed out before, is dripping in creepiness and still to this day resonates in my mind every time I am passed by a wisp of fog.  What Hollywood fails to realize with all these thinned out remakes is that the original films were rooted in the times, the mood of society, the innocence of this country and the untapped talents of up and coming directors and writers who have since become jaded and bored.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>Ask why John Carpenter gave the go ahead for this bastardization of a remake & his reply is,<br /> "Why not!? Everyone else is doin' it!"<br />Yeah, but that doesn't mean YOU should do it.<br />But, nevertheless, here it is a remake to Carpenter's 1980 classic that sucks like the biggest black hole with no ending in sight ("The Fog" will land with a thud on DVD January 24th, 2006 in it's original PG-13 format or in an unrated format, either way the film still sucks).<br /><br />The plot is still the same: Antonio Island or Bay (take your pick) is celebrating its 125 years of existence. A new monument to the towns three founding fathers has been erected right out in front of town hall. But, their is an ominous backstory to the town's origins & the citizens of Antonio Island are going to pay for it with their very lives. An unholy fog has rolled onto shore mysteriously killing anyone in its path. Its up to the towns descendents to figure out the mystery of the fog before its too late.<br /><br />Carpenter is without a doubt one of the true masters of suspense & horror. With the 1980 original version to "The Fog" he brought a great ghost story to the screen with the right amount of atmosphere, suspense, & with his trademark score "The Fog" remains one of his best films.<br /><br />The remake, however, is a different story entirely. Its crap. Every single frame of this film sucks.<br /><br />The characters are two-dimensional & after seeing the original a few times over the years, I couldn't really visualize anyone else in these roles. Tom Welling, Selma Blair & the entire cast are an absolute waste. Blair doesn't have the purr that Adrienne Barbeau had as Stevie Wayne, Welling wasn't believable as Castle let alone a fisherman, & the Father Malone & Old Man Macon characters get little less than 5 minutes of screentime - combined.<br /><br />The tweaking of the original story is really lame. Did we really need to see the whole backstory of the Elizabeth Dane plotline? Hal Holbrook's, Father Malone did a perfect job of reading from his grandfather's diary with out the need of one flashback, or an extra tug from his drinking flask! Has American society become so fu**ing attention defecit disorientated that we need to have everything spelled out for us? Leave a lot to the imagination - it's more creepier that way.<br /><br />The ending is the worst insult to Carpenter fans. What in the hell were they thinking?! I was so pissed off when I left the theatre & I have come to the conclusion that John Carpenter can't truly be trusted (hey folks, he gave the nod for this remake). What's next "Halloween: The Musical"?!<br /><br />"The Fog" is to be avoided like a bad case of seasickness.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>The original 1980s version directed by John Carpenter was never one of my favorite films of his; it was atmospheric and eerie, but it just wasn't all that scary to me.  So in viewing this remake, I tried to forget the original and look at it on its own merits.  Director Rupert Wainwright has captured the eerieness and has a few jolts here and there, and this new FOG is better than some of the other remakes of recent years (Planet of the Apes, e.g.).  Selma Blair comes out with the acting honors in a toned down version of the original Stevie Wayne; the rest of the cast including Superman Tom Welling and Lost's Maggie Grace do what's expected of their roles.  It entertained me and didn't lose my interest, so that's why the four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>John Carpenter's `The Fog' may not be his greatest film, and that is exactly the reason for remaking or improving it. The character of vengeful Blake could be scarier with modern prosthetics, and the deadly fog that sneaks in on the townspeople could be more atmospheric with today's special effects. Revolution Studios seems to have thought the same way, but sadly something went terribly wrong while making the film itself.<br /><br />What is wrong? The answer is clear. That is the film's incoherent storytelling, which made me dizzy while watching it. The original's story about the ghosts seeking revenge remains intact, and the film presents how they show up at the quite seaside town (or an island ... whatever) shrouded in a fog. So far, it's good, but the problem is how to tell this story.<br /><br />Apparently the fog is so whimsical that it appears and disappears without particular logics behind its random actions. It can sneak into a kitchen, but not a fridge. It can turn a human into a mummy-like corpse in a second, but it uses that trick not much, because it seems to know that the CGI is costly. The lack of consistent logics just helps make the film scare-free.<br /><br />Slow and sleep-inducing pace of the film only makes us realize the impossibility of the film's plot. In horror films I usually don't expect much from the characters, but the behaviors of them here are incredibly stupid. If you find a video camera that might prove your friend is not a killer, you won't hide it from the police and give it to your girlfriend. Forget the law of physics here. If your car crashes, overturning several times before finally plunging into the sea, you would get seriously hurt. Not in this film, because of the driver happens to be the star of the film.<br /><br />New version of `The Fog' is not scary. Well, the original was not that scary, but it was moody and stylish. They certainly did change some part of the original, but none of the changes make sense. So ... why did they remake it?</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>The movie opens with a fairly boring beginning.  Things don't look too promising- and they don't get any better throughout.<br /><br />I would liken the film more to a Murder She Wrote episode than a horror/thriller movie.  The acting is a bit on the weak side and it's very difficult to maintain interest in the story.  As another reviewer said, it's "just plan bad".  There is nothing frightening about it and it will leave you questioning why they even decided to remake the movie in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This is one of the worst horror movies ever made.

The storyline itself behind the Fog was pretty good though but it could not save the ending of this film, which was really lousy and to me made hardly any sense.<br /><br />Take my advice, and many others I assume will say the same thing- get the older version. The older version is way better and so is the ending. The actors are even better in the older version. This remake is poor compared to the old one so please do not think the old version is as bad as the remake because it isn't- it is a whole lot better trust me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>When a small town decides to make and present a statue dedicated to people that helped establish their town, its usually a joyous occasion. However for Antonio Island off the Oregon coast, the people are about to pay tribute to four men which will lead to events that will bring terror to the entire island. A couple of people (who are descendants of two of those four men) seem to be troubled by a mysterious fog that has begun to roll in and engulf the town, oh and there's some murders that occur that may or may not have something to do with this fog.<br /><br />Later in the film its found out that back in 1871, the four guys in the statue betrayed some guy named Blake who had purchased part of the island to help some lepers, but of course it doesn't just end there, oh no sir. This fog and the murders are the result of Blake and his lepers who were killed years back and now they want revenge on anyone on the island and especially those related to the four guys.<br /><br />This is a remake of a 1980 film starring Jamie Lee Curtis, which was far, far better than this film could ever have hoped to be. This version stars Tom Welling (TV's "Smallville"), Maggie Grace ("Taken") and Selma Blair ("Hellboy") who are all very mis-cast here, there's not one moment of suspense, terror or anything redeeming. The conclusion is laughable and really I was just thankful it ended when it did. * out of 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Tom Welling and Maggie Grace did the best they could, but the story just isn't that interesting and it is a very predictable and familiar tale of revenge from people who were wrongly killed by greedy folks in the past.</p></br><a href="../users/A2O97GKCSISM3F.html">A2O97GKCSISM3F</a><br/><p>I must be in the minority here, but I don't care. Director Rupert Wainwright did much better with this than Stigmata, plus his "motive" for the fog's appearance makes more sense here, but John Carpenter's direction style is hard to beat, but RW comes close here. The acting isn't oscar-worthy, but decent, and like the original, the setting and atmosphere is very creepy when the fog arrives. I feel like a broken record here, when creators re-make<br />classics, they aren't always trying to copy the original scene for scene, scary movies are getting very predictable these days, and John Carpenter is probably old enough to retire, Wes Craven is still doing movies and they're fairly decent, yes, this includes the Scream series. Now I'm getting off track here, to make a long story short, this was yet another decent remake and I enjoyed it. However, I admire JC and Debra Hill for producing the remake, keeping the basics of the classic intact.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Tom Welling, Selma Blair and Maggie Grace star<br />in this 2005 horror remake of John Carpenter's<br />1980 film.

I'm still trying to work out why anyone would a) want to remake John Carpenter's 1980 classic and b) more importantly, why they wouldn't try and rework the premise a bit more - ala the excellent 'Dawn Of The Dead' remake, which, in my humble and probably blasphemous opinion, actually surpasses the original. As it stands, what you get are the standard nods to modern tokenism (everyone is young and beautiful, the soundtrack is full of contemporary modern music and there is much more of an accent on CGI) and some decent camerawork. Some fairly decent production values ensure that it's not a terrible film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's just not a particularly interesting one either. Its also not remotely scary, which is a major failing in any modern horror film and what small atmosphere it does build up deflates like a limp balloon when the crew of the `Elizabeth Dane' make their definitive appearance and turn out to be less scary than the ghost pirates from those truly dreadful 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' movies or a villain from an episode of the original series of 'Scooby Doo'. That said, Selma Blair does appear in a rather fetching pair of panties and some of the fog effects are quite nice, but it's not a patch on Carpenter's spine-chilling, 'less is more' original.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>As far as remakes goes, this new rendition of John Carpenter's classic 1980 original falls far short in terms of both acting and plot.<br /><br />The basic plot remains the same. A ship of lepers was betrayed by the town of Antonio Bay's founding fathers 100 years earlier.  Their ship was set afire, dooming everyone on board.  Now, the ghosts of those souls have come to take their revenge against the people of Antonio Bay.  Hidden within the fog, the ghosts begin their search for the descendants of those who killed them a century earlier.<br /><br />In this movie, Tom Welling stars as Nick Carter, the owner of the "Seagrass", a small fishing boat that Nick and his friend Spooner (DeRay Davis) use to take fishermen and young girls for trips on the water.  It is during one of these excursions that Spooner and two young girls discover the fog and the secrets that it contains.<br /><br />Maggie Grace stars as Nick's girlfriend Elizabeth Williams.  She's been away for six months, and since returning to Antonio Bay, she's had recurring nightmares about drowning.  Were these just dreams or a premonition of things to come?<br /><br />Selma Blair stars as Stevie Wayne, Adrienne Barbeau's role in the original film.  Stevie owns a lighthouse with a radio station located inside.  Stevie, along with her young son Andy, will have to draw on their inner strength later in the movie to face the mysterious fog.<br /><br />Finally, Adrian Hough stars as Father Malone, the hard-drinking priest of the local parish who is hiding a mortal secret from everyone; Father Malone's ancestor was one of the ones who burned the ship containing the lepers.<br /><br />Sometimes, remakes turn out to be as good as the original film, while other times, the remake just doesn't measure up.  This is one of the times that the original is far better than the remake.  I found the story in this movie much harder to follow.  Although the general plot remained similiar with the story of the lepers, there were some instances in this movie I had a hard time following, such as Elizabeth's dreams, and her unlikely ending at the end of the movie.  Also, I felt Stevie Wayne's role in this movie was totally different from the original.<br /><br />This movie is ok, but it doesn't rate anywhere near the first film.  If given a choice between the original and the remake, I would choose the original, with its excellent cast of Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Hal Holbrook.  True horror movie fans may find this movie worthwhile, but its just not as good as the first one was.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>this takes the origional titles the Fog and spits all over it.

She even utters a line "can someone beam me out of here" and it looked as though she was looking right at the camera.  Tom Welling is a one trick pony.  You need more than the "hot" factor to be a credible and talented actor.  He's a horrible crap actor, and they just had to get him with his shirt off, ok! who cares.

The remake of John Carpenter's 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis flick, The Fog is not that successful. I like the fog effect when the fog rolls into the town, they did a good job at that. The story consists of a town called Antonio Bay and a curse from a ship wreck which involving the towns Four Fathers. The crew from the ship are ghosts and they bring the fog along with them. A failed attempt, too bad John Carpenter didnt remake it, that would of been interesting but Rupert Wainwright's directing only goes so far and the ghosts are only effective when we cant see them up close, only when we see them from afar and walking. Starring Tom Welling (Cheaper By The Dozen movies, Tv's Smallville), Maggie Grace (Tv's LOST), Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions, Hellboy), Rade Sherbedgia (Eyes Wide Shut, Snatch) in a wasted role, Kenneth Walsh and DeRay Davis.

There are some decent actors in the movie but are far in few so all I can say is get the original movie and keep this atrocious re-make where it belongs on the shelves or in the trash..</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Terror from the sea strikes a tiny coastal town during its Founding Fathers' festivities. As the denizens of Antonio Bay gather and celebrate, a dense, spooky, meteorologically perverse fog rolls inland, against the wind, and begins to exert a malignant influence. And, within the fog lurks... something - something that craves a reckoning. Sure 'nuff, several Antonio Bay-ans begin to die off, all in gruesome CGI fashion. Elizabeth Williams, a wayward daughter of Antonio Bay recently come home, has been having disturbing dreams; she begins to delve into the mysterious goings-on. She and boyfriend Nick Castle uncover a dark, long-hidden secret that originates back to 1871, a secret which implicates the founding fathers in an act of atrocity. Can she, Nick, sultry radio deejay Stevie Wayne, and crazed Father Malone (who you just know is keeping something to himself) make a successful last stand against the relentless fog and its murderous phantom passengers? Anyways, Happy Founding Fathers' Day.<br /><br />This remake attempts to take advantage of the heat factor brought in by current television "hot" stars: Tom Welling (Smallville) and Maggie Grace (Lost). Unfortunately, Tom Welling's opening scene, where the film is suppose to strongly establish his leading character, charter boat owner Nick Castle, by having him deliver a bracing speech to his crew and clientele, flops ignominiously. Instead of sounding self-assured, he comes off as someone trying to sound grown up. I guess, in my mind, he's still young, high-schooler Clark Kent, even with that stubble. From there on, it's downhill for Welling, as he fails to make an impact and, in fact, sets new standards of cardboard cutout acting. Lovely Maggie Grace fares better than Welling, as she comes out the more developed protagonist. As the disaffected Elizabeth saddled with wanderlust, she settles down nicely in her plot-propelling, co-leading lady role. And, compared to Welling, who seems to be forcing it, she seems more comfortable and more natural in her emoting. The movie's saving grace is Selma Blair and her vigorous turn as Stevie Wayne. As I recall, the original Stevie Wayne (as sexily portrayed by Adrienne Barbeau) was also the high point of the original Fog. Adrian Hough as Father Malone, a priest burdened with a disturbing secret, is unsettlingly weird and tortured.<br /><br />What makes one movie palatable and another unsavory? This version retains the same key characters and apes most of the original premise (with some details altered in a fruitless bid for creativity), and yet doesn't come near in entertainment value. I'm not sure. The original Fog, while inherently cheesy, had several endearing moments, which gave it a nice flavor and favored cult film status. Maybe Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis just had that singular "it" quality? Maybe Maggie Grace is too generic? Or is it Welling's insipid acting? Or maybe the oh-so-crappy, "huh?"-inducing ending here? One of the best parts about the original was Stevie Wayne's disembodied, night-owl radio voice stealing away from her lonely lighthouse, lending a sensation of dread isolation to the film. I relished the impending sense of doom and high-tension drama that washed over me as Stevie steadfastly remained in her lighthouse and tried her level best to direct her listeners to safety thru the radio, all the while frantic for her son's safety and knowing she herself might soon fall under attack. Those wondrous chills are missing in this remake, because this version's Stevie deserted her station pretty quickly. I also didn't like the fact that Nick and Stevie have a past relationship here, or that Nick and Elizabeth have a current relationship predating the movie. Part of the allure of the original to me was the concept of strangers initially going about it their separate ways and then finally, desperately banding together in a last stand against the ghosts.<br /><br />In the last generation, there's been such an influx of derivative horror flicks with the same crude shock effects that the audience's level of tolerance has considerably dropped. Nowadays, a film of this genre has to be truly innovative or truly shocking to make an impact. There's a reason this movie wasn't first screened for the critics before it was released. This version of the Fog mind-numbingly plays itself out by the numbers. The changes the writers install doesn't improve a whit on the original. Given, there are some cool special effects (the death of one Antonio Bay citizen involving shards of glass is nifty) and, I guess, some decent "boo" sequences, even though you see them coming a fog bank away. But the trite plot and cliched scriptwork take away from what atmospheric ambiance is retained from the original.<br /><br />So, two stars for this one: I originally had it as a one star stinkarama, but reluctantly threw in an extra star for Maggie Grace and Selma Blair's earnest, if ultimately futile, efforts. In terms of quality, this is on the same par as the incompetent, predictable, and unscary Darkness, The Boogeyman, and Cursed. Trust me and most of the reviewers here, go check out the original instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Made for TV caliber stinker remake of a for-its-time decent horror movie. Acting is bad with TV actors. The dialogue is bad to corny at best. The story is completely unbelievable. Continuity was all over the place. This was just one of those plain old bad movies on cable that you somehow find yourself in front of after stumbling in late on a Saturday night.<br /><br />I remember the original as being a bit more entertaining, but that was like 25 years ago (the original The Fog was actually the first movie that I saw on cable TV in like 1980). So if you're in the mood for a Foggy evening, rent the original. There's no way it couldn't be better than this amateurish remake.<br /><br />More than enough said.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>I saw the original. What took me back some is the fact that the plot of why the ghosts are in the island town is totally unrelated from one another. Plus, I really didn't like the whole random choosing of the victums.<br /><br />I could see how they had watched the original and said, "we can do this much better given the technology we have now."<br /><br />But did they really have to sacrifice story.<br /><br />The characters even have little differences but not many. They are all, collectively, your typical scared townies that don't know what's going on and just wander around when it comes to solving it. The style of the film was executed perfectly, though. I can never get enough of the images. But there just needs to be mory story.<br /><br />plus, it's just too short when it comes right down to it.<br /><br />Final Verdict: The plot gets lost in the fog.<br /><br />But, hey, that's just my perspective. You might like it better than I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>I like this movie. Obviously, I'm a huge fan of the original Fog and I saw this one at the theater; I hated it there, but somehow found myself buying it.  Since, I have come to really enjoying this movie, but not in its entirety.  I'm one of those who can watch select scenes of a movie and be very satisfied.  This is clearly one of those.  It gets progressively worse near the end, and that's unfortunate.  However, it has a lot of elements i really enjoy - a coastal movie, some decent horror (albeit not really scary), a lot of night scenes, etc.  So enjoy it for the few good scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This time, John Carpenter and Debra Hill helped produce the remake of their horror classic. Also, it seems more for teenagers than for adults. The original seemed like an adult horror movie, rather than teens, because they get Tom Welling to play Nick Castle, Maggie Grace, and DeRay Davis to appeal to younger viewers. I wanted to watch the original and the remake back-to-back, and I think the original is better because it's scarier. This one is okay. Some people may find it boring. If you like remakes, you might like THE FOG!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Once again, the Unrated edition beats the other editions.<br />The Fog itself behaves in the same "against the wind" manner it did in the 1979 version.<br />A larger budget, excellent FX, make this film a blast to watch. The audio is great on a 5.1, and adds to the chills.<br />The deleted scenes in the extras are interesting, and there is no clear reason why some very spooky moments are deleted.<br />The features show a lot of the behind the scenes work, as well as the FX magic. The commentary is sort of enlightening, but it seems like the director is as at a loss as to why the good scenes were chopped as is others. The Unrated edition adds back some superb work. The end result is a good story, well executed.<br />Even after Multiple Viewings, my original reason for getting this film was seeing the clip of Selma Blair ( HellBoy), still stands as  the mosty outstanding reason to get this film; even so, the film has some great moments with the exchanges with  Dan the Weather Man, the signature rapping on the door, and the extremely well done extension of the background story to the Wraiths in the fog, as well as the History of the Town.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>This is a remake of the John Carpenter film of the same name. Here Carpenter is the producer. That film just misses being a classic. 100 years ago a ship was purposely sunk, drowning all aboard. Now they're back for revenge. They seek out the descendants of those responsible for their deaths. Overall I was satisified with the original, but not this remake.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Despite what critics and fans have said about "The Fog", this film is a great remake of a classic horror film. It isn't Oscar material, but what scary movie is. It is meant to be fun and campy and I actually enoyed it. I will also admit I am a huge fan of Tom Welling, and there is a great scene in the film where he takes his shirt off: that is worth the price of the movie.<br /> The film basically follows the same plot as the original in which a huge fog bank descends upon Antonio Bay and all hell breaks loose. Lots of surprise elements are included, and there were many times I jumped while watching it.<br /> The DVD has some great bonuses, including commentary by the director, deleted scenes, and a great documentary on remaking a classic.<br /> When the new version of "The Fog" came out in 2006 it debut at #1 at the boxoffice, eventually accumulating a gross of over 26 million dollars: someone liked it!<br /> Sit back, make some popcorn and enjoy a great, scary film.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>An island town in Oregon is haunted by the angry spirits of people long murdered by the town founders.

(and into the water) come on people!!! I personally hope that this is one of the last remakes that I see, which were unindating the flim industry throughout 2005.

Like a number of his films, the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AM6OQ2">The Fog</a> failed to find an audience until being released on VHS/DVD where it is now considered something of a classic.  It had one of the best atmospheric direction jobs I can ever recall.  How could anyone think they could improve upon this film is a mystery to me.  Steer clear of this fog and go buy or rent Carpenter's original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>i loved the first fog(it is one of my top 15 horror movies)but like the man said "if it ain't broke don't fix it"!!!!!<br /><br />  not worth your time or money,get the first one instead!!!</p></br></body></html>

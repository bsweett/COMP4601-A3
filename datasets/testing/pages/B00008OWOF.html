So, the son Frank Abignale,Jr., poses as a pilot,doctor and lawyer,writing up to over 1.5 million dollars in checks. Tom Hanks plays the wily yet persistent Federal agent who stays on the case, and in turn rehabilitates him. This movie will keep definitely keep you on your toes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>Based on the life of Frank Abagnale, Hollywood decided to do what it usually does - change the 'little details' of the story to make it more 'dramatic'. In this case, instead of going into Abagnale's actual reasons &amp; motivations for what he did (which I'm sure many viewers were interested in), the movie 'explains' his action by some psychobabble about the trauma of his parents' divorce and wanting to please his father.<p>Luckily, what remains of the story is fascinating enough, and is presented by a wonderful cast, giving their best performances. I'm sure I wouldn't be able to see Christopher Walken as 'Creepy Guy' ever again after his against type - performance in this movie...</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg has shown once again why he's the best director in hollywood.<p>Catch Me If You Can tells the story of a conman named Frank Abagnale Jr.(DiCaprio) Frank fakes being a pilot and starts writing fraud checks and all before the age of 18.<p>He is pursued by a federal agent Carl Hanratty(Tom Hanks).

It's the true-life story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a successful con artist who managed to escape numerous attempts at jailing him by an FBI agent (Tom Hanks), the only person who truly understands him.  Spielberg's directing is superb, making the film a very realistic one indeed; there's an extremely entertaining script by Jeff Nathanson; then there's a very fine score by John Williams.  To add to that, there are also great performances from DiCaprio (in one of his few very likable roles) and, of course, Hanks, along with Martin Sheen, Nathalie Baye, and Christopher Walken.  It may not rank among Spielberg's greatest films, but CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is surely one of his most entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>"Catch Me if You Can" is a smart and occasionally funny film that shows you that sometimes the most outrageous stories are the ones that are true.  Yes, this was inspired by a true story.  How close to the facts it stayed is unknown to me, but what is known is that this was a film that kept me intrigued and in awe from start to finish.<p>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale Jr.; a young and bright kid who can con with the best of them.  How he got there is that he has learned from the best, his father.  Things get shaky when his parents are undergoing investigations from the IRS and his mother wants to get a divorce.  Not knowing what else to do, Frank runs away and tries his best to make it on his own by doing what he does best: con.  Posing in many different occupations such as an airline co-pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer triggers a cat/mouse chase conducted by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks).  The movie keeps your attention throughout and leaves you unsure of what's going to happen next.<p>I loved everything about this movie.  It was ten times better than I thought it would've been, mainly because the trailers do mislead you (as many have said) into thinking that you're going to be seeing a whacky chase comedy with all sorts of shenanigans and mishaps.  Well, yes it is a funny movie at times, but I don't think I would really label it as a comedy.  A lot of the things that happen in the film are actually heartbreaking and sad.  So be aware of that when you decide to buy a ticket for this one.<p>The performances were more than ingenious.  Tom Hanks is as great as ever and really takes his role to the limit while DiCaprio also proves to be a fabulous actor as well, and also is able to show us there is life after "Titanic."  Everybody else was really great in the film, especially the great Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. (your eyes never leave his sight when he's on the screen).<p>Stephen Spielberg does an outstanding job of orchestrating this wildly unpredictable film.  It doesn't always have to be sci-fi this or aliens-that when it comes to his films.  He's able to expose the heart of the story with ease in this film, not cheating us out of anything at any point during the entire movie.  I wished he'd do more films like these because he's really good at it.  Although I do love some of sci-fi films like "Minority Report," I think his more realistic films like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Schindler's List" is when you get to see his true and unique talent at its absolute best.<p>"Catch Me if You Can" was a pleasant surprise for me.  I did not plan on liking it as much as I did, which in itself is a pretty neat quality of the film.  Just remember that this isn't supposed to be a "dead-on" comedy.  There are funny and amusing moments, but some of the things you will see are actually sad in some cases.  Still, this is a very well-made movie with top notch performances that definitely deserve recognition.  Very worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>Having just watched the DVD last night, everything is fresh in my memory...  Was I disappointed in this outing by the great director?  Not really.  Even middle-of-the-road Spielberg is better than most other director's best efforts.  Tom Hanks plays geeky FBI Agent and nemesis to Di Capprio's devil-may-care con-kid (not really a con-man, since Dicapprio's character starts doing all these crazy things at the age of seventeen).  It is effortless and free as the story uhnfolds, not answering a whole lot of questions that might pop up.  Hmmmm.  Being that this is "Based On A True Story" does make it a bit more interesting.  All in all...a good weeknight sitdown movie.  Something to watch after a heart-attack MNF game to take the edge off the day.  Nothing extra-extra-special here.  Certainly not Speileberg's best effort.  But DiCapprio shines and so does Tom Hanks and that makes up for some lackluster script strains.  The fact that this guy actually impersonated a pilot, a doctor, and a state prossecutor as well as floated over $4 million in bogus checks in the mid-to-late 60's is very impressive.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>Everything about Steven Spielberg's "Catch Me If You Can" is a joy.  From the terrificly-retro John Williams musical score, to the fine acting performances, to the vibrant colors that saturate every scene in the film, to the clever animated title sequence, right on through to the enormously fine-tuned 1960s period detail that we see throughout the movie.<br /><br />The sets and the colors used in this film truly make you feel you're back in the mid-1960s.  I only caught one very small error in this "period" flavoring of the movie, and that is a short clip shown of a Boeing 767 jetliner landing. The 767 didn't first fly until 1981.  Everything else lands the viewer directly in the middle of the '60s.<br /><br />The story of one of the granddaddies of all check-forgers, Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., is told here by Mr. Spielberg at a very brisk and viewer-friendly pace; and, even though the picture clocks in at a fairly-lengthy 2 hours and 21 minutes, it never becomes tedious or wears out its welcome.  It seems fresh at every turn.<br /><br />A marvelous film with brilliant attention to period detail, and a first-rate DVD to boot!  The 2-Disc DVD features multiple featurettes on the making of the film, with an ample dose of information provided by Mr. Spielberg himself.<br /><br />I love the "look" and the feel of this film, and the way Director Spielberg uses his camera to tell the story...such as utilizing a high overhead shot looking down on a crowded street teeming with people, one of which is our subject, Mr. Abagnale, who stands out significantly by his merely donning his newly-acquired bright white Pan Am pilot's cap. ... There's another scene where Spielberg chooses to frame his actor (Tom Hanks) in the upper right corner of the screen, shooting him while we gaze over the shoulder of another actor in the foreground. ... And another grandiose Spielberg-like moment comes in the corridor of a fancy hotel, where nothing but the turning of a shoe tells the desire of a would-be femme fatale.<br /><br />And the video transfer to disc is eye-popping!  The colors are very bold and lifelike. Just perfect.<br /><br />This DVD offers three different Main Menus, based on each of the three primary "fake occupations" that Mr. Abagnale engages in.<br /><br />"Catch Me If You Can", the movie and the DVD, is a class act all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>A true story from director Steven Spielberg based on the autobiograpical book by Frank Abagnale Jr (Played here by Leonardo DiCaprio), CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is an entertaining, if somewhat overlong movie of the young con man who had successfully passed himself off as a pilot, pediatrician and Attorney General of Louisiana in addition to being wanted for fraud in 50 states: all before his 19th birthday!<br />The movie opens with Abagnale and two imposters pretending to be him on a TV game show, then the story begins in flashback mode (#1). FBI Agent Carl Handratty (Tom Hanks) had his first face to face encounter with Abagnale when Abagnale was imprisoned in France in 1969, after several years attempting to capture him. After being arrested and place on the plane Abagnale begins telling his story to Handratty which leads Spielberg to get tricky and start flashback #2. (Confused? I was at first). This starts the real story of Frank's escapades at Xmas 1963 with Frank watching his father Frank Sr (Christopher Walken) receive a doctorate. As it turns out Dad was also the one who taught Jr the art of scamming: The earliest example is when Frank successfully poses as a substitute French teacher at his own school! Of course along the way he assumes the identities of a Doctor, Lawyer and Pediatrician conning his way to immense wealth and throwing Hanratty off his trail numerous times- even posing as a Secret Service agent trying to help Hanratty!<br />But then as happens in life, Frank meets a wonderful girl and falls in love so soon he is grappling with the idea of telling her the truth about who he really is; and then risking being arrested and being separated from the woman he loves.<br />Sure, the story is pretty basic; but CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is still a highly enjoyable and fascinating movie which manages to maintain viewer interest for its full two hours plus running time. Though Leonardo doesn't portray a broad acting range at the best of times he's pretty good here. So is Hanks, but I found it annoying that he recycles his GREEN MILE accent for this character. That's my only quibble. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is easily Spielberg's best movie since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, although as I mentioned earlier his time juggling may confuse first time viewers. Martin Sheen plays Frank's future father-in-law.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>Like 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley," Steven Speilberg's breezy "Catch Me If You Can" tells the story of a young man who enjoys life's riches through an identity that's not his own.  Leo DiCaprio is Frank Abagnale, Jr., a teenager who spends the mid-1960s posing as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer--all the while cashing checks around the world that ring to the tune of $2.5 million.  His quick wit and suave demeanor are apparently enough to make unsuspecting strangers believe at face value anything Frank says.  Hot on his tail, however, is an FBI agent (Tom Hanks, in a supporting role) who's determined to nail Frank and end his streak of ruthless deception.  DiCaprio fits into his role like a pair of well-worn jeans and seems more confortable with his material than he did in Scorcese's "Gangs of New York."  Productionwise, "Catch Me If You Can" is also a success, as it captures the flavor and texture of the 1960s admirably through its colors and fashions.  I just wished the film would dig a little deeper into Frank's background which could shed some light as to why he decided to be a juvenile con man.  Sure, we know Frank's parents divorced (Christopher Walken, who plays Frank's dad, earned his Oscar nomination, by the way), but not all kids with mommy/daddy issues turn into sophisticated criminals.  And, at 2 hours and 20 minutes, "Catch Me If You Can" gets a bit long-winded and could use some trimming.  To be honest, this movie doesn't represent the cream of Speilberg's crop, and it pales a bit in comparison to the far more engaging "Minority Report," also released in 2002.  As for the DVD itself, I don't understand why it needed to have 2 discs.  The movie and the bonus material (which consists mostly of glossy featurettes) could have fit into one DVD.  Despite this, the film's lighthearted spirit and agreeable tone make it still worth "catch"-ing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>You will walk into this movie having heard nothing but great reviews for it and great word of mouth. You will definitley leave the theater after this 2 hour + film very satisfied, with a smile on your face to boot. That is how incredibly enjoyable and fun this movie is. Right from the cool opening credits down to the last minute, it is nothing but a fun, entertaining ride for the viewing audience. Everybody knows that this is a true story based on the life experience of a real man, Frank William Abagnale, Jr. I haven't read the book, so I can't quite comment on how truthful it is, or what it leaves out. What a life. He was a 16 year old kid who was dealt with a upsetting blow in his family life, and it sent him on the run. If you haven't read the book, I won't say what causes this. Frank now finds himself on his own, with nowhere to go, and no one to do it with. Thus begins the cons. Frank becomes one of the best con men ever. He went on to impersonate an airline pilot(as Frank Taylor), and then a doctor(under the name Frank Connors), and then onto being a lawyer. He even took the bar exam and passed. In a few funny scenes, Frank is seeing watching tapes of "Perry Mason", "Dr. Kildare", and "Dr. No", all after taking on these new identities, to get a hang of just what exactly he is doing. All of this before he turned 19 years old. Hot on his trail is FBI agent Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks. The chase scenes between the two are extremely fun. How he slips away, which sets the cat and mouse game back in action, is great. Once caught, Frank is asked to work with the FBI helping out check fraud, under the supervision of Hanratty of course. This is unlike any Spielberg film I've seen. Different. All Frank wanted was a family. He loved his mother, but it seemed he had a closer, more loving bond with his father, Frank William Abagnale, Sr., who is played by the always fantastic Christopher Walken. The scenes they have together are all wonderful. Some of the best moments in the film. Frank wanted his parents. That's all. Once you get get past the fact of all the incredible things he has done, impersonated, and gotten away with, you start to remember that he is just a 16 year old kid, scared to death, and wanting a home, with a mother and father, to go too. This is what also makes his relationship with Hanratty so interesting too. He is chasing him. He's around. When he is caught and in Carl's care, it is apparent that Carl has been somewhat of a father figure to him. These two relationships with Frank and his father and Frank with Carl are very interesting to watch. The identities and all that are great fun, but it's these storylines that are fascinating to watch. The actors here are all great. Leonardo DiCaprio has proved that he is a great actor, and he is far more than just the king of world idol from "Titanic". For all the fronts he puts up, you see down deep that he is a scared young kid. He did a wonderful job. Tom Hanks shines too. But then again, when doesn't he?. Hanratty is a real man of course, and Tom makes it seem so on the screen. A harried man just trying to do his job. Walken is great as I've already said earlier. Martin Sheen also appears in a small role, as does James Brolin, and an uncredited Jennifer Garner from "Alias". John William's score is zippy and whimsical and it takes you right into the time. A nice piece of work. The film also looks amazing. They got great colors and the look and feel of the 60's down pat. It is a fantastic looking film. While it may appear to be light and shallow(Amazon's wrong)at first, you got to look beyond that and see what's really going on. This is something Spielberg has always been a master at. This is, pure and simple, one of the most entertaining and enjoyable films of the year. Thanks to all involved for giving it to us.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>2002 was a knock-out year for Steven Spielberg.  Minority Report amazed audiences during the summer and Catch Me If You Can giddily amused them during the winter.  Catch Me If You Can  chronicles the life of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a master con-artist who cashed bogus checks while passing himself off as a pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  While such a lifestyle may appear glamorous and exciting on the outside, the truth of the matter was that Frank was actually a sad and troubled teenager who could only maintain a relationship with two people in his life - his father (Christopher Walken) and the FBI agent pursuing him (Tom Hanks).  DiCaprio displays an impressive acting range as he moves from light and charming into brooding and distraught whenever the story calls for it.  Hanks in the role of Carl Hanratty hits another home run and proves himself once more to be the Jimmy Stewart of his generation.  His Hanratty is not the cliche law enforcement officer who obsesses over his prey day and night, but rather a complex father figure who feels that Abagnale can be salvaged from his life of crime.  As the pursuit drags on, Hanratty develops a respect, and then a concern, for Abagnale.  The growth of this relationship proves to be touching and amusing at the same time.  This film probably will not rank among the pantheon of the great Spielberg films, but it will definitely not diminish his legacy.  Catch it if you can!</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>About a few days ago, I finally managed to see director Steven Spielberg's ("Minority Report") anticipated "Catch Me If You Can". I have to admit that the film was kind of long (that is what you would expect from a Steven Spielberg film), but it really didn't matter just as long as the film was good, and man was it ever! The performances from Leonardo DiCaprio ("Titanic") and 2-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks ("Cast Away") just couldn't be better! The true-life story of "Catch Me If You Can" focuses on Frank Abagnale, Jr. (DiCaprio), a teen growing up outside of New York. His father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken in an outstanding performance) is being investigated by the IRS for maybe some back taxes and such. And the lives of Frank Jr., Frank Sr., and Frank's mother/Frank's wife, Paula (Nathalie Baye) take a turn for the worse. When Frank Jr. finds out that his whole life is in a bit of a shambles, he does the unthinkable...he embarks on a journey of impersonation and fraud by becoming a doctor, a lawyer, and an airline pilot. Not to mention that Frank has also cashed some fraudulent checks, in which the banks lost $4 million in the process...and he did it all before his 19th birthday. This case has attracted the attention of an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Hanks), who is determined to bring Frank to justice...if he can catch Frank first! The direction of Steven Spielberg was just as outstanding as when he directed "Minority Report" and the "Indiana Jones" films! The scenes in "Catch Me If You Can" were hilarious, especially the scenes when Leo's character outsmarts Hanks' character throughout the film, such as when Frank hires some "stewardesses" to escort him throughout the airport without being caught by Frank and his FBI boys. In conclusion, "Catch Me If You Can" has great performances from 2 celebrated actors, a great supporting cast (Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, Nathalie Baye, James Brolin, and Jennifer Garner), lots of humor, powerful storytelling, and a great soundtrack! Whenever people see "Catch Me If You Can", I just hope that they can get by with Tom Hanks' JFK-like accent in the movie, I know that I did! "Catch Me If You Can" is a great DVD addition to any Steven Spielberg collection! This is, without a doubt, Leonardo DiCaprio's best film since "Titanic" and Tom Hanks' best film since "Sleepless in Seattle"!</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I was pretty psyched about CATCH ME IF YOU CAN before it came out.  I'm not one of those psycho DICAPRIO TITANIC fans or anything, in my opinion, the real star of TITANIC was JAMES CAMERON.  But, from the trailers, it looked like a snappy, snazzy hip little movie with SPIELBERG in charge.  Come on, it can't miss.<p>I think it did though.<p>It's nothing like it's trailer.  From the trailer, I was expecting IN LIKE FLINT, THE PINK PANTHER, JAMES BOND... something quick witted, colorful and frantic, but instead it was slow.  It had some snazzy parts.  In fact, it had some really good parts, but I couldn't help thinking that this movie was more suited for a CBS sunday movie or LIFETIME NETWORK.<p>Before seeing the movie, I was expecting to see an OSCAR contendor or something.  After seeing the movie, I will be really disappointed if it is.  In fact, now I'm thinking CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND is the real TRUE STORY movie to see.<p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a true story and it's an interesting story.  The acting is great.  I don't think anything different of DICAPRIO or HANKS.  They're both top notch performers.  In fact, if anybody deserves any acknowledgement in this movie, it's CHRIS WALKEN.  He's outstanding in it.  Maybe a best supporting actor here.  <p>Although, the movie was a let down, should have just waited for it to come out on video.  A good movie, but not what I expected and not the kind of movie I wanted to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg directed two movies that were released in 2002. One was MINORITY REPORT, that sci-fi futuristic suspense film starring Tom Cruise. That movie represented the "new" Spielberg, the director who's view of the world has become much more dark and sinister. Yet, in that film there were hints of the of comedy and dark humor that were reminiscent of the "old" family friendly Spielberg. Spielberg's other film of 2002 is CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and it's a classic Spielberg piece in everyway.<p>The movie is warm, light-hearteded, and full of nostaligia. That is ironic in a way considering the movie is based upon the crime spree of the world's most successful con artist, Frank Abagdale. Of course, if you've read Frank's memoir of the same name, you know that's how the book is too. Therefore, the film stays true to the spirit of the book, messing with history just enough to make the movie more compelling, dramatic, and lively.<p>The whole look of the film; from the cars, clothing, hairstyles, and Christmas ornaments; captures the style and era of the mid-1960's. The soundtrack is great and the movie's main theme is another tune that makes a nice addition to the John Williams canon.<p>Every performance Tom Hanks has done since SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE has beengolden and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is no exception. Leonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job as the main character and Christopher Walken pulls off a supporting performance that should earn him an Oscar nomination.<p>The movie is fun to watch and hearkens back to the good old days of Spielberg when he made movies that were just good movies. It does lack depth, but not every film has to change the world.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>December is typically the time of year that movie studios release all of their 'serious' movies just in time to be considered for Oscar nominations.  While this invariably leads to wealth of excellent films to see, most of them are exactly 'fun' to watch.  "Catch Me If You Can" is a welcome break from the dour natures of the films this time of year and is a very entertaining viewing experience.  In fact, if it were not for the Academy of Motion Pictures disdain for comedies and multi-genre films (this would qualify is a 'dramedy'), "Catch Me..." might have a shot at a few Oscars, too.<br /><br />  "Catch Me If You Can" tells the real-life story of one of the most unlikely, accomplished con artists in U.S. History, Frank Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio).  Abagnale was responsible for impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, an assistant attorney general, a history professor, and forging $2.5 million in counterfeit checks.  The real kicker is that he did all this before he even reached the age of 18!  Ironically, Abagnale currently is one of the most sought after experts by banks and business when it comes to check fraud and developing methods to guard against it.  Although there are likely some embellishments to enhance the dramatic value of this movie, "Catch Me..." by and large sticks closely to facts of the story.<br /><br />  In the movie, Abagnale (DiCaprio) first realizes his gift for the con when, at a new school, he takes advantage of a substitute teacher's tardiness and impersonates being a teacher, himself.  It's not important that he didn't have that much greater knowledge over the class material than they other students.  What was important was that he had the charisma and charm to make the rest of the class think he did.  A key scene early in the movie takes place when Abagnale's parents are called to the principal's office because the school found out about Frank's scam.  Instead of coming down hard on Frank, his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (played with understated grace by Christopher Walken), jokes with his son about it and almost seems proud of it.  Frank Sr., unfortunately, is one of those lost souls in life, who seems to have the perfect American family, but is really more of a loser who is watching all he worked for come unraveled (a failing business and a failing marriage).  Frank Sr. seems proud of Frank Jr. because the younger has the ability to actually pull off the scams that the older tries and fails to do.  It's a very telling moment, because it foreshadows the motivation for the path in life Frank Jr. would take because Frank Sr. chose to be a cheerleader rather than a father.<br /><br />  After his parents divorce, Frank Jr. decides to run away and use his 'skill' to make a living.  This is where "Catch Me..." takes the audience on a long journey through the various professions and scams of Abagnale's mentioned above.  To be able to fund his 'adventures', Frank uses his intelligence and charm to discover all manner of ways to get false checks cashed.  As he becomes more adept at this task, he also attracts the attention of FBI Check Fraud division and agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  Abagnale begins to move across the country and pick up new professions while managing to stay one step ahead of, but still in contact with, agent Hanratty.  The irony of Hanratty's pursuit of Abagnale is that Hanratty understands Frank better than Frank does, at least in terms why he is doing these scams.  In trying to stop Frank and help him rehabilitate himself, Hanratty becomes the father figure that Frank Sr. never was.<br /><br />  "Catch Me If You Can" is simply one of those funs movies that make the movie going experience worthwhile.  Hanks plays agent Hanratty well as somewhat clumsy, stodgy, and determined pursuer.  Walken gives what could (and should) be an award-winning performance as Frank Sr.  The true pleasant surprise here, though, is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Frank Jr.  After years of self-important behavior and an almost total disappearance from big screen in the aftermath of "Titanic's" massive hype machine, it's nice to see DiCaprio back as a likable character in a good role.  He has probably learned his lessons about what fame can do and, combined with his role in "Gangs of New York", has likely signaled a return to the successful acting career many people expected of him from his earliest days.  In concert with the other fine performances, DiCaprio helps make "Catch Me If You Can" a cinematic treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>This is an interesting movie in that it is not only based on something historical, but it combines tragedy and comedy rather well.<br /><br />Very quickly, we see that Frank Jr loves both his parents. And they appear to be a well off functional family. Later, a financial crisis hits, and their living standards are reduced drastically. He still loves both his parents, but we can see that he is starting to lean towards his father. After he realizes that they are getting divorced, he can't handle it and runs away. A gem of comedy from Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is when he tries to make Frank Jr's decision as to who he will live with easier: "Frank, just put my name down."<br /><br />After this tragic beginning, the comedy kicks in. Frank Jr. goes from being financially wrecked to financially stuffed. First he impersonates a pilot. At this point, the FBI agent Tom Hanks comes in. While the movie leads us into cheering for Frank Jr., it does NOT make the mistake of allowing us to hate the Tom Hanks character. (We are also permitted a moment of sympathy for him when he realizes his team is not exactly an 'elite squad.') Tom Hanks and Frank Jr. cross, but Frank Jr. avoids capture. (This is when Frank Jr. starts taunting Tom Hanks with telephone calls.)<br /><br />Frank Jr. then goes on to impersonate a doctor. At this point tensions are released. Tom Hanks has lost thew trail; and Frank Jr. meets a woman who he may want to spend his life with. A small unbelievable element here is that Frank Jr. and she jump ship just when Tom Hanks has picked up the trail again.<br /><br />Moving on, Frank Jr. decides it is time to impersonate a lawyer now. At this point he is tired from running, but too late he realizes that you can't just steal $4,000,000. and call a truce. It is worth noting that if Tom Hanks had not seen Frank Jr's face, Frank Jr. may have had a chance to go back to a normal life.<br /><br />The deception is understandably starting to wear Frank Jr. down, and in a comical manner, he slips under the FBI agents and makes his way to Europe. If I say much more, I'll probably ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it.<br /><br />I'll just say it is an interesting end with elements of both sorrow and reconciliation. All in all, it's an interesting combination of history, tragedy, and comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is kind of an odd story, another one of those based-on-a-true life tales. This was hyped up a little too much when it came out so I expected more than what the film delivered. However, it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way. He did all of this in his teenage years.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays his normal cocky role while Tom Hanks is the straight- and-narrow looking FBI man on his trail. Although not a tense thriller, the movie holds the viewer's interest throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes with the last half hour being the most interesting, capped off by a satisfying ending.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't enjoy watching was DiCaprio (as "Frank Abagnale") taking advantage of genuinely-nice girls. This guy was no hero, believe me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Catch Me If You Can is the film of Dicarpo's 2002 Christmas double feature that I didn't see in the theater. Even though I liked Gangs Of New York more, Leo gives another great as Frank W. Abagnale Jr a teenage con men who is full of heart. Tom Hanks as arch enemy Carl Hanratty also gives a heart felt performance.

He is a wonderful actor and brilliant in everything he does. And this is one of my most favorite roles of his. Its perfect and entertaining. I couldn't believe it was actually based on a factual event. Its amazing to even think about while watching this film. The movie is actually a bit long, however, I barely felt it because there really is no down time or boring parts. It is a great chase like movie. Really captivating.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Another must see from director Steven Spielberg.

I definitely recommend it if only for the awesome opening credits.  One of the best movies from Steven Spielberg, and most likely his second most fun (behind Raiders of the Lost Ark)<br /><br />The DVD features a number of featurettes and interviews.  It's a wonderful Two Disc set.<br /><br />A definite must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Ever since putting out Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg's been sort of hit-and-miss. From likable outings like Minority Report to Munich to sort-of-okay ones such as A.I and The Terminal. Catch Me If You Can, a film similar in tone to the Terminal is a bit more accessible and it's interesting all the way through. But interesting doesn't mean great through and through and the film suffers from what I call a "perfectly too long script" where the film can't really be cut down but you wish it had been.<br /><br />The film centers on real-life con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. who successfully impersonated an Airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and receiving the checks priviledged to such prestigious careers. Of course people aren't too happy and on the case is FBI man Carl Hanratty, an expert on bank fraud. But there's more to Frank than just writing bad checks as he has some family issues that he needs to have taken care of and the desire to keep running.<br /><br />This is kind of a hard Spielberg film to like because it's more a sum-of-its-parts kind of film than looking at individual achievements. All his films, from E.T to Close Encounters to Jaws and Jurassic Park always had some memorable image or a musical theme or something. In this case, it's more acting that shines through. From Leonardo DiCaprio bringing in a great turn as Frank to the one who should've gotten the Oscar, Christopher Walken. Only real problem is Frank's chaser, Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. He plays it with an awful accent and at times you can't even tell what kind of character he's supposed to be.<br /><br />Where the film doesn't really fail but just sort of stumbles is in its pace. This is a film where looking back it's hard to tell what could be cut since a lot of it is important to establishing characters and motivations yet it just feels too long, like a movie you want to trim down but you wouldn't even know where to start. But tonally the film feels just right from its almost sugary atmosphere to the chase music. It's nice to see John Williams NOT to something that sounds like Star Wars all the time). It's not even close to being Spielberg's worst (look to 1941 for that) but not really Spielberg's best but it's still a nice little movie.<br /><br />If you're expecting another classic, look elsewhere. But if you just want something entertaining now and then, can't go wrong here.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The dramatization of this true story of Frank Abagnale Jr has been played brilliantly for Di Caprio giving to date the best role of his career .

This talented boy makes the whole journey of the selfish and inmature character . Finally he comes back to the mother embryo and this is the cause for his eventual perdition . Holy Freud and your Oedipus complex you solved the case worked out as a silent and celestial Sherlock Holmes . (Or perhaps Spielberg made a secret homage to the Seven-percent solution that famous film of Herbert Ross of 1976?)<br /><br />The script is marvelous and meticuosly edited . A worthable work !</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>This is a generally entertaining film with lesser ambitions than comparable films such as The Great Impostor (1961) and -- at least to some extent --  Zelig (1983) and Chamelon Street (1989). Directed by Steven Spielberg, Catch Me If You Can is mostly based on the autobiography of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., played by Leonardo DiCaprio. His performance is adequate but overshadowed by those of Christopher Walken (as Frank Sr.) and Tom Hanks (as Carl Hanratty, a character created by Spielberg and Jeff Nathanson who wrote the screenplay). Given Frank Jr.'s charm which seems natural to DiCaprio, it is easy to understand how quickly he could deceive so many different people, both in the United States and abroad. More difficult for me to understand is how Frank Jr. -- as portrayed by DiCaprio -- could sustain that deception almost indefinitely. <p>I just wish the film had devoted more attention to the exceptional cunning which was obviously required of Frank Jr. to devise so many ingenious strategies and tactics. For example, he recognized the benefits of having others' bank deposits credited to his own account so he devised a way by which to print slips bearing his account number. He then replaced blank deposit slips in bank branches with his own deposit slips. I also wish more attention had been devoted to examining Frank Jr.'s compulsive need to assume others' identities. Deep down, was he ashamed of his father? Was he ashamed of himself? I am also curious to know how he could betray the confidence of so many decent people and still remain so cheerful, even playful, even after he was finally apprehended. Perhaps Spielberg should be blamed for casting DiCaprio or perhaps the two of them should be blamed for a poorly developed character. In fact, other than Frank Sr. and perhaps Hanratty, none of the characters in this film is sufficiently developed. Hence the Four Star rating which includes one for the Walken and Hanks performances and another for the special features.<p>To repeat, Catch Me If You Can is frequently entertaining. However, after seeing it again recently, I again wondered if the real Frank Jr. could gain my confidence as easily as he did others. Probably...but DiCaprio's Frank Jr. couldn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F8R40Z2OMIJM.html">A2F8R40Z2OMIJM</a><br/><p>I love the title sequence of CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (by Kuntzel + Deygas).  The zippy graphics and John Williams score set the scene for what is to come: a stylish chase movie.<p>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale Jr., who, in real life, masqueraded as a pilot, lawyer, and swindled millions.  Tom Hanks is Carl Hanratty (what a name!), the FBI agent who chased Abagnale.<p>As directed by Steven Spielberg, CMIYC is a very entertaining film.  It's well paced, funny, and moving at times.<p>My one complaint about the DVD is that Janusz Kaminski's cinematography gets mucked up in the transfer to digital.  On my widescreen digital TV and proscan DVD player, there are some digital problems in low light scenes with streams of light in the background.  You can see digital artifacts floating in the light beams, which ends up looking like a STAR TREK transporter effect! Otherwise, the disc (especially the sound mix) is a treat.<p>I missed CMIYC in the theaters.  I'm glad I finally 'caught it' on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg has finally returned to comedy... sort of. Based on a true story (and from what I hear, quite accurate), this film follows the life of a very young Frank Abagnale jr. who runs away from home and disguises himself as a pilot, then a doctor, then a lawyer, all in the course of two years. The FBI is following him, particularly Carl Handratty, who works in the fraud department and doesn't have much for a sense of humor. This film strays from the usual "based on a true story" inspirational dreck and instead creates a fun, fast pace. The film runs close to two and a half hours, but feels like a mere 70 minutes. DiCaprio is perfect as young Abagnale, Hanks is (as always) marvelous as Handratty, but the best performance in the film comes from Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. Walken owns every scene he's in. He's absolutely brilliant. "Catch Me If You Can" is a very different film for Spielberg, but he shows once again that in the movie business, he's the very best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Catch Me If You Can" is the story of real-life con artist Frank Abagnale, Jr. who, in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when he was between the ages of 16 and 21, wrote $2.5 million dollars in bad checks and became one of the most notorious con men in American history. The film follows Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) from his early high school pranks to his check-printing operation and eventual capture in France five years later. FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) doggedly pursues Frank as he successfully impersonates an air line pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, living the life of a playboy and cashing ingeniously forged checks all along the way.<p>"Catch Me If You Can" was directed by Stephen Spielberg and, along with Minority Report, signifies a revival of Spielberg's directing talent after fifteen years of mediocre-at-best filmmaking. This film is fairly light fare, but it is immensely entertaining, funny, touching, and impeccably cast. Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a perfect fit for Leonardo DiCaprio, and is probably his best role since "What's Eating Gilbert Grape". Tom Hanks seems to have abandoned his typically saccharine roles this year -much to his credit- and puts in a wonderful performance as sympathetic geeky G-man Carl Hanratty (along with a terrific showing in "Road to Perdition"). Christopher Walken was the only actor to receive an Oscar nomination for "Catch Me If You Can". His performance as Frank Abagnale, Sr., our protagonist's down-and-out father, deserved the honor. Frank Jr.'s awkward combination of admiration and pity for his father seems to have been a key motivator in his illustrious life of crime, and Christopher Walken really helps us understand that.<p>The real Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a successful security consultant these days, protecting businesses from white collar crime. He cooperated with and bascially likes the film, but is quick to point out that "Catch Me If You Can" is based on his biography of the same name that was written about 25 years ago. Mr. Abagnale says that some aspects of his experiences were exaggerated in that book and some have been altered for the movie as well. Whatever the inaccuracies, Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s immense intelligence, ambition, and guts are the most striking elements of the film. It's the rarity of finding all of these qualities in such abundance in one person that make Frank's character so fascinating, and make him one of cinema's most lovable antiheroes.<p>I highly recommend "Catch Me If You Can" for its great performances and its extremely entertaining story of an ingenious con man and his noble pursuer...made all the more interesting because the story is largely true.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>and the message is, &quot;Sometimes, I'm gonna do a film where I just try to entertain you&quot;.  And entertain it did!<br /><br /> Reviewers of the movie are at odds, either giving it high praise, when they recognize that it is just there to entertain the filmgoer, or calling it dreadful, when they expect every Spielberg movie to be a momentous event of special effects and storytelling. &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is based on the life of a con man, who pulled his crimes as a teenager, and then reformed for the rest of a long life.  The story engrosses the watcher, and Spielberg gives the film a light touch, a terrific cast, and fits it all into the eerily real culture of the 60's everyday life with costumes (wardrobe is outstanding), period sets, and a general feeling of wonder (Remember &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;?) that was the true 60's feel, devoid of momentous political events and the inevitable strife caused by war.<br /><br />DiCaprio is featured as an odd duck, an obsessive compulsive trapped in escalating acts designed to make his father feel that his life is successful.  He shows some great naivete, especially in the scene criticized by many with Jennifer Garner, and displays the genial and engaging manner that the real Frank must have had to get away with what he did.<br /><br /> Hanks is another believable work obsessive compulsive who chases him down and forms the nucleus of the nonviolent criminal teams that solve financial crimes in this country every day.  Bringing Frank to the FBI feels a little unbelievable, but it DID happen, and it was based on Hanratty's understanding and faith in not only the genius, but also the need of Abagnale to outsmart the world.  I'm sure it was a huge<br />financial success for law enforcement in the real world.<br /><br /> Many seem surprised at the fine flair that Christopher Walken displays as Frank's father, but Walken's career is full of moments like these, where he has flashes of a true craftsman, then does an over the top performance in his next role...kind of a roller coaster ride with this fine performer, you never know what to expect.<br /><br /> The audience clapped in the film I saw, enjoyed the music, had a great time...now that's entertainment!  Catch Me If You Can blends light comedy with a background edge of why things turn out the way they do when families dissolve.  It may be the most entertaining movie (short of My Big Fat Greek Wedding) of 2002; and although it doesn't deserve to win any awards....<br /><p>sometimes Spielberg should just entertain us!  He's earned it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DE1IYJGU5HPW.html">A3DE1IYJGU5HPW</a><br/><p>Steven Spielburg's second 2002 film is a dinosaur.  It's an anachronism.  It belongs to the time period in which it's set, a more innocent America where Charles Manson had not brought violence to the wealthy and Vietnam was still a winnable (and profitable) war.  It's Catch Me If You Can, the story of con man Frank Abagnale, Jr., who may very well be the world's foremost expert on forgery and fraud.  If that doesn't sound like a complimentary introduction, fear not; Catch Me a film's film and a throwback to the cinema of yore, when audio and video combined to make an experience rather than an assault on the senses.<p>Imagine a mixture of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and To Catch a Thief.  Catch Me has the slow pacing and careful cinematography of Hitchcock at his finest, and Spielburg has forsaken his recent effects-laden shots for straightforward storytelling.  Every individual shot is deliberately framed, with a care for detail not usually seen outside of a Lynch film.  There are no explosions to distract the eye from character interaction, and the overall effect is that of an effortless and immersive film.<p>Leonardo DiCaprio, in one of his best (and best-developed) roles since Gilbert Grape, plays Frank Abagnale, a teenager growing up outside of New York.  His father (played by Christopher Walken) is being investigated by the IRS, and Frank Jr.'s idyllic American life full of apple pie, WWII vets marrying their sweethearts, and large-finned cars is about to come crashing down.  When he finds that what he's left with isn't to his liking, Frank embarks on a career of impersonation and fraud.  He passes himself off as an airline pilot, a Harvard-educated doctor, an assistant prosecutor, and a recruiter for an airline stewardess program - all before his 19th birthday.  When he starts passing bad checks - to the tune of four million dollars - he attracts the attention of straightlaced FBI Agent Tom Hanks, who manages to avoid his Hanks persona in favor of actual acting.<p>Catch Me is a character story, told through a series of events in Abagnale's life.  It's funny at times, but the portrait that develops is of a sad, lonely, and almost pathetic child who runs and hides because he doesn't know what else to do.  Hanks is like an automaton, relentless in his pursuit, and his grip on Abagnale only grows tighter with each narrow escape.  It's not a deep meditation on a philosophical subject, or an artistic look at some overused postmodern clich&eacute;.  Catch Me aims to entertain, nothing more, and succeeds admirably.<p>Without effects, a blazing soundtrack, and fast-paced action to drive the story, Spielburg ekes the most from Hanks and DiCaprio without resorting to hammy overacting.  This, combined with the easygoing plot and fantastic camerawork, lend Catch Me an unusual amount of verisimilitude for a modern film: it's something to lose yourself in, where you no longer think "I'm watching a movie."  That is an accomplishment worthy of note.<p>Final Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Oh, my, what a wonderful movie this is.<br /><br />This film, a "true story" about an audacious and clever con-artist--his flight from justice and eventual capture--is one of those movies that keep Mr. Spielberg firmly atop the pedestal upon which he so richly deserves to sit. It's simply a lot of fun--a great story, well told--and succeeds on almost every level that film attempts. The characters are multi-dimensional, intriguing and all sympathetic; the pacing is seat-of-the-pants; the direction is artful, but never at the expense of the story; the music another gem from John Williams (and uncharacteristic of his normal brassy fare); the acting is superb (and I hope that given this, The Aviator, and others that people will finally admit the sizable talent of the often unfairly hated DiCaprio); and the plot is a gem.<br /><br />One aspect that I love is how DiCaprio's character is an awful con-man, reprehensible by every measure, and yet is just so very daring and intelligent that he demands our respect and admiration (and, sometimes, jealousy). Also, in his relationships with his parents (featuring a great turn by the normally out-of-control Christopher Walken), the policeman chasing him, his would-be wife and others, we see the real human being, inside, his dreams, hopes and failures. In the end, we care.<br /><br />Finally, the movie gets style points for its retro-60's opening sequence and theme, and the subtle points that you may just miss on a first viewing (for instance, DiCaprio tracing handcuffs while talking on the phone to the police). Excellent, excellent movie that you'll watch more than once. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Based on a true story, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN provides a congenial theater outing.<p>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr., who, between the ages of 16 and 19, successfully impersonated an airline pilot, a physician, and a lawyer. In the process, he passed phony checks totaling millions of dollars. Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the nerdy FBI agent out to bust young Frank.<p>This is probably the best acting performance by DiCaprio since TITANIC, which isn't saying much, and Hanks has done better. However, both actors apparently had a lot of fun with their roles here, and it's that energy that makes CATCH ME IF YOU CAN a film worth watching. Also, Christopher Walken is wonderful as the enigmatic Frank Abagnale, Sr., whose business and marriage is ruined by the IRS, which is pursuing him for reasons left largely unspecified. And, while it was never clear to me whether the Old Man clearly understood the extent of his son's mischief, the occasional sly grin and whisper in the ear seemed to indicate that he admired and envied his boy's larcenous spirit and adventurous lifestyle.<p>This film is a flight into nostalgia for those of us old enough to remember the days when commercial air travel still had &eacute;lan, when pilots were heroes, and when the politically correct "cabin attendants" were elegant "stewardesses".  There's one comic scene involving Frank, Carl and an in-flight chocolate &eacute;clair that pointedly recalls that coach fare used to be more than an apple and bagged peanuts.<p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN drags a little by the end, and the lesson of the epilog might be that crime pays.

It started off a bit slow, but once the scams began so did the fun. Most people including me thought it was going to be a light-hearted comedy/drama due to the previews, but it really is more of a serious drama with some very sad moments. Don't get me wrong, the movie is a lot of fun and the 2 hour and 15 minute running time flys by. Leonardo Dicaprio finally finds a role that helps him to shine as an upcoming actor, and Tom Hanks is great as always as the serious cop who is on his trail. Another thing worth noting is that the costumes and soundtrack are stunning, and they time warp you back to the mid-60's.

If you go the Dawson Leery route and are a fan of Steven Spielberg then it seems the complaint is that this film is no "E.T.," "Jurassic Park" or "Schindler's List."  But if you are a fan of Tom Hanks then the complaint would be that this is not a "Philadelphia," "Forrest Gump," or "Cast Away."  The idea that Spielberg and Hanks, who worked together on "Saving Private Ryan," would spend there time on this trifle seems to be too much for some fans to take.  But then Leonardo DiCaprio, who has seen little sign of the critical success ("What's Eating Gilbert Grape") or box office success ("Titanic") of his earlier days is probably just happy to have had movies with Spielberg and Martin Scorsese out at the same time.  Okay, so "Catch Me If You Can" is not a great film.  It is a very good film and that puts all the parties concerned ahead of the game given the standard fare from Hollywood.<p>The story might not be about life and death, but it is certainly compelling.  Young Frank W. Abagnale Jr (DiCaprio) runs away from home rather than deal with the divorce of his parents and has to live by his wits and the checkbook in his back pocket.  It turns out his wits are pretty good and he is not only able to pass millions of dollars worth of bad checks, but pass himself off as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  Doggedly pursuing him is F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks), who knows that Frank is really a beggarman and thief.  Actually, we know that Frank will get his man, because that is how the film opens, and it is as Hanratty is bringing Frank back to the United States from France that the story is revealed.<p>"Catch Me If You Can," based on Abagnale's biography, is the story of an engaging rogue who uses his charm and aforementioned quick wits to get himself out of one sticky situation after another.  The man had panache, which is exemplified when he has to get through the Miami airport despite the fact Hanratty has F.B.I. agents at every other line.  The movie is not really a primer for a life of crime since Abagnale's did his con man act in the Sixties and technology has advanced well beyond his effective use of a bathtub full of water and model airplanes to make thousands of dollars.  <p>In addition to the questions regarding how Frank does it and how Hanratty catches him, there is the relationship between the two men as well as the relationship between Frank and his father (Christopher Walken), from whom he gets his charm and sense of larceny.  It is when the film operates on this level that "Catch Me If You Can" becomes another classic Spielberg film, at least in the sense of the constant theme of symbolic fathers and sons, even if it never gets churned into real butter.  <p>This is an enjoyable film even if it does not fall into the category of joining other Spielberg, Hanks, and DiCaprio films that you have in your video library for convenient repeat viewing.  There is a bonus disc with the DVD version, which only has 75 minutes worth of extra material, mostly about the real Frank Abegnale Jr. (maybe when Spielberg has to put kids through college or something he will break down and start doing commentary tracks so I can get enjoy a course in filmmaking in the comfort of my own home).  If you really are insulted by Spielberg and Hanks doing this project, just wait until next year's "Terminal."  Hang in there.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002), starring Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a jaunty crowd pleaser.  It's based on the true story of con man Frank Abegnale who, as a teen ager, passed himself off as a lawyer, a doctor, and an airline pilot.  Di Caprio fits the role well, and the setting of the 1960's is wonderfully captured in the film's letter-perfect art direction and period songs on the soundtrack.  Walken was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Frank's father.  And don't miss the terrific opening credit sequence, which will remind you of Saul Bass' memorable title sequences from so many 1950's and 1960's movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Catch Me If You Can" is a genuine throwback, made with a light touch and finger-snapping charm, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, finally, in a movie star performance. If he hits a down note as 1960s con artist Frank Abagnale I'd like to see it.<p> Director Steven Spielberg, too, gears back his tendency to pile on the portent, although there are few scenes of thick soup drama that seem to jar us out of our enjoyment. Mostly, however, "Catch Me" is an easybreezer about a kid who finds the one thing he does well, does it with extraordinary ease, and eludes the entire FBI mail fraud division for years while he does it. The highest-concept script floating around Hollywood couldn't tell a better tall-but-true tale.<p> Frank Abagnale was a kid of above average smarts with a slick, quick-thinking businessman for a dad (Christopher Walken) and a mannered, spoiled French mother (the estimable Nathalie Baye). When Frank Sr. gets tagged by the IRS, his wife swiftly sours on him and gets a divorce. That sets up a scene where, on the spot, Frank Jr. has to decide where, and with whom, he'll live, and Frank Jr. bolts, beginning a five-year run of check fraud unlike anything before or since.<p> The movie better explains the mechanics of just how Frank Jr. rips off Pan-Am Airlines, his chosen victim for the stunning no-questions-asked treatment afforded pilots at the time. Later, he becomes a doctor in Georgia, then a lawyer in Louisiana, where his run nearly ends when he gets involved with a rich girl (Amy Adams) and decides to marry.<p> On Frank's "tale" is FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) a straight-arrow investigator with a better taste for magnetic ink than human relations. Hanks personally asked for the role, and he makes a nice, determined foil. "How else do you think this is going to end?" is his standard line to Frank. A kinship develops, the kind of kinship between two acknowledged, lonely professionals on opposite sides of a business, and when the game comes to a final close, Carl goes a mile -- and further -- for Frank when most "kinder" agents would have let the chips fall where they may.<p>  Frank Jr. also tries to keep a tenuous connection with his father when he can, and Walken, in a few scenes, essays a broken, disillusioned man just about as well as an actor can. Frank Sr. barely hides his seething under the polish of his false optimism; Walken, as usual, gives his lines an ever-changing, jazzlike cadence; his performances are mysteries all themselves. He's beautiful in this movie. <p> And look at DiCaprio! So cautious in both "The Beach" and "Gangs of New York," Leo seems to have refound the confidence the groove he flaunted in his early career. The role suits him -- DiCaprio still looks like a boy, so playing young is easy -- and it may, in fact, turn out to be one of his best roles. DiCaprio, because of his face and voice, will always struggle with movies on the other side of the track; better he should play to his good looks and his easy-to-smile demeanor. Frank Abagnale is a Cary Grant/Jimmy Stewart kind of guy, and DiCaprio can be their heir, should he want the mantle. "Catch Me If You Can" is a hell of a start.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>An enormously entertaining movie from the master of cinema Stephen Spielberg. This has got to be the 4th best movie of 2002! Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a dazzling young con man who spent four years impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer--all before he turned 21. All the while he's pursued by a dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty ), whose dogged determination stays one step behind Abagnale's spontaneous wits. Both DiCaprio and Hanks turn in enjoyable performances and the movie has a bouncy rhythm that keeps it zipping along. However, it never gets under the surface of Frank's drive to lose himself in other identities, other than a simplistic desire to please his father. In my oppinion, this is a must see for anyone that has good taste. ...if I were you I'd get out there and see this movie as soon as possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>In this film Steven Spielberg wants to entertain us with a simple plot, a simple situation, a great chase around the world. He wants to entertain us with two characters who are highly attractive. The young man who becomes a criminal because his father is harrassed by the IRS and whose wife is stolen away by his best friend can easily become a symbol of fighting back, resilience, rebellion, intelligence against a system that tries to crush all those who may be antisocial, or just appear to be antisocial. The second character of the cop who is chasing this young man is just as attractive. Divorced, having lost wife and daughter, abandoned and isolated in his personal life, living the life of a hermit, of a monk of the law against crime, he easily becomes a father substitute to the young man and chases him with real paternal care and even maybe love. This relation between the criminal and the cop is amazingly reassuring. The young criminal becomes a hero because he attacks the economic system and is more intelligent than the businessmen and CEOs of this system. The cop becomes a hero because he is not viciously chasing a criminal he is ready to kill if necessary, but he chases him to protect him against his own desire to fool the system, and to give him the opportunity to really become ? social ? by using his talent and his intelligence against the criminals who attack the system. This will lead me to the conclusion on this point : this film is in a way a denunciation of the economic and political system that tries to destroy its opponents by all means available, including in their private life, due to a total lack of ethics on the side of the proponents of this system. Why does our system produce such a phenomenal highjacking of intelligence into crime ? But the film also has another interest. Leonardo Di Caprio reveals himself as able to impersonate many characters and personalities in this film and this is the proof that he is improving and developing. He is able to become, in the near future, a good and even great actor, provided his body and face are put aside and his acting talent is emphasized. That is all the more important because he is getting old and will no longer be able to play the handsome and lovable teenagers he has played so often. He is entering the real profession : he is enabled by this film to show that he can act with his soul and not only with his body.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>This film was very drawn out and there were some very unecessary parts in there that if they would have left out...we still would have gotten the jist of the film.

Which of the three is "Frank William Abagnale", the most daring confidence man under nineteen? He was caught in 1969 France and extradited to America. In 1963 his father Frank Sr. spoke at a Rotary dinner about his life. Later he got a loan from a bank but the family moved to an apartment. [Note the locks on the door.] Frank Jr. goes to a new high school, and impersonates the teacher of a French class! There is a surprise visitor at home, but Frank won't tell. His grandmother comes for a visit, his parents are divorcing. "Everything will be ok." "Is it ok if I write you a check?" Frank uses forged identification to pass a bad check (and failing). He studied the actions of airline pilots and learned their jargon. Next he orders a uniform. [Note the period automobiles on the street.] Frank has no problems in cashing checks or paying by check now. He forges another check.<br /><br />By knowing the jargon the "Skywayman" gets a free airplane ride as a deadhead. Frank learns the technical details of bank checking. He bought a used checkwriter machine to create authenticity. The MICR routing is in the numbers, a check from across the country won't be bounced for two weeks. Now the FBI is looking for him. His father has troubles with the IRS. An FBI team follows the forged checks to a motel; he is still there! There is a surprising meeting in the motel room. [There is unconscious humor here.] FBI agent Carl Hanratty has seen his face and can identify him. Later he buys new suits and meets a former model. "How much would you pay?" Frank has another check handy. On Christmas he makes a personal call to Carl Hanratty. "You're gonna get caught." A young waiter gives Carl a clue from a comic book - "he's a kid", his prints aren't in the system! They make a list of runaways and start a search. Frank's mother has a yearbook with his picture in it. "$1.3 million."<br /><br />Frank is living in an apartment in Atlanta. He goes to a hospital and meets a nurse. [Kindness can work with strangers.] "You have really nice teeth." "I'm a doctor." Frank's new forged identity is a graduate of Harvard Medical School. Frank Connors was at the top of his class. He watches TV movies about medical practice. But he has to answer an emergency call for a bloody accident. In NY Hanratty visits Frank Sr. and read the return address on a letter. [What, no mail cover?] Brenda tells about her past. Frank can help her, he meets her parents. "That was beautiful." [He can tell good stories.] "The dog was dead." Brenda's father wants the truth." [Can a trial lawyer detect when a witness is lying?] Frank tells him the truth: he is nothing, really. How did he pass the bar exam in Louisiana?<br /><br />Frank is now an Assistant Prosecutor. But this time he gets his knowledge from a "Perry Mason" episode and makes a mistake. ["The Case of the Jealous Journalist" was first shown on Sept. 2, 1961.] Frank visits his father and learns the news about his mother. He makes another call to Hanratty. "Stop chasing me." "It's my job." Hanratty knows "he can't change his name now". Men in dark suits crash the engagement party. Frank tells Brenda about his other names and identities. "Why would you lie to me?" Frank slips out by a window. At the airport Frank observes the watchers. Next he visits a college to impersonate an airline recruiter; it's a plan to escape surveillance! Frank flies to Europe and forges better checks with older equipment.<br /><br />But Hanratty surmises Frank is in France and living in his mother's village. "That was really good, Carl." Can Frank escape from an airplane in the air? Not for long. Frank got twelve years, to be served in isolation. "Merry Christmas, Frank." Afterwards Frank offers advice to Hanratty on detecting forged checks. He is offered a job to help them. There is a final scene in the airport. "Nobody is chasing you." "How did he do it?"<br />The words at the end said Frank helped the FBI capture some of the world's most elusive check forgers and counterfeiters, and is considered a foremost authority on bank fraud and forgery. Frank also redesigned many of the secure checks used by today's banks. [Did the trauma of his parents' divorce force him to take the wrong path?]</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>A well polished film based on the true story of a con-artist who for a time outsmarted the allmighty F.B.I. in his forgery and circulation of false cashier's checks.<br /><br />The film is a light drama surrounding the character of Leonardo DiCaprio who finds himself on his own at an early age.  He soon learns that he has good skills in being a con-man and forging checks to get paid. He continues this scam for years but the F.B.I. under an agent played by Tom Hanks is on his tail.  The U.S. being too hot, he soon goes in hiding in France to continue his life of crime.<br /><br />This is a great film in every sense.  It is a touching drama but remains on the humorous note throughout the film.  DiCaprio played his role very well as did Christopher Walken as his father.  Tom Hanks essentially played himself as always but at least his mediocre acting skills did not tarnish the film in anyway as his character was as rigid as Joe Friday.  This is a good film to watch by the entire family: check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>An amusing if overdrawn double martini blend of scams and flirtation that etches its light-hearted arc with good old fashioned tale of a lovable rogue pursued relentlessly by a single-minded cop, who over time develops a paternalistic interest in his prey.<br /><br />The touchy feely moments are fortunately never too campy and the cheeky ones never too risque. Most of the Oh-so-cool pilot moments are probably a bit dated (pilots being little more than commercial chauffers today, unlike their glam roles 30 years ago) but De Caprio oozes a dark chocolate blend of slick charm and lonely-boy vulnerability.<br /><br />The opening sequence (of title credits) has a fabulously artistic Saul Bass type sketch video that alone is worth the price of the dvd. Which is great because the DVD has fairly few features otherwise.<br /><br />Don't expect a classic, but for a breezy evening to pass the time, catch this if you can.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>I heard about this story back in 1980 when the book came out.  So naturally, I was very interested in how the movie would play out.  The story of Frank W. Abagnale is told with some humor and some melodrama by Director Steven Spielberg.  DiCaprio and Hanks give very good performances in this unbelievable, but true tale.  Not one of Spielberg's best, but very entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>I was surprised to find that this movie entertained me. Not that I was expecting it to be horrible, but I definitely was not expecting anything truly entertaining. I am not much of a Leonardo diCaprio fan, so I am skeptical anytime I see one of his films. However, he did very well in his role, and conveyed both the excitement and anxiety of being someone in his position (pretending and always on the run to be one step ahead of the law). Also appealing were Tom Hanks and the actors portraying diCaprio's parents, Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye.<p>A couple of things annoyed me though (because something inevitably does): 1. Jennifer Garner. I don't care how popular she becomes. I find her miserably annoying. 2. The strange and too long intro to the movie with stick figure drawings. It, oddly enough, practically tells the whole story... and as I said, goes on for too long.</p></br><a href="../users/AR2DE47VCY1C8.html">AR2DE47VCY1C8</a><br/><p>This movie purports to be about an actual person, Frank Abagnale, Jr., who posed more or less successfully as an airline pilot, teacher, physician, lawyer, and Secret Service agent (not in that order) before he turned 21.<p><p>It begins in a television studio, with three people all claiming to be the real Frank Abagnale, leaving the audience to judge who the real one is, but never returns to that sequence, and doesn't finish it.<p><p>I remember seeing just such a TV show years ago, which showed just such an imposter, but whose name I've forgotten.  I remember that he posed as a surgeon in the Canadian Navy, where he actually removed an apprendix successfully, and as a professor at St. Martin's college outside Olympia, Washington.<p><p>I don't remember all of the other details or parts he played, but I suspect that he was the trigger character for this movie.  If so, this was highly fictionalized, although the original story was supposedly written by Abagnale himself (the real con man).<p><p>Steven Spielberg produced and directed Catch Me If You Can, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing a 17-year-old as the lead whose mother and father are splitting up, and eventually divorce.  The mother is cheating on his father, depicted as a romantic loser by Martin Sheen.  The FBI agent that is tailing Abagnale is very well portrayed by Tom Hanks.  DiCaprio, Sheen, and Hanks all turn in good peformances.<p><p>The impostor that I saw on the TV show I later heard dropped out of sight, and apparently went back to his old tricks.  In the movie, Abagnale was sentenced to do 12 years in federal prison for bouncing a couple of million bucks worth of bad checks, but then was hired by the FBI to help them catch other "paper hangers."<p><p>The denouement stated that Abagnale eventually was married, had children, and was living "happily ever after."<p><p>It sounds too much like the character I saw on TV to be coincidental, but that guy was not a 17-year-old.

Maybe Abagnale was a "copy cat." <p> <p>As another reviewer has said, Spielberg does not sufficiently delve into to details of how Abagnale pulled off his impersonations (it all looks far too easy), nor his motivation.<p><p>All in all, it was an entertaining film.<p><p>Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Catch Me If You Can is based on the true life story of one of the most successful con artists in history - Frank Abagnale Jr. ( Leonardo Dicaprio). Frank is able to assume several different identities including a Secret Service agent, an airline pilot, a doctor, and a history professor to cash more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks in the United States, as well as 26 other countries.  Carl Hanratty ( Tom Hanks) is the lead FBI agent in the Checks Fraud division that is tracking Abagnale, and is determined to take him down no matter what. "Catch Me If You Can" takes us on an exciting and extremely entertaining cat and mouse chase between the two men. <p>"Catch Me If You Can" is without a doubt the best film I have seen in the last couple of years. The film's screenplay was an extremely accurate adaptation of the book that was written by Frank himself. The story was absolutely perfect to bring to the big screen, simply because of how successfull Frank was. He managed to accomplish everything before he was 19. The overall direction from Stephen Spielberg was amazing. The film is paced extremely well, and even though it is almost 2 1/2 hours running, the film never seems long or drawn out. The set designs were also extremely authentic, and Spielberg was able to get the best performances possible out of the actors. <p>The overall cast was just great in this movie. Each actor was the perfect choice for their particular role. I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. But I must admit, that he turned in an outstanding performance and captured the true essance of Frank Abignale Jr. He is cunning, intelligent, and witty. This let him play the different identities of lawyer, teacher, doctor, etc, so convincingly. Tom Hanks was brilliant as Carl Hanratty. He will amaze you with the determination he gives in tracking Abignale. Hanks will also make you laugh because of his Boston accent, and also because of how extremely naive he can be at times. At one point, Abignale is able to convince Carl that he is a Secret Service agent working on the case. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Jennifer Gardner ( TV's "Alias"), and the rest of the cast put in top notch performances as well. Finally, the film is extremely fun to watch and down right hillarious. I was laughing for the majority of the film, and I actually had a good time watching Frank from one moment to the next. <p>"Catch Me If You Can" was easily the best film of 2002. The film provides - an extremely authentic portrayal of Frank Abignale Jr.'s life, wonderful performances, masterful directing from Spielberg, and non-stop laughs. Not to mention the DVD has some pretty good extras as well. I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>Although this movie is about 20 minutes longer than most, it keeps your attention. Not in an action-packed way like a typical summer blockbuster and not a real intellectual movie, it is a good combination of action, intelligence and the unexpected. To know that it is fact-based only adds to the drama. Hanks does a good job, as he almost always does. DiCaprio outdoes his normal acting and has moved himself up a level (although this is certainly not as popular a movie as his other ones that won him recognition). This is also a good movie for dates.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>If you want to relax for 2 hours and a half, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is a good choice. The movie has a fast rhythm, funny jokes, good performances, nice music and comical situations, so you should have a good time with this one.<br /><br /> Loosely based in the autobiographical novel by Frank Abagnale, the movie follows the steps of young Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), a nice kid with great abilities to passing himself as an older man. One day Frank escapes from home with very few dollars, so now he starts to passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney.<br /><br /> Eventually Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. When the FBI notices this, an agent is designed to chase Frank, that man is Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).<br /><br /> &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is a very funny movie, perhaps the ending is not very convincing, but most of the segments are amusing. The music is just great, the costumes and the little details are perfect, so what else can you ask, the movie is pure entertainment.<br /><br /> The DVD extras are also very amusing; the behind the cameras features are very informative, the interviews contribute to understand better the process that was followed to complete the film, so a good movie and good DVD extras make &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; a good choice.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This movie is not a standard &quot;cop catches a thief&quot; story.  I don't think Steven Spielberg wants us to dislike or hate the thief and that, we want justice to be done towards the end by having the cop getting the culprit.  Rather, he shares with us Leonardo's character's family background, about his parent's divorce, about a young innocent boy that is forced to grow up too fast to fend for himself.  All along, Leonardo's character has a affectionate relationships with his father (played convincingly by the ever brilliant Christopher Walken) &amp; there is a tell-tale sign in the movie that his X-factor is passed on by his father.  Maybe, Leonardo's character enjoys acting different characters so that he can escape from reality &amp; that, he wants to make a lot of money to justify to his parents that they don't need to worry about financial security anymore &amp; that they needn't have to worry about the very thing that separates them at the first place.  That's why in the end, all we have for Leonardo's character is utmost sympathy.  Sympathy is what Tom Hank's character gives Leonardo's character &amp; maybe, that's why they share this chemistry or bond that can be read in between the lines.  It's refreshing to see Martin Sheen NOT playing US President for a change.  A truly enjoyable movie to watch &amp; an affirmation of Steven Spielberg's versatility in directing different genres of movies.  Highly recommended &amp; shouldn't be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>Catch Me if You Can is a entertaining movie about a young man who takes the identity of numerous occupations, including pilot, doctor, and many others, and is being pursued by the FBI.  Frank Abagnale JR(DiCaprio) does all this as a way to impress his father, played to perfection by Christopher Walken.  The movie follows the FBI's pursuit of the young crook over the period of four years.  This is a good movie with not much to it, but is still worth a view.<p> The actors in this movie are what make it as good as it is.  DiCaprio is very good as Abagnale with Hanks his usual excellent self as Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent in pursuit of Abagnale.  Walken was very deserving of his Oscar nomination for his role as DiCaprio's father.  At times he is funny and then other times you feel so bad for him.  During some conversations, I couldn't help but think this was a lot like the relationship between Biff and Willy Loman.  The DVD is packed full of extras that give a lot of coverage to behind the scenes stuff.

I thought he was a sissy (Man in the Iron Mask, Titanic, Romeo and Juliet). He really surprised me with this one though. I am very surprised that he didn't even get an oscar nomination. Tom Hanks did a fine job too. Everybody can expect that! The best role of the whole film though went to Christopher Walken, playing as DiCaprio's Father who became a total loser. Chris Walken was amazing. It truly was his best role since his oscar-winning performance in "The Deer Hunter" in 1978. Stephen Spielberg is an impressive director who always comes through. "Catch Me if you Can" is among the finest con artist movies I've seen. I can't wait until May 6th to buy the dvd. This isn't something that really young kids should see, nor would they enjoy it.

CATCH ME IF YOU CAN brings to mind Tony Curtis as Ferdinand Waldo Demarra of THE GREAT IMPOSTER.  However, in Curtis' case, his quest for identity was vaguely undefined as he sloughed his skins more for the sheer joy of it than for any other ostensible purpose.  Leonardo DiCaprio made it clear early on that his own quest was based on a need to restore his moral universe, one in which was threatened by the dissolution of his parents' marriage.  DiCaprio, as Frank Abagnale,Jr, idolized his parents.  When they danced, the joy in his eyes was unmistakable.  It was when they stopped dancing, that the world of marital discord intruded.  Christopher Walken, as Frank's con man father, gives a powerful performance as a smooth talking yet ineffective businessman whose only success in life was to have married a desirable Frenchwoman some twenty years earlier.  It is Walken's constant harping of his landing her that, over the years, became the central mantra for his son's life.  In the young Frank's eyes, his mother became a symbol of all that was noble and beautiful, and if it were a lack of money and success that doomed his father to lose her, then it became his own mission in life to reconnect them.  All of the scams that Frank Jr. pulled off are seen not as to enrich his own wallet, but to act as the glue to reestablish the natural order of things.  DiCaprio's most touching scenes are the most easily overlooked. In a restaurant, he is dressed as a co-pilot, treating his father to a fancy meal.  During the conversation, in front of his father's astonished eyes, he casually pushes the keys to a brand new Cadillac parked just outside.  "Take them, Dad," he pleads, "won't Mom be impressed."  There are many scenes like that which allow Frank to make it clear that his crimes of theft and forgery mask a talent that under different circumstances might have allowed him to be in  the flesh those fake uniformed superficial entities that now register in the mind as the prototypical demi-gods that ruled the television screens of the 60s.  <p>Tom Hanks, as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, registers as a sort of combination of pseudo-father figure whose respect Frank wishes with a more than subtle undertone as Frank's Dr. Richard Kimble to Carl's Detective Gerard.  But unlike that fugitive, this one plays his escapes with style and a sense of not wishing to blend in.  Where Dr. Kimble sought work as dishwashers, Frank Abagnale flew only in the highest stratospheres of our cultures.  Not only did he want the job of pilot, doctor, and lawyer, he wanted their badge and uniform too. This connection of Carl Hanratty as father-confessor and father-surrogate slowly accrues its own kinetic energy until by the film's end, the bond between Frank and Carl was at least as strong as the one that Frank tried so hard to forge with his own father.  By the time the closing credits roll, Frank shows that the simple respect that one human being can feel for another can be enough to turn around a life that for a few short years seemed headed for a tragedy that this film thankfully avoided.  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of the most entertaining films of the year that in its own way points out the need for people to connect in a manner not unlike that Jimmy Stewart posited in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>Catch Me If You Can<br />10 Of 10<br />I Really Liked This Movie Allot.

Two Huge Thumbs Way Way Up.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>Spielberg opens his holiday offering with a narrative frame of his protagonist appearing on an episode of "To Tell the Truth," intercutting shots of DiCaprio with 30-year-old footage of "guest" Kitty Carlisle and "host" Joe Garagiola from the actual television show. A nice device for "motivating" the story and establishing a sense of place and "realness"--but also one that sets up an expectation in the audience: will Kitty make the right call? <p>Spielberg's script never returns to this framing moment. A small detail perhaps, but this film, like most of Spielberg's work, takes great pride in the details, the verisimilitude of time and place--from Nehi pop bottles to Mitch Miller's television show to the continuous use on the soundtrack of popular music hits of the day. The problem is not so much that many of these details are anachronisms, or just sufficiently "off" to be bothersome, but that the slowness of plotting and thinness of characterization allowed me to dwell on them in the first place.  Hanks' role calls for him to be a straight-arrow caricature with his face upstaged by large glasses and his deportment deferring to his padded mid-section; DiCaprio, too, is about surfaces, incapable of suggesting any of the addictive giddiness of the successful imposter or con artist.  The biggest surprise in the film may well be the nuanced, sensitive performance of Christopher Walken who, as Frank's blustering, conning father, is at once wholly believable and sympathetic.<p>The film will no doubt do decent business. Not only is it a star vehicle for two of the screen's biggest attractions but Spielberg pulls on all of the middle-class family-value strings that are his trademark, and he combines the genre of the loveable imposter with that of the persevering bounty hunter who bonds with his praiseworthy prey. Moreover, unlike George W. and Osama, Hanks gets his man. But at 2 hours and 20 minutes the film feels like it owes us more--at the very least the satisfaction of knowing whether Kitty Carlisle got her man.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>After the excellent &quot;Minority Report&quot;, Spielberg returns with something completely different in &quot;Cath Me If You Can&quot;.

Unfortunately, this stylish story about a burglar (Leonardo Di Caprio) and his persecutor (Tom Hanks) isn`t all that appealing and becomes just another popcorn flick with a few nice twists. Sure, the direction and acting are great, the soundtrack cool enough and overall it`s a decent time-capsule picture, however it`s way too long and gets predictable and repetitive. The characters aren`t as deep as they want to be and as a whole the movie lacks substance. Anyway, it still is watchable, there`s a lot worse out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, the latest opus so far from the cinema's greatest living director Steven Spielberg, is a highly inventive crime caper movie based on real life.<p>Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Frank Abagnale, a kid from Long Island who ran away from a broken home and worked his way to riches by impersonating everyone from airline pilots to doctors to lawyers and forging checks to the tune of $4 million during a three-year spree in the 1960s.  Tom Hanks, reliable as always, portrays Carl Hanratty, the FBI man hot on his trail from coast to coast who eventually tracks him down in France.  The process by which DiCaprio is able to manage not only to forge checks but also his own identity is done with considerable wit and humor; and the cat-and-mouse game between him and Hanks closely resembles Hitchcock at his prime.<p>Spielberg obviously identified with Abagnale and his saga, since the director himself told some pretty tall tails in his youth to break into Hollywood, including lying about his age.  As a result, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, like a lot of Spielberg's work, has a deep personal resonance to it.  But Spielberg also devotes time to Hanks' FBI agent's dilligence in pursuing the elusive Abagnale.  The film's witty title sequence, made to look like the film itself was actually made in the early 1960s, and John Williams' jazzy score (in the manner of Henry Mancini's great film scores from the 60s), prove to be the icing on the cake.<p>Long and deliberately paced but never dull, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of the best films of 2002, and yet another great movie in the Spielberg canon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>"Catch Me If You Can," directed by Steven Spielberg, is based on the real life story of Frank Abagnale. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Abagnale, a young con artist who successfully masquerades as an airline pilot (among other professions) and passes off forged checks in the course of his travels. Tom Hanks portrays the nerdy but dedicated FBI agent who relentlessly pursues young Abagnale.<p>"Catch Me" opens with a great, atmospheric animated sequence that is perfectly complemented by John Williams' score. The movie as a whole is an excellent blend of suspense, human drama, and laughs. Although the film deals with some very serious themes, the tone is largely light and fun. Abagnale conducts his scams during the 1960s and the film makes superb use of period music, film, clothing, and cars: it's great fun to look at and listen to.<p>The performances, script, and direction are first rate. The story is told in a very effective non-chronological fashion. DiCaprio shines in this lead role; he brings a nice mix of charm, brains, and boyish enthusiasm to the character. Hanks' likeable character is an excellent foil for DiCaprio's. Special mention should be made of Christopher Walken's witty yet touching performance as young Abagnale's father. Overall, I found this to be one of the most enjoyable, skillfully crafted, and satisfying films of 2002.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Let's see.  A young con man impersonates an airline co-pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer; in the process, he cashes over four million dollars in bad checks.  When he's finally arrested, convicted, and imprisoned, he is released early to go to work for the FBI.<p>Is this a great country or what?<p>Stephen Spielberg's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), who conned his way to outrageous fortune before he was even old enough to buy a beer.  The Abagnale family is on the cusp of implosion, and when his parents finally split, do does Frank, Jr.  As a 16-year-old living on his own, he quickly learns one thing:  as long as you can write a check, you can survive another day.<p>DiCaprio at last sheds his bubblegum "Titanic" image and turns in an impressive performance.  He shows some remarkable range in a role that is fundamentally and inherently complex.  Tom Hanks is solid as FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, who stubbornly and relentlessly pursues Abagnale from one con to the next.  But it is Christopher Walken as Frank, Sr. who steals the show; Walken effectively portrays the senior Abagnale as a shrewd, yet vulnerable businessman overwhelmed with financial troubles--a con man himself who is pleased with his son's daring duplicity.<p>I would have liked for the film to dive deeper into the ingenious machinations of Frank, Jr's check forging ability, and the Sixties Retro opening credits are so annoying I almost walked out then and there.  Yet CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, not even close to Spielberg's best work, is still very entertaining, and well worth a visit to your local cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>When the idea for a film surfaced in the creative mind of director Steven Spielberg concerning the amazing activities of Frank Abagnale Jr. there might have been more than a little bit of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu involved.  It was Spielberg who, as a young man fascinated by film, talked his way past Universal Studios security guards to watch films being made.<br /><br />Leonardo Di Caprio as Abagnale Jr. interviews a Pan American Airways supervisor to learn about the careers of their pilots for the ostensible purpose of writing an article for his high school paper.  In reality he is seeking to learn enough about the lives and activities of Pan Am pilots so he can successfully impersonate them.  Couple his skillful impersonations alongside a genius for manufacturing bogus checks and the FBI was left reeling while he drained millions from the banking system.  His cover as a pilot provides him with the opportunity to cash checks in cities all over the world.<br /><br />Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. plummets from a commanding community position as a successful businessman in New Rochelle, New York to a life in which he is compelled to scrap for his next meal.  It all happens after he has troubles with the Internal Revenue Service and winds up under the oppressive yolk of owing a huge amount of money.  After the Abagnales leave their mansion and move into a small apartment the marriage of Walken to his attractive French born wife, whom he had met during World War Two, ends abruptly in divorce.  She promptly marries Walken's lawyer friend from the New Rochelle Rotary Club, played by James Brolin, as Di Caprio's world becomes  shaken.<br /><br />Di Caprio had seen his father engage in shady manipulations, and so he put some of his father's techniques to use along with his own additions.  Soon it becomes obvious that Walken was a rank amateur compared to his son, who has a genius for white-collar crime.<br /><br />The film's dramatic high point and chief story thread is the battle between Di Caprio to stay out of prison and hard working New York FBI agent Tom Hanks to put him there.  Hanks is divorced and so literally married to his job that the white collar criminal is able to consistently reach him in his office on Christmas Eve.  They develop a respect for each other over time, with Hanks admiring Di Caprio's brilliant skills, one of which is master escapist every time that he and his colleagues close in, with the criminal admiring the FBI agent's idealistic tenacity.<br /><br />The film, based on the true life exploits of Abagnale, heads toward the inevitable result of a confrontation where the criminal is arrested.  It happens under the most dramatic circumstances in France.  The story then takes another turn late in the film when the FBI realizes that it can use the criminal's white-collar criminal skills as a means of preventing  future crimes.<br /><br />In real life Abagnale abandoned his criminal ways after doing his time, making large sums of money by consulting the corporate world in the area he knew best, that of security.  Ironically Abagnale began by costing the corporate world millions and ultimately ended up by saving it millions.<br /><br />Martin Sheen has a role as a father whose daughter wants to marry Di Caprio.  The wily young man of many identities meets her as a presumed "emergency room supervising doctor" and then swiftly switches to lawyer after passing the Louisiana State Bar.  He then goes to work as an assistant prosecutor in the office headed by Sheen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>"Catch Me If You Can" is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, the most successful conman in history. By the age of 19, Frank had already posed as a pilot for Pan Am, paraded around as a medical doctor, and fooled everyone by taking an on-the-side-job as a lawyer. (By the way, he faked a Harvard-graduate diploma to become one.) During this time he cashed fraudulent checks at various banks around the country, and eventually around various places in the world. His is an amazing story, and this film is based on it.<p>There's no real plot to go into, as I have already given it to you. Other than telling you that the film opens when Frank is sixteen and runs away from home after his parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) have a messy divorce, you pretty much have the setup for a light, fluffy, and altogether fun film.<p>Frank is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the man hot on his trail, agent Carl Hanratty, is played by Tom Hanks. There isn't really a Carl Hanratty in real life, but it adds to the story. Frank, on the run, actually starts to become friends with Hanratty, who realizes Frank is just an adolescent and does not realize the eventual outcomes of what he is doing. Hanratty sort of adopts Frank, even after he is caught and thrown in a French prison. He helps him get transferred to an American prison, and then even gets him a job in the FBI for spotting fraudulent checks.<p>I read Frank William Abagnale, Jr.'s true-crime memoir, which was released a few decades ago. It differs from the film at times, and it isn't always as light-hearted as the film is. But in terms of pure, fluffy fun at the movies, "Catch Me If You Can" is a sure-fire hit. At times it seems to stray a bit too far off the path of realism, unlike the book, but that's part of the fun, really.<p>The film is entirely watchable, and doesn't try to become an epic. Steven Spielberg creates a real dazzler here; it is effortlessly watchable and even at two and a half hours long, it doesn't become overbearing. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and, unlike most critics, I thought Tom Hanks did a great job in his role. <p>I especially like how Spielberg captured the image of the '60s so well here, and John Williams' score fits the part of the film very well. And as for the cast, they are all matched perfectly to their characters. I especially liked Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr., who steals every scene he is in. His performance was worthy of its Oscar nom. <p>If you just want to sit back and relax, "Catch Me If You Can" is the perfect film for you. There's nothing all that special in the film, but the film kind of becomes special because it is so easy to watch. I recommend "Catch Me If You Can" to anyone who can enjoy a movie for what it is. <p>"Catch Me If You Can" is a true popcorn flick, and maybe a little bit more.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed this movie.  The relationship between DiCaprio and Christopher Walken is almost as good as the one between DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.  The bond between them is not immediately apparent and it is highly unorthodox, but, by the end, you completely believe the friendship that has arisen before our eyes.<br /><br />The plot itself is very interesting, and I have to say that the ending was not what I expected.  The film definitely delivers, and, other than "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," this was the first movie that I really liked DiCaprio in.  I found his work to be the weak link in "Gangs of New York."  Hanks, of course, is outstanding once again.<br /><br />Lastly, the film has some very picturesque moments, such as the scene with the 8 old school stewardesses escorting the main character through the Miami airport as Sinatra's song massages our ears in the background.  This one is certainly unique as it has a retro, yet not dated, feel to it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) had an easy life in New York during the 1960's.  He was the only child of his parents and his father (Christopher Walkin) made a decently living from owning a store.<br /><br />All that came crashing down around him when the IRS came calling demanding more money.  As things got more and more dire, his mother (Nathalie Baye) filed for divorce.  Suddenly forced to choose between his two parents, Frank took off instead with the clothes on his back and a checkbook with a balance of $25.<br /><br />Even though Frank was only 16 at the time, he was also brilliant.  He quickly figured out how to cash checks for more then he had.  That led to forging checks, which led to taking jobs as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor, all without even a high school diploma.<br /><br />But things weren't all fun and games.  FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) was on his tale.  Can Carl catch Frank?<br /><br />The movie starts out rather slowly.  Watching Frank begin his life of crime is only interesting for a little while, but it takes much longer then it should.<br /><br />Once Carl really gets into the picture and the two start their cat and mouse games the tension really picks up.  And it is hard to know who to root for, Frank to get away or Carl to capture him.  The two actors do a great job of making their characters real and sympathetic.<br /><br />The movie is based on a true story.  Since this is Hollywood, that means take with a shaker of salt.  But it is still interesting to think of a teen really being able to pull this off.  Naturally, with the advent of computer banking and added security, he'd have to work much harder to even think of pulling all this off today.<br /><br />This movie starts as a slow character study but builds into a chase movie with heart.  It's not a movie to rush out and watch, but if you are interested, give it a whirl.  Odds are you'll be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>Let me start by saying I am not a DiCaprio fan at all, in fact I can hardly stand the sight of him.

No matter what role he plays, he's like a little kid showing off.  I just couldn't get engaged with his character or really care.  Christopher Walken, however, made me feel the upset of his situation as we see him change from a self-confident business executive into a beaten man.

We are told at the very beginning that this movie is inspired by the book, which means that there are changes in both the events of the book as well as the characters.  All this means is that the filmmakers chose to tell a slightly different story than was Abagnale presented in the book.  It doesn't make the movie any less truthful.  <p>This is the story of con man Frank Abagnale, Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio).  The movie starts with Abagnale in a French prison and being released into the custody of FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  Throughout the film we switch back between Abagnale conning and running from the law to Abagnale and Hanratty talking on the plane.  It offers a nice change of pace as well as a continued questioning of how Abagnale got caught.  <p>We flash back to Abagnale before he leaves home.  He is devoted to his father (Christopher Walken), and is deeply hurt by the divorce and the court requirement that he make the choice of which parent he wants to live with.  Instead, Abagnale chooses neither and runs away to New York City.  Thus begins his life of the con (though there is a suggestion that he had been doing some check/credit card conning before he runs away).  Surprisingly, the movie strays from focusing on Frank Abagnale himself but spends just as much (or more) time on Carl Hanratty and the hunt to catch Abagnale.  <p>Hanratty is a somewhat geeky FBI Agent.  He is very serious and very devoted to his job of catching check frauds like Abagnale.  He is good at his job, but Abagnale leads Hanratty on a long chase over most of the country (and the world) before ending in France.  The film shows as Hanratty discovers more clues as to where Abagnale is, but never quite manages to catch up to him.  There is the yearly Christmas Eve phone call from Abagnale to Hanratty (because both end up alone on Christmas).  <p>We do get to see some of the cons that Frank Abagnale pulls off, but we never quite see his preparation or learn the reason why Abagnale is conning.  It takes something away from an otherwise excellent movie.  <p>I would recommend this movie as I thought it was quite good, but if I had to choose between Abagnale's book and the movie, I would take the book any day of the week.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>if not for the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio in the lead role this could well have been a near-great movie.  unfortunately leo (who i will admit does look better here than at any time since "titanic") gives yet another of his oh so obvious acting jobs: his attempt at a suburban new york accent is as painful as his vocal tricks in "gangs of new york" -- where does this guy get off trying this stuff, as if he were a classically trained brit actor?  now to the good: tom hanks offers his most ingratiating performance in years (ever since he started to specialize in being tom hanks) as the sullen fbi agent who tracks down master forger leo; christopher walken is at his wierd best as the fallen idol father; the john williams score grabs you from the opening and never lets go.  while the story requires a bigtime suspension of disbelief, it IS fun to imagine someone getting away with some of this stuff (as skewed thru the young mans eyes) rather than the reality of the desperation which compelled him to live his decade on the run.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>This comedy is the best I have seen in years.

I didn't find it impressive that some teenage con-artist was frauding corporate America, which inevitably the tax payers have to front the bill for.  I didn't find his character likable, charming or intelligent, which "Catch Me If You Can" tried to convey to it's audience.  I also believe that this film totally exaggerated what really happened.  I find it hard to believe he did half the stuff he did in the movie.  The acting was overdone and horrible for lack of a better word.  It seemed like everyone in this movie was just soaking up the limelight and loving every minute of it.  Less is more, ever hear of that cliche?  I was hoping Leonardo's character was going to get caught sooner. This would have made the film shorter, considering the 2 1/2 hours it lasted....what's up with that by the way?!?  I would have enjoyed more footage of him locked up in prison, paying for what he did.

It moves VERY slowly for the first hour or so, and failed to make me care very much about either of the two protagonists. Hanks is good in a basically undemanding role. DiCaprio is -- well, DiCaprio, charming and boyish -- and the script is oddly uncaring about the victims of Frank's Pranks. Worth renting if you are interested in con men, or a fan of Hanks or DiCaprio.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>The trailers and the graphics used to promote &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; make this movie seem like a light-hearted, cartoonish chase movie, but it's much more serious than that.  Director Spielberg delves into the psychology of a real-life con artist and impersonator, teenager Frank Abagnole Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), who runs away from a broken home and must rely on his wits, albeit illegally, to keep himself afloat.  As Frank's cons get more and more bold and skilled, the FBI agent on his tail, Hanratty (Tom Hanks), scrambles to outwit him.  The two form a unique relationship of the hunter and the chased, with Frank toying with Hanratty in scene after scene. What Frank doesn't expect is to find the love of his life and a close-knit family so unlike his own that he wants to remain in their midst.  <p>The best performances are the smaller supporting roles:  Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. and Martin Sheen as Frank Jr.'s father-in-law.  Di Caprio does a solid job with his part as a baby-faced, sweet-talking impersonator, but he rarely lets the complicated emotions surface.  Likewise, Tom Hanks is good as the agent obsessed with capturing Frank, but he doesn't add any magic to the role.  The soundtrack, with its cartoonish chase theme, helps lighten the film.<p>&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is a cross between &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Matchstick Men.&quot;  Frank's scams are often comically clever, but there is a dark underside to his story.  Its the darkness that creates the bond between Frank and the audience, as it's difficult not to feel for a young man who feels unloved and powerless.  As Frank gains confidence, he blossoms - and the audience roots for his happiness, even as we know it cannot last.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Dicaprio and Hanks star in this completely engrossing film based on a true story.

The picture frolics along for about an hour until, suddenly, it seemingly goes flat, even boring. And it's Hanks, working with the alacrity of Barnaby Jones and the acumen of Inspector Clousseau that's to blame. No recording devices, 3 agents at the party, no effective police backups, a literal crawl up the stairs at the party, a complete lack of aggressiveness, the ridiculous escape from Miami, all seem to point to a deliberate lengthening of the film.

Well, it is a crime thing and Tom Hanks is the cop (FBI) and Leo DiCaprio is the robber.  But it's anything but grim!  Speilberg chose to tell this story, which could have been tragic. in a completely light hearted way.  The only terrible scene is in the beginning when DiCaprio is languishing in a French prison.  From there on, it's all up.  The colors are bright, the atmosphere is light.  And yet there's a lot of depth to it, as well.  It talkes  a really good director to pull it off so well.<br /><br />First of all, the story is amazing!  We all know it's true; no one would make something like that up!  Then, the cast is all-star!  DiCaprio shines as a complex, tortured kid who is, at the same time, having the time of his life!  The relationships are touching and so well handled.  Christopher Walken is superb as the dad.  Tom Hanks plays the 'alternate" father---as serious and humorless as the first one was charming and irresponsible.

He came by it honestly because his father was a businessman and con artist, who helped teach him everything he knew.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is boyishly handsome, engaging and diabolical as Frank Abagnale, Jr.  Due to an unfortunate turn of events in his life (which I won't elaborate on, to spoil the plot), the young man turns to a life of pulling con job after con job, at just age sixteen.  Not only does he manage to make close to $2.5 million, but he finds love, fame and notoreity in the public eye, all the while eluding the advances of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI investigator hot on his trail.<br /><br />This film is intelligent, original and just superb (from the very engaging title credits, down to the intriguing conclusion).  You will definitely be entertained.......</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>While watching this excellently made movie, I found myself wondering "How can we feel sorry for this character?  He's a pathological liar; how can we like someone who has stolen over 4 million dollars, and doesn't know how to live HIS life?"  In spite of Leonardo diCaprio's smooth performance, I didn't find myself feeling sorry for his character. Since this is based on a true story, other things became evident:  the ineptness of the FBI in the pursuit of this con artist; the gullibility of hundreds of people who could accept this baby-faced boy as a doctor, lawyer, co-pilot; Steven Spielberg still knows how to make a movie great even when it's subject matter isn't.  With that said, you should enjoy the capers of this brilliant young man as he goes from life to life and ultimately ends up becoming a millionaire by helping the government find others like himself.  Hmm..crime might pay?  Christopher Walken is very good in his Oscar nominated role as Leo's father, a con man in his own right; Jennifer Garner pops up in a brief role as a very high class hooker; Amy Adams is fine as Leo's love interest and almost bride; Martin Sheen shines as Amy's romantic father; and of course, two time Oscar winner Tom Hanks shows why he's one of the finest actors of our generation in his role as the fiercely determined, if somewhat ineffective, Carl Handratty.  John Williams contributes a somewhat Mancini-ish score that adds to the caprice of the film.  While I can't admire Frank Abagnale Jr.'s activities, the movie is a good example of cinematic artistry.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>This film builds in entertainment value as it skips merrily along and possesses an unnerving quality, sure to upset the con in all of us, regarding true life famed forger Frank Abagnale Jr. being globally cornered and doggedly pursued by a determined and obsessed FBI agent. Director Steven Spielberg pictures an upscale, conservative and gaudy side of the 1960s, and DiCaprio is more than convincing as the gifted scam artist, who as Spielberg suggests, is only trying to find his way back home. Clever and amusing "Pink Panther" -like musical score by John Williams helps keep this criminal act a light-hearted affair.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>A boring story, make that VERY boring combined with the McActor himself: Tom Hanks makes this mess unwatchable. Spielberg pumping up this broken-down film with his bag of tricks only makes things worse.</p></br><a href="../users/AO3JW5VHT2GQ.html">AO3JW5VHT2GQ</a><br/><p>Summary:<br />Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young man in what he believes to be a very difficult situation - his father, Frank Abagnale, Sr. (Christopher Walken), is in trouble with the IRS and, as a result, his mother, Paula Abagnale (Nathalie Baye), is having an affair and wants a divorce.  Unable to handle the stress and not wanting to deal with the situation, Frank Jr. runs away from home.  <p>Unable to find a real job that will pay him what he needs, he turns to crime, but a type of crime that has some early roots in lessons learned by his father.  His crime spree begins as he realizes he can write people bad checks and get away with it.  However, the bad check scam only works for so long before people catch on.  Frank Jr. learns this rather quickly and, instead of continuing to write bad checks, turns to creating phony checks and cashing them at unwitting banks, realizing he can get away with it for much longer.  <p>His success at forging checks brings him to the attention of the FBI and their check fraud specialist, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  It is only through Carl's persistence that Frank Jr. is eventually caught, but not before Frank Jr. can try his hand at several other ploys.<p>Building on his deceptiveness in the check forging scam, Frank learns that people very seldom actually check your references and as long as you look the part, they are willing to let you play it.  Frank takes advantage of this fact by getting a Pan-Am pilot's uniform and flying millions of free miles in the jumpseat of airplanes.  Once he becomes aware that Pan-Am is catching on he leaves the pilot business and forges the necessary credentials to become an emergency room supervising doctor that only requires him to make sure the residents under him take care of everything.  This job is short-lived however, and he trades it in for a job as a lawyer when he falls in love with a successful, New Orleans attorney's (Martin Sheen) daughter, Brenda Strong (Amy Adams (III)).<p>He actually tries to adopt this life permanently, but his past catches up to him and eventually he has to flee to Europe to escape Carl, but to no avail.  Despite being caught after a multi-million dollar and several year crime spree, Carl eventually devises a plan to get Frank out of jail early and put him to work in the check fraud division at the FBI, where Frank Jr. eventually builds a very successful career.<p>My Comments:<br />I thought I was going to have a problem with this movie in the very beginning when Leonardo DiCaprio's name was before Tom Hanks's name in the opening credits, but I quickly realized that it was justifiable - this is not a Tom Hanks movie, it is a DiCaprio movie to the core and very good one at that.<p>If the movie wasn't based on a true story (though embellished no doubt), it would fall into the absolutely unbelievable category of movies and I probably would not have given it as as good of a rating as I did.  Throughout the movie my wife and I were incredulous that something like this could actually have happened.  I haven't done enough research to actually discover what was real and what was embellished, but even if one-tenth of what happened in the movie was real this is still a fascinating story.  Of course, as with most movies where you are rooting for the criminal, it does kind of turn the tables on justice, but because this one is a real story where the criminal not only was caught but then turned around and began meting out justice to other criminals, you feel justified in rooting for him.  Also, despite any embellishments, the story was very solid - there were virtually no plot holes and very few if any gratuitous or wasted scenes.  This is a very tight movie.<p>As for the acting, I think I am going to finally have to break down and give Leonardo DiCaprio some credit.  I also recently watched Gangs of New York and this guy has got it going right - he can play a very convincing number of roles.  DiCaprio was superb, hands down superb.  Also, the supporting cast, including Tom Hanks, were also very good.  There were only a few major names in the movie besides DiCaprio and Hanks, but major names weren't really necessary.  For the most part the acting in this film was very convincing.<p>The only thing I might criticize about the movie was the opening credits.  They seemed wasted on silly animations that could have been used to introduce characters and cut down on the the movie time (this is a pretty long movie).<br />This criticism carries over to the DVD menu structure because it uses a similar type of animation that is actually kind of difficult to read.  Other than this wasteful and silly decision, the movie was great.<p>Overall, this is a wonderful movie.  The acting is very convincing and the story is impeccable.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this film.  It draws you in and stuns you with every twist and turn.  I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>...I'm late to the party.<br />I don't know why it took me so long to see this but...<br />Better late than never I suppose. :)<br />There are a ton of reviews for this movie already so I'll make it short.<br /><br />The good.<br />Everything, there that was easy.<br />Kidding, the all star cast was perfect as expected.<br />Brilliant direction.<br />Incredible score.<br />Pacing was spot on.<br />Everything that could have been done right, was.<br /><br />The bad?<br />Nothing, in my opinion this movie is about as perfect as a movie can be.<br /><br />Stunning.<br />Superb.<br />A must see.<br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Why is there no extras on this DVD? Not even a trailer, not something I would have expected from a Steven Spielberg film. Mind you, he's probably waiting until everyone's bought it, and then will release a special edition, director's cut, or some nonsense. I was very disappointed that there was no extras. I hate DVDs like that.<br /><br />I was a bit unsure about this movie, but I ended up really enjoying it. I wasn't keen on the very 1960s credits at the start, and the film seemed a bit overlong, but not in a tedious way. It's the only one of Leonardo DiCaprio's films I've liked since Titanic, and that's saying something. He does so well in this movie! He manages to look really young (thanks to a very dodgy haircut) and then looks older, and really gaunt at one point. It was all very well done, and it was a very subtle aging.<br /><br />It's a very intriguing film, finding out how people fake cheques, etc. How he managed to get away with it for as long as he did is shocking. And I LOVED the whole relationship between Tom Hanks & Leonardo, it was a very strange relationship, but at the same time, interesting. It's the way Tom Hanks starts off chasing him, and towards the end they end up being friends - and they're still friends to this day according to the end of the film.<br /><br />The end of the film bothered me a bit, it seemed awfully sluggish compared to the rest of it. Thankfully, both actors manage to almost rescue the film, and keep it going, and keep you watching. With different actors, it might have failed. And there's a whole host of supporting actors, including Christopher Walken (fabulous as ever), and a very strange role starring Jennifer Garner! It was quite a shock to see her, and it was a very small role, which didn't quite seem to fit in with the rest of the film. What happened to the cheque that he gave her? It only took her a day to film - what an easy life eh? She must have been paid a fair bit, just for a couple of minutes screen time.<br /><br />A highly recommended film, which will have you smiling right the way through, and will definitely get you in the mood to read the book. Maybe. Hopefully there will be a special edition at some point - despite the fact I'm a cynic at heart, I'm a sucker for these things.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Catch Me If You Can tells the incredible true story of a teenage runaway who finds himself alone in the big city and in need of a job. He uses his wit and creativity to live the good life, successfully posing as an airline pilot, physician, and lawyer, and cashing millions of dollars in bad checks, all before he is 18 years old!<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is utterly convincing as teenager Frank Abagnale, Jr. His considerable poise and confidence charm us immediately. Tom Hanks plays the stalwart FBI agent who chases Frank for years, forming an odd bond with him. Christopher Walken plays Frank's troubled father in his typically eerie style.<br /><br />Director Speilberg recreates the fashions and look of the 60's well and the script is riveting. There are many surprises and some chuckles along the way, although I consider this a drama, not a comedy. This is a very enjoyable film about an amazingly resourceful young man. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>It's easy to see "Catch Me if You Can" as Spielberg Lite. Certainly it's ridiculous to compare it with such grave, portentous films as "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan," and it doesn't call for a fraction of the technical wizardry of "E.T." or the Indiana Jones flicks. Nevertheless, in its sprightly elegance and moments of unexpected poignancy, "Catch Me if You Can" is as fine a movie as Spielberg has ever made. The themes of home and belonging are crucial to Spielberg--"E.T. phone home" could be the epigraph to his entire career. Beneath the cat-and-mouse game played by teenage con man Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) and FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is an intense longing on the part of both men for human connection, which they find unexpectedly in each other. Setting the action on successive Christmases was a master stroke, casting in bas relief the essential loneliness of both men. "Catch Me if You Can" would make a great double bill with Spielberg's first feature, "The Sugarland Express," another film about an epic police chase and the need for home.  Of course you probably won't think about any of this while watching the movie; you'll be too busy laughing at DiCaprio's chutzpah and Machiavellian cleverness, and at Hanks' grumpy, Sad Sack attempts to trap him. The two leads, of course, are wonderful--DiCaprio in particular plays his role the way Yo-Yo Ma plays his cello--but the standout is Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr., shedding his usual creepy persona in a moving portrayal of a man whose essential optimism is slowly ground into the dirt. Frankly, the film could stand to lose about 15 minutes at the end, but it's built up so much good will up to that point that most audiences won't mind. My guess is that, in retrospectives 50 years from now, "Catch Me if You Can" will be considered among Spielberg's finest.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This is not going to be remembered as one of the greatest films in the careers of any of the main folks involved (with the exception of Christopher Walken, who has rarely been better), but it is nonetheless an excellent if unspectacular movie.  Leonard DiCaprio is excellent in a complex and well acted role.  Tom Hanks is solid as always, although his faux-Boston accent is a tad grating at times.  John Williams has produced a score that is more subtle than his usual efforts, and quite effective in setting the mood for the various scenes.  And Steven Spielberg does his usual highly professional job of directing.  The film fails to be anything especially thrilling, but I can't imagine many people claiming that watching it was a waste of time.  <p>I loved the period feel of the film.  Most of the decor felt just right.  At no point was it anything less than a joy to behold<p>The only problem with the film is that in the end, it just isn't very memorable.  I loved the performances, I loved the set and art design, I loved the score.  But I felt far less moved by the film than I would have anticipated.  Still, one could hardly go wrong by taking the time to see this highly polished, professional effort.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks do their usual superb jobs of directing and acting.  They bring to life the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., an incredibly gifted con man who spent four years impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer from ages 16-20 and "earning" millions of dollars while at it. FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is hot on his trail the while.  Christopher Walken plays Abagnale's father brilliantly and it is in the disappointments and failings of the father that the genius of the son is born.  Abagnale, Jr. can teach himself anything plus he can also charm the birds from the trees.  He has nerves of steel when doing one of his impersonations and can think very fast on his feet.  Yet he is also heartbroken from 16-20 over his mother's leaving the father he adores and the father slowly drifting and falling further and further from mainstream life as a result.  Abagnale, Jr. clearly wants to save his father and restore his parents' marriage as the end goal of his impersonations.  In this he is still clearly a teenager of divorced parents trying but failing to come to grips with that reality.  I was surprised to learn that this film is almost 3 hours long since it is so fast paced. DiCaprio is again a heartthrob here, as we haven't seen him since "Titanic" but he's also so much more.  See it.</p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>Being a stickler for realism, the coming attractions of this movie had no appeal for me as I beheld the boyish face Leonardo Decaprio in a Pan Am uniform of a first officer, knowing intimately that gray hair and a cane was almost a prerequisite for that airline's cockpit personnel. Imagine my surprise as the story came to TV and I found myself enjoying one scene after another.<br /><br />Decaprio plays, Frank Abagnale Jr., a modern day Ferdinand Waldo Demara, with a twist. He makes emotional attachments along the way as he starts conning and defrauding very early in life, at about the same time that his father and mother start to separate.<br /><br />Chasing Frank is a stuffy, Catholic, typical, white-shirted FBI Agent named Carl Hanratty who seems outwitted by his prey at every turn, as he comes up one step behind. Frank's greatest caper, along with passing forged Pan Am checks is puddle-jumping on other airlines while pretending to be a Pan Am pilot. Ever the ladies' man he meets stewardesses and hookers whom he cons as if it is was the most natural thing in the world. But our Frank isn't content with being a mere pilot.<br /><br />Faking diplomas from Harvard, he passes himself off as a doctor where he works in a hospital emergency room directing other interns to take care of the patients. Just to round out his curriculum vitae, he decides it would be nice to be a lawyer as he woos a prosecutor's daughter. With two weeks of study, he passes the bar exam in Louisiana. The only problem is that darned FBI agent Hanratty won't give up coming after him.<br /><br />He seems to be the perfect candidate for a psychopath. His happy home is broken by his father's financial and business misfortune, His mother leaves his father for the father's lawyer, and Frank takes pity on the father who thinks the government is after him for everything. It is obvious he worships a man who is a failure, but still does everything he can to gain his approval.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's direction is as upbeat as the movie's tempo and dialogue. The viewer may develop a fondness for the pursuer and the pursued. There is a happy ending for both of them.<br /><br />The real Frank Abagnale had a cameo appearance in this movie, playing one of the French police that captured Abignale in France.<br /><br />The End (almost)<br /><br />Sometimes real life turns out to be even more interesting than the fiction, and this was no different. I was more than interested in the man who reminded me of "The Great Imposter," Ferdinand Waldo Demara.<br /><br />The real Frank Abagnale Jr. made his first con against his father. He asked his father for a credit card so he could date the many women he admired. In order to get the cash, he used the card, told the garage to keep the batteries, sets of tires and gasoline, resell them, and give him cash.<br /><br />He served time in more jails than is shown in the movie. He served time in Sweden, six months in French jails and a few years in federal penitentiaries where he escaped from one pretending to be a prison inspector.<br /><br />In addition to being a "doctor" and "lawyer," Frank faked credentials to gain a teaching assistant job at Columbia University in New York.<br /><br />Frank's fortune changed after he was fired from one job after another when a background check revealed his prison record. He approached one bank with an offer. He would give them a lecture on detecting bank fraud. They wouldn't have to pay him if they didn't like it. If they did, they would pay him $500 AND tell other banks about his work. He ended up making millions.<br /><br />He currently lives and works in Tulsa, OK, and is still good friends with Special Agent Joe Shaye (known in the movie as Carl Hanratty).</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Catch Me If You Can is one of those true story movies that achieves a rarity. It gives you a really interesting and intense film while still keeping its feet on the ground and not going overboard or off track with the initial story.<br /><br />This film is based around the true life of Frank Abagnale Jr. who became known as an expert impostor, who managed to con Pan Am airlines out of millions of dollars by impersonating a pilot, a doctor and a legal prosecutor. In the movie it generally keeps to the core roots of Franks story and the man himself was even involved in the making of the movie.<br /><br />The film is set out from his teenage days and shows a young man who has a talent of confidence. This confidence allows him to fit into any role he's presented with and at the start of the movie we see him impersonating a teacher, which ultimately gets him into trouble. He's a kid who idolises his father, a man who's in serious trouble with the IRS and is being cheated on by his wife, Franks mother. Frank Jr's parents split and Frank runs away to Manhattan with just $25 in his checking account. Determined to clear his Fathers losses and repair his parents marriage, Frank becomes one of the biggest con artists ever known to the United States. The film then turns into a cat & mouse chase between Frank & FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, but what starts as a felon being chased by a cop turns into a father & son type relationship.<br /><br />The film itself is just incredible, the settings and the script are just superb and have a certain style and confidence very rarely seen in movies these days. It has real life situations taking place that to some would seem utterly unbelievable, yet the film makers display these situations with such a confidence (Due to them being true situations and all) that it's pulled off without it detracting from the film itself.<br /><br />There's one scene in particular which I'm thinking about and it's a point in which Carl actually manages to find Frank and get into his Motel room while Frank is still there. At this stage in the film Carl is unaware of what Frank looks like and Frank, with his sheer exuberance manages to convince Carl, with no proof what so ever, that he's the man who's caught Frank and had him arrested moments earlier. Taken in by his confidence, Carl believes the story and allows Frank to leave the room and ultimately escape. Of course to most people this would seem utterly ridiculous but the way it's put together in the film, it works perfectly.<br /><br />A very good movie that is a masterpiece in my eyes and unfortunately overlooked by many. Buy it or rent it, I promise you wont be disappointed either way.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>The inspiration for this implausible story about a teenage conman who swindles his way to a cool $2 million before his 21st birthday is actually, as most people planning to purchase this DVD will know, a true premise. Frank Abagnale Jnr attained brief fame in the 1960s when he became the youngest American ever to appear on the FBI's most wanted list and his autobiography, published in 1980, chronicling his underhand escapades, became a cult bestseller.<br /><br />It appears that Steven Spielberg was one of those readers, or at any rate, was inspired to recreate this story on the big screen by some convincing source or another as this is not an orthodox Spielberg film. It fits neither into the category of his most recent, darker themed movies, A.I: Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, nor the large scale epics emphasising tender children's emotions (E.T., Hook), large scale historical drama (Schindler's List) or blockbuster thrill sensations (Jurassic Park).<br /><br />No, Catch Me if You Can is something rather different. Ostensibly it is a dramatic comedy. Di Caprio is cast as the dashing, raffish Frank Jnr - except that his clothes for some reason are always a size too small. It is never quite clear why he feels the need to become one of America's most notorious criminals, but we are given the impression that deep family psychological anxieties play a large part - Frank Jnr is angry with his mother Paula who dumps his father for someone more successful and has a touching desire to please his father, Frank Snr (Christopher Walken plays this role to acclaimed success). Rapidly and ingeniously he passes himself off as a pilot, doctor and lawyer - sometimes through necessity when his is on the verge of being caught, sometimes, it appears, through sheer boredom. His evades his captors because he is so clever, but also because the finest brains of the FBI that pursue him are represented by Carl Hanretty (Tom Hanks) who, with his middle aged family problems, paunch and dogged rather than lightning quick intellect, frequently and comically lets Frank get away.<br /><br />This is not a deep film but several issues are explored. Frank's weakness for women is a continuous theme throughout the film, many different types of women - high class prostitutes (whom he cons) and the naive, brace wearing Brenda Strong (Amy Adams) who's tender innocence captures Frank's heart for a while and he becomes engaged to her until the need to escape from the law forces him away again.<br /><br />There is also a respectful bond between Frank and Carl the FBI agent. Carl respect's Frank's ingenuity and cunning, Frank sees Carl as almost a father figure and admires his persistence to bring him to justice. There is a clever solution that reconciles both these two factors. You'll have to watch the movie to find it out.<br /><br />So a Spielberg comedy. The man has nothing to prove, he can do pretty much what he likes now. It probably won't go down as one of the Spielberg greats, but it is slick, realistic and the plot keeps revolving with enough action to just about justify the length (over two hours). The 60s theme is done well too. As well as the tight trousers, the film is set to a minimalist jazz soundtrack with some evocative saxophone solos from Dan Higgins.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>After his dark, sci-fi work on A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, Steven Spielberg returns to more lighter fare with the engaging and entertaining Catch Me If You Can.  The film is based on the true story of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., who by the age of nineteen passes himself off as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and cashes over four million dollars worth of fraudulent checks.  The film is told in a flashback style, opening with Frank being extricated from a French prison and brought back to the U.S. to face charges and bounces back and forth between his trip home and his exploits in the previous few years.  Leonardo DiCaprio is perfectly cast as Frank.  His boyish good looks and charm work to his advantage as the young con man.  Mr. DiCaprio gives a multi-layered performance as beneath the surface Frank is really a young man who is devastated by his parents divorce and wants only to please his father and see his parents back together again.  Mr. DiCaprio has never been better and it is certainly the equal of his Oscar nominated performance in What&#65533;s Eating Gilbert Grape.  Tom Hanks gives yet another superb performance as the dogged FBI agent Carl Hanratty who tracks Frank across the US and eventually to France where he finally captures him.  Mr. Hanks plays Carl as a by-the-numbers agent, who shows no outward mercy to Frank, but has compassion for the kid because of his situation.  Christopher Walken is excellent as well as Frank&#65533;s father, who loses everything to the IRS because of a fraud investigation.  His contempt towards the government as they strip away everything in his life is both hilarious and heartbreaking.  Mr. Walken received a deserved nomination as Best Supporting Actor in 2002.  There are other good performances by Amy Adams as a girl who Frank becomes engaged to, Martin Sheen as her father, Nathalie Baye as Frank&#65533;s French mother and Jennifer Garner has a bizarre cameo as a model who propositions Frank for an evening of pleasure.  While these performances are all since, they are mere sidebars to the triangle between Frank, Carl and Frank&#65533;s father.  The cat and mouse hunt between Frank and Carl is tension filled and briskly paced.  Mr. Spielberg keeps the action moving and he never lets you up for air.  The film has been criticized for not diving deeper into what made Frank do what he did or get in the mechanics of fraud, but that&#65533;s not the point of the film.  It is the chase between the two leads.  You know that Frank will eventually get caught, but where, when and how will it happen.  Mr. Spielberg does gloss over some issues and the film does take some liberties, most notably that is no real Carl Hanratty.  Frank did have a main contact at the FBI, but there was a large team of investigators who tracked and caught him.  But the role of Carl is needed in the film as the chase becomes personal and the emotional focus of the film.  All in all, Catch Me If You Can is perfectly crafted film, full of lively performances, a sharp script and crisp direction.  This film yet again shows why Mr. Spielberg is among the greatest directors of this or any generation.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>The (almost) true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s adventures as a juvenile con man has been made into a great movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Frank, who runs away from home when his parents are going to get divorced, and poses as a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and other praiseworthy professions in order to pass phony checks and win the hearts of girls everywhere.  Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent out to catch Frank.  The story is great, the acting is superb (Hanks's Boston accent is hilarious), and the jokes are great.  This movie is very clever, and you will be laughing long after you leave the theater (this movie has the world's greatest knock-knock joke in it).</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>It's nice to have a Spielberg movie that doesn't have to be loaded with portent. Don't get me wrong, I like portent, but I went to this expecting escapism (based on the trailers) and I got it in spades! I was immediately caught up in the movie and enchanted by the light story. The characters were all likable. The period details really great (check out DiCaprio's Bachelor pad when he's pretending to be a doctor). Even the John William's score works nicely for a change. Everyone is working in the same light-hearted vein, and the tone is very nice and consistent throughout.<p>DiCaprio is very charming and believable, and in his few serious scenes, he brings some real pain to the proceedings. I hope this and Gangs of New York helps us remember that he actually was (and is) a good actor, and not just that obnoxious playboy from the post-Titanic days. Tom Hanks is great: we root for him to catch DiCaprio, and we root for DiCaprio not to get caught. That's part of the fun! And Christopher Walken really gives one of his best performances in a long time. He's the most "serious" character in the film, but he shows terrific heart and spirit, and only occasionally falls back to his "creepy" mannerisms.<p>This is not a serious work. It is meant to lighten your mood with a competent, straightforward telling of a truly engaging story. And it succeeds. I say "catch it if you can." <p>REGARDING OTHER REVIEWS I'VE SEEN SAYING THE MOVIE ISN'T FUNNY AND AUDIENCES AREN'T LAUGHING:  The audience I saw this movie with was in stiches.  Yes,it has it's serious moments, but the most memorable comedies always do. It isn't slapstick. But IT IS FUNNY, and I don't hesitate for a minute to recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg's latest film, Catch Me if You Can, is his freshest in years after a stretch of good but flawed movies. This lighthearted comedy/drama is a little different style of film then his usual sci-fi or heavy drama fare, and the change seems to have revitalized him.<p>This true story, which sticks pretty close to fact, follows Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DeCaprio) in the 1960s as he fakes his way as an airline pilot, doctor and a lawyer while cashing thousands of forged checks. The story is hard to believe, despite its basis in fact, but Spielberg brings it very much down to earth and creates some very real characters. It is a very simple film in its nature, compared to most of Spielberg more complicated tastes, as of late. In fact, it hearkens back to his early films which displayed a more youthful vigor and passion. What he has always been best at is telling simple, magical tales about regular people getting caught up in extraordinary events, and that's what Catch Me if You Can is all about.<p>In fact, this film seems to revitalize everyone involved. Not only is Spielberg at his highest form, DeCaprio performs far better then anything he's ever done before. He shows some true talent portraying the genius kid. He manages to upstage the great Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, something I never would have guessed was possible. Spielberg must have seen the potential in him, and helped bring it to the forefront. Also, John Williams score is breathtakingly original. As of late, the great composer has delivered some stale music that sounds much like many other scores he's done (something that happens to everyone after being in the business as long as he), but Williams here shows that he's still got the talent to produce amazing new material. The authentic 60's sound of the music captures the tone of the film perfectly, and the unique opening sequence both looks and sounds like a period production. There are a few moments where the score begins to sound like some of his other work, but Williams seems to keep it under control and these moments are only fleeting.<p>This film is truly as near flawless as they come. Sure it isn't something that will have a profound effect on anyone; it won't change culture or demand viewing upon viewing. It's not that kind of film. It's just a simple, fun, entertaining story that is expertly produced and shows that Spielberg still has what it makes to make the classic movies of his career. Good job Spielberg, I knew you still had it in you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very charming film directed by Stephen Spielberg (ET-The Extraterrestrial, Minority Report). It is a period piece and the detail to costumes and set design is very interesting and accurate. It made me wonder how much was actually special effects and how much was real. It's got humor sprinkled throughout and when you see what the ending tells you - you'll walk out of the theatre in amazement.<p>The story is that of 16 year-old played by Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic, Gangs of New York) who cons his way into the airline business, medical field and in the Legal profession. His learns the scheming ways from his father who is brilliantly played by Christopher Walkin (The Dead Zone, America's Sweethearts). <p>Now, the FBI catches on to forged checks and sees a pattern develop and then assigns Tom Hanks (Apollo 13, Castaway, Splash) to try and track him down and incarcerate him<p>Spielberg directed this one with a little flair and a lot of attention to detail. It has humorous moments and a lot of interesting facets on the FBI, their procedures and what a clever boy can really do.<p>As a result of his worldly travels he ends up falling in love and the kicker of it all is the ending when you read the text on the screen that tells you what happened to these two men and what their doping today. I liked this movie - although a little long in length - it was much better than AI. This one is one I think the whole family can enjoy - if you can wait the length of the movie.

Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>The story is true. Frank Abagnale Jr. was a young man who, before turning 21, forged numerous checks and became one of the biggest con men in the United States. Catch Me If You Can is, of course, loosely based on his life and work, but it's still entertaining and fascinating to watch. Normally, I'm not a fan of Spielberg, but he's done a really good job with recreating the 50's and 60's. The costume and set designers should be given equal credit with their excellent work. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a believable performance as Abagnale himself, while Tom Hanks is brilliant as the Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent who is willing to stop this man from creating more fake checks and assuming more fake identities. Christopher Walken does what he does best, even if he doesn't seem to fit the role as Frank's father. Nathalie Baye as Frank's mother is very convincing, probably even more convincing than DiCaprio. Martin Sheen is also a nice addition to the supporting cast.<br /><br />Keep in mind, though, that this is not a serious hard-hitting biography, but rather, a comedy-drama that doesn't really take itself seriously. It's good for laughs, and it does its job well. The only problem is that it's a bit too long, and it could have been slightly shortened. Catch Me If You Can is still an entertaining movie, and if you love Spielberg (or Hanks, or DiCaprio for that matter), then you'll love this one.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Ok, not evil, but whatever.<br /><br />This lighthearted offering from Steven Spielberg is superior to `The Terminal' but not quite as infectious as his beauties like `E.T.'.  It is fun and exciting and engaging, but I find it also to be slightly forgettable.  It is one of those films that leaves no complaints while in the midst of enjoying it, but it isn't one that you're going to remember three days later.<br /><br />Make sense?<br /><br />The film tells the true story of con-man Frank Abagnale Jr., who by the time he was 21 had made a living at deceiving and `stealing' from the government.  He was a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, all the while never being any of those things.  He was, simply put, a genius.  Carl Hanratty was the FBI agent who was on his tail for years, never quite getting close enough to catch him (well, eventually), always one step behind.<br /><br />One thing to describe this film is `jovial'.  It is a happy fun film.  Within the restraints of the genre it works nicely.  It does lack the `human' element that could have really set this film apart (and made it more memorable).  While the film remains exciting and entertaining it lacks that gut punch that could have made this movie `mean something', and in the end it would have completed it.  That said, happy is what happy does, and happy does a lot for this film.  Not only is the plot rather boisterous, but the performances are all just so delightful.  Leonardo DiCaprio captures the suave and childlike adorableness of Frank Jr. rather remarkably.  A lot of my cinephile friends consider this one of his best performances.  I kind of agree, since it really capitalizes on everything that makes him such an endearing actor.  This is a far better performance than his confused turn in `Gangs of New York', which was released the same year.  Tom Hanks is perfectly matched here, for he really understands how to play up the genre here.  As many know, I am not a gigantic fan of Mr. Hanks, so for me to praise a performance takes a lot from me.  But, as anyone who knows me knows, I consider his lighthearted `non-baity' work to be his best (see `Big' and `That Thing You Do' for examples).  Christopher Walken may not be the most jovial character in the bunch (and he does insert the films only `human' element) but he nails his character.<br /><br />Also, look for Amy Adams in a scene stealing supporting role!<br /><br />All in all, `Catch Me If You Can' delivers a very strong and very likable experience.  It's a film that may not `stick with you', but it is a film you will have no quarrels with watching again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>There's a lot to like in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN--the handsome production values, the unobtrusive John Williams score, the performances by a first-rate cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Charlie Sheen, Christopher Walken) and the fact that it's based on the amazing story of a young man who fooled authorities with forgeries and impersonations over a long period of time.<br /><br />Makes me recall the Tony Curtis film, THE GREAT IMPOSTER ('61), which told the same sort of amazing story with a lot more exuberance. Somehow events never seem quite so extraordinary in the way that they unfold in this reenactment of a true story. Only a few times does the urgency of DiCaprio's escape from the man chasing him really involve the audience.<br /><br />Don't ask me why--but there's not enough punch to the proceedings and perhaps this is where John Williams with his "nice" score fails to take the drama seriously. Instead of accompanying the more gripping moments with dramatic bursts of music, he instead goes for a quieter, sophisticated sound closer to the bland '60s sound of cocktail music. Somehow this deadens the impact or seriousness of the crimes being depicted and gives the whole movie a bland quality that is out of place. I never thought I'd be criticizing a John Williams score for being bland but so be it.<br /><br />The performances can't be faulted--Tom Hanks is especially good as the F.B.I. man and DiCaprio does a highly competent job as the misguided youth. Christopher Walken makes the father an interesting character.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it IS an amazing story--this man had to be brilliant to pull off what he did--in an age where counterfeit checks and IDs are scrutinized as carefully as they are most of the time, it seems highly unlikely that such a ruse could happen in the light of today's heightened high security--or is it??</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This movie was extremely entertaining, in fact I laughed at times. Leo brought charisma to Frank Abagnale, that engaged you. Tom Hanks has had better days, though he provides a certain comfort for a variety of viewers who have faith in him. Supporting roles in Christopher Walken and Amy Adams are to be commended, as they both add so much energy to the film that brought it all together. Spielberg knew what we was doing when he stepped into this movie and decided to direct it. All in all, it was a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This is another solid base hit in the storied career of director Steven Spielberg.  The title implies a bouncy cat and mouse thriller, which to some degree, it is.  But it is just as much a character study of a forger/con artist and his pursuer, a dogged treasury agent.  There is a somber tone to the film that suggests that the con artist, Frank Abignale Jr., is not so content with the choices he has made despite the apparent riches of his profession.  In contrast, the agent, Carl Hanratty, is equally lonely as a result of a recent divorce, which is probably why he plunges himself so wholeheartedly in his work.  As Frank Jr., this may be the best work that Leonardo DiCaprio has ever done.  As Agent Hanratty, Tom Hanks imbues the character with steely determination and dignity where the character could just as well have been portrayed as a bumbler.  Christopher Walken also contributes a superlative performance as Frank Sr., a ne'erdowell who Frank Jr. holds up on a pedestal.  Where the film falls a little short is as to why Frank Jr. chooses the life that he does.</p></br></body></html>

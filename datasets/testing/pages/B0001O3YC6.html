It's not. You are getting the two individual movies (in two separate cases) just wrapped in special packaging. At least the disks have all the same special features as the individual release so these aren't cheap theatrical release only kinds of disks. However when you look at the current price for this two movie set you really aren't getting anything special here. I think it's better to just get the individual movies.<br /><br />Plus a lot of the complaints I hear about Chronicles of Riddick freezing up seem to come from this package set more than the separate movie release. Now if any of you out there have been worried about buying these movies because of that I think it's been a decent amount of time enough for Sony to have either corrected the manufacturing procedure that made that bad batch or for that batch to be phased out. My recommendation is (until there is absolute confirmation there are no more bad copies) go buy the movie at a brick and mortal store that offers returns. If you have a bad copy go back with your receipt and tell them. They will likely just let you get another copy of the movie. If so let then know about the situation. Maybe they can cross-check distribution and all that to make sure you new copy is from a different batch.<br /><br />The Riddick movies are great and the Blu-Rays look and sound awesome. I just don't see any benefit on getting them in a two pack deal if there are no significant discounts.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL:<br /><br />This is a grab-you-by-the-seat-of-your-pants action thriller that starts with a bang and maintains its tension. Using a variety of clever devices throughout the film including a good script and fine acting, "Pitch Black" rises well above the usual genre fare.<br /><br />JUST PLAIN SCARY:<br /><br />All throughout "Pitch Black" there was a pervasive feeling that something ominously malevolent was getting closer to happening. We see signs from the beginning. Right after the crash landing we see distant trees that turn out to be the huge skeketal remains of a herd of huge animals. Then there's "something" that's scurrying about underground and a deserted camp without explanation. What happened to the people?<br /><br />BUT THAT'S NOT ALL:<br /><br />There was a model of the solar system with its 3 suns that demonstrated a total eclipse that was just about to occur! As all this is happening the pace picks up, it starts to get dark, their solar-powered vehicle stops working, and the whatevers that were scurrying around underground are beginning to pour out of the hilltops in mass. They resemble swarms of giant bats that look alot like the creatures in "Alien". Our intrepid survivors are obviously in for a long night!<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:<br /><br />That's what the film is all about. Suffice it to say that the pace swells to fever pitch in an environment where nobody is safe and there is no telling how long this "Pitch Black" environment will last. You'll find yourself on pins and needles for most of the film.<br /><br />Check it out!<br /><br />ALSO CONSIDER SEEING:<br /><br />Tremors, Alien, or Aliens.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>As far as Sci-Fis go this is pretty good.  It is cetainly better then "Chronicles"  I believe this movie was Vin Diesel's first big break out role and does a good job planning, well a character you'd expect him to play.  Definately a movie you should check out and it is worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>It had been quite some time prior to this film that a successful sci-fi/horror genre had been released.  Audiences were mostly being burried under a pile of mediocre alien films and cheap conventional horror.  Director David Twohy brought back this fading genre with new concepts, good effects, and a rather decent cast.<br /><br />The plot is laid out in the main review and so I won't go over it here.  The story itself is solid and allows the audience to immerse themselves in the adventure of the characters without great leaps in reasoning: a common problem in the science fiction genre.  In terms of acting, Radha Mitchell played a very credible role as a shaken but resolute captain. The star of the show is of course Vin Diesel as Riddick, a shiny eyed alien who can see in the dark.  His character was the basis of a less-than-stellar spinoff 'Chronicles of Riddick.'  Cole Hauser as Riddick's tormentor also did a pretty good job.  The film has excellent special effects with monsters that are quite terrifying to look at.<br /><br />A fun cat-and-mouse horror/sci-fi film that is worth multiple viewings.  I strongly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>i rented this expecting bad acting , cool effects , and not scary looking monsters. boy am i surprised. i loved it. vin diesel is my fave actor. the only change would be make it longer. hello its 1 hour and 10 minutes long.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>This film may not expand the Science Fiction Cinematic Universe as we know it, but there's a couple of twists and turns and enough atmosphere to make it a worthwhile addition to the genre.  "Pitch Black," directed by David N. Twohy, involves a commercial space flight carrying forty passengers that crash lands on an unknown desert planet.  With three suns above them, there is plenty of daylight in which the survivors can negotiate their quest for survival, and finding water is their main concern.  As they begin to explore the wastelands for sustenance, they find evidence that others have been there, apparently some years before them:  A small ship and a couple of buildings; all of which appears to have been abruptly left behind.  Lead by pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), the small band of survivors have a couple of additional obstacles in their way, as well.  One is Riddick (Vin Diesel), a murderer who was being transported to a penal colony.  But he may not be their greatest danger; because there is someone-- or something-- else close by.  Very close.  An entity that in all probability is responsible for the disappearance of those who came before.  And, if that isn't enough, Fry ascertains that the three suns above them will be setting soon; their world is about to be plunged into absolute darkness.  Soon, they will have to deal with Riddick and the entity stalking them in the pitch black of an eternal night.<p> This concept is nothing new, and there's a sense of been there, done that, about it, but to Twohy's credit, what it lacks in originality he makes up for in presentation by building the suspense and maintaining the tension right up to the end.  The story was obviously influenced by a number of other films, predominately "Alien," "Soldier" and even "Rocketship X-M" from 1950, but there is a unique characteristic about Riddick and a revelation at the end (that has to do with his true nature) that secures a separate entry in the annals of Sci-Fi lore for this film.  This one definitely has it's moments, enough to take it to a level that even such highly touted offerings as "Event Horizon" and "Alien 3" failed to achieve.  <p> The performances, too, are a cut above the usual for this kind of fare, and while no one in the cast is likely to win an award for their work here, they do a good job, individually and collectively.  Radha Mitchell has an affecting screen presence and creates a very real person in Fry, equal to, if not surpassing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in "Alien."  Diesel is effective, as well, especially in the menace he brings to Riddick, which is subtly honest and believable; the understated way he plays it gives added impact to the character and takes him beyond stereotype (though not quite up to Rutger Hauer's Roy in "Blade Runner").  With Riddick, what you see is basically what you get; there's not a lot of depth or complexity to him, but that's who this guy is, and Diesel plays it well.<p> Also turning in effective performances are Keith David as Imam, Lewis Fitz-Gerald as Paris Ogilvie, Rhiana Griffith as Jack and Claudia Black as Shazza.  As Johns, Cole Hauser is adequate, but he fails to give his character the definition his co-stars achieved with their respective roles.<p> Rounding out the cast are John Moore (Zeke), Simon Burke (Greg), Les Chantery (Suleiman), Sam Sari (Hassan) and Firass Dirani (Ali).  From the beginning, you know what you're in for with this one-- it's a survival story, and few of the characters, if any, are going to make it to the end.  But as entertainment, "Pitch Black" does the job; it's thrilling enough that by the time it's over you feel like you got your five bucks worth.  You may not remember it next month, but while you're watching, it's a pretty good rush.  It's the magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>David Twohy's follow-up to '96's The Arrival is one of grave circumstances and underappreciated symbolism. After sustaining heavy damage from a meteor storm, a spacecraft transporting numerous people crashes on a hot, desolate planet. Once the sunlight fades into darkness, however, the survivors of the crash become prey to a species of flying, nocturnal alien, against which there is only one chance for their survival: Riddick (Vin Diesel), a convicted murderer who was being moved by their craft to a far-off prison.<br /><br />Though it underwent critical scrutiny, Pitch Black is one of very few mainstream Hollywood films to address the Muslim faith with high regards, rather than denigration. One of the more prominent roles depicted in the film is Abu "Imam" al-Walid (played by Keith David), a Muslim who sees the good in Riddick, despite the prisoner's forte for killing. The character, in fact, is paid the ultimate honor a slaughter-fest flick can deliver--survival--and is included in the film's below-par sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I suspect that much of the commercial appeal for this film comes from Vin Diesel's presence; which is sad since this film has some great ideas, and a great monster design, done by the consistently cool Patrick Tatopoulos.<br /><br />However, since Vin has gone on to bigger and better films ( Like XXX ) more power to him.<br /><br />The bad points, IMO, are the Australian actors who can't even pull off decent accents of any kind ( should have overdubbed the lot), and the "process" that was decided on to "hyper"-light the  daylight portions of the film.<br /><br />This film  bears no relation to Aliens or the other film mentioned in the editorial. Not even if you compare them to the re-edits that come out in Quadrilogy.<br /><br />Anyways, the film is quick to start, and races at a great pace. Don't be fooled by the reviews panning Vin's work ... he does a great job, and conveys a superb feeling as the hero ( or "anti-hero" if you wish).<br /><br />As it is, the film is a great watch. If only some of the stylistic film stock changes could be reversed ...</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Before Vin Diesel got billed as the next action hero, he starred as a convicted murderer being transported on a ship through space.  Among other passengers on the ship are a tough captain (Radha Mitchell), a drug addicted cop (Dazed & Confused's Cole Hauser), and some other characters played by Keith David and Farscape's Claudia Black.  When the ship crashes on an uncharted planet, the surviving passengers are forced to band together to survive against the planet's indigenous vicious creatures.  The plot and storyline are far from original, but the excellent acting (including the surprisingly well acted role by Diesel) and superb directing from David Twohy (The Arrival) make Pitch Black a high grade B movie that is a great guilty pleasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I had expected PITCH BLACK to be a cheesy, sci-fi movie of somewhat poor quality. I couldn't have been more surprised. It is obvious that the film didn't entail a huge budget (there probably would have been at least one familiar name in the cast if there had been). But some of the best films of all time are the ones that didn't have much of a budget (e.g. Rocky). PITCH BLACK isn't a great sci-fi movie, but it is better than most.<p>The story was quite believable and does not deny it's homage to the classic ALIEN. The acting is wonderful and the cinematography and brilliant lighting (or lack of) that conceals the film's small budget (yet fits wonderfully with the plot) is pure genius. The movie kept me both in suspense and full of interest. PITCH BLACK is one of the most underrated movies of 2000. Like the characters in the film, perhaps the movie can finally find a way out of the shadows and make its way into the light of respect.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>Very Dark picture to match its title. A story of those in cybersleep who wake up to their ship going out of control. Rushing to controls, trying to save the sleeping fugitives who await unknown possibilities and adventures. Help they scream out as the ship plummets into outer space. They are saved I don't know who Owens is but he saved those passengers. They hit the new planet with flying blackish birds they could look like huge cormarants. They try and some do make it, rebuilding the exisiting dumping ground space machines with cells they find. The things I liked. I like the female lead, I think she is very pretty and strong looking, plus I think she is a good actress. She does a good job in all films she is in. I would like to look this strong. She is the captain and struggles to keep her plan. I like flying to space planets and meeting the strange creatures and exiciting possibilites. The birds dripped blue blood from the many sun filled atmosphere, an eclipse comes bringing them out of hiding to eat the stranded. Help again, finding a solution so they can move on to ever more feats of strength and hope of happiness in each of their neverending experiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>I was very favourably surprised by this movie, which didn't make a big score when opening in cinemas but now is much more recognised once it is accessible on DVD.<br /><br />It is one of the most original SF films of those last years, well filmed and with good actors. And it was really not easy to do something original considering the topic - a spaceship crashes on a distant and hostile planet and the stranded crew struggles to survive and find a way out. It was already treated in many SF books - and still this movie managed to find an original way to deal with the story.<br /><br />I do not want to give spoilers, but from the title of the movie you can safely presume that absence of light will play an important role - and you will be right! Special effects, light and sound were very well done in this movie and even the most spoiled viewers should find this movie visually and accoustically quite impressive. There is at least one scene which WILL definitely impress you - when a giant planet rises above the horizon line of the alien world, where the action is situated. I still shiver with delight when I remember this moment.<br /><br />Also, if by any chance you saw the idiotic sequel of this movie ("Chronicles of Riddick") please stay calm - "Pitch Black" is totally different in every aspect. It has a credible plot, interesting characters and simply is a real treat for every SF fan. OK, it is not "Star Wars" or "Aliens", but is still a really good movie. See it and have fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>Interesting film with decent enough plot, characters, action, dialogue, effects. Lots of people have never heard of this film but it is worth a look if you like SYFY and or action. Riddick as the main character, sort of, is an interesting character, who you are not sure you like or hate. Recommend. Actually like this one better than "follow on" Chronicles of Riddick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Imagine the legendary "Flight of the Phoenix," except the crash is on a barren alien planet... and there are nasty flesh-eating monsters. And a serial killer.<br /><br />That describes David Twohy's most artistically adept movie, the raw and dusty "Pitch Black. This cult movie starts off as your average gang of embattled, ill-matched castaways struggling to survive, but it that becomes utterly brilliant as it slowly slips from gritty sci-fi to harrowing, claustrophobic horror. And yes, even Vin Diesel gives an awesome performance in this one.<br /><br />After a meteor storm, a sleeper transport crashes on a desolate desert planet. Most of the passengers survive, including a stowaway kid and a dangerous prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel). Unfortunately, it turns out that the entire planet is a desert because it's blasted by three suns all throughout the day, and the survivors have little food, water or shelter. Oh yeah, and Riddick has broken out.<br /><br />To find the necessities, a small group led by Carolyn Fry Radha Mitchell) sets out across the desert -- and discovers a swarm of vicious omnivorous creatures in a cave. Fortunately they can't come out into the light. But when the group finds a geological survey station, they learn that a monthlong eclipse is about to fall over the planet -- meaning the creatures will soon eat them all if they don't escape from the desolate planet, and some of them aren't gonna make it.<br /><br />Personally I haven't liked David Twohy's work except the 1996 sci-fi film "Arrival," but "Pitch Black" is the kind of brilliant cult movie that almost makes up for an otherwise okay-to-bad filmography. This is not a polished space opera, but a dingy, grimy, dirty sci-fi movie full of recognizably ugly technology and stained morals -- not to mention some truly grotesque deaths. And not all of them are from the winged beasties either (think chest impalement).<br /><br />And Twohy gives the movie a very bleak, vaguely disturbing look -- endless chalky deserts filled with bones, grimy ships torn to pieces, empty skies, and searing pale light that makes everyone look half dead. Even the beautiful colourful expanses of space seem vaguely ominous. But the whole thing suddenly becomes jump-in-your-seat scary when the monsters attack, and start eating people as they run. The one problem? COME ON, what are the chances that they would JUST HAPPEN to arrive for the once-in-two-decades eclipse?<br /><br />And the feeling of suspense is heightened by sharp-edged, pared-down dialogue ("You're dancing on razor blades here") and a warped sense of humor -- we're assured that "No similarity to actual persons or predators, living or dead, is intended or should be inferred." Nice.<br /><br />The characters are a pretty mixed bag, and there's always the haunting realization that most of them would easily turn on each other to save themselves -- and in fact, the main character even does that in the first few minutes of the film. There's benevolent Muslim pilgrims, a hard-nosed bounty hunter, a prissy dude who hoards booze, and an annoying urchin of ambiguous gender. The standouts are Claudia Black as the tough Shazza, and Keith David as the kindly Abu "Imam" al-Walid.<br /><br />As for the leads, Diesel gives a pretty good performance as a wisecracking killer with a distinctly creepy edge (ew, he took a hair sample) and "shine" eyes that let him see in the dark. But I was most impressed by Mitchell's Fry, as a selfish hardened leader who learns to defend other people's lives in a crunch.<br /><br />"Pitch Black" is a fast, eerie, bloody little sci-fi movie with a nasty little planet full of even nastier creatures that are just waiting for dark. Definitely worth it for sci-fi buffs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>I really like this movie - A LOT. Very strong leads and a compelling main story mixed with a lot of nuance (Johns the druggie, Fry trying to ditch the crew, slight religious over tones.. etc).. about all this movie needed was an alien species a little less generic and a stronger secondary cast. However, I give this movie high marks for what it is and cannot fathom how they got that fantasy hybrid mess of a sequel from this hidden gem. See Pitch Black, skip the god awful sequel.. this is Diesels best movie and best character, not to mention a very nice high definition transfer and plenty of extras, hopefully if there is a third movie they go back to the grittiness of what makes this movie shine.<br /><br />8.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Yup, Vin Diesel is the man! His Riddick character is the baddest, meanest, coolest super-criminal I've seen in years. A true anti-hero in a gloriously tense sci-fi epic. PITCH BLACK has Riddick being transported to prison via deep-space ship. Along the way disaster strikes (of course), causing a crash-landing on a strange desert planet. Riddick is among the survivors who soon find that they are quite unfortunately, not alone. Something is alive and has stripped the planet of any / all other lifeforms. Worse still, these insatiable critters only come out at night, which is coming on fast, and lasts for months (years?)! The battle between humans and monsters is both satisfying and convincing, as Riddick rises up to kick some hideous flesh-eater buttocks! The rest of the cast ranges from great (Kieth David, Cole Hauser, etc.) to just plain monster chow. PITCH BLACK takes the best elements of movies like ALIENS and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and melds them together perfectly. The result is a dark, sinister ride through a funhouse where the attractions reach out and tear your head off! Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>man this movie was hard core, since the first time i watched it, and even now after many many times of seeing it. it's still a good one for me. man especially since vin diesel was up in there. my hero. movie does him justice. he's great, his acting, and his skills. let the world know who he was. he's been unstoppable since. another one of my favorites is cole hauser. i give him props. this was a thrill ride. you never know what's in the dark. there's always a scare of the unknown. don't venture in the dark alone.

Will it get us?  These are the questions that run through the minds of the characters in the film.  Vin Diesel was born for this role.  He plays a convict that is supposed to be transported, but he ends up getting out and helping the characters survive the alien onslaught.  Riddick does a wicked good job making you believe he is hardcore and you shouldn't mess with him.  He is also the savior of the movie.  All in all, Sci-Fi fans everywhere should see this movie.  I liked it better than Chronicles of Riddick (Pitch Black 2).</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>A starliner is struck by meteors and becomes a flying wreck.  Only a portion of the ship manages to land on a desolate planet.  One of the survivors is Richard P. Riddick who is a prisoner being transported by a bounty hunter who also survived.  The planet is arid and bright under three suns.  There is evidence that life once lived there as well as an abandoned scientific station.  An escape ship can be fixed with parts from the crash and a water generator can be fixed.  Seems like everyone will be able to get off the planet with a little work.<br /><br />But then trouble begins when one of the survivors enters a dark place.  There is still life around but it clings to the dark.  Not a problem with the three suns.  Not until someone discovers that the suns are all about to be blocked by a giant planet.  Soon darkness falls and only the strength and determination of a convicted felon will be able to pull anyone through as they must finish the repairs while fending off the night predators.<br /><br />According to some preview material when the movie was first released, Riddick is a government assassin who has outlived his mission but the government has been unable to eliminate him as he is too good.  This background gives one a different view of this movie.  The later additions to the series seem to have abandoned this idea.  Still, it is a good story of enlightened self interest.  Decent acting and good effects help drive this tale of survival.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>This was the second Riddick movie I've seen. I watched it in the hope that the sequel I saw first would make more sense. No such luck. This one does, however, make more sense by itself.<br /><br />The premise is of a crash landing on a forbidding planet. One of those to survive is an escaped convict with a bounty. The trouble is that the local wildlife is not very friendly and seems to take a positive delight in turning survivors into casualties. They appear to be large creatures, somewhat reminiscent of bats, vampire tendencies and an aversion to light and human beings. That is where Riddick comes in handy since he is decidedly unhealthy to the "bats".<br /><br />The story was fairly predictable but done well enough. I did not think it was great but it apparently appeals to some. Don't expect it to be a great setup for the sequel, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>The anti here genre of movies was always a favorite of mine.  Main reason being, is that if you look in the average movie or story, the good guys tend to be dull, and the bad guys are the most interesting characters in the movie.  Examples of anti heroes are Snake Plisken(Escape from New York), Jack Carter(Get Carter), or Porter(Payback).  These weren't heroes with lofty ideals or alturistic goals, these were villians that happened to have similar goals to the protagonists or were coherced in to helping a good cause.  Riddick is now added to this line of anti heroes.<p>The plot is relatively simplistic, and would probably fail under scrutiny, but it isn't the point of the movie.  The idea is that this is some sort of interstellar bus/plane travelling through an unpopulated part of the galaxy.  They get hit by a rain of small meteors and the ship starts to go down.  The co pilot attempts to jettison the passenger section to save ship, but the system jams and the ship crashes on a seemingly unihabited planet.<p>The planet is a surreal landscape, there is more than one sun, and it creates a strange surreal lighting, nothing seems quite real.  The planet is a desert and desolate, nothing but rocks and sand for as long as they can see.  When they make stock of who survived they find that they have two passengers that were unexpected, a marshal of some sort, and an escaped convict named Riddick.  An almost inhuman predator that had been recently recaptured and was being brought back into incarceration.  <p>Upon some exploration of the planet they find that it wasn't completely deserted.  They find a large collection of bones, like an elepahnt graveyard for some giant creatures.  As well as what appears to be a science station, seemingly deserted for years.  This seems like a boon since they can use some of the lefteover equipment to reapair a ship.  But three things happen that radically change their plans.  One is Riddick escapes and is on the prowl.  Two, is that the previous lifeforms on the planet were wiped out by a vicious flying creature that inhabits the planet in swarms.  Three, the creatures are highly photosensitive, but the planet is shifting, and the sun is going down.  With this planet, that could mean weeks.<p>This was a suprisingly good movie.  Not one that you worry on the plot or dialogue, but to sit back and enjoy the ride.  Diesel is great as the predator diesel.  Seemingly more like a jungle cat on the prowl than an escaped convict.  He really looks like he is toying with the survivors.  Not trying to kill or hurt them, but playing strange games that serve no purpose aside from enjoyment.<p>the rest of the cast is a bit cliche, but they are just vehicles for the main character and the story.  Which is similar to a James Cameron film, they land in a dark place, and things keep getting darker.  Some faces arer recognizable from the sci fi genre, noticably Claudia Black from Farscape fame.  They aren't bad, but they are obviously just backdrops and victims.  The alien species is interesting and vicious, and the situation created by them gives the movie a desperate feel.<p>I wouldn't rate this movie as perfect, but fun.  It is a good action flick and, so far, Vin Diesel's best work yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Pitch Black, director David Twohy's visually stimulating film, is a solid science fiction adventure, with an interesting cast, nasty aliens, and a pretty intelligent plot that holds together well for the most part.  <p>A crisis in space, as a meteor shower damages the hull of the merchant vessel "Hunter Gratzner".  Awakening from a sleep state, the occupants of the spacecraft find themselves sliding down into the atmosphere of a planet.  Quick actions by the Docking Pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), saves the ship from burning up, but much of the ship's hull is torn away in a thrilling and violent crash landing on the planet's sandy surface.<p>A handful of survivors are left on the desertlike planet, which bathed by the light of three suns, shows few signs of active life.  Among the group are Johns (Cole Hauser), a bounty hunter, and his prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel).  The group explores the planet, which shows traces of past habitation, but no human life is found.  Finding an abandoned camp, the survivors encounter a hoard of strange flying creatures hiding in one of the buildings.  After the creatures kill a young boy, a further search reveals a cavern full of old human bones.  <p>The survivors discover that an eclipse will soon plunge the planet into "pitch black" darkness.  The darkness will trigger the appearance of the flying aliens, who repelled by the light of the planetary system's three suns, remain hidden underground.  Thus begins a race for survival, as the group must salvage supplies, repair an existing ship, and escape from the planet.<p>The special effects are very good.  The scene where a multitude of flying creatures fill the sky is impressive, as is the scene where one of the survivors is dismembered and ripped to pieces.  The aliens themselves are unusual looking and quite fierce.  Unlike "Aliens", Pitch Black is not a straightforward shoot em up battle between the creatures and man.  Instead other subplots are explored.  The basic conflict between Riddick and Johns finally reaches a head during the desert trek.  There are issues of blame and responsibility, concerning Fry.  And also with Riddick, who balks at helping his fellow man.<p>Pitch Black is recommended to science fiction and action film audiences.  Riddick is a mysterious anti-hero, and Vin Diesel is absolutely riveting on screen.  His voice slow and errie.  A sequel based on the character Riddick, is in pre-production phase.  Radha Mitchell is outstanding as Fry, a woman attempting to rise to the situation, seeking redemption.  A talented and busy actress, who will hopefully be seen more in mainstream films.  Pitch Black's two commentary tracks with director David Twohy are interesting and informative.

Fast-paced thriller has lots of action, scares, and suspense, boasts very impressive special effects and production values, and features two terrific leads in the sexy Radha Mitchell and Vin Diesel. Superb direction from David Twohy solidifies this exemplary sci-fi/horror tale.<br />**** 1/2 out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>Vin Diesel stars as Richard B. Riddick, a potentially amoral and dangerous criminal being transported through space to prison.  When the spacecraft crashes on an isolated planet, only a few survive, including Claudia Black (Farscape), Cole Hauser, and Radha Mitchell.  During the day, the planet is a barren dessert, and the survivors worry that they will die of thirst; as night falls, they find that they are prey to a terrifying foe.  The survivors find themselves relying on Riddick, despite their hesitation.  <p>Pitch Black is a solid sci-fi thriller, despite its relatively low budget (23 million).  The director, David Twohy (writer of "The Fugitive"), manages to maintain a genuinely creepy atmosphere throughout the movie and keeps the movie unpredictable.  Ultimately, it's the type of well-crafted B-movie that is rarely made today, and it helped make Vin Diesel a star.  Pitch Black is likely to become a cult classic, helped immeasurably by the forthcoming planned sequel "The Chronicles of Riddick."<p>Extras: The DVD features an excellent director commentary track, which sustains a nice balance between technical description of special effects and more general aspects of how the movie was created.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>This movie, when it was released, stared nobody famous (helloooo Vin Diesel), was directed by David Twohy (who is responsible for some pretty major flops, like G. I. Jane, The Arrival, Waterworld, Critters 2 and Terminal Velocity), and was written by the brothers Wheat, Jim and Ken, who have also spent most of their time penning some pretty dreary stuff (Birds II, The Fly II, and Nightmare on Elm Street 4). Aside from the fact that Twohy once directed The Fugitive, this movie has nothing going for it right out of the starting block.<br /><br /> Let's talk plot. Taking place in the distant future, a space ship is carrying some passengers to an unnamed planet. Among the denizens is a dangerous convict, who is our narrator. For no explained reason, the ship's hull is punctured full of holes, causing an understandable and intense crash, depositing the surviving members of the group on a large deserted planet that has three suns. Unfortunately, a major solar eclipse is on the verge of occurring, and the planet just happens to be infested with a horrifying race of aliens that can only live in the dark. Needless to say, the aliens begin feasting on the poor survivors like they're Human McNuggets. Pass the popcorn!<br /><br /> Perhaps the most admirable trait of the movie is its patience. It jumps into the story with just enough exposition to keep it sensible, but it doesn't rush anywhere from there, doesn't make any excuses, and doesn't explain itself any more than it has to. Each element of the story (including the nicely designed and unobtrusive sub-plots) achieves a mythical quality within the confines of the well-measured story. Of course, the cinematography helps. The first half of the movie, establishing the mood and situation, is almost over-exposed, glaring a hot white. The three suns (one of which is a silver blue) shine beautifully on the shimmering and humming planet, and everyone's faces become bleached masks. And then, suddenly, it's dark.<br /><br /> There's nothing devouring about the film. It certainly doesn't swallow the audience whole, the way Aliens did. But it does provide a context and a story that, in its own element, is believable and suspenseful, the way Alien did. Sure, Pitch Black has its cheesy moments, but it's the type of cheese you don't regret, and most of it provides a welcome relief from the constant swarthy forms rushing by in the darkness. Balanced out by moments of intense creepiness, the cheese helps keep the movie from falling into total self-importance.<br /><br /> But what makes the flick (despite nicely underplayed acting all around) is the visually enchanting tricks the director opted to add. The convict narrator spent most of his life in a prison with almost no lighting. Upon his release (i.e. breakout) he got a doctor to give him night vision. (C'mon, it's the future) At many points the movie adopts his point of view, which is simultaneously gorgeous and chilling. Add to that the alien point of view (which is an array of crystalline shards, intended to represent the way they &quot;see&quot; things in a manner similar to bats: via echoes), and you have a flick well worth just watching, if not experiencing.<br /><br /> It's hard to know who'll like it and who won't, but I don't hesitate to say this is a good movie. Playing out like a live action version of Myst plus Doom, this show has its weak points and its strong points, its silly moments and its strong moments, but doesn't disappoint. And although some of it may be gross, some of it disturbing, and some of it a little dopey, it's an engaging story without a predictable resolution, tuned to an almost perfect pitch.<br /><br /> Get it? &quot;Pitch?&quot; Pitch Black? Just go see the movie, for crying out loud.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is an incredibly good movie that successfully crosses over into two genres: science fiction and horror. It does justice to both. <p>A passenger laden space ship crash lands on an apparently barren and arid planet orbited by three suns. One of the passengers is a viscious killer whose eyesight is such that he can see better in the dark than the others. <p>At first, their most serious problem appears to be how to get off the planet. It quickly becomes clear that how to stay alive in order to get off the planet is the first and foremost issue.  You see, the planet is inhabited by killer creatures that shy away from light, and an eclipse is on the immediate horizon. <p>The viewer doesn't fully see the creatures throughout most of the film, just their gruesome handiwork. Less is more and the film director capitalizes on this premise to great effect. You do not really see them fully until the very end, and they do not disappoint! <p>This stylish and gripping film depicts the killer as the anti-hero who ultimately squares off with the creatures from one's worst nightmares. As darkness falls, the survivors become less fearful of the anti-hero, as his unique ability to discern these carnivorous creatures in the darkness can help them survive. It is their fear of these nightmarish creatures that now becomes paramount.<p>Visually stunning, this film is unusual and clever. It is no wonder that it is a sleeper hit. It has the makings of a cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A13KXWTN0DT878.html">A13KXWTN0DT878</a><br/><p>I'm the kind of person who gets excited over movies by seeing the trailers. I even get chills from trailers, and this one of those &quot;chilled&quot; movies. The plot: A group of ship-wrecked survivors fight for their lives on a planet overrun by dark loving blood-thirsty creatures. The positivities: The acting was awesome, and I was glad to see a movie full of fresh faces. They may not be new actor(resses), but they aren't widely known. But after this movie, they should all be recognized for their great acting and characterization. Especially Vin Deisel who played a convicted murder with heat censored eyes who plays the hero of the movie. The guy's intensity made his character (a top-notch murderer) very mysterious, and spontaneous. Radha Mitchell did great as our heroine and leader, and the young actress who played the girl who disguised herself as a guy were awesome additions to the cast. The suspense was kept up scale after the eclipse happened that allowed the creatures to come out of hiding. You keep asking yourself: Who's going to die next? Or when they're going to die. The negative: This isn't really a negative thing, but there are some places in the movie where you feel as if you're watching the sequel to Starship Troopers. Although the creatures are totally different and more high-tech looking, there was just something about the movie that gave me the feeling. All in all, Pitch Black is a great sci-fi/horror that is well worth seeing, and buying.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>So much fun and as a sci fi junky, IMHO, top notch!<br /><br />Like Radja Chadna's review on the main page, I dont know how I missed this. I was living with 6 people in a crazy apt in Manhattan during 2000. We were all film students, but never went to the movies, were too busy I guess forgetting what it was to be alive. I dont remember a trailer for this, no idea who Vin Diesel was randomly picked this up on a friends advice because he said it was (more or less) an extension to Charlie Sheen's 'The Arrival'<br /><br />I wish I had seen this in theaters. Just epic sci fi. Characters that were easily enjoyable, that you cared about, the switching of the boy/girl thing was very well done, the story had me hanging on from jump street. There is so much here, a combo of a little Dune and The Descent, the lighting was really good even in the dark scenes and I was hooked baby, just really stellar stuff. The scene of the ringed Saturn type planet eclipsing the planet as they drove by, was so magical. The dude from Platoon, (interestingly with Charlie Sheen), as the Imam was a good mix of balance. The scene when the flying smaller bat things, went down the long hole and you can peer in to see all the bones from the scientist there that locked themselves in and forget their was an opening 22 years earlier or whatever, man just so well done. There are touches of so many memories from other films that remind me a bit of this, like I said: Dune, The Cave (still thought it was cool), The Descent, Duncan Jones Moon, hahha dunno, all just came to mind.<br /><br />What Vin lacks in his acting ability, he makes up for with a pretty decent ensemble cast, that just takes the film along the way where you never lose interest and really are on the edge of your seat. Dig in.<br /><br />I love how a film can be lost for years from your sight, and then something like this comes along that you overlooked and it can turn your whole world onto a series like Riddick, hoping that Vin will step away from the $$$ that is Fast and Furious for a bit, and concentrate on his favorite character for perhaps another two Riddick fliks with David Twowy.<br /><br />Just so much fun!</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>There are some suspenseful moments. The action scenes are OK. The plot is so so.<br /><br />It's worth watching once.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I watched this with some trepidation, as Vin Diesel is not a great actor and most of the other films I've seen him in have been - well - awful. However, this film, rather like the Terminator films for Arnold Schwarzenegger, suited him perfectly and it was much better than I expected.<br /><br />Its a tense Sci-Fi/horror film in which a spaceship crash lands on a planet and the surviving crew have to contend with the planets less than pleasent inhabitants as well as Riddick (Diesel) who is a dangerous prisoner being transported on the spaceship. Riddick is no ordinary prisoner though, and because of their desperate situation the crew enlist his help to try and survive.<br /><br />Its all well done and in places pretty scary. The cast all give good performances and the director and cinematographer have done a fine job creating another world. Some of the camerawork in particular was cleverly done and this especially added to the tension in the film.<br /><br />Obviously it owes a huge debt to Alien and Aliens, but it is sufficiently original to hold up in its own right. OK it isn't as good as Alien or Aliens but if you watch this with an open mind you'll probably be surprised at just how good it really is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>A transport ship crash lands on a dead planet with 3 suns. Among the survivors is an escaped murderer who was being taken back to prison. They discover an abandoned camp which includes a ship they hope to use to get off the planet. They also discover the planet is inhabited by nasty meat-eating creatures that live in darkness. Figuring they will be ok as there is no night on a planet with 3 suns, they are dealt another blow when a model in the abandoned camp indicates an eclipse is coming. When it starts, the planet it plunged into darkness for a long time and the millions of creatures come above ground. The movie becomes a story of survival as they use any source of light they can find to fend off the creatures to get to the ship and leave the planet.<br /><br />I like the concept of this movie and it does a pretty good job of telling the story although it becomes predictable once the creatures emerge and the survivors have to depend on sociopath Riddick to lead them to safety. Once the creatures are brought into full view they're not that interesting and their is no real suspense. Except for one character, you pretty much knew who was going to live and who was going to die. Overall a worthwhile action/scifi/horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>My friend hated this movie, but he was expecting a horror movie. I love it for the details. The acting isn't perfect, but hey... <p>Ship transporting a whole bunch of not-so-rich people, one rich preson going the scenic route, and one psycho prisoner with guard crashes on the nearest survivable planet after being holed by an asteroid. The planet was once colonized and hasn't been explored since (one gets the feeling space travel & colonization arn't really controlled or coordinated by any single government in this universe). There are aliens, and they arn't really intelligent or friendly. <p>Cool bits? The lighting in the movie has been altered to show that other planets probably would not have a sun with the same visable light spectrum as earth. The aliens don't look like people at all. And there's a good bit where you ... ok, I won't give all the good bits away. But it's really cool. And is has Vin Deisel, acting waaaaay better than in anything else I've seen him in... and looking yummy...</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>I've been hearing lots of comments about this movie from friends of mine, so I finally decided to buy it.  Lemme tell ya, it was worth every penny!  Vin Diesel was absolutely wonderful as Riddick, the convicted murderer whose ability to see the planet's indigenous, man-eating lifeforms proves to be most helpful in getting the crash survivors around in the dark, and Radha Mitchell was great as Caroline, the surviving officer of the crashed ship ... Riddick .. escapes with (the) survivors.  It was also wonderful to see Keith David of Armageddon fame as the Muslim holy man.  I only wish he'd had a bigger role!<p>My only real gripe with Pitch Black (and one, I am sure, that is shared by lots of others everywhere) was the fact that the character played by Farscape's Claudia Black was 86'ed barely halfway through the film.  She was a real tough cookie who seemed to know what she was doing, and it just seemed so senseless that she got offed so early.  Except for that little blunder, I found Pitch Black to be very entertaining, and the behind the scenes documentary to be very informative.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Vin Diesel who plays the anti-hero hero in &quot;Pitch Black&quot; should inherit the muscle man movie roles of the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger, if this movie is any evidence.  Actually, Diesel is a much better actor than Arnie, and he is the core of this highly entertaining and frightening science fiction movie.<p>I was awed by some of the lighting and camera work; scenes shifting from hues of orange to brown to blue and then the eeriness of the eclipse.  But, lordy, what creatures.  Even though we know they are computer generated, one cannot help but admit they were some of the best monsters since &quot;Aliens&quot;.  The device of having them in the dark was superb, because not only did we fear the sight of them, but their haunting and frightening screams.  <p>The overall casting was likewise effective, particularly Randha Mitchell as Fry, a complex and well-drawn female character that combined both strength and vulnerability, and an expressive face that worked beautifully for her.  Cole Hauser is effectively creepy as the addicted cop, who shifts from his early &quot;hero&quot; role to the true villain of the piece.  I also liked Claudia Black's tenacity and guarded sexuality, and Keith David's stereotypical religious leader.  Ketih managed to make him convincing.<p>But, it is Diesel who struts, grunts and muscles his way through the film; he is very good at showing expression with just a little twist of his mouth, and even with the &quot;see in the dark&quot; eyes, his final scene with Mitchell is both touching and unforgettable.<p>A great movie----let's look for more of David Twohy's brilliant conceptualization and style.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RRBPUGD7UOSP.html">A3RRBPUGD7UOSP</a><br/><p>I sat down ready to watch what I had hoped would be a great sci-fi action film. I expected another movie to give the 'Alien' series a run for it's money. I feel like I wasted my time. I want it back. I feel like the producers of this film pulled a fast one on me.<p>The film follows a group of people on a starship who crashland on a remote planet. One character, Vin Diesel's Riddick, is an escaped convict heading back to prison having just been recaptured. As the group search the area around the crashsite, the find that the planet's three suns are going to set, and they will be plunged into total darkness. In this darkness lies a terror worse than Riddick. Blah, blah, blah...<p>We all know the hype. The commercials were good and the special effects look good. Honestly, three-quarters of the way into this movie, I was enjoying it. There were several plot twists that were totally unexpected, and fairly refreshing, until toward the end of the film. One plot twist too many, and the movie lost me as a fan. I felt cheated, or better yet, tricked.<p>Diesel does a good job with the acting in this movie. The special effects were fantastic, and the creatures were pretty scary. Not as nightmare-inducing as the alien, but still a bit scary. <p>They say that two things can make or break a movie.

The immediate danger is the need for water, so they strike out in search, but come upon an abandoned colony.  But no colonists.  They soon discover that 22 years ago, the people were attacked by creatures of the night, sort of a cross between a dragon and a bat that feed on human flesh.  The pilot contends with the struggle between the drug addict bounty hunter and his killer prisoner (Vin) and they all fight to survive first the desert planet, then the coming of the 22 year solar eclipse that sets the monsters of the dark loose.<p>It is taught, edge of the seat action, with great writing, direction and super acting from the whole cast.  <p>One very great Sci-FI film!!</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>loved pitch black one of my fav's a must have for sci fi fans and horror fans-- action packed this one is a hit!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>A small bunch of humans are space wrecked on a desert<br />planet that has a black secret.

My original impression of the film turned out to be pretty much true: John Carpenter's "The Thing" meets "Alien". A diverse group of people are marooned on a desolate planet with three suns. One of the survivors, Riddick, (Played by Vin Diesel) is a mass-murderer/serial killer. The planet is inhabited by nocturnal, light-sensitive creatures who feed on human flesh....Luckily, the three suns force the Aliens to avoid the surface. Unfortunately for our hapless survivors, they've arrived just in time for a once-every-22-Years Total Eclipse....Is that the dinner bell I hear ringing....? And what's the bigger threat: The carnivorous Aliens or Riddick...?<p>  What sets Pitch Black apart is it's smart script. There are quite a few twists and turns here. Heroes who aren't so heroic, villains who might not be all that bad, a couple of unexpected deaths.....The effects are good, but don't overshadow the generally fine acting. Diesel did a good job as Riddick, but I did have to rewind and use the subtitles a LOT to catch some of Riddick's lines due to Diesel's mumbly delivery...<p>  The DVD has footage not seen in theaters, 2 seperate commentary tracks, theatrical trailers, production notes, cast & crew bios, a totally dopey "Pitch Black Raveworld Event" (20 minutes of people dancing while clips from the film play in the background), and a teeny-weeny little making-of featurette that clocks in at less than five minutes. Even though I'm not generally a fan of Vin Diesel's, if they do make a Riddick-based sequel, I'll be first on line....</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;Pitch Black,&quot; about a stranded group of space travelers threatened by voracious alien monsters, is an entertaining thriller. True, it's not the most original film: elements of this story are reminiscent of such past films as &quot;Aliens.&quot; But solid direction, performances, and special effects make this an above-average film of its genre. The ominous, threatening atmosphere is greatly enhanced by some outstanding cinematography. And Vin Diesel delivers a memorable performance as a criminal who is stranded with the rest. If you like sci-fi thrillers, I recommend &quot;Pitch Black.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Considering that this was a low-budget film, shot in the Australian outback...they did a hell of a good job. Although the script was weak, Radha Mitchell pulled off an excellent performance. I believe that all of the actors in this film should be commended for turning what should have been a total bomb into an entertaining, action-packed joy ride. Vin Diesel was also very convincing as Riddick. He too pulled off a marvelous performance. The action was spine tingling and edged-of-your-seat stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>I saw a trailer of this and it looked like a low budget shlock movie. I rented the DVD for various irrational reasons and it was a reasonable science fiction thriller. Despite looking low budget in the previews the sets and filming are quite good. <p>The main attractions are the two leads, a convict played by Vin Diesel and a female pilot played by someone else. <p>The film is interesting as it has a female in the jock lead role and in doing so it is not artificial like Tomb raider. The actress playing the role is both effective an charasmatic. <p>Vin Diesel is also a pleasant surprise. In interviews he comes across as a little dull but he is able to give a multi dimension peformance to his role. You have in a science fictin film something unusual a interesting and rounded character. <p>The photography is good, lots of washed out tones which create the sense of an alient world. The &quot;monsters&quot; provide menance by only being shown for short periods and the way they are portrayed does not degenerate into comedy as can sometimes happen. Quite a reasonable DVD to play to while away a few hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Pitch Black brings to the screen the story of a spaceship carrying a wide variety of passengers that experiences technical problems while en route and is forced to crash land on a planet dominated by flying pterodactylus type monsters.<br /><br />The acting is very poor to the point that acting lessons are needed ASAP for everyone involved.<br /><br />The "bad guy" is much more like the usual pompous high school jock/"pretty boy" seen over and over again in those types of movies.  Apart from his weak appearance he fails to convince in his role as a mean and greedy drug addicted mercenary.<br /><br />Furthermore, he somehow manages to kick Vin Diesel's butt repeatedly!!!<br /><br />Moreover, what was the point of the Muslim cleric with his four acolytes???<br /><br />Or the Australian woman and the arrogant Englishman for that matter?<br /><br />Not to mention the obnoxious, spoiled kid who for some reason is not scared at being stuck on "hell planet" and who has a "surprise" for us later on in the movie.<br /><br />Unless of course the whole point of having these annoying characters in the film was for the audience to enjoy seeing them picked off one by one in true B-movie fashion (as I've seen other reviewers characterize the movie).<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's an average plot, the acting and the actors are very weak, the dialogues are poor and the special effects are very good.<br /><br />The potential for a great movie was definitely there, but the surprisingly poor acting/casting and the full of holes plot prevented it from becoming anything more than average.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a B-movie so one should not expect too much.<br /><br />Overall, both Vin Diesel as well as the rest of the "cast" do a rather poor job of trying to cover up for the mediocre plot; wait `til Pitch Black is shown on TV.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>Pitch Black is a Sci-Fi film sure to please fans of the genre. While the acting wavers at time, the film is held together by a good storyline, and by the film presense of Vin Diesel. I just finished my second viewing of Pitch Black, and enjoyed it once again.<br /><br />The story is as such (without spoilers): A crew of 40+ crashes on a distant planet after their ship is hit by a meteor shower. Few survive, but those that do must deal with a brutal ex-con (Diesel), and an enemy that loves the dark are attacks during a coming eclipse.<br /><br />My rating of this movie is primarily for fans of sci-fi and action movies. Those who could care less about these genres will probably not like Pitch Black, simply because the acting has occasional glimpses of mediocrity. But alas, Vin Diesel holds the movie together. You love and hate him at the same time.<br /><br />The story is quite unique, and in the end I felt entertained and emotionally involved with the characters. A main character dies at the end, and I was saddened. Also, at the end I am left wanting the story to continue. I am grateful that the Chronicles of Riddick do not end here.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 68<br /><br />40 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

As with &quot;Legend,&quot; I feel that &quot;Pitch Black&quot; begins with an open canvas, which segue into regular tactics and cliches of horror and sci-fi, and then is rescued in the end by a climax that proves to be satisfying (of course, &quot;Urban Legend&quot; does it in a much less appealing manner). I did have my doubts at the beginning, but in the end, I felt that it was a good enough effort to sit through, and even enjoyable in certain places. <p>The film begins, fittingly enough, with a spacecraft crash-landing on a secluded planet where there are three suns that shine multiple colors of brilliant light across dry, arid plains of dirt and rock. The planet itself is never identified, nor is it an important factor in the movie. It merely provides for an eerie and unstable setting that will set the tone for the terror to come, and it does a commendable job in doing so. This is where the filmmakers get to show their stuff as well, leaving the norm of filming techniques and giving us lots of yellow and blue hues to give the sense that the atmosphere is quite uncomfortable. <p>Our group of survivors, assistant captain Fry, a female, and less than ten civilians, begin surveying the terrain in hopes of finding water and nutrition to live off of until they can safely make it off the planet's surface. The intrical character of the film is Riddick, a muscle-bound prisoner whom no one trusts until things begin to get intense. One of the group members is mysteriously killed, and further prying leads to the discovery of a small abandoned town, where a 3D diagram tells them that an eclipse is about to take place, bringing with it the thousands of carnivorous creatures that fear light. As the group searches their crippled ship for supplies to make it to the abandoned ship in the ghost town, the realization comes over them that they must face their greatest fear without even being able to see it. <p>The first thing that needs to be discussed is Riddick's character, who is played quite well by actor Vin Diesel, a man who could match muscles with Schwarzenegger and wit with Eastwood. The script sets up his personality so that we never know when to trust him, or if we'll ever be able to. He went to jail for murder, and he shows no remorse for the crime yet neither does he express a need to rehash the events of his past. He is the typical macho man who has a hidden soft side. This makes it much more interesting, because he is the only way for the group to see where they are going (his eyes were altered by a prison mate to take on a sheen which allows him to see in absolute darkness). His swarthy looks will keep the female fans swooning while his way with words and quick reflexes will intrigue the major audience of sci-fi buffs. <p>The movie's structure, as I said before, tends to dwindle in the middle of the film. After the lights go out, the intensity does pick up, but for some reason, I just was not as involved in this section of the story as I felt I should be, or as I usually am with movies of this sort. It seems like there could've been a little more intensity to the entire sequence of events, which involves the group's treck across the darkened terrain to the working vessel in the abandoned town. I think one of the ruinous factors of this section, and the most important, was the predictability factor. It was easy for me to tell who was going to lose their life next because the movie sets it up by developing certain character's personalities more than others, and there you have it. Then there's the old cliche where something you do in the beginning of the movie comes back to haunt you. In this case, it has to do with Fry, who was willing to save herself in the beginning by sending everyone else into oblivion while trying to land her spacecraft. This is revealed, and there is an argument among the group about the next course of action and who's in charge, but it doesn't tie up too much of the running time. <p>However, the movie is bookended, so to speak, by a fascinating beginning and a pleasantly satisfying ending that makes the movie work. The beginning of the film really gives us the feeling of isolation and loneliness in the vast universe, and we get the feeling that even though the group is together, they are so much more apart from the rest of the universe. While the special effects employed in creating the creatures leave much to be desired, the effects used for the beginning third are superb. One shot that sticks out in the mind is the shots of the Saturn-like planet elevating on the horizon. It appears massive on screen, making the characters seem small and minute, which is very important. The ending also gives us something to smile about. The predictability ends, and the actions and tactics of the characters, especially Riddick, make the movie worth the trip. Also worth noting is the inner conflict of Riddick, if there even is one going on. You are left with the question of whether or not he has become a changed man after the events of the film, and basically you get to decide. <p>The cast is mostly comprised of unknowns, most of whom die off in the beginning of the movie to leave the higher ranking performers to do the dirty work. Vin Diesel is a marvelous action hero/villian, and he really brings to life the uneasiness and intimidation that his character inspires in the rest of the survivors. Radha Mitchell does a commendable job as Fry, who comes off as strong-willed and involved with the events at hand. She doesn't break down or give up in the midst of tumultuous situations, but instead presses on when things get harder. It soon becomes a battle of opinion between her and Riddick, which is quite intriguing to watch. <p>In summation, I entered in the world of &quot;Pitch Black&quot; without much expectation, and left it feeling more surprised than I thought I would. The movie does have its redeeming qualities to rescue it from being a mere two star flick, mostly in the acting and the majority of the story. It's an interesting look, moreso than &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; at the fact that what scares us the most is what we cannot even see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YC9XEDFKXPLK.html">A1YC9XEDFKXPLK</a><br/><p>Pitch Black may borrow from several Sci-Fi flicks; at least all the flicks were honorably favorable ones like Aliens,Road Warrior, Dune, etc.  The original creativity and imagination from the writer for this story,including aliens that will only come out in the dark or night, added to the thrill and horror of what these creatures could do. At least the creatures were given a &quot;weakness&quot; unlike other films where the creepy things are indestructible. Expose these puppies to sunlight and P-O-O-F !...The same thing that happens to Gremlins and vampires in the sun w/o sunblock spf 2000.<p>Vin Diesel is also another actor to watch out for as he may be the next big box office success. Right now he's a little rough around the acting edges. Yet, he's defintiely destined for greater things! As for Radha Mitchell, she portrayed her character very humanly; she proved her character was fallible and human just like the others despite her rank or authority.<p>The f/x were also reminiscent of Starship Troopers; which is a compliment and not an insult. The only annoying eye strain-excercise is the beginning of the film where the crew is new to the planet's surface;The bluish-white filter camera effect was unbearable ! <p>This is a defintie Sci-Fi must see !</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>This movie tries, it really does.  It makes a whole-hearted effort to recapture the horror, claustrophobia, and emotional turmoil of Ridley Scott's &quot;Alien.&quot;  But it just fails.<p>There are two basic problems with this film.  First is the monster.  In &quot;Alien,&quot; we had a man in a suit; in &quot;Pitch Black&quot; we have computer-generated creatures.  The Alien, designed by H.R. Giger, actually looked like it was in the environment, because it was, giving the actors something to react to.  The creature in this film, by John Cox's Creature Workshop, doesn't, despite a marathon technicial staff.  It's entirely too obvious, too often, that the actors are reacting to the air, expecting the thing to be matted in later.<p>The other problem lies with the characters.  The actors themselves do an admirable job, reflecting the known skill and acclaim of folks like Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, and Keith David.  The problem is that we have no sympathetic point-of-view character to hold onto, and thus we don't much care if they live or die.  The only characters we have who aren't at least somewhat objectionable are a group of Muslims on the hajj, and as most of them have no English, they can't serve as the audience surrogate in the action.<p>The movie is, mostly, visually beautiful.  The location work, shot in the same desert as &quot;Mad Max,&quot; makes for wonderful atmospherics.  The shift from relentless sun to total darkness (think Asimov's &quot;Nightfall) is done mostly well, with a few scientific errors easily overlooked in a movie.  And the creatures, when they hold the screen themselves, are remarkably well done.<p>This doesn't make up, however, for the manifest weaknesses of this film.  It tries to hard to ape elements of successful past sci-fi horror, and it just doesn't hold up.<p>A sequel is due out next year.  Here's hoping we're at least given a POV character we can hang onto and understand.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>I have no idea what &quot;Pitch Black&quot; was about, but Vin Diesel cussed a lot. All I know it was dark and these creatures came out from the hidden and started to eat people. Vin Diesel of course survived because he's pretty much immortal. Just listen to what he says, it's comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>3 of 5 stars to the sci-fi movie Pitch Black. This is the second movie in the Chronicles of Riddick series with Vin Diesel in the role of Riddick. The movie opens with a passenger transport space ship starting to crash into a world (the ship had been knocked off-course). The ship is carrying Riddick plus several other passengers. The crash breaks the ship into lots of big chunks and Riddick is landed far from the main group of passengers. The world appears to be a hot dry planet (a desert) with three Suns. So, the handful of survivors seek water as their first task. Things seem to go OK until nightfall when bird-like creatures come out of hiding and start killing/eating people. The group is re-united with Riddick just before nightfall. From here the plot is simple and not too interesting: get to another part of the crashed ship to the shuttle to escape from the planet. Of course, between where they are and where the shuttle is are those birdlike creatures. You can guess most of the rest.<br /><br />If you didn't see the first movie of the Riddick series you'd have no idea who this guy is and why he has shiny eyes. The movies does little to give you any of the back-story. For that matter, in this movie Riddick is a not too interesting character and there is no development that would lead to a future story. So this is a good sci-fi movie with a very predictable plot. Yes, I do recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>This movie start well but it gets boring and uninspiring afterward. Overall: Mediocre.</p></br><a href="../users/A41I67QYRAOSQ.html">A41I67QYRAOSQ</a><br/><p>However, not widely viewed prior to the release of Chronicles of Riddick.  This is a sci-fi thriller!  People marooned on a desert planet with a surprise when the sun goes down ("Pitch-Black).  Riddick as always is a tough guy whose character you will like and want to see him in more movies. The choice of characters was very good.  You develop distinct feelings towards each one and the writers did not let those emotions go to waste.  Excellent cinematography.  You will be on the edge of your seat waiting for the boogey men!</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>This may be the worst movie I have sat all the way through.<br /><br />I kept thinking (or hoping) not that it would get better but that it would get less bad.<br /><br />It didn't.  It just went from bad to worse.<br /><br />This is chiefly because of bad writing throughout, lame special effects, and bad--spectacularly bad--acting on the part of the two principal white males.<br /><br />Cole Hauser, who plays Vin Diesel's Probation Officer, learned acting in modeling school: to act, strike poses.  He overacts, or I should say overposes, shamelessly.<br /><br />Vin Diesel has the opposite technique.  He apparently filmed this while in a coma.  Either that or he phoned it in, and his body was produced by special effects.<br /><br />The women aren't bad, but nothing can redeem this hopeless clunker.<br /><br />Even the creatures aren't very frightening.  And the more you see them, the less frightening they get.  All of $1.75 was spent on their computer animation.<br /><br />And at least that much was spent on red-syrup for blood.  There is also a lot of blue-syrup for blood.  This is either the creatures' blood, or simply some arty filming.<br /><br />Also in the Arty Filming Dept. is the overall YELLOW of the first scenes.  Later this is dropped, with no explanation.  Also dropped is the notion that the survivors have to use breathing apparatus.  I guess they got tired of sucking on tubes.  These simply disappear.<br /><br />They aren't the only ones that suck.  Marvelously sucky are the stabs at Portentous Dialogue.  Seeing Vin Diesel debate (or somnabulate) theology with the Muslim guy is truly amusing.  (But don't eat your lunch first.)<br /><br />What redeems this whole mess is the fact that YOU DON'T CARE A DAMN ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. When they die, or when they escape, you don't care.<br /><br />A silly comedy.  The songs are especially unmemorable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>Oh, the joy that is Pitch Black.  It starts out in space, with a voice-over by Vin Diesel.  All you know about him is that he's a criminal being transported.  Suddenly, the confusion starts...the ship is being hit by something, and a crash landing is necessary.  The first huge moral dilema is presented within the first four or five minutes of the film.  It is brilliant because it sets the tone for the rest of the movie.  Cole Hauser plays Johns, the man in charge of transporting Riddick...he's concerned only about his payday.  There's Jack, the young boy running away from something, and Imam and his students/proteges, on a trip to New Mecca.<p>The fun really begins when they finally find some water...and realize they're not alone on the planet.  The planet goes dark for the first time in 22 years, and the creatures come out for some feeding.  Survivors start getting picked off one by one, internal debates heat up, and you really wonder what Riddick will do...or even Johns, for that matter.  I love movies where there's no clear-cut &quot;hero&quot; character.  We all have our flaws, and they are all on display in this movie.<p>The DVD presentation is fantastic.  The picture and sound quality are top-notch.  There's not as much behind-the-scenes stuff as you might want, but this movie was made years ago on a small, $20 million budget.  The best special feature is the commentary by Twohy, Cole Hauser, and Vin Diesel.  They give a lot of cool insights into the film, discuss what they think worked and didn't work, and what they tried to add to the film.  I highly recommend this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>The unrated version of this movie only has an additional three minutes of footage, but it actually seems to have even less than that. There were basically just little segments throughout the movie that were extended by a few seconds, just to add that little bit more blood and gore. Didn't really add anything, nor did it take anything away. The extras consist of a couple commentary tracks, lame making of featurette, trailers, web links, etc. Not a lot, but my standards seem to be getting higher. The movie itself is a good sci-fi horror flick. I particularly love the opening sequence when the ship crashed on the planet. Those special effects were awesome. If you haven't seen this movie, I would rent the dvd before you buy it, just to make sure you like it, but if you like sci-fi this is a good film to add to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>I'd heard, over and over again, how &quot;Pitch Black&quot; was just an &quot;Alien&quot; rip-off. Apparently there's another version of the film going around, since the one I saw was in no way an &quot;Alien&quot; movie. If anything, it owes more to &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; but it's really just another example of a man vs. nature story (flashback to high school English class ...).<p>Of course, if it really was an &quot;Aliens&quot; retread, it might have packed a few more jolts along the way. Perhaps I'm jaded at this point -- it's certainly possible -- but this film was interesting and involving, but not really scary at all.<p>But for my money, it WAS interesting. The intertwined moral dilemmas of the survivors, the biology of the raptors, the cosmology of how that unnamed planet got plunged into darkness once every 22 years ... All solid stuff and more thoughtfully assembled than the last two &quot;Alien&quot; films were.<p>The film was also highlighted by the artistic choices, particularly the use of colored filters during the three suns sequences, the use of Australian actors and writing (&quot;Crikey!&quot;) and the star-making performance of Vin Diesel.<p>Diesel's character slipped once or twice into &quot;ooh, he's SO bad&quot; caricature -- or at least, his dialogue did -- but the moral dilemma he faced and the subtle performance he gave made him a pair of biceps to watch.<p>A good rental when you've decided that you just can't watch &quot;Aliens&quot; again, but want some smart science fiction survival horror. Not the best of its genre, but a worthwhile entry that doesn't deserve much of the criticism heaped upon it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>Science Fiction (and horror, for that matter) films are so numerous that their stories have been copied, remade, expanded upon, narrowed down so much that there is hardly an original idea still floating around in this genre.  "Pitch Black" does little to change that fact.  The concept of a rogue alien species endangering and eliminating human life is hardly a new one.  The Alien Trilogy provides the seminal work for this type of story and several dozen other movies have tried to copy that formula to varying degress (mostly lesser) of success.  "Pitch Black" manages to avoid the pitfalls of the path already paved in its approach to re-telling a similar story.  A transport ship carrying 40 commercial passengers (and 1 maximum security prisoner) encounter a meteor storm that forces a crash landing on a barren planet seemingly devoid of life, leaving only about a dozen of the passengers still alive.  The initial trick is in making the viewer think that the now escaped prisoner, Riddick, (played with remarkable style and depth by Vin Diesel) is the true threat to the survival of the rest of the passengers.  The real danger isn't Riddick, but a species of carnivorous, raptor-like animals (seemingly inspired by the species in Aliens) indigenous to this planet.  Initially, these animals are not much of a threat as they are deathly afraid of light (which scalds them) and this planet is privy to three (!) suns.  However, in an unexpected twist of bad luck, the survivors find out that they are about the experience an event that occurs only once every 22 years on this world... a total solar eclipse of all three suns.  Once the eclipse starts, these creatures are free to roam the surface of the planet and devour whatever prey they may find (humans, in this case).  The goal of the survivors becomes trying to transport energy cells from the crashed ship to an intact escape ship left behind by the previous set of unlucky souls from 22 years earlier.<p>With the interesting twists in its premise, this movie would still not be much more than sci-fi rehash with a gimmick if it were not for the stellar performances put in by an underrated cast.  Diesel is the most noteworthy as convicted murder Riddick.  This role practically sets itself up for a mail-it-in performance of detached coolness.  Yet, Diesel brings surprising pathos to Riddick that enables the viewer to empathize with his struggle to do whats right for Riddick (because, he is a criminal after all) or do whats right for the survivors (because he is human at the core).  One scene early in the movie demonstrates this range perfectly.  Johns, the mercenary cop who tracked down and captures Riddick, taunts Riddick while making a deal the ensure his cooperation and assistance in trying to get the survivors off-planet.  To drive home the point that Johns is definitely in control, he quickly points and fires his rifle at Riddick, intentionally missing him by a few inches telling him, "Now I want you to remember this moment, as a way things could have gone, but didn't".  Johns, gets a little too close to Riddick after this and gets surprised when Riddick, now unrestrained by the cords holding him at bay, grabs the rifle from Johns, quickly flips around in his face and screams at him "Now you remember THIS moment!".  While it would be easy to display over the top rage or unnatural coolness during this turn of events, Diesel's facial features betray a sense of frustration and fear in knowing very well that Johns could have killed him and that he does indeed control Riddick.  <p>Vin Diesel is a relatively new actor who first came to audiences' attentions playing Private Caparzo in "Saving Private Ryan".  He has such a prescence that watching him on-screen is truly compelling, from roles like a shady stock broker in "Boiler Room" to science fiction a**-kicker in "Pitch Black".  Diesel's Riddick makes some of the characters played by Schwarzenegger and Stallone look like Little Lord Fauntleroy.  Diesel could own Hollywood before it's all said and done.  Cole Houser adds strength in the role of the merc cop Johns.  Johns is seems focused primarily on greed (Riddick is a large payday to him) and his next drug hit.  He is so cold and calculating that by far exceeds Riddick as the most dangerous human.  Radha Mitchell as the ships surviving crew member and Keith David as an Arab holy man also turn in effective performances in the struggle to survive this alien world.  <p>While certainly not an original story, "Pitch Black" takes familiar plot elements and weaves them together into a re-telling that is refreshing and captivating.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>Director David N. Twothy (the Arrival) has undoubtedly surpassed my wildest expectations with this devilishly clever and well polished Science Fiction thriller that resonates with immensely amusing dialogue, sparkles with highly believable characters, reverberates with noteworthy performances from Radha Mitchell (Fry), Cole Hauser (Johns), and the incomparable Van Disel in a star making performance as the irrepressible career criminal Riddick, and ingeniously experiments and rearranges classic SCI/FI formulas and conventions ranging from Alien, Aliens, Terminator, and Star Trek with subtle filmmaking rarities like plot and character development to conceive a Sci-Fi epic that has volatile mix of sophisticated horror, highly modulated thrills and chills, and a uniquely human dimension that is sorely lacking in its peers.<p>Pitch Black is much deserved respite from the average Sci-Fi onslaught of just recycled story pictures, monster slasher flicks, inane clones and formula hybrids, and technology driven effects pictures with essentially nothing more to provide than it's sophisticated effects. Though Pitch Black contains it's lion share of new age special effects and sounds, Pitch Black instead uses the wildly advanced film-making faculties as icing on top of a well defined story rather than the other way around. <p>Thankfully, Pitch Black comes packaged with an entire brigade of options ranging from a David  N. Twothy commentary track, a making-of Documentary, theatrical trailers, a three-extra minute exclusive un-rated version of the film, a marketing video on the selling of Pitch Black, and more. A Must-Buy for any fan of superior science fiction.<p>P.S. Certainly has the most charismatic villain since the Terminator.</p></br><a href="../users/A294DWRBQUOIK4.html">A294DWRBQUOIK4</a><br/><p>Okay this film does share alot with Alien, but it is still a very enjoyable film to watch. Vin Diesel was without a doubt the most interesting character in the film. <p>  Alot of good lines and overall acting made all of them pretty good. The effects were very clever and some I found spectacular. The planet coming over the horizen I particully liked.<p>  My only real complaints are they never really say what happen at the start. And they never really show what they eat as there doesn't seem to much else on the planet. They show the aliens fighting each other, but not so much eating each other. So what do they survive on?<p>  But still a suspenseful and riveting watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Before Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser became household names (well, maybe Diesel is the only `household' name, but the others are at least bigger stars now) they all starred together in `Pitch Black', another title in the vast sea of science fiction action horror films.  What sets `Pitch Black' apart from the rest of the pack though is the way director David Twohy is able to create a true sense of dread and misery, a feat much like Scott created with `Alien'.  Instead of just randomly giving the audience high amounts of gore Twohy instead builds a slow yet steady dissention into genuine fear.<br /><br />`Pitch Black' finds a group of space traveler's crash landing on a deserted planet that is scorching hot thanks to the presence of three suns.  Amongst these travelers is a very dangerous criminal known as Riddick who is being transported by drug addict cop William J. Johns.  When Riddick escapes custody shortly after their crash landing, the crew believes they are in grave danger.  They are right; danger lurks right around the corner, but that danger is far graver than Riddick alone.  The crew soon realizes that this lifeless planet is on the verge of a total eclipse, and the creatures that are waiting to come out upon nightfall are ravenous and looking to feast.<br /><br />I remember when I first saw `Pitch Black' is was put off.  I was expecting a high octane action film with large amounts of gore and special effects.  `Pitch Black' is not like that though.  The film is more along the lines of `Alien' than `Jurassic Park'.  This is a film about fear and suspense as apposed to bloodshed and over stylized creatures.  Don't get me wrong, there is a high body count and there are some very interesting and effective looking aliens but they are not the focus.  In fact, you don't even get a good look at the aliens until halfway through the movie, and the actual `action' sequences of the film don't hit until the film is about the end, but the constant feeling of dread follows you from the opening of the film until the credits begin to roll; and then some.<br /><br />There is a scene when the group is traveling across the barren planet in the dense darkness with just a dim light guiding them and keeping them safe from the imposing creatures.  In that scene we can see the aliens crowding at the outskirts of that light, keeping just far enough away for not be bothered yet close enough to make their presence known.  That scene defines well the overall feel of this film.  As the audience we know that death is right around the corner, just beyond our line of vision.<br /><br />The acting is actually very well done here.  Vin Diesel is obviously built for action films, but he demonstrates a decent understanding of character development, allowing his rough exterior to give way to a nicely crafted criminal who is understandable and believable.  I think that Cole Hauser has a decent chance at becoming a great movie star.  I see that potential in him, although I am let down by his consistently mediocre selection of film projects.  Here he is outstanding as the drug-riddled cop Johns and delivers my favorite performance in the film.  Radha Mitchell has turned into the best actor of the bunch.  Her performance here as ship captain Carolyn Fry is strong and respectable, but what she's done with her career since is even more commendable.  Her strong performances in `Finding Neverland', `Man on Fire' and most notably Woody Allen's `Melinda and Melinda' have proven her to be a very reliable actress who is moments from `household name' status.<br /><br />In the end I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoy `Pitch Black'.  While I was turned off upon my initial viewing (I was young and na?ve and expecting something different) upon subsequent viewings `Pitch Black' surpasses what one could hope for and becomes a above average sci-fi film that is effectively horrifying and memorably satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>I have to start by saying that I saw the Chronicles of Riddick before I saw Pitch Black, so I already knew the character of the anti-hero protagonist in both stories. That said, I'm happy I did, because Pitch Black comes off as your everyday space horror that attempted to steal some of the success that the Alien movies had. The stand out in this movie is the main character, Riddick, and how true the writers kept that character through-out the story. You had your expectations for Riddick, and he goes just a little beyond them while never actually disappointing or become predictable.<br /><br />The story begins like most sci-fi movies, that being a view of the galaxy to let us know that this is a sci-fi movie. Soon after, though, the ship that all the characters are traveling in hits a small asteroid belt that tears the hull apart, and they are forced to crash land on a planet with three suns and a never-ending desert. Oh, and with strange creatures that hate the light, but these come later, after we understand what's going on with Riddick and the crew of unfortunate survivors that become his prey.<br /><br />When finally they do come, though, a sort of understanding comes between the other characters and Riddick, and they realize that they must get off the planet soon. Thus starts the heart-pounding run across the desert landscape to an abandoned ship. All the while, character infighting threatens to separate them, and does in some cases. By the end it becomes both a fight for survival and a fight to retain one's morals. The ending is obvious, somebody has to escape, but it's who ends up escaping that is the surprise.<br /><br />Another thing that separates this movie from other sci-fi movies is that it doesn't even try to present a strange, alien world. In fact, you barely ever see the aliens that are in this story, and they are actually presented more as beasts than intelligent creatures. There are no made-up races of strange looking creatures (like Star Wars) or the never ending stream of humanoid, bipedal aliens (like Star Trek) that gets monotonous. This movie presents its own ideas on sci-fi, and does so successfully.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie, and its sequel, to anyone tired of Star Wars or Star Trek (I was never a really big fan myself). Its new ideas are refreshing. I'd also recommend this movie to horror fans who liked Aliens, as it has some similar moments. But most of all, I'd recommend this movie to writers or young screenwriters, as it has one of the best, well-written characters ever created in Riddick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>Ok, so Twohy has made a sort of Alien/Aliens ripoff, but cast that out of your mind as you start watching this movie and your experience will be alot better.  The whole visual style is excellent until we get to the "pitch black" section of the film, than it starts to look a little more like the same old sci-fi/horror stuff.  I belive in one sense the movie is just to show off how cool the character, Riddick, can be played by Vin Diesel, but on the other hand it is a good sci-fi movie on its own.  One thing that's a little unfortunate is the fact that we are left with so little characters in such a short time (Resident Evil, AvP).  We dont' really get to know anyone except the 4 or 5 main characters, too bad.  Although yes, it can be somewhat derivative and plot stealing in a sense, it must be watched in conjunction with the short, Dark Fury, and Chronicles.  I do recommend it to any sci-fi/horror or Vin Diesel fans, you won't be let down, I think.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>A great movie featuriing good acting, directing, and use of lighting to tell a story of creepy inhabitants of another planet.<p>Highly recommended.</p></br></body></html>

Bruce Willis is AWESOME as usual.  Great supporting actors...the children were so talented.  I gave it four stars instead of five only because it left me feeling disturbed, as it most likely would leave anyone...and I had trouble sleeping afterward.  Well worth the watching and the emotional distress it may leave you feeling once you turn off the lights and go to bed.  Two thumbs up!!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>For an action film, Hostage sports surprisingly good performances. The cast features Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction),<br /><br />Kevin Pollak (The Whole Ten Yards), Jonathan Tucker (The Virgin Suicides), Ben Foster (The Punisher), and Willis's daughter<br /><br />Rumer Willis. The surprising thing is the best performance in the movie is by Foster who plays psyopath killer Mars. Anyway,<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays Jeff Talley, a former hostage negotiator who after a traumatizing accident (presented in the opening scene) moves to a small city and becomes chief of police. Then a crooked executive Walter Smith (Pollak) and his children are taken hostage in their fortress like house by Dennis (Tucker),<br /><br />his brother Kevin, and Mars (Foster), three psychopathic boys<br /><br />(Well, Mars & Dennis are, Kevin is just along for the ride).<br /><br />Talley chooses to pass up negoiating it, but then his wife and daughter (Rumer Willis, who plays his daughter, is surprisingly good for the few moments she's onscreen) are kidnapped by men who need a disc hidden in the DVD case of Heaven Can Wait.<br /><br />The film (like my title says) is very exciting, it never lets up, and it doesn't use cliches like most action films do today.<br /><br />There was one thing that was pointless (two Heaven Can Wait movies which didn't lead to anything), but you won't be dissapointed. A.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Hostage is a typical big budget action movie. It's enjoyable for an hour and a half.

"Hostage" takes an age-old, stale concept...the hostage thriller...and tweaks it enough to make the most jaded viewer sit up and take notice 45 minutes into the film.<br /><br />First of all, the director, Florent Siri, flaunts his creative vision at every turn, telling the story simply, yet inserting sly edits or artful compositions that you only notice when you get a chance to breathe.<br /><br />The performances were all fine (except Willis' estranged wife...she struck me as a little amateurish) with Ben Foster doing a particularly menacing turn. In fact, it bordered on the "disturbing"...seeing evil right there on the surface. He did it well. Really well.<br /><br />The screenplay has enough "randomness" to keep your attention, and honestly it has no more plot contrivances than any other movie of this genre. The good thing is that you are too involved to care, which shows you the movie is doing it's job.<br /><br />Even the opening credits were kinda neat.<br /><br />One little caveat, which will make sense to those who have seen the film. Maybe I missed it, but the identity of an important bad guy is never revealed. It feels like it that should be important, and there are lines that suggest that we are leading up to a big "a-HA!" moment. Oh well.<br /><br />If you need a Friday night, put-the-popcorn-on and put-the-feet-up entertainment, you will likely be very happy you put "Hostage" in your DVD player.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>HOSTAGE, based on the best-selling novel by Robert Crais and adapted for the screen by Doug Richardson, has all the right ingredients for an action thriller: good plot, good character motivation, the requisite battle between good and evil, the transformation of a past bad deed into a current good turn, pyrotechniques, good sets, good actors.  What more could you ask for a movie in this genre? Editing!<br /><br />Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis looking far better sans hair than in the overly hirsute opening scenes) is a hostage negotiator in Los Angeles and after a traumatic event, transfers his family to a little Ventura County town.  The job as Chief of Police of the quiet burg seems boring until the day of the movie when three punk teenagers (Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, Marshall Allman) respond to their testosterone and antisocial tendencies and decide to steal an Escalade SUV from rich man  Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak) and his children Jennifer (Michelle Horn) and Tommy (Jimmy Bennett) who live in a superstructure, highly guarded mansion that serves as a headquarters for criminal money manipulation (unbeknownst to the perpetrators).  What begins as a 'simple robbery' escalates into a heinous situation that even Talley feels he cannot handle.  The teen trio holds the family hostage, requesting a helicopter to aid their escape.  Memories and flashbacks to Talley's Los Angeles fiasco drive him to superhero deeds in the messy situation and through a series of truly interesting twists this cat and mouse game of death comes to an interesting end.<br /><br />Yes, there are subplots galore, deaths, fire, explosions, death-defying actions, and unexpected turns of events - all of which propel the breakneck speed of this film under the direction of Florent Emilio Siri.  But clocking in at 113 minutes feels like 90 minutes could have accomplished the same results with more intensity.  Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis and few can carry off these flicks as well.  The supporting cast is fine with a special nod to Ben Foster who seems made to play the creepy teenaged protocriminal.  One wonders why the producers elected to select brilliant composer Alexandre Desplat ('Birth', 'Girl with the Pearl Earring', 'The Upside of Anger', etc) to create a score that is 1) buried by all of the onscreen noise and 2) gratefully so!  In all the film, with a lot of editing, could rank up there with the best of them in this genre.  As it is, it is pretty solid 'entertainment.'  Grady Harp, July 05</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>When compared to most action flicks of the last two years (such as the piece of crap SWAT movie) Hostage is above most of them. When compared to action/thrillers as a whole, Hostage is your average Bruce Willis action/thriller flick that is fun throughout, but nothing too memorable. I left the theater feeling satisfied, but I wasn't jumping for joy because I just saw the best action/thriller of my life exactly.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays hostage negotiator Jeff Talley who after witnessing a gruesome death of a child in a hostage situation gone bad, moves with his family out of Los Angeles to a smaller Californian town to work as chief of police. But he is soon dragged back into the hostage game when a car-jacking gets out of hand when 3 teenagers break into a mansion to try and steal an Escalade. The plot thickens later as we find out that the three teenagers have barracaded themselves in with something much more above themselves that a well funded group of organized criminals will do absolutely anything to get back. I don't want to say too much but that is basically the premise behind Hostage.<br /><br />Like I said before, Hostage is a decent flick with an interestingly enough premise behind it to make it watchable. There's also a few tense moments in it to make an okay thriller. Also, the characters were played finely and with depth. It was just that it wasn't a breath of fresh air or anything in this genre and it was a bit predictable.. I recommend that you wait for video, but if you're a fan of films like The Negotiator or Panic Room, you might want to check this one out sooner. It's a tough call.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Hostage" is an action thrill ride! Bruce Willis is back in top as Jeff Talley. This is just as good as "Die Hard".</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>This is not the strongest of the Robert Crais books. Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are of course the two best known creations, the happy go lucky detective and his sullen, Vietnam traumatized partner. Crais has had some trouble breaking out of that mold (although 'Demolition Angel' was quite enjoyable). Hostage has the old premise, the gunfighter who loses his edge, the surgeon who loses a child on the operating table, the race car driver  . . . . Well. You get the picture.<br /><br />So Talley loses one in LA and ends up in some Godforsaken place. Where, of course, he faces another hostage crisis (actually two.)<br /><br />You know somebody wrote that from the credits they knew this motion picture was going to be junk. Amen, brother. Me too. I knew from the credits I was being held hostage. What a load of junk, over acting, over grinning, over leering, over the top. Far over.<br /><br />Sorry. 2 stars because I like Willis and I'm a big fan of Crais but, Robert, when you sell your book you have to make a deal where you maintain some creative control. Otherwise, they make your book look stupid and YOU lose fans. They did the same thing to John Katzenbach's "Hart's War." Hey. Wait a second. That was Bruce Willis, too. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>In Hostage, Bruce Willis plays Jeff Talley, a former Los Angeles hostage negotiator who moves to the 'burbs after messing up on the job and letting a husband kill his wife and son. Talley is now the Chief of Police in a quieter, calmer neighborhood, and his main concern is saving his marriage and keeping his teenage daughter in line. That is, until a group of teens break into the home of a rich family and take the father and children hostage after a failed attempt to steal the family's Cadillac Escalade. Little do they know, the father is actually a crooked money launderer with bad guys on his tail. Unsure what to do, one of the kids shoots a cop, locks down the house, and Talley has to come to the rescue.<br /><br />I'm a person who likes bad movies. I actually kind of revel in the trash that's out there. And that being said, I liked this movie. It was entertaining and action-packed. I stayed interested the entire way through, and actually wondered what would happen next. That being said, it's not great cinema. It's not fantastic. It's reminiscent of one of my favorite trashy movies, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322933X">Fear</a> with Marky Mark and Reese Witherspoon. If you like that movie, you can enjoy this one. Bruce Willis is his typical, surly cop self, and the supporting cast is aight. If you're in the mood for entertainment, pick this one up. If you want fantastic hostage drama...I don't really know what to tell you. Maybe try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790739739">The Negotiator</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Before directing Hostage, director Florent Siri was the maestro behind a few of the best selling Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell video games.  It can be easy to see that when watching the ultra glossy, over the top action that is found throughout Hostage, which finds Bruce Willis as a burned out hostage negotiator whose family has been taken hostage, and whose lives depend on that of another family taken hostage as well by a trio of young, would be thieves (Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, and Marshall Allman).  However, things don't go as well as one would hope, and soon enough good 'ol Bruce has to take matters into his own hands.  Willis is pretty good in a role that fits him like a glove, while the glossy action sequences end up being surprisingly tense and bloody to boot.  However, Hostage ends up being way more over the top than it should be thanks to the schizoid screenplay, and the performances from Tucker, Marshall, and Foster in particular who apparently would have been better off in the looney bin.  All in all, Hostage is worth a look for Willis fans or mainstream action junkies, but you can do far, far better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>This is the best acting I have ever seen Bruce Willis do. "Sixth Sense" is a distant second. The film stirs up the real unpredictable nature of people. The premise is a good one. Bruce Willis as a cop has to rescue a family held captive in their own house, but thats not all. His gung ho motivation is that if he retrieves a disc hidden in a dvd case that pertains to a corrupt group, he saves his own kidnapped family. He plays the anxious, must do savior unusually well. The threesome teenagers holding the family in the house(one reluctant)do a decent job of playing some confused, ruthless oddballs. Their is some strong violence and an undercurrent of shear nerve racking bombardment. The empathy drawn out by Willis for his family is impressivly done. The ending could have used a little more work, but it plays. The dvd clarity is excellent and the sound is great. Not a bad watch, but post viewing may require sedation.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>As the title suggests, 'Hostage' has two things -- hostage situation and Bruce Willis.  For most of film fans, that conbination means 'Die Hard' but as it turned out, his new film is not as good as that classic actioner.  Still, for all its too implausible story, 'Hostage' is full of (often violent) actions and suspence, hugely supported by a large amount of bullets flying over Willis's head.<br /><br />The film opens with a familiar pattern -- a failed police negotiator Bruce Willis moves into a small town with his family, where he becomes a cop.  Now, three young thieves sneak into a rich family's house to steal a car, but their plans go awfully bad when they are instead trapped in the house fortified with surveillance cameras, where they find many 'Benjamins' concealed in a safe.<br /><br />Things don't stop there, for another family (and that is Bruce Willis's character's for that matter) is also kidnapped, and he has to deal alone with the TWO cases at the same time, without letting the authority know the truths.  This superhuman task needs a help which comes from the inside of the house (of the first case), in the shape of a wise little boy, who escaped from the crinimals, and maintains the contact from the outside by a cellphone.<br /><br />Familiar?  Sure, it is familiar -- hostages, radio contact, etc. -- but all the elements that were seen in 'Die Hard' are used in a different way, to give more pumped-up effects.  The script of Doug Richardson ('Die Hard 2') provides enough actions to grab our attention, directed by French director Florent Emilio Siri, who clearly has good skills of composing reasonably exciting action sequences with good pace and editing.<br /><br />But the fact still remains that the story is too far-fetched, and at least they should have re-considered the casting of Rumer Willis (Bruce's real-life daughter) as, you know, kidnapped daughter of Willis's cop.  Quite frankly, she is doing the same thing as Sofia Coppola did to her father's 'Godfather III.'  The key roles should be given to actors strictly according to the acting ability.<br /><br />In spite of its unbelievable story and the obvious lack of good supports (Kevin Pollack remains unconscious through the considerable part of the film), 'Hostage' is still a reasonable action film made with taut, slick direction from Siri (whose 'The Nest' made in his native country is a real surprise), but it does not change the course of the fading star status of recent Bruce Willis.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>When three teens, on a whim, decide to break and enter the home of a rich accountant (Kevin Pollak) and his two kids, they get more than they bargained for.  For this accountant has some very desperate clients, who don't mind sacrificing the hostages in order to get something they want that's inside the house.<br /><br />Stuck in the middle is Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis), a suburban police chief (and, coincidently enough, a former police negotiator), whose own family has been taken hostage by the accountant's mysterious client.  With the help of the accountant's son (a credible, if a bit over-the-top, performance by young Jimmy Bennett), Talley must work to satisfy TWO parties of murderers...before time runs out.  Because (of course) there is a clock ticking away...<br /><br />Fortunately, this film will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Willis gives one of his best performances in years (I'd almost given up on him), Pollak is enjoyable to watch as always, and the other performances are at least tolerable.  But of course, the thing that draws attention to a film like this is the tension...and there's a lot of it.  "Hostage" is one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in a while.  It races along, and takes you with it.  There are a few minor flaws: the style of the opening credits, for example, has nothing to do with the rest of the film (watch it and you'll understand), and some of the camera work seems iffy.  Yet (note the five stars) this is a darn good action/suspense flick, and you'll probably want to watch it the next time you need a two-hour adrenaline rush.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis stars in this surprisingly good thriller. The plot is very complex and you might be confused at times but, you have to show patience to understand it. The movie starts with my man Bruce with a nice hair due while he is a negotiator. But when things go awry and the hostages get killed, one a child, Bruce Willis's character named Jeff Talley quits the force and becomes hief of police in a very small town. This is a change from big Los Angeles. He's married, and has a daughter there. But, just when he thinks that things are going to be very calm, it ends up being very hectic. When three young punks break into a large mansion and when one of them kills a cop and shoots at other cops, there's a situation. Inside the giant mansion, there's one man with two children. The mansion alone is neat to observe as it's so big and has so many hidden places. It's absolutely gorgeous and that alone is amazing. But, Jeff Talley is the guy in charge and he negotiates with the 3 guys that have broken into the house.<br /><br />But, things get worse for Jeff when mysterious men inform him that they'll execute his wife and child if he doesn't retrieve a disc from the mansion in which unfortunately 3 intruders are already in. Talley is going to have to decide between his family or the other one's. Of course, Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis and you'll just have to wait what's going to happen. The movie packs some thrills and some action scenes in the mansion are awesome. For one, there are lots of molotov cocktails and this movie ends up being an origianl and absolutely amazing experience. Beleive me, I thought that this would be a very average movie but boy was I surprised. The thrills are real thrills and some scenes are just freaky. The last scene is a great finale with some great action. This action/thriller is definitely one that no one should miss out on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>Kevin Pollack (A Few Good Men, House Arrest), his daughter, and young son are taken hostage in their own house (a la The Desperate Hours) apparently by cheap juvenile delinquent burglars.  Bruce Willis is a cop who takes charge of the hostage situation.  But Pollack has something in the house that both the mob and the FBI want, the latter interfering with Willis's control of the situation.  However, the boy, locked in his room, finds a cell phone and becomes Willis's informer from inside the house.  The boy's involvement is reminiscent of Home Alone, even more of Playing Dangerous.  It's a pretty standard hostage suspense situation, but very well done with some surprises.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>1. Audience doesn't care whether Talley's wife and daughter live or die.  The wife doesn't love him much and the annoying daughter is a loser.  Audience likes Walter Martin's kids much better.<br /><br />2.  Three thugs are just too young and not inspiring fear.  Even the silly stupid Mars was ludicrous as a madman.  He just looked like a geek playing a mad man.<br /><br />3.  Willis negotiating for money makes no sense as a ploy, and these black-booted thugs make no sense as to the lengths they'll go.<br /><br />It was not boring, I'll give it that.  There was action.  But I really wasn't inspired to give a damn whether Talley's wife lived or died in the end.  I almost hoped they died and he'd go off on his own and start a Hostage trilogy.<br /><br />Just a ridiculous uninspiring premise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Florent Emilio Siri<br /><br />Cast:  Bruce Willis, Kevin Pollack, Jimmy Bennett, Michelle Horn, Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, Marshall Allman, Serena Scott Thomas.<br /><br />Rated R for strong violence, language, and a brief scene of drug use.<br /><br />Running Time:  109 minutes.<br /><br />Bruce Willis dazzled movie-goers world-wide in "Die Hard" with his incredibly likable pizzazz and charm, parading around as a renegade copper with enough wits and muscle for a "Road House" sequel.  That was circa 1988, when Willis was perhaps Hollywood's most dynamic action hero; however, with Florent Emilio Siri's 2005 release entitled "Hostage", viewers are able to see that Bruce almighty may be out of his league.<br /><br />Willis stars as former Los Angeles hostage negotiator Jeff Talley, who has now moved to become the police chief of the small, quiet town of Bristo Camino Failing to save his last victims, Talley is haunted by his letdown as a negotiator and swears to never get wrapped up in that kind of police work again.  Talley's fears are put to the test when a group of rugged bandits (headed by Jonathan Tucker as Dennis Kelly in a fine performance) take a wealthy family hostage inside of their luxurious home.  What the criminals do not know is that the father, Walter Smith (Kevin Pollack), is a mischievous accountant who has illegitimate information to report to a big-time kingpin.  In order to ensure that he receives his numbers, the kingpin takes Talley's family hostage until the police chief conjures up a way to acquire the important data files from the Smith home.  As Talley attempts to talk his way into saving his own family, he must figure out how to wheel-and-deal with Dennis, his brother (Marshall Allman), and a sociopath named Mars (Ben Foster) and direct the Smith children (Jimmy Bennett and Michelle Horn) to safety.<br /><br />"Hostage" is an admirable attempt as an exciting, emotional action film.  Willis thrives in this "every man" kind of role; however, director Florent Emilio Siri puts little focus on the Talley family and allots too much screen time to Willis's "woe is me" routine.  Willis is only fair as the inner-anguished negotiator-turned-chief and Pollack's role is a waste.  The real winners of the film are the younger actors and actresses, providing some solid support to the aging star.  "Hostage" is stimulating and moderately suspenseful (and moderately predictable), but Willis is not hanging from rafters, shooting the bad guys while running barefoot over glass, or jumping off moving airplanes.  If you're looking for the Willis of old, "Hostage" may be a disappointment; but the film does manage to paint a fairly believable portrait of the horrors that circle around a hostage-and those who are directly involved in suppressing them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis continues his career slump with this mutated, watered down version of "Die Hard", with Willis in the Al Powell role, minus the twinkies.<br /><br />Willis (with a full head of hair and beard) is Jeff Talley a top notch hostage negotaiter who has one very bad day. Fast forward to a year later and Talley (now clean shaven and bald) is the Chief of Police of Anysmalltown, CA, where life for him & his family has slowed to a crawl.<br /><br />Talley's past is about to return to haunt him as three young teenagers follow a wealthy family home and try to steal the family Escalade for a joyride. When the three boys set off the silent alarm, the cops come calling, forcing the boys to hold the family hostage. After Talley lets the higher ups take command, Talley calls it a day and heads for home.<br /><br />Things change tragically when Talley gets held up by a masked man, informing Talley that their is a secret DVD disc inside the rich family's house and that if he doesn't return to the house and get the disc, Talley's family will die along with the rich family.<br /><br />It's up to John MacL - er, Jeff Talley to save his family and the day.<br /><br />"Hostage" is definitely one of those films that should be caught on "HBO" or "STARZ" , & thats only if there isn't anything else on.<br /><br />The problem with "Hostage" is that you can actually see the plotpoints from "Die Hard", right down to one of the teenage boys trying to channel the menace of Hannibal Lecter with "Die Hard"'s uber trash terrorist Hans Gruber(it doesn't work & the kid sucks).<br /><br />The acting is terrible. Willis seems to be in first gear & doesn't really take off, like he did in "Die Hard". Willis' real life daughter plays Talley's daughter in this film & comes across as a whiner (she has a few lines but nothing earthshattering). Kevin Pollock, who is usually funny, looks like he just showed up for his paycheck. The daughter of the rich family is pain in the a.s.s. The film is a bore.<br /><br />"Hostage" opened a couple of weeks ago in theaters & will most likely crash land on DVD near the end of June '05.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>I was really rooting for Willis to make another strong film, being a fam of his. But this one is just too pat, too predictable, to deserve paying theatre prices to see.<br /><br /> Basic plot: Willis is a cop who is living a rather routine life as a police chief, having become emotionally shut off after a botched hostage situation. Now he has a chance to redeem himself by saving one family taken hostage -  while also trying to keep his own family out of danger from other bad guys.<br /><br />  If you watch every action film that comes along, good or bad, you'll probably go to this one. But it isn't even close to the level of Willis's best work. Too bad he didn't get a script worth working with. He tries hard but even the best actor can't rise above a mediocre plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I rarely ever give a movie less than four stars, but this one was filled with so many cliches that I couldn't resist. It started off interesting, but after the first 30 minutes I was ready to leave. I stayed through until the end and sadly nothing happened to improve my impression of the film. Bruce Willis was okay, but they had him in tears at least five times if not more. Hopefully Bruce will resurrect his career (the last piece of trash film he did was "The Whole Ten Yards") with Die Hard 4.0 which will be released in 2006. Trust me on this one and wait three months or so until "Hostage" swiftly goes to DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>Honestly, I really like action movies but this was so slow, so badly plotted and so gruesome I barely made it to the end.<br /><br />The movie begins with the entirely predictable scene where Bruce loses the hostages  and has to cope with his guilt, redeem himself, etc.  Of course its no wonder he loses the hostages with dialog like "Relax!" and "Take it easy!"  Truly fine script writing.<br /><br />This cliche behind us, Bruce launches into an absolutely rediculous hostage within a hostage story where almost nothing happens for an hour and half until he drives his truck through the house gates.  Just when you think he's gonna wrap things up...nothing happens. In a later scene with a helicopter, nothing happens either.  Instead, the focus is on how upset Bruce is, and who goes to an action picture for that?<br /><br />The plot, as far as I can tell has to do with comedian Kevin Pollack trying to steal a DVD from himself.  When this fails, it turns out he has the contents memorized.  None of the plot makes any sense, but it gets worse toward the end when Bruce begs Kevin not to kill his (Bruce's) family, saying "they haven't seen your face" but calling him by name.  Kevin had better hope Bruce's family is deaf!<br /><br />If the above wasn't enough, the movie really focuses in on some ugly deaths. Do you really want to see somebody portayed fairly sympatheticly, only to be thrown over a balcony?  If any of this was real and the characters had to witness these awful closeups, they'd probably be better off dead.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis is a great action actor. His Die Hard series gave us some raucous dialogue, explosions galore, and interesting situations.<br /><br />Not to be outdone, Willis makes a return to the silver screen as a former hostage negotiator for the L.A.P.D named Jeff Talley. I say former because his last negotiation ended with the death of three people, a distraught hostage taker and his wife and young boy.<br /><br />Years later we find Chief Talley living a mundane life just outside bustling L.A. But times still haven't been that good for him. His wife is on the verge of leaving him, his daughter is rebelling, and now a new hostage situation breaks out at a wealthy man's home within Talley's jurisdiction.<br /><br />But, not surprising, there is much more than meets the eye...<br /><br />Three foolish young boys (who were just looking to steal a car) turn hostage takers within the rich man's house and find that the house can turn into a fortress (metal bars blocking entrances, surveillance cameras, etc.). And they find a safe with tons of cash in it. Why would a man keep that much money on hand?<br /><br />Enter the "real" bad guys. They want a CD that's in the house which apparently has damaging information on it related to money laundering for the mob (although this isn't spelled out, it is easily surmised). And these real bad guys kidnap Chief Talley's wife and daughter and tell him he must get that disc out of the house or his family will be killed.<br /><br />But inside the house are the stupid kids turned hostage takers and the rich house owner's two children (a pre-teen boy and a teenage girl). Will Talley have to sacrifice one family to save his own?<br /><br />************************************************************************<br /><br />The film is entertaining if a bit stilted. Initially no one is supposed to approach the house, but Willis' character does with ridiculous regularity.<br /><br />Willis' character, too, has to convince his own officers that he's doing the right thing even when it's painfully obvious he's not, which stretched credibility.<br /><br />The ending was flat-out lost on me, too. There's no way Willis's character would be able to walk away from an incident like that. Either the mob or the law (or probably both) would be all over him. I'm not going to give away the ending here, but let's just say that if I were an L.A. County District Attorney, I'd have a field day with this case.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>Where to begin?  Overall, Hostage is a decent thriller, but did this story really need the kitchen sink tossed in?  Personally, I didn't understand why the questionable FBI didn't just show up sooner and do their thing.  Why did they need for Talley to run around for an hour worth of screen time if they were fully able to get in and look for their beloved DVD?  Plus, what was the urgency?  It was night time, all banks were close.  Wait to see if the stand off would last until the morning.  Jeez.<br /><br />Talley turned over the scene to a negotiator, why not kidnap that negotiators's family to make sure they got their DVD?<br /><br />All in all, I was still entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis is excellent in the film.  The direction is very interesting at times.  Some of the supporting performances are questionable except for Kevin Pollack who is quite good towards the end of the film.  But what really messed up this film was the storyline.  It is so cliche and old hat.  Its like a weak cross between Panic Room and Die Hard.  Don't get me wrong it has some good moments but overall the film leaves much to be desired.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>I am a HUGE Bruce Willis fan and have been since "Moonlighting" so I have seen all of his movies. (My favorite to this day is Die Hard 2). So of course I loved this movie just for the fact that he was in it. What was it about again? (Just Kidding). It was a really good Fast-paced action-thriller.I LOVED it and feel that it is one of his best movies. FYI: His daughter in the movie is his oldest daughter in real life with Demi (Rumer Willis).</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Come now, it's not as bad a film as many reviewers lament! With just a minor clipping of subthreads that lead nowhere, or a somewhat less cacophonic background score, it might even have made for a 4-star action thriller.<br /><br />The plot is awash with twists and tension, but the music hoses us with sounds that swell at all the wrong moments, least necessary of which are those when our supercop steps out of vehicles in slow motion. Such gratuitous effects reek of B-grade.<br /><br />The script falls squarely in not-bad territory. Our adolescent and thus inadvertent hostage takers do well with what they are given, but one of them has to personify half-baked psychopathic undertones while the other two wade in sporadic brotherhood. Characters such as the female superintendent of police, or a baritoned and masked bad guy, come across as little more than stereotypical caricatures. Plus, I would really have liked to feel for Bruce Willis' family.<br /><br />To fan the fire, literally, the last half hour swoons with convenient developments that defy logic at many levels.<br /><br />But all that is probably par for the course with lollipop thrillers so it shouldn't hurt. I had a fairly good time. If you suspend disbelief and watch it without 'Die Hard' expectations, it should make for a pretty gripping suspense flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Hostage", starring Bruce Willis, opens with 3-D graphics depicting various aspects of hostage negotiations in Los Angeles. It appears to be a sort of `best of' depiction and they don't appear to be related. As the credits come to a close, these images bleed into the beginning of the film. The credits sequence resembles an animatronic; a rough draft of a sequence of animated film or television used to give the animators a chance to make changes before the project is completed. This sequence has an interesting look, vaguely reminiscent of the opening credits of "Spiderman", but once the film starts, they seem completely out of place.<br /><br />Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis), a former LAPD hostage negotiator, takes a job as Chief of Police for a small town in Ventura County. He is basically running from the demons of his previous life after failing to stop a hostage situation. He likes the peaceful quality of his new job, but has problems with his wife and daughter. They aren't so happy and there are clearly issues to work out. Arriving at work, one of his officers reports a suspicious truck parked in front of a fancy, gated home. She is soon shot and Talley rushes to the location. He learns that three teenagers have taken the Smith family hostage after a botched carjacking. Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak) is an accountant for the mob and he was scheduled to deliver some account information. They aren't happy about the delay and try to take matters into their own hands.<br /><br />Directed by Florent Siri (someone I am not familiar with) and based on a novel by Robert Crais, "Hostage" starts as a very taut thriller. From the opening prologue, through about thirty minutes of the story, everything is portrayed in a gritty sort of mid-70s "Dirty Harry" type of look. This works, as mentioned, for about 30 or 45 minutes. At that point, the subplots start to kick in.<br /><br />Robert Crais is a fairly well-known writer and I have read a few of his books. He is the type of writer who writes books that read like they are films; a chapter about the main character ends just before the climax of an action and the next chapter picks up the actions of the villain(s) two chapters before. He is writing a movie. Unfortunately, this type of writing is becoming more and more common. Another mark of this type of writing is that a new subplot or twist will be revealed every other chapter. In the hands of a good writer, it seems more natural. If the writer is mediocre, it seems uneven. Crais falls somewhere between.<br /><br />"Hostage" is uneven. The scenes with Willis and Pollak, and their respective families, are interesting, well-written and appear realistic. A couple of Pollak's exchanges with his kids were probably borrowed from real life by the screenwriter. As soon as the sociopathic teenagers and the mob become involved, the story and the film spirals out of control, flip-flopping blindly between realism and over-the-top cartoonish acting.<br /><br />Really, the key problem is the teenagers. Despite a sentence or two of dialogue, we never really learn why they are acting as they are. Each is very over-the-top; they are always screaming, crying, sweating or staring resolutely into space or through another character. These roles would be difficult to pull off by very experienced actors. In the hands of these actors, the characters are downright laughable. One is shooting at people at random one moment and trying to be kind and caring to Smith's daughter the next.<br /><br />Also, typical of a film like this, the climax is overblown and completely unbelievable. Fire, commandos, teenagers with multiple Molotov cocktails and more all make an appearance in the last few moments of the film.<br /><br />The first half of the film would make a really good television movie. Unfortunately, they expect you to pay to see it and sit through the entire thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>"Hostage" puts Bruce Willis back in the action movies after his "Whole Nine Yards" and its sequel. But maybe Willis would have been better off if the movie was never made.<br /><br /> "Hostage" is really an inept piece of work that showed great promise but soon just becomes a barrage of action sequences that seem more implausible by the minute.<br /><br /> Willis plays Jeff Talley a hostage negotiator who lives in L.A. The movie opens with Talley on the job trying to talk a husband out of killing his son and wife, who has been cheating on him. When snipers say they have a clear shot of the man Talley calls them off holding a sign that reads "no one will get killed today" thus setting up Willis' character as a good honest cop who really cares about these people. As the situation goes on Talley loses control and all three are killed. Talley takes this hard especially when the boy dies in his arms.<br /><br /> The movie than fastforwards 12 years later and now Talley is no longer a negotiator but is sheriff of a small county and is having problems with his wife and daughter, played in the movie by Willis' actually daughter. The daughter, Amanda (Rumer Willis) thinks her parents are going to get a divorce. And even though the parents protest, secretly I think they feel the same way.<br /><br /> Right now I suppose the movie sounds entertaining. And it is but that is only because we think the movie is going to focus on Willis and reveal more of these demons in his closet.<br /><br /> Kevin Pollack plays Walter Smith, who wife has died and now takes care of his two children, Tommy (Jimmy Bennett) and Jennifer (Michelle Horn). As they drive home three young boys see Jennifer. One of them then gets the idea to follow the girl to her home and steal their car. Apparently this is what the three boys, played by Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker, and Marshall Allman, do for kicks.<br /><br /> Once the boys break in and hold the family hostage after a series of mishaps occur, for instance, none of the boys thought of the police showing up the movie hits the tone that will be played through-out.<br /><br /> The movie was directed by Florent Siri and written by Doug Richardson. I'm not familiar with either. I will say this though Siri does give the movie some style. Notice the slow motion action scenes. It seems like someone has been watching Sam Peckinpah's movies. But little else is offered to this movie. The writting at times is sloppy. Characters say such ridiculous things with a straight face. Simple lines like "I'm the man" are said with great dramatic impact. Are you kidding me?<br /><br /> But after the first hostage situation the movie has what it feels is a twist. Now Talley is called back on the case after he calls the F.B.I. to take control of the case because his family is now being held hostage unless he can get a DVD of Ernst Lubitsch's "Heaven Can Wait". And it is not wanted as a rental. There is some sort of important information, what I don't know, it is not all very clearly explained, on the DVD that the bad guys just have to get. I suppose though what is on the disc doesn't matter. Hitchcock would play around with this. What the villians wanted in the movie wasn't so important but the actions they took to get the information was. So Talley has to go inside the house and get the DVD or his family will be killed.<br /><br /> Now Talley must face his fears after things went so wrong with the boy 12 years earlier and finds himself in the same situation.<br /><br /> As I watched the movie I thought why did the director and the writer chose "Heaven Can Wait"? It must have been done for a reason. After a while I though maybe the connection between the two movies is this; In "Heaven Can Wait" a man is sent to Hell where he is confronted with his past sins. In "Hostage" Jeff Talley must also confront his past demons. Other than that I can't think of anything else.<br /><br /> "Hostage" for all of its action is really a pretty boring picture. Once the movie started to focus more on the action and less on the characters I found myself tunning out every now and then. The movie started off as a character study of Talley and then just abandons everything for action. Why? They were starting off so well. But what are we going to do. Here is a perfect example of why Hollywood has been losing money lately as attendance is a recent lows. People simply aren't going out to see movies anymore because we don't wnat to see movies like "Hostage". Why should I pay 10 dollars to goes see junk like this when I can rent it for half the price or even wait for it to play on TV? This is why of weeks Hollywood is losing out. They don't realize we are sick of their movies. But go ahead Hollywood keep making these movies and losing money. It merely shows how out of touch you are with the public.  * 1\2 out of *****<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Promising but ultimately inept movie that is a barrage of action sequences and very little human interest.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis' agent:  Bruce, here's the new picture you're going to star in with lots of small time actors who were working as extras five minutes ago and some of them were actually pulled off the roach coach and put in fronnof a camera.<br /><br />Willis:  I don't know.

Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Crais, this 2005 release finds that one hostage drama is not enough, there needs to be two hostage dramas going on at the same time just to make things even more complicated.  Then it decides that the hero should be burdened with guilt over a previous hostage situation that goes wrong.  On the one hand this makes the scenario pretty unbelievable, but on the other hand you get to the point where you are wondering how they are going to get to the requisite happy ending so you will be hard pressed to call "Hostage" predictable.  That being the greatest Hollywood sin, I am willing to forgive this film its faults.<br /><br />The prologue finds Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis), with long hair and a long beard, dealing with a hostage situation in L.A.  His goal is to make sure that nobody dies that die, but that does not happen.  A year later Talley is the chief of police in Bristo Camino in Ventura County.  His wife (Serena Scott Thomas) and daughter (Rumer Willis) are still living in the city and come out to visit on weekends.  The daughter is not speaking to her father, apparently worried her parents are going to get divorced and unable to understand why daddy wants the relative peace and quiet of the sticks.  But like Willis' most famous screen incarnation, John McClane of the "Die Hard" flicks, the rule of irony applies and his biggest nightmare shows up in town.<br /><br />Three young punks are sitting in a stolen pick-up truck ogling a young girl who flips them off before getting back into her daddy's SUV.  They decide to follow the family home and when they discover a beautiful home nestled in the hills outside of town they decide to break in and push the family around.  The thing we know somebody is dead and Talley arrives on the scene to be greeted by a hail of bullets.  The Smith family ends up being held hostage by these three punks and when the County Sheriff shows up Talley is perfectly happy to turn over command and walk away.  However, there is an interested third party to the hostage situation who insists that Talley resume command and do everything in his power, not to make sure that everybody gets out alive, but that a certain computer disc is retrieved.<br /><br />Again, this is a totally unbelievable situation, but it is not boring.  You either buy into the scenario and go along for the ride or you do not.  My only question is whether the red herring I picked up on to no good end whatsoever was intentional or an uncorrupted mistook.  That and why the title credits look like a dry run for "Sin City" and also have no discernable payoff in the film.  The most interesting character in the film ends up being Mars (Ben Foster), the trigger happy one of the punks who had be scared because I kept thinking at some point he would realize that the young girl he was holding hostage (Michelle Horn) was going to be the last female he was going to be near for the rest of his life.  Earlier in the film her father (Kevin Pollak) tried to dissuade her from dressing like a tramp.  Being eyeballed by punks with guns certainly seems to suggest that she might reconsider her clothing choices in the future (especially in terms of any words that might appear on her shirts).<br /><br />Director Florent Siri comes up with some interesting camera shots and even managed to impress me with a slow motion shot (I have been wincing at those pretty much since I saw the end of "Rocky II").  If anything, Siri is fascinating by the cinematic style of violence he can depict and if you are looking for an action film with flair this might fit the bill.  The only one liner Willis' character has in the film is an echo of something just said by one of the bad guys and most of the key moments for his character are inarticulate looks of fear, rage, and despair.  That is why I thought the two hostage situations were motivation enough without needing to resort to the one that went wrong.  The end game of "Hostage" requires a couple of reverses to help things along, but I actually found it quite interesting to suddenly be rooting for a character that I was hoping to see dead and although I did figure out the finale surprise twist it was not telegraphed that far in advance, so I was more pleased with myself than disappointed in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>When compared to the majority of films being released these days, HOSTAGE is about as good as it gets making this type of film...<br /><br />Classic good honest cop thrown into a tough situation while trying to escape the burnout of a prior life is faced with some of society's worst criminals and human scum !<br /><br />Bruce Willis does some of his best dramatic emotional acting in this tense hostage thriller.<br /><br />Soundtrack helps build the moods and tensions.<br /><br />This is not the mindless "cotton candy" formula fluff liberal Hollywood tends to toss out these days.. this is a real story with real world grit.<br /><br />Sure there are some minor elements I may not have been 100% thrilled with regarding the kid's pat of the storyline, but no film can be 100% perfect in every regard for every viewer.<br /><br />Like I said, this is about as good as it gets when making this type of film.<br /><br />It's a shame it got such little attention when other lesser films are better known.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>To be a hostage induces an dreadful experience to those under circumstances where the choice of options have ceased  to exist.  The only choice is to live under the constant observation of another party who controls everything within the area in which they confine the hostage.  In order to prevent a deadly outcome in a stand-off with law enforcement the police have negotiators that communicate, usually over the phone, directly with the person in charge.  The negotiator communicates with the hostage taker in order to gain ground and information in regards to the situation while trying to solve the issue in a peaceful manner.  Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) is negotiator who desires nothing else than to solve hostage situations peacefully, but it has taken it's toll on his life including his relationship with his wife and daughter.  Consequently, Jeff has taken the job as a small town sheriff where he enjoys counting the peaceful days in contrasts to the violence of Los Angeles.<br /><br />Hostage, directed by Florent Emilio Siri, has an interesting display of the opening credits through a vignette portraying the city of Los Angeles in black and gray while the sky is crimson red.  This suggestively induces a notion of darkness and despair that suddenly cuts into a hostage situation where an extremely disturbed man has taken a woman and her son hostage who is also screaming out his demands over a phone.  On the other side of the line rests Jeff on his back under the scorching L.A. sun located on top of a parking garage talking to the hostage taker with the cool calmness of a kindergarten teacher.  During his conversation with the hostage taker the S.W.A.T. team informs him that they are ready to strike, but he holds them back.  However, the situation begins to slip Jeff's grip and it is the violence of these working conditions that makes Jeff seek relocation in a more serene community.<br /><br />The relocation takes its toll on his family.  His daughter thinks they are getting a divorce while she feels the tension between her mom and dad.  Jeff's wife even complains that she does not know what is going on, as Jeff keeps everything bottled up inside and does not share his thoughts or feelings. Yet, the job has its benefits compared to his previous job.  It is a safer and more peaceful job for Jeff, as his biggest problem is speeding and maintaining the dress code among the police officers.  However, somewhere in this low-crime background a dark and more sinister situation is about to boil into a deadly stand-off with the local police force.  Three teenagers decide on trying to steal a luxury SUV from a richer family, but something goes wrong and the three adolescents become hostage takers.<br /><br />Initially, it all seems like an ordinary break-in that went wrong and led the hostage situation to Jeff, but when some other factors come into play he finds himself being a hostage.  His position turns into a race against time and the other police officers in charge at the lavish mountain top home where the hostages reside.  It is crucial that Jeff remain cool and collected while trying to find an answer to his tough situation which calls for extreme measures.  However, he cannot plan for the unexpected elements that might occur in a highly stressful circumstance and how it might affect others in this situation.<br /><br />From the opening credits until the end of the film viewers will most likely sit glued to the edge of their seat.  The story is highly engaging and it throws several different ideas at the audience to make the situation captivating, and it does so with much success.  There are however, some elements in the story that feel awkward and far-fetched, yet somehow Florent Emilio Siri keeps the audience's attention until the very end.  The cinematography touches on the borders of psychosis when it extravagantly spreads its black and crimson shades across the screen, which artistically elevate the level of suspense.  Bruce Willis's performance balances well with Ben Foster's dark persona that brings another intriguing element to the story.  All of the different aspects of the story prepare the audience for a thrilling journey that quickly changes direction with clever side plots and moments of surprise.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>This movie was violent as hell, but with a really interesting storyline.

I feel it totally deserved a number 1 box office opening weekend, it didn't get that, I think it placed number 4, but let me tell you, whether you're a guy or a girl, this is a must see movie.

Even from the first scene when Bruce has to rescue a boy and the child's mom from a crazy man and it doesn't end so pleasantly. Everyone in this film is excellent.

It shows that there are young actors in Hollywood that can act. Willis is gives a great performance, as usual, as the hero of the film. The only downside to this movie is that it does have a couple of slow parts, but not many. Recommended to Bruce Willis fans for sure</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Hostage represents Bruce Willis' latest attempt to produce a thriller with the kind of broad appeal exhibited by his most successful big-screen endeavor, Die Hard. The largest potential drawback to enjoying this movie is getting past some of the plot's implausibilities. For those who manage to achieve this, Hostage offers two entertaining hours. Or, to put it another way: accept Hostage for what it is, and a flawed-but-enjoyable ride awaits. I never once glanced at my watch.<br /><br />Willis plays top LAPD hostage negotiator Jeff Talley, who removes himself from the big city after two victims (including a child) are killed on his watch. A year later, he is the chief of police in Bristo Camino, a small Ventura County hamlet. Nothing much happens there, which suits Jeff fine. His biggest worry is dealing with the unhappiness of his wife, Jane (Serena Scott Thomas), and daughter, Amanda (Rumer Willis, Bruce's real-life daughter with Demi Moore). They dislike Jeff's new lifestyle so much that they only live with him part-time, and "part-time" is even too often for Amanda. Then, when a suspicious vehicle is spotted outside the gated house of an accountant (Kevin Pollack), everything changes.<br /><br />Inside the house, the accountant is lying motionless on his living room floor while his daughter, Jennifer (Michelle Horn), and son, Tommy (Jimmy Bennett), are being held hostage by three interlopers: Dennis (Jonathan Tucker), Mars (Ben Foster), and Kevin (Marshall Allman). An investigating police officer is shot and killed - an event that brings the entire Bristo Camino police force on the scene, plus a lot of help from the outside. After handling the initial contact with the hostage-takers, Jeff willingly turns over reigns of authority - until he discovers that there are darker goings-on than the crisis at hand.<br /><br />The secondary plot-thread bogs down Hostage a little. While this aspect of the film amps up the tension, it does so at the expense of credibility and drama. Hostage tries to give us access to the interaction between the three inexperienced criminals (none of whom trust one another) and their victims, but it is shortchanged. Also, the final showdown is a little disappointing in its ordinariness. But there are some nice elements. For example, Tommy is played as an ingenious boy (not the stock dullard of movies like this) who provides a stream of useful information to Jeff via cell phone calls. And a dog gets whacked, which almost never happens in major motion pictures.<br /><br />Although understandable, comparisons to Die Hard are misplaced. Hostage is a different kind of movie, and Jeff is nothing like John McClane. This character isn't a wisecracking fly in the ointment, he's a tortured individual looking for redemption. Jeff is an interesting enough individual that a drama could have been constructed around his life if the thriller elements hadn't intervened.<br /><br />Director Florent Siri has burst upon the North American scene with a flourish. His sense of scope is impressive - he is fond of tracking and aerial shots. There's one scene in which the perspective changes from one car to another at an intersection, then switches to a third car as the second one passes it on the road. This is done seamlessly, giving us a sense that the lives of the characters are intersecting before the main action begins.<br /><br />Hostage works in much the same way that Assault on Precinct 13 succeeds. Once the viewer has become immersed in the film's world, it no longer matters that real-world conventions are being flouted. Hostage has suspense and momentum, it takes some chances (the murder of a child during the prologue indicates that the film isn't squeamish), and, in Mars, it has a creepy villain (who appears to be designed, at least to a degree, using the mindset of the Columbine killers). The climax, while conclusive, offers little in the way of a true catharsis, but that's in keeping with the overall downbeat tone. Hostage works on its own terms, and, if you're willing to accept them, you'll enjoy spending these two hours with Bruce Willis.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>must hostage/action movies die with in the hour but this one gets more thrilling in the hour. with twisted plots and good acting by bruce willis i must say this movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! this is a great flick</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>So I never even heard about this movie nor heard about it making an impression at the theatres.

Looks for the criss cross of three car moments and the villain and Willis saying the same thing.  Strange connections.  I won't say more or I'll give a spoiler.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis is Jeff Talley, a former LA cop who specialized in hostage negotiation.  As the film opens Talley refuses to set the sharpshooter take out a man who is holding his own family hostage.  Talley tries to talk him out but the man kills his wife and young son and then kills himself.  So immediately the viewer is manipulated into felling sorry for Talley.  A year later, the stress has evidently got to him and he has moved his own family to the small California town oif Bristo Camino, to become the town Sheriff.<br /><br />Trying to escape the big city problems, Talley soon finds heimself caught up in a a dual hostage situation, including his own wife and daughter.  When three local hoods follow a SUV back to a lavish home in the hills, the trio break into the home to steal the car.  The home is owned Walter Smith (Kevin Pollack) who seems to be a bit of a shady business man.  Smith is home with his teenage daughter Jennifer, and young son Tommy.<br /><br />Now Smith has the most elaborate security system complete with alarms, surveillance cameras, front gate...the whole nine yards and yet the three hoods, brothers Dennis and Kevin Kelly and their sinister partner Mars, just hop the fence and get into the house.  I had a little problem with their so easily bypassying the security systems.  little Tommy manages to trip a silent alarm and soon a local female cop resonds to the alarm and is shot by Mars.  This of course brings out all the local cops and nearby county sheriffs to help.<br /><br />Now comes the sub-plot.  Seems Smith has a DVD that some very nasty men want to get their hands on.  They kidnap Talley's wife and daughter and order him to take charge of the situation and get them the DVD or his family will be killed.  Talley now has to contend with not only these organized pros, but the jumpy young hoodlums in the house.<br /><br />Willis is his usual enjoyable self.  He doesn't play quite the super-heroic type he did in the Die Hard films.  The best performance, hands down goes to Ben Foster who played the menacing, violent, and self-destructive Mars, who had an almost child-like fascination with death.  Jimmy Bennett as Tommy is yet another young kid who seems to have a touch of kevin McCallister in him as he continually manages to outsmart the bad guys by using a series of air ducts and secret ceiling doors to move about the house and even make phone calls out to the police.  He's probably just a little too smart.<br /><br />In the end, not enough is explained about the mysterious men who are after the DVD and what exactly is on it.  I was waiting for a payoff that never really materialized.  Still there was enough good stuff in the movie to make it worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Hostage (Florent Siri, 2005)<br /><br />If you take Hostage as nothing more than a turn-your-brain-off thriller, you're probably going to halfway enjoy it, despite some problems with the resolution. It's decently-paced, well-acted, and fun.<br /><br />Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) was the chief hostage negotiator for the LAPD before a hostage situation went horribly wrong under his command. He got out of the big-city life and took a job as the chief of police in a quiet town far away from the hustle and bustle. When a trio of ne'er-do-wells attempt to stael an SUV and end up barricaded inside the owner's house, Talley immediately calls in his old colleagues. The problem is, the family's father is involved in some shady dealings, and his pals tell Talley in no uncertain terms that he needs to take over and get their aims met before anything else happens.<br /><br />There's no big plot twists, no big subtexts, just straightforward action-adventure. All well and good, or would be if Siri hadn't decided to get a little arty on us at the end; we're left with one huge question (the defense of which would be, I'm sure, "the answer doesn't matter") that keeps nagging after the last reel has long been played. Well, perhaps not too long; Hostage is an empty-calories movie, and you're going to forget you were nagged by it after a few days.<br /><br />Fun enough. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Hostage starts out great but what's even better is that it ended the same way. I think the film is getting rated bad because people who love Die Hard see Bruce Willis in this and start comparing the films. I know this from hearing people in the theatre actually saying the movie is ok but it's no Die Hard. The film to me is perfect from the story to the action, there's not too much action but it's just right. Even better there was the birth and death of a unsuspected and excellent villain in Ben Foster.<br /><br />It starts out with the usual, a hostage negotiator (Bruce Willis) fail to save the life of innocent people and then he retires but not totally because he moves on to lead a small town police department. Next you are introduced to your nut cases Ben Foster (Mars) and Jonathan Tucker (Dennis) and his brother. Both Mars are and Dennis mad at the world because they have no money and feel like outcasts. So they play the outlaw roles and steal some stuff but what Dennis doesn't know is his little friend Mars whom he just met not even 3 weeks ago is a blood-craving psycho that goes way beyond just being a thief.<br /><br />The two gain interest in a girl who has a rich father and decide to follow her family to their house but they didn't know her father is in business with some crazy guys that want something in the house the girl's father owes them. The film gets crazy because there isn't just one problem there's a bunch of them. Ben Foster was great because he develops his character into an amazing villain and it seemed like he couldn't be stopped. Willis goes to war to get what he wants and loves and fights to the very end. I thought it was a great movie not only to blow off some time but it's something you don't want to miss for the wild plot twists. Also this is a very violent movie so if you have a slightly weak stomach it may start to get to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>Nothing really original here... Bruce Willis plays a hostage<br /><br />negotiator that fails to save a young boy and his mother, and<br /><br />decides to move out to a safe little town and become a small<br /><br />town sheriff. What happens? You guessed it... He runs into the<br /><br />same type of things that he ran away from in the big city.<br /><br />The film takes you think a ride of action and over the top<br /><br />drama... It does enough to keep you interested despite the<br /><br />fact that it is not really believable. It's pretty well<br /><br />acted considering what it is... The action is good of course,<br /><br />and some of the chacters are interesting such as the deranged Mars....<br /><br />The problem is that some things just doesn't make sense.. Like<br /><br />how the 3 teens so easily get by the high teck alarm system?<br /><br />Also, I think we should have seen more from the family.. It's<br /><br />hard to feel anything for the some of the chacters when they<br /><br />aren't together long enough. These things could have been<br /><br />fixed... But it's like they wanted to cut right to the action<br /><br />and drama.<br /><br />As a B movie it gets 4 stars... Other than that, it is only<br /><br />worth 3. Take it for what it is... A good b movie with holes<br /><br />in the plot.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis is a former hostage negotiator from L.A. turned small town sheriff who finds himself dealing with a hostage situation in his new job.

This movie kept me glued, from beginning to end.<br /><br />Lots of twists and turns, and action packed! I heard this movie<br /><br />was good, and for a change they're right!</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>As with all of my reviews, I must say that I was not particularly fond of how often the "F" word was used in this film.  I think movie-makers get carried away with using profanity to make it all seem a bit more real.  But besides that one complaint, I think this movie is a thrill-a-minute ride that most people will enjoy. HOSTAGE delivers suspense, shock, and surprises throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is excellent as the former hostage negotiator turned small town police chief.  His character ends up being drawn back into the role of negotiator, and Willis delivers the dialogue, the action, and the drama like only he can.  This is now my favorite Bruce Willis movie.  I think the originality of the script, combined with an awesome cast of actors and actresses made Willis shine more than in his past work.<br /><br />Kevin Pollak plays Walter Smith, a book-cooker with a high-tech DVD collection that adds a bit more saga to Bruce's unusually "bad" day.  Pollak's banter with his son and daughter sounded like the scriptwriter has been taping conversations in my living room!<br /><br />Jimmy Bennett (III) is Tommy Smith, a kid with some brain power...so much so that when he is asked by Willis to retrieve the "Heaven Can Wait" DVD, he thinks to look and see if there is more than one version of the film!  Now that's a smart kid.  Most adults don't even know there are two "Heaven Can Wait" movies.  Seriously though, this Jimmy Bennett kid, he's good.  I was actually yelling for him to crawl faster when the evil Mars was after him.  I think this kid has a bright future in Hollywood.<br /><br />This is without a doubt Michelle Horn's best work to date!  She gave Bruce a run for his money in this movie, nearly stealing the show.  I cannot say enough about her performance as Jennifer Smith; she had the drama, the tension, the fear, the...oh just insert every emotion one can display here ___________!  I said I think Jimmy Bennett has a bright future.  Well I KNOW Michelle Horn has bright past, present, and future.  This film should make her a superstar as far as I'm concerned.  If she pulled this off with such perfection, I don't think there is a role she couldn't pull off.<br /><br />Ben Foster plays the weird and completely insane Mars Krupcheck, a character that gave me the creeps!  Mars is evil through and through, and I think one of the things that makes HOSTAGE such a good movie is that Mars so personifies evil, while Tommy and Jennifer Smith represent innocence and purity - the clash of the two opposites creating such a clear view of evil and good that we tend to forget exist.<br /><br />Jonathan Tucker is a little weak in his performance as Mars's accomplice, Dennis Kelly.  It may have just been the script, not sure. Marshall Allman tries his best to make his character, Kevin Kelly, work, but it just wasn't his best performance.  Again, it may have just been the script.<br /><br />All of that about sums up what I thought about the movie and the performances.  This is a movie that provides the viewer with a great plot, a whole lot of action, some suspenseful moments, and a few unexpected twists.  I do not think young kids should watch this movie at all.  No one younger than thirteen should watch HOSTAGE, and I must once again say that I think the amount of profanity was a bit over the top, however, this is a movie about good and evil, so evil shouldn't be watered down too much.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Anyway who's expecting the usual Bruce Willish shoot - 'em - up action flick in "Hostage" is in for a big surprise. It's much more intelligent and original. It's without a doubt his finest presence onscreen since "The Whole Nine Yards".<br /><br />In the opening sequence, hostage negotiator Jeff Taley (Willis) is trying to stop a maniacal father from killing himself and his family. When Taley fails, it leaves a lasting emotional void on him and retires to a small community in California with his family (which includes Willis's real - life daugter Rumer as his daughter Amanda).<br /><br />Meanwhile, a trio of teenage punks decide to hijack a car owned by rich money launderer and family man Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak). The plan goes well until Smith's son trips the silent alarm and the cops arrive. The trio of boys take Pollak's family hostage and nearly kill Smith.<br /><br />Talley is brought back in to handle the situation. While on his way there, he learns that Pollak's character is a money launderer who left a secret code on a dvd. Talley is ordered to go into the Smith household and retrieve the dvd, or his family, who have been kidnapped by the men Smith works for, will be executed.<br /><br />This film is a great piece of cinema, but if you're not a big fan of violence, this film is not for you. It's as violent as all hell. Some of the film's most eyecatching parts include a 9 -year - old bleeding to death from a gunshot wound to the chin, a dog is decapitated by the terrorists who kidnap Talley's family, plus people getting shot, stabbed and lit on fire.<br /><br />Other than that, I think most people will truly enjoy this film. I'm also glad to see Bruce Willis finally being able to make good films after 5 years of flops.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>From Bluray.com: Update: While Lionsgate has not confirmed the full list of features for the Swingers disc (their press release makes a generic claim of "audio commentaries, deleted scenes...[and] featurettes" for the Blu-ray), the studio has announced the supplements for the Hostage Blu-ray, all of which are carryovers from the old Miramax DVD.

And, actually, the fact of the matter is "Hostage" is very similar to at least half a dozen other movies that Bruce made. But nevertheless, it's an excellent movie. I enjoyed it because it was so fast-moving and even though I sort of had a feeling what was going to happen I still felt very shocked and surprised. I don't want to give too much away, but there were some great effects. As always, Bruce was exceptional. After watching this movie, I really think the man must have been a cop in a prior life because he had this role down pat. And the movie is not so much a story of just a hostage situation as it is more of a story of good verses evil. The movie really pushes the envelope while asking the viewers to examine the situation and question the entire realm of what evil truly is. I enjoyed this movie tremendously and cannot recommend it enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Jeff Talley (Willis) was once a top-flight hostage negotiator in LA.  When a critical hostage negotiation fails, Talley takes the police chief position in Ventura, CA which endangers his marriage and puts strain on the relations with his kid.<br /><br />Inevitably, another crisis erupts with stakes just as high and Talley has to make this one work.  For a thriller, the plot was just a tad too predictable for this viewer.  "Hostage" is enjoyable, but a must only if you are a serious Bruce Willis fan.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, October 2008</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Definitely R rated for violence.

He has to save another family to save his own family in the process who are being held captive by corrupt FBI agents. Inside the residence of actor Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects, The Whole Nine and Ten Yards), his son and his daughter are being held hostage by 3 kids, 2 played by Jonathan Tucker (The Deep End) and Ben Foster (Big Trouble, Get Over It). Things happen that alter situations and forces Willis to go head on with both the corrupt agents and the punk kids inside the house. Also starring Kim Coates (Black Hawk Down, ExChange). Some people might like this movie, which in the case I did but some might find the language and the really hardcore scenes to be a little extreme.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>With "Hostage" you know what you're in for from the booming music and opening titles. Burned out hostage negotiator Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) takes a job as the sheriff in a small town to escape the high pressure world of crime enforcement that destroyed his life. What he walks into is exactly what he left behind but on a more personal scale. When a trio of teen thugs stop in his town to eat and are given the finger by a young girl, they find out where she lives and break into her home taking the entire family hostage. Suddenly Talley must deal with the entire situation he walked away from but on a smaller more personal scale. What Talley walks into turns out to much larger than just a hostage situation<br /><br />A fun high octane thriller that captures Willis in top form, the "Hostage" could play like a variation on the "Die Hard" formula (which isn't a surprise given that writer Richardson penned "Die Hard 2").  The direction is sharp and although showy recalls John McTiernan's ("Die Hard", "Predator") best work. Kevin Pollack gives a nice performance as the beleaguered dad and Willis gives a nicely etched low key performance as Talley that does much more than play as a variation on his character from "Die Hard". Although it didn't pick up much of an audience when it was first released, "Hostage" has enough chills and thrills to keep the audience happy.<br /><br /> A very sharp nicely done transfer from Buena Vista, "Hostage" looks particularly good with sharp images, bright colors with a nice golden hue to many of the scenes. There are some minor edge enhancements but, on the whole, "Hostage" looks extremely good here. Both the 2.0 and 5.1<br /><br /> This edition comes with minimal extras but they're nicely done. We get deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary from director Siri. There's also a typical "Behind-the-Scenes" featurette. It's not bad it's just done by the numbers. Some of the comments by the actors are pretty intelligent and articulate but much more could have been done than scenes intercut of talking heads and scenes from the film to illustrate points. WE HAVE SEEN the film. What we need to see is something we haven't before.  This could be done by focusing on real life hostage negotiator or, perhaps, comments from the technical advisors about what they've faced in the real world. Anything that might have occurred in the film that they think might happen in real life.<br /><br /> A fine underrated thriller, "Hostage" was ignored when it was released and that's too bad; Willis gives a nice performance with a touch more humanity than we've seen before and a touch more vulnerability as well. The featurette is largely perfunctory and the commentary, while it has some nice moments, would have benefited from a tag team approach to make it more interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>This one was really good.

There's Alejandro Aja with Haute Tension (or Switchblade Romance/High Tension) who brought back the late 70's early 80's sensibilities of what constitutes a good slasher, exploitation film. Then there's Jean-Francois Richet whose 2005 remake of John Carpenter's early classic, Assault on Precicnt 13 surprised quite abit in the industry. Neither film made too much in terms of box-office, but they did show that a new wave of genre directors may not be coming out of the US but from France of all places. Another name to add to this list is Florent Siri and his first major Hollywood project Hostage shows that he has the style and skills to make it in Hollywood.<br /><br />Hostage is another Bruce Willis vehicle that was adapted by Doug Richardson (wrote the screenplay for Die Hard 2) from Robert Crais' novel. Hostage is a very good thriller with a unique twist to the hostage-theme. Willis' character is a burn-out ex-L.A. SWAT prime hostage negotiator whose last major case quickly ended up in the death of suspect and hostages. We next see him as chief of police of a small, Northern California community where low-crime is the norm. We soon find out that his peace of mind and guilt from his last case may have eased since taking this new job, but his family life has suffered as a consequence. All of the peace and tranquility is quickly shattered as a trio of local teen hoodlums break into the opulent home of one Walter Smith (played by Kevin Pollak). What is originally an attempt to steal of of the Smith's expensive rides turn into a hostage situation as mistakes after mistakes are made by the teens.<br /><br />From this moment on Hostage would've turned into a by-the-numbers hostage thriller, but Richardson's screenplay ratchets things up by forcing Willis' character back into the negotiator's role as shadowy character who remain hooded and faceless throughout the film kidnap his wife and daughter. It would seem that these individuals want something from the Smith's home and would kill Willis' character's family to achieve their goals. The situation does get abit convoluted at times and the final reel of the film ends just abit too nicely after what everyone goes through the first 2/3's of the film.<br /><br />The characters in the film are developed enough to give each individual a specific motivation and enough backstory to explain why they ended up in the situation they've gotten themselves into. Willis' performance in Hostage is actually one of better ones in the last couple years. The weariness he gives off during the film is more due to his character's state of mind rather than Willis phoning in his performance. I would dare say that his role as Chief of Police Jeff Talley is his best in the last 2-3 years. The other performance that stands out has to be Ben Foster as the teen sociopath Mars. His character and Foster's performance straddles the line between being comedic and over-the-top. What we get instead is one creepy individual who almost becomes the boogeyman of the film. In fact, the last twenty minutes of Hostage makes Mars into a slasher-film type character who can't seem to die.<br /><br />The real star of the film has to be Florent Siri's direction and sense of style. From the very first frame all the way to the last, Siri gives Hostage the classic 70's and 80's Italian giallo look and feel. Siri's use of bright primary colors in conjuction with the earthy, desaturated look of the film reminds me of some of the best work of Argento, Bava, Fulci and Lenzi. In particular, Siri's film owes alot of its look to films such as Tenebrae, The Bird with the Crystal Plummage, and The Psychic. Certain scenes, especially the penultimate climax in the Smith home, take on an almost dreamlike quality. Siri's homage to the classic giallis even gives Hostage some sequences that would comfortably fit in a 70's slasher film.<br /><br />Florent Siri's Hostage is not a perfect film and at times its increasing tension without any form of release can be unbearable to some people, but it succeeds well enough as a thriller. It also shows that Siri knows his craft well and instead of mimicking and cloning scenes from the giallis he's fond of, he emulates and adds his own brushstrokes. The film is not for everyone and some people may find the story convoluted if not dull at times, but for me the film works well overall. Siri is one director that people should keep an eye on.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was great.  I wasn't sure what to expect really, it didn't get too many good reviews, but then again, it's Bruce Willis so it has to be good right?  The premise is pretty entertaining in itself, enough so that you know the movie will hold a few nail-biting scenes, and it does especially towards the end as everything starts winding down.  So heres the story.  You have Jeff (Willis) who's an x-hostage negotiator (the opening sequence shows us why he's an X) who is now working as cheif of police in a small CA town.  His wife and daughter visit on weekends and you can see his marriage is on rocky grounds...it almost appears that everyone can see that but him.  Enter our unlucky family, the ones held hostage by a group of teenage boys who wanted their car, but in the process someone gets shot and another gets knocked out and pretty soon the young boys get thrown into panic mode as the take the two children of the house hostage and close themselves into the house using the servalence system.  The only problem (at least for Willis) is that these boys took the wrong mad hostage.  he's an acountant (innocent enough) and he has connections with organized crime (not so innocent) and these crime lords need a disk that this man has encrypted for them.  The catch here is if Jeff doesn't hold the cops off and keep everyone inside the house until these crime lords get into the house to get there disk then Jeff's family will die.  He's got some choices to make.  If he goes inside the house to save the family, his own may die, and if he stays outside the house to protect his own family then the innocent children in the house may die.  It's a catch 22.  Scene stealer Ben Foster does an outstanding job portraying a pshycopath.  He just LOOKED insane, and the whole 'burn it' scene (When you watch you'll know what I mean) is just crazy...the most intence part of the film...All in all it was an impressive film.  Willis held his own, delivering a solid knock out punch of a performance.  I wish he would get more notice for his roles...but alas, I don't know if he ever will...We love you Bruce, keep up the GREAT work!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R.html">A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R</a><br/><p>HEADS UP, SPOILERS AHEAD.....<br /><br />Ok, so five stars for the action. There were a few funy parts during all the chaos. You know how in alot of movies the sick demented people get shot and stabbed and beaten and they still walk around like nothing ever happened as if they have super human powers, hehe. That's how it was with marshall. It was kind of comical when he kept appearing outta nowehere all crazy looking in slow motion. This movie really wasn't bad at all. I didn't expect the band of criminals to be kids, but they pulled it off, considering how sick and demented two of them were, but marshall was like a young ted bundy. There were a few moments that didnt fly too well with me. The only good kid died, the brother of dennis, and to me that was sad, and the beginning was nothing to write home about either. And the violence was so graphic, way more violence now in movies than in the past i've noticed. But overal hostage is a good action film. The acting was pretty good, and you wont get bored. The movie was over before i knew it,</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>In all my years of watching every Bruce Willis film that has been made, there has never been a film of his quite like "Hostage", possibly the first great action thriller of 2005! I saw this in the theater just yesterday, and I was completely blown away by the action, suspense, and the surprising twists and turns from pulse-pounding start to breathtaking finish! The direction of Florent Siri was flawless! Willis' intense performance could not be better! In fact, this is his best since "Die Hard" and "The Sixth Sense"! Joining him are Kevin Pollak (Willis' "The Whole Nine Yards" and "The Whole Ten Yards" co-star), Ben Foster ("Liberty Heights"), Jonathan Tucker ("The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"), and young newcomers Jimmy Bennett, Michelle Horn, and Marshall Allman, in which they all gave excellent supporting performances!<br /><br />The film focuses on LAPD negotiator Jeff Talley (Willis), who became devastated by a failed hostage situation which resulted in the deaths of a young mother and her child. Talley exits Los Angeles for a no-profile job as chief of police in the low-crime hamlet of Bristo Camino, a small town in Ventura County. When three delinquent teenagers named Mars (Foster), Dennis (Tucker), and Kevin (Marshall Allman) follow home a family intending to steal their car, they have inadvertently picked the wrong house on the wrong day. The trio find themselves trapped in a multi-million dollar compound on the outskirts of town, owned by Walter Smith (Pollak), an accountant working for a mysterious crime enterprise. Panicked, the teenagers take the family hostage, placing Talley in exactly the kind of situation he never wanted to face again. Soon after, Talley readily hands authority of the hostage situation to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and leaves the scene. Meanwhile, inside the compound is digital information, which is time-sensitive and invaluable to the mysterious criminals and critical to their enterprise. They will stop at nothing to get what belongs to them. The collateral: Talley's wife and daughter mysteriously taken hostage as well! This really puts Talley in a predicament: How does he save his wife and daughter without losing the lives of the hostages inside the house? Talley is forced to resume the command he abandoned, where the stakes quickly evolve into a hostage situation more volatile and terrifying than anything he could ever imagine.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is amazing! Bruce Willis, without a doubt, brings an electrifying presence into the role of Jeff Talley. Possibly his best role since the John McClane "Die Hard" days! Kevin Pollak was a little bit underused, but was still great nevertheless. Ben Foster brings a sinister, morbid change-of-pace performance to the role of Mars. A very well-done performance by the rising young star. Jonathan Tucker and Marshall Allman, who play brothers Dennis and Kevin Kelly, give powerful, extraordinary performances throughout. 17-year-old Michelle Horn really lives up to her name as Smith's daughter, Jennifer, and young newcomer Jimmy Bennett, who plays Smith's son, Tommy, was simply amazing! In fact, there seems to be a powerful and unforgettable connection between young Jimmy's character and Willis' character (reminded me of Willis and Haley Joel Osment in 1999's "The Sixth Sense").<br /><br />In conclusion, "Hostage", without a doubt, really makes up for the other Willis disappointments that were "Tears of the Sun" and "The Whole Ten Yards". In fact, "Hostage" has everything that a great action-thriller should have, including kinetic wall-to-wall action, crackling suspense that doesn't let up for a second, dynamic performances from a talented cast, and more! To me, this film really warmed me up until Willis' next film, "Sin City", will be released next month! "Hostage" is without a doubt, a DVD must-have to any Bruce Willis collection when released!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Jeff Talley (Willis) is the chief of police in Bristo Counta, a small town in Ventura County, California.  He used to be a hostage negotiator in the LAPD, but after a disasterous negotiation that led to the deaths of two people, he fled the big city.  Now, nothing much happens, and Talley is content.  On the perosnal front, his wife and daughter do not like the new JEff or his lifestyle.<br /><br />When an accountant (Pollack) and his son and daughter are taken hostage after a botched robbery attempt, Talley must get the situation under control until those higher in the chain of command arrive.  Once they do, he heads out, grateful to be out of the situation.  Talley quickly finds out that there is more going on than meets the eye, and is forcefully thrown back into the midst of things with added incentive to resolve the situation.<br /><br />With the kids working against the hostages on the inside, and Talley working against them from the outside, things quickly spiral out of control, and it soon looks like another crisis will befall Talley.<br /><br />I went into "Hostage" knowing very little about it (a rare thing), and was pleasantly surprised.  While there are some leaps of logic that you must accept, once you do, you are in for a wild ride.  Suspenseful and more layered than it might seem at first, "Hostage" is a really entertaining movie.  None of the performances are terribly outstanding, but everyone does a decent job bringing the characters to life.  There is enough action and suspence to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  "Hostage" was an unexpected surprise in the doldrums of the early-year movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis is great in this intense, hardcore action movie about a former L.A. S.W.A.T. and hostage negotiator caught up in a life and death drama, where two families lives' are at stake.<br /><br />After a hostage situation went terribly wrong, Willis left L.A. to become police chief in a safe California town.  But when three teenage deliquents, including one Joker Junior named Mars, take over a wealthy man's home - unbeknownst to them this man being a mob accountant - Willis' family is taken hostage in secret as the mob orders him to recover a CD with all the numbers that could take the mob down.  Whew.<br /><br />Just get this movie, prepare to be glued to your seat and riveted until the final denoument.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Nearly sunk by some extraordinarily bad casting and acting, HOSTAGE maintains enough momentum to sail over its problems, but it's a close shave.  I like Robert Crais' novels, but when they get filmed all the life goes out of them and the coincidences seem to assume huge, blatant outlines, as though highlighted by Sharpies.  Bruce Willis is fine as the hostage specialist who burns out after one excruciating standoff during which a child hostage gets killed.  Of course you know that, years later, and still haunted by his failure, and even though he's moved himself miles and miles from any stressful urban situations, somehow he's going to find himself right back in the thick of another, even worse, hostage crisis.  In this kind of picture, that's part of the formula.  "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"<br /><br />The problem is that all the children in the movie, and the young people in general, are terrible at acting.  I know there are good young actors out there.  I know this in my heart, just as I know that Rumer Willis is not one of them!  Wooden isn't the word.  She's heroic the same way Sofia Coppola was in The Godfather III.  Rumer plays Bruce's rebellious daughter in this one, not a stretch you might think but she looks like she's suffering the tortures of the damned.  And she spends most of the movie in bondage as it happens, gee thanks Dad.  Yet she's Sarah Bernhardt compared to the three punks who take a suburban mansion hostage, and the brother and sister they imprison.  They are all terrible and nearly ruin the show.  Ben Foster, sometimes very good, here sinks his own career with a series of acting "decisions" which belong in the Clunker Hall of Fame.  If he lives another three or four years, he will look back on this, the folly of his youth, with fists rubbing his eyes, as though he can't believe he was the same person.  A twelve step program might help, but is there one for "Ham Anonymous"?<br /><br />Now all the Ben Foster fanboys and girls will come down on me like the plague Hilary Swank fights in THE REAPING, but the truth is the truth and what Ben Foster does here is an insult to the very reels of film that captured his performance in.<br /><br />It was nice to see Serena Scott Thomas as Bruce Willis's wife.  If her casting follows its usual pattern, they must have offered the script to her sister, Kristin Scott Thomas, who then shuddered and rolled it sideways and sent it whooshing down the pneumatic tube to sister Serena.  Yeah thanks Sis.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I like Bruce Willis and that is why I watched this film. The movie is slickly made and tension is high throughout. It's an good popcorn muncher that is entertaining, just don't think about it too long afterwards. It's not the worst action film off the year and it's good enough for a few rounds. The DVD transfer looks very good and there are a lot of extras to check out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>The start of this will shock any potential lovers of Bruce Willis. (Me.) He looks out of shape (deliberate?), long GREY haired, and with a grey beard, just to round things off. The clothing is awful too, all baggy, but it has to be deliberate, as by the end of the movie, he's buff, shaved, and wearing tight t-shirts. Oh, and a topless scene too. Woohoo! Is that a real tattoo?<br /><br />This is a very character driven movie, which I was surprised at, and definitely wasn't expecting. I was thinking that if it didn't have Bruce, it could have turned into a straight-to-DVD movie that you get from the bargain bins. Having Bruce makes it worth watching (and more), and also a script that could have been the next Die Hard script does give it potential.<br /><br />The story goes like this: Bruce is now a small town police guy, who works on the policy of No Crime Tuesdays (or No Crime Week if you would prefer). He's hiding from his past, and is happy living the quiet life, although his wife and daughter aren't. (Look out for Bruce's real life oldest daughter, Rumer, playing his daughter in this. She's her mother's double, but with her father's jawline. Blink, and you WILL miss her, which shows having two of the biggest parents in showbiz does not bring you instant movie roles.)<br /><br />Three guys are across the other side of town, thinking about stealing a car. Two brothers, one good, the other a wannabe gangster, are with the ultimate bad boy, black wearing, scene stealing, Ben Foster.<br /><br />A father, daughter, and son, are in witness protection, in a house straight out of Panic Room, in fact it is one big Panic Room. The dad is a small time criminal, the daughter wants to go out, (wearing more than what I wear when I go out and no one stops me!), her father wants her to change, and the son just wants some peace. The three bad boys break in, intent on stealing the car, but get interrupted by the family, and sidetracked by an open safe full of cash, and it escalates from there.<br /><br />There's another set of bad guys, who are linked to the father, and when they find out Bruce is involved, kidnap his family. A small storyline, but still an important one.<br /><br />As I've already mentioned, Ben Foster steals every scene, and is well worth watching in this. He plays a cold hearted, evil character here, with black clothes, black hair, and very cold eyes. The character is very well developed, but not overly developed. His back story is a mystery to begin with, but piece by piece, you learn a bit more about the character. I said to my dad afterwards, that his whole character, the way he carried himself, especially the final scene, reminded me of The Crow, and particularly the late Brandon Lee. His final scene is something that will stick in my head for a good long time (I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares, without giving too much away). All his evil and emotion are portrayed vividly through his eyes, and he has the potential to be a really, really good actor.<br /><br />The whole hostage situation, and the negotiation tactics are what keeps this film going. Normally some finales leave some loose ends, but this film ties them up magnificentally, although the unidentified masked men (the second group of bad guys) does seem a little too convenient, with their motives going unexplained.<br /><br />I did enjoy this movie, and I can't wait to see more of Ben Foster, and it's well worth picking up for cheap. But I will warn you, you won't be able to forget Ben Foster's final scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>`Hostage' delivers violence and action, but the over-dramatic and contrived plot elements don't make a lot of sense.  There's a major problem when the one involved in the most suspenseful action scenes is a kid, and not Mr. Bruce Willis.<br /><br />Willis is Jeff Talley, a former hostage negotiator, turned chief of police in a small California town.  He finds himself in a familiar situation when a home invasion and attempted robbery is botched, and becomes a homicide and hostage situation.  The involvement of an outside element, leads to Talley's wife and daughter being kidnapped as well, creating a second set of hostages.<br /><br />Things unravel when the home invaders turn on each other. As the high-tech mansion burns, Talley rescues the hostages, setting the stage for a slow-motion shootout with the remaining baddies, and a tearful family reunion.  Another unrealistic comic book finish.<br /><br />`Hostage' is flashy, but the lack of a credible plot and manipulative style may disappoint those that expect more.  French director Forent Siri's commentary for his first American film is rather flat and simplistic, focusing on character motivation with very little technical insight.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>From time to time, it seems quite hard to find original schemes in what hard thrillers concern. This one establishes from the first admirable shot, the somber perspective of a tragic decision that will become in a stigma for Bruce Willis. Your marriage has too many lows and additionally his young daughter crosses over the delicate stage of adolescence.<br /><br />Three losers: Each own with a determined profile, decide to cross the line, but the things begins to blow against them and suddenly a true catastrophic mess will surround them with fatal consequences.<br /><br />The tension levels and the different dramatic clues are extremely well articulated, with wondrous angle shots and memorable traveling, that will conform a dense and easy going thriller that works out with magnificent synchronization. The power conflicts, the personal fears of our urban hero, his fears for his family will be main factors of this kinetic and frenetic story with predictable results but made with admirable resolution.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Hostage is a gritty movie starring Bruce Willis as hostage negotiator Jeff Talley.  The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Crais.  The plot of the movie follows the book pretty closely, except some of the moments that make the book special is lost in the translation and I can't say I blame the movie.  The story follows a short 2-day period when 3 thugs try and steal a car.  They choose the wrong house.  The house they choose is heavily secured, because the man of the house has some unsavory connections.  The hostages are quickly surrounded by cops and find themselves in a horrible situation.  Talley then is faced with his own hostage situation when his wife and daughter are kidnapped.  He has to retrieve a DVD out of the house and deliver it to thugs or they will die.<br /><br />The book really explores the life of Mars, the bad guy in the movie, and the two brothers Dennis and Kevin.  Kevin is the foolish younger brother who blindly follows and worships his older brother despite the trouble they get into.  This is a gritty movie with a lot of tense action and violence.  Willis is good in this film.  I recommend it to action fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) is a top hostage negotiator in Los Angeles.  But when one case ends badly, Jeff retires from the business.  A year later, he's the Sheriff in a small Southern California town where nothing ever happens.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about to change.  When three criminals attempt to steal a car, they wind up taking three hostages instead.  Unfortunately, Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak), one of the hostages, has something to hide as well.  Jeff is ready to turn the case over to someone else when his wife and daughter are kidnapped.  Now he has to keep his family alive without compromising the hostages in the house.  Can he do it?<br /><br />This movie is based on a best selling novel.  While I have never read it, I have enjoyed other books by the author.  I've heard his fans are disappointed with this adaptation, and I can understand why.  It starts well, with an interesting premise that really drew me in.  However, the longer the movie went on, the more preposterous it became.  And the ending was much weaker then I wanted it to be.<br /><br />This movie is rated R.  I caught it on TV, so I know parts were cut out.  In fact, it was laughable when the language was removed.  I don't know if any violence hit the cutting room floor, but there was still plenty of it here.  It did get pretty dark and gruesome near the end.  I was expecting this going in, so it didn't bother me.  I'm just pointing out it was there.<br /><br />The movie started out strong, but the ending lets it down big time.  It's disappointing that an interesting premise lost such momentum.</p></br></body></html>

This film doesn&#8217;t exactly succeed in doing so, but it does offer a few impressive set pieces as compensation. &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; borrows heavily from movies like &#8220;Rebecca&#8221; and &#8220;Psycho,&#8221; adding generous helpings of &#8220;Rear Window&#8221; and &#8220;Wait Until Dark&#8221; to the mix for good measure. .... It does an effective job at the beginning when it is setting up the scenario, injecting just enough ambiguity into the proceedings to make us question whether Claire is truly seeing what she thinks she is seeing or whether she is suffering from delusions brought on by mental instability. Unfortunately, once that issue is decided for us, the film loses some of its intriguing quality and becomes a more standard issue horror film. Moreover, the major plot &#8220;twist&#8221; is one we can pretty much predict five minutes into the film. Given its weaknesses, &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; delivers the goods for those who want nothing more than a relaxing, goosepimply good time at the movies. Director Robert Zemeckis, though he appears to be slumming here a bit, knows how to shoot an effective jump-out-of-your-seat suspense sequence &#8211; although he does tend to rely overmuch on the &#8220;false scare&#8221; technique that seems to be so popular in films of this type. As to the acting, Ford pretty much walks through his part, surely dreaming of better things to come in the role department, but Pfeiffer manages to bring a dignity and depth to a character that could easily have degenerated into the hysterical wife stereotype. &#8220;What Lies Beneath&#8221; is an effective time killer provided you realize beforehand that the answer to the film&#8217;s title is: &#8220;Not much.&#8221;</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I enjoy this movie a lot. It is sit at the edge of your seat movie. I think both Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer did a great job. Michelle looks very beautiful in each scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star in this 2000 Robert<br />Zemeckis thriller.

I recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I had the chance to watch this film back in 2000, when I was thirteen I think. And it's no surprise that I had trouble walking into dark rooms for a few days because of it. What Lies Beneath is one of the scariest films I've ever seen; the jump scenes actually work (there are some you don't even expect in the least). The minimal music also helps with the creepy atmosphere (except for the jump scenes, of course). The plot may be a bit thin, but it didn't matter to me when I was watching it. The ghost in this film was as scary as the ones in all of those Asian horror films. And it's good to see some adults in this sort of horror flick, instead of stupid teenagers who do nothing but whine and scream. Zemeckis, Pheiffer, and Ford have done an extraordinary job with this film. And I hope we get to see more horror films that have a silent atmosphere and have no annoying little kids whatsoever.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Norman and Claire Spencer (Harrison Ford and Michelle Pheiffer) think that getting used to their college-bound daughter's absence will be the worst of their worries. Nope. Strange occurances begin almost immediately, causing Claire to grow increasingly terrified and suspicious. Are simple oddities (a door that opens itself, pictures jumping off tables, etc.) escalating into full-blown supernatural events, or is Claire just losing her mind? The tension builds slowly, while the mystery becomes more intriguing. Is there a ghost about? If so, what does this frightening spectre want? What is it trying to tell Claire? Norman believes that Claire is cracking up, until dark secrets are revealed that leave no doubt as to the mission of the relentless spirit. Ford and Pheiffer are great together, coming off as a married couple w/ lots of history. WHAT LIES BENEATH is suspenseful, eerie, and packed w/ surprises. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"What lies beneath" is a taut thriller about a picture-perfect couple (Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer) Their only child is off to college, and everything seems to be okay. They still make passionate love, all is well with the world. Pfeiffer soon experiences eerie hauntings. She thinks she's going off the deep end. Ford appears to be supportive.<br /><br />"What lies beneath" superbly shows a marriage falling apart. Miranda Otto,who's otherwise famous as Eowyn "I am no man!" stars one of the next door neighbors that Pfeiffer fears for. It's nice to see Otto playing a comic role to balance out the grim subject matter.<br /><br />"What lies beneath" peels away its layers like an onion. Pfeiffer learns of her husband's dalliance with a student, and things turn for the worse. Ford is pitch-perfect as the narcissistic,and ultimately creepy, husband. What lies beneath... are many lies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>What Lies Beneath starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer is a Hitchcock style film. I like this movie, Pfeiffer steals every scene while Ford plays his creepiest role yet. What Lies Beneath is about a husband and wife who are now in the empty nest period of their lives, the daughter has moved onto college and the couple have buried a secret and finally starts resurface. This film is a bit slow especially the first hour but after that the pace and story fall into place. Give this sly and slick ghost film a chance. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Robert Zemeckis<br /><br />Cast:  Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Diana Scarwid, Joe Morton, James Remar, Miranda Otto, Amber Valletta, Katherine Towne, Victoria Bidewell.<br /><br />Running Time:  130 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for terror/violence, sensuality and brief language.<br /><br />"What Lies Beneath" borrows heavily from movies like "Rebecca" and "Psycho", adding generous helpings of "Rear Window" and "Wait Until Dark" to the mix for good measure.  Claire (Pfeiffer) and Norman (Ford) are a well-to-do married couple living on a somewhat palacial lakeside estate in Vermont. Norman's a research scientist and spends much of his time finishing papers and giving lectures while Claire stays at home, dealing with the emotional aftereffects of a recent car crash.  Norman has a stepdaughter, Caitlin, who goes off to college at the beginning of the movie. For the first time in years, Claire is alone in the house, and she notices strange things afoot. She experiences some strange phenomena, including a woman's reflection in her bathwater. The fragile Claire is convinced the disturbances have something to do with the strange couple next door, and urges her husband to look into the matter. He finds nothing, of course, and asks her to see a therapist, thinking that his lovely wife is still unstable, but the therapist recommends contacting whatever might be causing the disturbances, and that's when the fun begins.<br /><br />It's ironic that a movie be entitled "What Lies Beneath" when it is so shallow. This picture is typical Hitchcock suspense with plenty of creaks and jumps and `look behind you' scenes, but there aren't enough full on scare sequences and much of these are just overused clich&eacute;s. Director Robert Zemeckis ("Back to the Future", "Forrest Gump") is clearly having a blast behind the camera and successfully masters yet another genre. He puts a tremendous deal of skill into the proceedings; however, there simply isn't enough material to work with. The film uneasily balances between domestic drama, supernatural chiller and all-out thriller, and the three sub-genres simply don't gel.  As the neurotic housewife, Michelle Pfeiffer is perfectly cast and brings depth to her first good role in a long time and holds her own against the more popular Harrison Ford, who curiously avoids the limelight for most of the movie.  As soon as the emotional hokum gets going, the film loses a good deal of momentum, but the shear suspense of it all is what keeps `What Lies Beneath' going. But with the uneasy mixture, the bogeyman material seems out of place when in tone with the thriller aspect. While it is very slow-paced, Zemeckis and Pfeiffer make a deadly combo and almost overcome the bogging down of sentimentality and a slightly shallow script. Eerie, creepy and surprising, "What Lies Beneath" is flawed, but generally a sophisticated thriller that is still better than most of the modernized, teenie-bopping trash that Hollywood sends out these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>It took me quite a few months after buying this to actually watch it - I seem to be getting worse & worse for needing to watch a film in the right mind frame, or when it's "appropriate". Plus, I've been told this film isn't that great.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised how scared I was watching this film. You'd think after a while you would be desensitised after watching a lot of horror films, but I jumped loads, and after it had finished, insisted on switching on all the lights in the house. And then I was too scared to go to sleep. Never has a film affected me as badly as this did.<br /><br />I'm not much of a fan of Harrison Ford, but loving Michelle Pfeffer. She is such an amazing actress, and I noticed it most in this film. It's all in the eyes with her in this, especially in the bathtub scenes. She manages to portray so much just through her eyes, and it's brilliant. Most actresses would probably fail miserably at this, but she does it well.<br /><br />The film severely drags in the middle however, and for me, this stopped me giving it a higher rating. It starts well, it ends well, it doesn't work so well in the middle. Robert Zemeckis could have easily trimmed this by half an hour, and made it a much better movie. Nothing much happens in the middle, apart from some boring stuff with an Ouija board, and that's about it.<br /><br />It's not up to scratch as some of the other movies that Robert Zemeckis has done, including the fabulous Back To The Future trilogy, Castaway (this was entirely filmed during on the break on the film) and Who Filmed Roger Rabbit being some of his best.<br /><br />If you can, pick up this film for cheap (which you should be able to now), cos you'll regret it. It's one of those films you will watch once, and never watch again, but I've definitely found, it's a film that sticks with you.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Hitchcock comparisons aside, this is one tidy ghost story.<br /><br />Minimal gore and violence, some self-depracating humor, and losts of creepy, eerie moments make this one a winner.  Atmosphere is key here and the stunning lake house they built for this film is gorgeous.  Tranquil, beautiful. peaceful and just the right set-up to concince us it's all paranoia.<br /><br />Pfeiffer is absolutely excellent here and carries the film squarely on her shoulders.  If we don't believe her, the whole film goes out the window.  Her performance ranks among her best and she did deserve an Oscar nod for it.  Her expression change when she is momentarily "possessed" and the sees the house door open reflected in a mirror is alone worth a viewing of this quasi old fashioned chiller.<br /><br />A good fun ride, some nice chills, and Pfeiffer's perfomance make this the winner it is,</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>Hitchcock would have been proud of Robert Zemeckis as the director of this flick. Zemeckis used the little tricks of the suspense trade like a cracking of a door, spontaneous images and a loud noise during a quite scene, etc. to create a phenomenal thriller. The suspense is breathtaking and the whole concept has been perfectly executed.<br /><br />It didn't hurt that superb actors like Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are starring in this movie who play their roles very good without a question.<br /><br />With the use of only a few special effects, the suspenseful atmosphere is communicated throughout the film and it's definitely a movie you want to watch over the years frequently, even though the initial surprise factors from the first viewing may have already disappeared. But Thriller is a cinematic experience and very well done.</p></br><a href="../users/AE42JLYPXUI45.html">AE42JLYPXUI45</a><br/><p>Prepare yourself as this spellbinding, edge-of-your-seat thriller takes you to hell and back.<p>  Michelle Pfeifer plays Claire Spencer, a housewife with the perfect house, the perfect husband, the perfect daughter, and the perfect life.

I wound up having a lot of fun with this big budget, old-fashioned thriller which is designed solely to entertain. I suspect that many of those who were disappointed by it felt that, because it has such a famous and talented director and cast, it should have served some higher purpose. Or it could be that their plot hole threshold is lower than mine, for it is true that a lot of what goes on in the movie isn't all that believable. Still, part of what drives great movie making is, frankly, the ability either to rise above or to gloss over any script deficiencies, and I think the film mainly succeeds in doing this. It has been said that What Lies Beneath became a huge hit just because it came out at time when there was little product out for adult audiences, yet it could not have become such a success if a lot of people hadn't enjoy it.<p>Claire and Norman Spencer seem to be a very happily married couple. He is a successful doctor doing genetic research at a prestigious university in Vermont. She is a musician who seemingly put aside a promising career in order to be the perfect wife and mother. When the couple's only daughter goes off the college, Claire is left alone much of the time in their magnificent lakeside home. Her husband and her friends are worried about her for reasons that become clear later on. It turns out that they have cause to be concerned, for soon she begins to have some frightening hallucinations about a young woman who appears to be dead. When the woman next-door disappears, Claire becomes convinced that she has been murdered and begins to investigate the woman's husband. Norman becomes increasingly concerned and frightened by Claire's behavior. This is only the beginning of a mystery that takes the audience on a wild ride that questions what is real and what isn't. Are the things Claire sees real or things she imagines? Does she really see a ghost or is it a demon inside her trying to reveal a terrible truth? <p>Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford are perfect as Claire and Norman. This role is a welcome departure, as well as a good career move, for Mr. Ford, but it is basically Ms. Pfeiffer's movie. She has never been more beautiful nor vulnerable. In the hands of a lesser actress, Claire might have come off as laughingly neurotic, but Ms. Pfeiffer magically turns her into someone we can both relate to and root for. It's a role that's tougher than it looks, and the star makes the most of it. <p>What Lies Beneath is beautifully visualized. It is full of water imagery, water which at times acts as a force to hide the truth and, at another times, as a mirror to reflect it. This imagery doesn't make the movie any deeper, but it does make it lovely to look at. <p>This picture recalls some of the work of Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock was the master of suspense, and, while What Lies Beneath in no way equals the best of his movies, it shares with them the idea that the ultimate goal of any good thriller is to entertain its audience. And for me, this movie did that. I suspect that some, but not all, of the criticism this movie has received may be based on a bit of intellectual snobbery. It is certainly not a work of art, but the great magic of cinema is that it can produce an infinate variety of movies. There is room in this world for all of them, and I for one like it that way, because a steady diet of any one particular type would soon become stale.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>What Lies Beneath is an old fashion thriller about a house wife<br />  Michelle Pfeiffer who's upset that her only daughter is away at college.<br />  Now bored and lonely she starts snooping on the neighbers with envolves<br />  some Hitchcock ripping off.

If Hitch had the movie magic we have today, this is a movie he would've made. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star as a couple who live in this great new house. Suddenly, the wife starts getting weird visions and ghostly goings on. She believes their new neighbor has killed his wife. But it is something far more close to home. Michelle Pfeiffer shines in this film. This is really her baby. Harrison Ford is as good as usual, but is given the backseat in the first part. He comes into his own in the last half. Director Robert Zemeckis has concocted a stylish thriller that no one seems to make anymore. Some of the scares are genuinely scary!. They are shot with such grace and style, that they come off beautifully. It's nice to see something like this on the screen after a tidal wave of awful slashers immitating &quot;Scream&quot;. As far as Suspenseful thrillers go, What Lies Beneath delivers in a big way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>C'mon...Harrison Ford as a villain?  No way.

He is a prominent scientist, she's an ex musician that just left her only daughter at college. Free time takes Mrs. Spencer to spy on her neighbors, and from that activity she believes that a crime has been perpetrated next door. Insecure and nervous, Claire's paranoia grows as a series of paranormal events take place in her perfect home: doors open and close, electrical equipment turn on automatically, spectral visions in the bathtub. Are all these things related? That's one of the many secrets the movie hides.<br /><br />A lonely home, secrets trying to be revealed, darkness, ghosts and the impending sensation that we are not sure what our eyes are seeing, What Lies Beneath has enough elements to hook you up for a scary time. Zemeckis takes advantage from every trick, cliche and ideas to spice the story, until he leaves us with a terrible deja vu sensation. The result is a supernatural thriller cleverly built, part psychological, part ghost story.<br /><br />And one could very well wonder, when Michelle Pfeiffer sees a spectral reflex on the water, if the ghost we are seeing is indeed Mr Hitchcock.<br /><br />As soon as the credits vanish, we take a walk from moments of Rear Window, Suspicion, Vertigo and even Psycho. The cinematic references overwhelm us, from the lead man's name, the disturbing music score, the movie's rhythm, the creepy house alone on a hill. Hitch's fans will enjoy tremendously this tribute<br /><br />Pfeiffer and Ford are two stars talented and very charismatic, whose performances give more depth to the story. Pfeiffer, above all, is very convincing as the housewife victim of a series of inexplicable events. Her terror and her pain are very truthful. Ford is somewhat relegated to a second place.<br /><br />In the end, the secrets that hide What Lies Beneath are not so interesting. The excess of subplots, tributes and tricks make the movie into a series of brilliant moments that are bigger than the whole. For the entertaining time, we can thank Zemeckis. For the suspense and fear that comes from our inner souls, let's thank Hitchcock, the man that understood that, in a good story, there must lie beneath secrets and emotions too scary to be revealed ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GB5CG77LGQRB.html">A2GB5CG77LGQRB</a><br/><p>What Lies Beneath<p>Score: 78/100<p>Beware of the trailer for What Lies Beneath! If you want to see the film and not know what's going to happen, you must stay away from all adverts of this classy, hip thriller. I, fortunately, knew nothing about the movie when I went to see it, so I was lucky. But, if you see the trailer, you'll be able to guess the end twist within the first second. However, once you keep yourself darned away from that advertisement, your on the right track, and are sure to like this chilling and thought-provoking film.<p>Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford), a university research scientist, is growing more and more concerned about his wife, Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer), a retired concert cellist who a year ago was involved in a serious auto accident, and who has just sent off her daughter Caitlin (Norman's stepdaughter) to college. Now, Claire reports hearing voices and witnessing eerie occurrences in and around their lakeside Vermont home, including seeing the face of a young woman reflected in water. An increasingly frightened Claire thinks the phenomena have something to do with the couple living next door, especially since the wife has disappeared without apparent explanation. At her husband's urging, Claire starts to see a therapist; she tells him she thinks the house is being haunted by a ghost. His advice? Try to make contact. Enlisting the help of her best friend, Jody (Diana Scarwid), and a ouija board, Claire seeks to find out the truth of What Lies Beneath.<p>At the very, very end the film kinds of drains away and leaves us with something a little more lifeless than the first hour and a half, but, flaws aside, What Lies Beneath is an excellent film. However, to call it a film or a movie is underestimating this thriller - it's more of an experience. What Lies Beneath's spooks and scares will practically traumatise you for the coming days. It's a truly horrifying piece of cinema, behind The Exorcist as the scariest film of all time. I couldn't stop jumping out of my seat and my face was pale when I came out of the cinema. It may not have the brilliance of The Exorcist, but it certainly has the style, the high performance level and the true smell of sheer horror that The Exorcist had included in 1973.<p>Not for everyone, but for people who want a lot of fun as well as a lot of seriously sweaty scares, What Lies Beneath is the perfect night out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>In this supernatural thriller, a woman believes that a visitor from the past is trying to guide.

And also, you will never believe who the killer is in this movie!! But I will not say who he/she is until someone has rented or bought this movie. The extras for the DVD were exceptional.

Considering how well crafted and inventive his other films such as Forrest Gump and Castaway were, this film resorts to corny special effects and hackneyed suspense techniques.  This film has been compared to Hitchcocks films.  The difference however is that Hitchcock will employ brilliant camera techniques and timing and music -- NOT cop-out techniques of artificial CGI to paste in ghost images.<p>Furthermore Harrison Ford's character development is simply inconsistent and rather unbelievable.  This is a well done "made-for-tv" movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ATOSQVSOA3D8Q.html">ATOSQVSOA3D8Q</a><br/><p>WOW! i love this movie from beginning to end.

It is scary and does hold your attention.  Also it has great star power with Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford.  The setting, with a beautiful lake and Vermont mountains in the distance, is breathtaking.  The negatives include some moments in which the film seems to fragment and go off on an unexplained tangent and special effects which are never explained other than as mental aberrations on the part of the characters.  Pfeiffer is very engaging as a woman who suspects that her house is being haunted by the ghost of a woman who has died mysteriously.  She first thinks that it is a neighbor who has been killed by her husband.  The viewer never receives an explanation for the neighbor woman's angst and anger towards her husband which has led Pfeiffer to suspect a murder.  The suspense sometimes goes on too long and the dramatic effect is a bit strained at times. Also the &quot;ghostly happenings&quot; are never really explained.  However, this is a reasonably entertaining movie and will appeal to a wider range of people than most suspense films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>If you've never been afraid to get into your bathtub, you will be after watching &quot;What Lies Beneath,&quot; the latest thriller from acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pheiffer as a married couple whose lives are about to be changed by a haunting secret and a terrifying entity. This is as good as adult contemporary thrillers get; with a little bit of the elements of &quot;The Blair-Witch Project,&quot; &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; and the famed movies of Alfred Hitchcock, Zemeckis is able to bring to the movie a complete sense of unease, while adding diversity and intensity to the intelligent story. <p>Claire Spencer is having a little trouble coping with her daughter moving away to college, and just when she thinks she is feeling better, a frightening cry from the other side of her fence leads her to believe that her new neighbor, Mary Feur, is in danger of her husband. After many strange events and a ghostly apparition in her house, Claire believes that Mary has been killed by her husband, but is dismayed and thinks herself crazy when she discovers otherwise. But the apparitions still keep coming, little by little: strange whispers fluttering through the house, an overly-anxious front door, and falling picture frames, all of which lead to the clues Claire needs to put the puzzle together. When she discovers the shocking truth, she realizes that her husband, Norman Spencer, is not who he seems to be, and what lies beneath his outward appearance is something that can mean her end. <p>This movie is a terrific example of the fact that a movie can have a PG-13 rating and still deliver on the grounds of suspense and chills. In using the techniques of previous films, Zemeckis makes them his own and keeps the story solid and fluid. You might say that the first part of this movie is a first-class take on the element of suspense from &quot;The Blair-Witch Project,&quot; which is highly acclaimed for its ability to scare us without showing us what's behind the creeps. &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; is able to carry this technique off as well as Claire begins to hear and see strange things without ever being able to fully make out what is going on. A small fragment of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; plays a part here, as Claire begins to understand that the entity making contact with her wishes retribution for something done to her. <p>Of all of the elements of this film, Hitchcock's techniques and brilliance are clearly evident throughout this film, from small, minute camera angles to the music and the way certain shots last so long without a cut-in. In one scene, Pheiffer walks out of her darkened bathroom, into her bedroom, and then out into the hall again, where she sees steam rising out of the bathroom doorway. This is all done in one shot, a typical Hitchcock technique that works so well with the story at hand. The music of certain scenes, especially in the climactic ending, will have you thinking back to classics like &quot;Psycho,&quot; which set the standard in horror movie soundtracks. Instead of seeming played out and dull, the way in which the film uses each of them in its own way is quite fresh, inventive and new. <p>While the filming techniques have been used before, the idea for the story also adds to the originality of the film as a whole. The aspect that adds the most uniqueness is the source of the entity that haunts the Spencer household, and the reasons for which it does so. I've never seen this done before in a movie of this kind, and it fits the mold perfectly in keeping with the idea that Claire is in danger not from the apparitions that plague her, but by something alive and real that she holds very dear. Without giving too much away, the ending is a bit of a stretch, but nevertheless keeps moving like the rest of the film, and once it is over, you'll find that it was well worth the wait. The special effects, which mostly take the place of using actual people in the roles of ghosts, add so much to the script and the overall effect of intensity. Alan Silvestri's frightening score will also make you jump when it strikes a high chord in the most thrilling moments of the film. <p>While the actors in all parts do a terrific job bringing the movie to life, this is clearly Michelle Pheiffer's movie, for she will carry most of the action, the emotion and the story with her. She portrays Claire Spencer, the happy wife who discovers secrets permeating through her marriage. She is by far the most complex character, and when she starts putting the pieces together, her entwining emotions are played to perfection by Pheiffer, who is superb. Harrison Ford is the other leading character, the husband Norman Spencer who has more secrets than truths in his life. Ford is excellent in this role, which is strikingly different from many of his other roles in which he plays the good guy, the hero who saves the day. But he carries it off with intelligence and, at times, wit. Diana Scarwid adds the needed comic relief in the form of Claire's best friend, but it turns out that she will play a minor yet important part in unlocking the mystery. <p>With so many elements of past films going for it, &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; is a classy and intelligent ensemble of complex characters wandering through a world of lies, deceit, fright, and secrecy. It makes the audience jumps at the right times, while keeping their hearts beating juts a bit faster in between. Be sure to try and catch all the eerie ghosts and entities the are all throughout the film; there are a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Yes, Harrison Ford receives top billing, and he does a creditable job in his role as stuffy professor Norman Spencer.  But, let's face it---this movie belongs to the superb Michelle Pfeiffer, in an overlooked, should have been Oscar nominated performance.  Michelle portrays Norman's wife, Clare, a woman who has seemingly had a difficult year since a strange auto accident the year before the movie starts.  First thing you know she's sure that their new neighbor has killed his bizzare wife.  And, what's worse, a ghost is haunting Michelle, and she's sure it's the wife's ghost that's doing it.<p>Aha...that's just the start.  Robert Zemeckis, like Brian DePalma, pays homage to the great Alfred Hitchcock in this really spooky film.  Unlike DePalma, however, Zemeckis doesn't copy Hitch, but translates his style into Zemecki's own.  It's a brilliant directorial effort, again worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Diana Scarwid as Jody, Clare's friend, is also superb in a supporting role, bringing a little bit of humor and pizzazz to Clare's spooky life.<p>The plot twists and turns, in spite of the movie's trailer revealing something it shouldn't have, but it still works, thanks to the dominance of Pfeiffer in the leading role.  Her &quot;possession&quot; by the ghost reveals a sensual sexiness few actresses can pull off as convincingly.<p>The visual effects are stunning, and the last thirty minutes or so of the movie is spine-tingling in its intensity.  A real winner of a movie, that demonstrates that Harrison and Michelle are not over the hill.  This movie made well over a hundred million, and it's one of the best spook stories in recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Amazon's review really nails this film for the intelligent, old-fashioned edge-of-your-seat thriller that it is, but it is a flawed film too.<br /><br />No need to rehash the plot as both Amazon's review and the product description tell you enough about the film, so I'll get right to what I loved, liked, and disliked about this film, but let me warn you in advance that this review contains serious SPOILERS that I feel I can't ignore while writing this review as it specifically connects to the flaws the film contains.<br /><br />This film's strengths:  Don't let the box title fool you with Harrison Ford's name being first, which is based upon his considerable star power, this film belongs to Michelle Pfieffer and to her alone although a very young Miranda Otto from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007KIFI2">Flight of the Phoenix</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTI">War of the Worlds</a> gives a noteworthy supporting performance.  Ford himself really plays second fiddle to Pfieffer in this thriller and although he gives a good performance, he seems out of place being a supporting actor and looks rather uncomfortable during most of this film.<br /><br />The script is intelligently written and slowly reveals the plot in such a way that we feel we know what is coming, but we are as unsure as Pfieffer's character as to the "truth" of things.  The direction is first-rate by Robert (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AL1E">Back to the Future</a> and Forrest Gump) Zemeckis as he experiments with playing Alfred (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783240236">The Birds</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225849">Psycho</a>) Hitchcock.  He builds this little masterpiece up to a compelling and chilling conclusion that doesn't disappoint even though it does leave us scratching our heads a bit.<br /><br />The film's weaknesses: Simply put . . . it's Harrison Ford's presence in this film which ends up being rather distracting.  At the time he was too big of a star to play such a supporting role and one keeps scratching his head wondering just why he's in this film.  In addition, Ford himself seems so uncomfortable not being the main attraction.  I don't mean that he's too egotistical to play a supporting role, but he had been a number one box-office draw for nearly two decades at this point that I just don't feel he knew how to fade into the background in a less starring role.  Lastly, while he makes a (spoiler alert here) remorseful guilt-ridden bad guy, he does not make a believable self-serving psychopath and the faulty script at the end attempts to make him BOTH.<br /><br />That is the film's other serious weakness.  Ford's character is supposed to be guilt-ridden over an affair he had with a college student that ended with him murdering her.  Ford is actually very good at playing flawed characters as many of his heroes are such, but the script also has him as a lunatic at the end.  First he's genuinely sorry for his affair, his part in the death of his lover, and the pain this has caused his wife to experience, and we, the audience buy that as Ford is great at playing stronge but emotional characters as with his great performances in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATZT">The Fugitive</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767803434">Air Force One</a>, but the script then has him enjoying his attempt at murdering his wife (Pfieffer).  He jokingly asks her if she would rather have hot or cold water in the tub as he attempts to drown her and then even loving plays with his dog as she is drowning before his eyes.  Is this the same man who was crying, literally, to his wife over what had happened with that other woman.  In an otherwise intelligently written and well-acted film, this is a glaring inconsistancy in a character and it doesn't add up.  Add that to an already uncomfortable performance by Ford in a supporting role and you get an ending that is somewhat murky if not still thrilling and suspenseful.<br /><br />Well, I don't want to end this review on a negative note as this film deserves all four stars that I gave it, but it's not without its flaws.  This slickly, well-executed thriller is worth both your time and money, but just don't be surprised if you find yourself scratching your head a bit when it's all done.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>'What Lies Beneath' directed by Robert Zemeckis ends with a very satisfying bang / surprise, but it is just a bit tedious in getting there. Contrary to the blurbs on the jacket, the movie does not live up to Hitchcock's quality and does not do for the bathtub what 'Psycho' did for the shower.<br /><br />While it is not as bad as the most critical reviews, it does not add lots of points to its stars' resumes, as it simply does not effectively use the ambiguity between psychosis and the supernatural as we see in Hitchcock and the best of Stephen King.<br /><br />Nice surprise in the casting and in the technique used to attempt murder. Otherwise, average.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>Whatever homage for Hitchcock was intended, "What Lies Beneath" is not fit to be on the same shelf as "Rear Window." Why? Hitchcock movies are intelligent, winding around the story and characters. "What Lies Beneath" uses spooky music and scenes that jump out and calls it disturbing.<br /><br />"Ghostbusters" is scarier.<br /><br />What is disturbing is Harrison Ford's choice to be involved. What was he thinking when he signed on? He's a favorite actor for me. He's starred in "Star Wars," "Indiana Jones," "The Fugitive" and "Mosquito Coast." Good stuff. Until this.<br /><br />Ford's credibility as an actor is not shaken. He carries each scene of this meandering movie. Bad plotlines are confused as tricky storytelling, and even Ford can't take a Saturday-matinee and turn it into a Friday-night blockbuster.<br /><br />Does the movie adequately refer to Hitchcock classics? Who cares? That sort of thing is only interesting when the referring movie succeeds on its own. This doesn't. That's the same problem Ang Lee had when making "The Hulk." He spent so much time of mimicking a style that he forgot to make a good movie.<br /><br />The Plot:<br />Happy couple lives in Vermont. The wife is being spooked but does not know why. The husband does not seem to understand. The ghost slowly reveals its intentions, and the happy couple's life unravels. The big finish is not expected, and the only redeeming part of this 130 minute couch-sit.<br /><br />About the story:<br />Connections are never made as to why the ghost waits a year to do some haunting, and why it took the measures involved. Nor, why it thinks Claire "knows" why she's being haunted when she fully demonstrates she has no idea.<br /><br />The ghost tries to kill Norman, Ford's character. If that's all it wants, why does it need Claire, Michelle Pfeiffer's character and Norman's wife?<br /><br />Subplots involving the quirky neighbors are never sorted out.<br /><br />"What Lies Beneath" as a title is misleading. I can't go into this more for the sake of ruining the story for those of you who will wind up still seeing it.<br /><br />In all, the movie will be forgotten, played late at night in the time slot reserved for exercise equipment commercials. The movie is not awful, and better than a rerun of that infomercial with Chuck Norris. It is just that Harrison Ford, and costar Michelle Pfeiffer can and have done better.<br /><br />Looking for a real thriller? See the Hitchcock movies that this is being compared. "Rear Window" with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly is a great place to begin.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>I've seen thousands of movies but WLB is seriously very, very bad. I am shocked that Ford/Pfeiffer/Zemeckis actually churned out a film so awful. Considering how many cool movies Zemeckis has created in the past such as the BTTF trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Cast Away, plus his involvement with the 'Dark Castle' movies (House on Haunted Hill, Thir13en Ghosts, Ghost Ship-all graphic and way scary) and Tales From The Crypt for WLB to be such a boring affair is bizarre. <p>Thank goodness I bought this DVD cheap, I would have felt so criminally cheated if I had paid full price for it. Never before has 2 hours seemed so unfathomly long. Every tedious minute is dragged out and every second is felt. <p>This wouldn't be so bad if the plot and story were bearable but the whole thing is so full of holes and embarrassing contrivances that it becomes too hard to swallow. For such a long, drawn-out and tedious affair to have a boring, tension-free ending is unreal. Considering the talent behind this film it's strange for it to be so bad. I wouldn't recommend it under any circumstances.<p>The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>Okay, imagine an episode of Tales From The Crypt (whose television program was actually co-created by this film's director Robert Zemeckis) with a good cast, a good budget, a good director, and one of the more interesting premises of a film this year. Now imagine the worst script possible being attached to it, and there you have &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, easily the worst film of 2000 because of its sheer, transparent joy in dumbing itself down from what could have been a shocking, disturbing, multi-leveled thriller to a crowd-pleasing mish-mash of Hitchcockian cliches, over-the-top performances, and an ending that goes on about twenty minutes too long. What is wrong with Robert Zemeckis? He who was the mastermind behind such truly great films like &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and the executive producer of one of the most underrated films of the 90's, Peter Jackson's &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, brings us this film which seems to have consciously made an effort to make itself stupid. Of course, Zemeckis has had his share of misfires such as &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; and the abysmal sequels to &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, but after his superb direction in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and his support of &quot;The Frighteners&quot;, I was hoping that those days were over. But I was wrong. Now onto the movie itself. Its plot is very strong: A happily-married couple (Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfieffer) who finally have some time to rekindle the flames of their romance after sending their daughter off to college, find that their beautiful new colonial house... is haunted. And it just so happens to be haunted by the ghost of a young college girl who Ford's character, a brilliant college science professor, had an affair with. Makes for a pretty strong ghost story, right? Wrong. Merely because the film tries too hard to make the events of the physical world responsible for the terror that the spiritual world brings into it. Whatever happened to ghost stories that happened seemingly for no reason? Doesn't that make things scarier and more immediate when terrible things happen to good people without justification? Apparently, Zemeckis and Co. didn't think so. So we have one climax followed by another and another and another and another until we finally get to the real one that not only is embarassingly absurd, but gives no real satisfaction. You're left feeling empty and insulted because where the film could have disturbed and shocked in an intelligent manner, it went for the cheap Hollywood ending that wraps everything up in a neat little package so you can walk out of the theater feeling good that the evil-doer is punished and the innocent walk free. Didn't Hollywood learn anything from great shockers like &quot;The Exorcist&quot; or &quot;Se7en&quot; or &quot;Psycho&quot;? That you can make a disturbing and smart thriller without everything having to happen for a reason? I guess not, which is maybe one of the reasons that 2000 was one of the worst years of filmmaking ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>"What Lies Beneath" is the type of ghost story movie in the same mold as "Stir Of Echoes", and what I mean by this is that it is a revenge ghost story.  In other words, the ghost in the movie is not the malevolent entity in the movie, but the ghost's killer is.  However, these type of revenge ghost story movies do not work very well to present a truly pure horror movie viewing experience because once you realize the ghost just wants revenge, the focus of the movie changes to the punishment of the mortal killer(s) and much of the suspense and mystery of the supernatural becomes secondary or maybe even lost completely.  This is unfortunate and such is the case with both "What Lies Beneath" and "Stir Of Echoes".  Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star in "What Lies Beneath" and they are both great actors and I have no problem with them in this movie...no, it's the script that I do not feel presents pure and unadulterated horror.  If you just want to see a drama, this movie is fine but, as a horror movie, it does not function well as such...in fact, as a horror movie, this movie sucks.  The only movie like this that actually works as a horror movie in my opinion is a movie called "The Changeling" with George C. Scott...I would recommend "The Changeling" any day over "What Lies Beneath" or any other movie like this which have become somewhat popular in the horror genre over the last 10-15 years.  Unfortunately, these movies are riddled by a common anti-climactic flaw which extinguishes the mystery of the supernatural which ignited the audience's interest in the movie in the first place.  If people think this is a good drama, that is fine, but I just hate it when I read reviews and get all excited about watching a horror movie and it turns out the movie sucks as a horror movie...such is the case with "What Lies Beneath".</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`What Lies Beneath' certainly has it's fair share of thrills, and there are moments when you will jump near out of your skin, but in the end the film is almost too campy for it's own good.<br /><br />That said; it's still worth checking out.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Caitlin Spencer, a woman drove halfway to insane by paranoia when she begins to speculate that her new neighbors are harboring a dark secret.  When she starts having visions, in particular that of a young dead woman, she becomes increasingly more agitated by the idea that a ghost needs to communicate some horrendous truth to her.<br /><br />It's kind of like `Gothika', just not as bad.<br /><br />It's a very good thing that Michelle Pfeiffer chews this film up.  She just attacks this performance with so much dedication and fearlessness that you almost forgive her for giving way to this choppy (and at times rather silly) script.  She's actually very close to fabulous here.  Shockingly, the acting all the way around is pretty great.  Even Harrison Ford, an actor who is very hit or miss (more often miss) for me.  He carries the eerie sense of destructive charm that suits his character flawlessly.  I also thought that Diana Scarwid was rather great here as well, serving up your typical token `best friend' role with a twist.<br /><br />I only wish that this film didn't wear its influences on its sleeves.  The film borrows so heavily from other, more successful films of this nature, and it's blatantly obvious.  When you look at a film like `The Sixth Sense' (one of many that this film borrows from), you can see how they used originality to their advantage to create something that will break boundaries.<br /><br />This film doesn't do that.<br /><br />The film kind of escalates to a rather chaotic and unsuccessful ending, but there are moments throughout that balance things off, helping `What Lies Beneath' become recommended viewing.  This is far from the best in the genre, but it's also far from the worst (I give it a C+. verging on a B-).  It's fun and spooky, and even when it reaches levels of ridiculous camp (such as that laughable possession scene), the film is redeemed by committed acting that never fails to sell the unsellable.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>It had been a year since Dr. Norman Spencer betrayed his beautiful wife Claire. But with Claire oblivious to the truth and the affair over, Norman's life and marriage seem perfect--so perfect that when Claire tells him of hearing mysterious voices and seeing a young woman's wraithlike image in their home, he dismisses her mounting terror as delusion. However, as Claire moves closer to the truth, it becomes clear that this apparition will not be dismissed, and has come back for Dr. Norman Spencer... and his beautiful wife. This movie is a jump-in-your-seat scary tightly wound psychological and supernatural mystery.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Just a note to indicate that the years intervening since this film appeared have done nothing to dull the luster of this thriller nor of the two stars who, singly and together, pretty much hold the stage throughout the performance.

The transition from joy- to terror- filled days is done well while the twists and turns make dramatic logical sense.

One thing I did not like about the DVD itself is that when you put it in your DVD player it plays parts of the movie before going to the menu screen.

I've always enjoyed Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, but wondered what this movie was all about.  I was pleasently surprised, as it was far better than I thought it would be, and I didn't anticipate the twists and turns.<br /><br />Harrison and Michelle play Norman and Claire Spencer, a happily married couple who are adjusting to their new positions in life.  Their daughter has just gone off to college, and they are now pseudo empty nesters.  While Norman still has his work as a college professor, Claire finds herself a bit bored.  Their new next door neighbors have become an object of fascination, as they have passionate fights and reconciliation.  Clarie eventually becomes convinced that the husband murdered his wife when she sees some strange things in the middle of the night.  After attempting to contact spirits on the Ouija board and some odd goings on here and there, Claire becomes convinced that the wife's ghost is trying to communicate with her.  When she confronts the neighbor, he explains, once his wife appears at his side, that he didn't kill his wife.  Embarrassed, Claire leaves with her tail between her legs, thinking it's just some paranoid fantasy.<br /><br />But there really is a spirit trying to connect with her, just one not in association with the neighbors.  It's of a university student who disappeared last year named Madison.  Who Norman had an affair with.  Who Claire walked in on, ran away in shock, had a car accident, bumped her head, and forgot about.<br /><br />It's a juicy tale, to be sure.  It's a good, old school kind of thriller, without blood and guts, and keeps the suspense going until the very end.

Norman & Claire's idyllic life in their beautiful lakeshore Vermont home is shattered by Claire's visions of an entity, and Norman's callous dismissal of her visions only strengthens Claire's resolve to get to the bottom of the matter.

Harrison Ford was good, and played a bit against type.<br /><br />The movie left a few loose ends untied (such as the situation with the neighbors, and some visions and apparitions), had a few lapses in logic and reality (yeah, I know it's a ghost movie) such as the boat mast poking a hole in the windshield though not breaking it, and some of it was a bit too convenient (one accident at the exact location of a previous accident), and the final scene felt tacked on (think how nicely ambiguous it would be if what lies beneath just sank past the camera...)<br /><br />Overall, the movie is pretty good and entertaining, and though it started off strong, it tapered off a bit as it got into the second half.<br /><br />DVD extras include a commentary by Zemeckis and 2 producers, a brief documentary of (mostly other) Zemeckis movies, and text-based cast/crew info.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Robert Zemeckis' superbly-crafted thriller WHAT LIES BENEATH gets another release on DVD, this time with more extra features. Hitchcockian in story and style, Zemeckis' tale about supernatural happenings at a lakeside house is a suspensful and compelling story starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer. The plot is set a year after Dr Norman Spencer (Ford) had an affair with another woman, but Claire (Pfeiffer) is oblivious to his betrayal until Claire starts hearing voices... Events start off well, with some well-played scenes reminiscant of REAR WINDOW, but the film leans more on it's star power than originality. Dogs bark when something bad is about to happen, every door creaks eerily, lightning, thunder et all. But despite the over-done &quot;homages&quot; to PSYCHO among others, it remains a very effective thriller and a bold lesson in shock tactics. The last half hour is a tour-de-force of frenetic camera trickery, twists, clever imagery, fantastic &quot;boo!&quot; scares and Alan Silversti's nail-biting score. Building the tension slowly from a &quot;who-dunnit&quot; to an all-out, no-holds barred thriller near the finale, if you like shocking films like this, then this one is a must.<br />The DVD extras are great stuff for fans of the film, starting off with a flashy 30-second clip show of the film that launches the menu. An insightful Commentary by director Zemeckis is the highlight, and the &quot;Behind-the-Scenes&quot; Featurette is informative and interesting, and you also get production notes and trailers. Impressive. Most impressive.</p></br><a href="../users/A37DLVPKJZGSQF.html">A37DLVPKJZGSQF</a><br/><p>What Lies Beneath, a brilliant, masterfully played out homage to Hitchcock is quite frankly the scariest movie I have ever seen. I came out of the cinema pale and shaking and while I was watching the film I was so scared I even had to shield my eyes at parts. All the scary parts are brought to life by a great score with manages to grab you in the nuts at the most unexpected times. The movie is over 2 hours long but never tires. I have watched this about 5 times now and every time I get the chills and always appreciate the film more. Robert Zemeckis excellent direction reminds us of how many great movies directors can do in 1 year. Cast Away and this film were both brilliant experiences and Zemeckis directs them both brilliantly. The performances excel, with Michelle Pfeiffer excellent as Claire Spencer who, while trying to uncover a masterful mystery, is slowly losing her mind. Harrison Ford brings up many shocks and takes a surprising back seat. His performance is fabulous. What Lies Beneath builds its suspense - especially in one horrifyingly Hitchcockian bathtub sequence - and always uses its ideas. I couldn't find many plot holes but the film can be complex at times. If you watch the film carefully and take note of everything that's happening I'm sure you'll understand the ending and the mystery that is slowly unlocking. What Lies Beneath has many great camera shots too like Michelle's toe peaking above the bath water, her hand clutching the side, her grabbing a sharp piece of glass and it reflecting her terrified face and a freaky close-up on Harrison Ford's eye. I love this movie, and it will always be a heart-stopping and fun experience for me to sit through.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Robert Zemeckis has made a career out of melding excellent stories with great visual effects ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit", "Back to the Future", "Forrest Gump").  He is a very versatile director who can adeptly shift from genre to genre.  In this film, he again demonstrates his talent, creating a spooky supernatural thriller delivering some of the best suspense I've seen in years.<p>The story by Sarah Kernochan ("9 ? Weeks", "Sommersby") where the dead victim communicates with someone living to finger the killer is not innovative and has been done numerous times in various forms.  What makes this film good is Zemeckis' presentation.  It has elements of Hitchcock suspense with the benefit of modern technology and visual effects.  Zemeckis' use of camera and sound produces extraordinary suspense and startling surprises that make viewers jump out of their seats.  There is a lot of silence in this film with no background music which makes the surprises that much more dramatic.  He peppers the film with false alarms so you never know if the buildup is for something genuinely scary or just the dog.  Though none of the techniques is new, they are all used extremely effectively.  The film creates terror with very little gore and violence, proving that the use of these techniques in horror films is overdone and unnecessary.  Often what we don't see is far more frightening than what we do.<p>The acting in this film is outstanding.  Michelle Pfeiffer gives a brilliant performance as Claire; the overwrought wife who everyone thinks is losing her mind when she starts talking about communing with the dead.  Pfeiffer takes her character right to the edge and her hysterical fear at the events that transpire is awesome.  Harrison Ford plays an unaccustomed role, departing from his normal white hat hero.  He shows great range by handling the sinister aspects of his character nefariously.  Diana Scarwid also gives an enjoyable performance as Claire's best friend.<p>Though this film doesn't redefine the genre, it is a fine example of frightening suspense under the guidance of a talented director.  I rated it an 8/10.  Be prepared for a heart pounding experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>Director Robert Zemeckis gives us your typical suspenseful moments like the mist escaping the bathroom door, the wide angle bathtub shot reminiscent of The Shining, a dog growling at an evil presence, someone opening a door and then when they close it, a person is standing there, and so on.  Seen it all before, but still created suspense nonetheless.<br /><br />Also adding to the movie's suspense is the lighting tricks.  For instance, you'll have a scene that's all dark and then a bolt of lightning will illuminate a figure you didn't know was there.<br />There's also extreme close-up shots that add tension, too.  I especially liked the scene where Michelle Pfeiffer is slowly walking down the stairs backwards and all we're allowed to see is the back of her heels.  It's a very quiet scene and then there's a bang that makes you jump.<br />Not only are these close-up shots unsettling, but I thought they were artistic, too.  One bathtub scene shows us just a woman's legs and it reminded me of a similar painting by Frida Kahlo.<br /><br />There's good special effects in this movie, but what I appreciated most is that these special effects are used sparingly, only when needed.  It annoys me when a movie is all special effects at the expense of a good story.  What's funny is that I've seen this movie several times, but only in my last viewing did I notice at the very end, there's an image of a woman's face in the ice.  It's very subtle, but pretty clever nonetheless.<br /><br />I gave this movie 4 stars only because I thought the ending got a little too unrealistic and silly for my taste.  I also thought the movie could've been edited better (ran a little too long).  And they never explain if that was really blood on the neighbor's shoe.<br />Overall, though, I thought this was a successfully suspenseful movie...kind of like Rear Window with a ghost story twist.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>What Lies Beneath brings to the screen the story of a widow that remarried and settled in a nice country home in Vermont. Things become a little complicated when she begins to feel a strong sense of paranormal activity inside her house...<br />The movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.<br />Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford, and most of the rest of the cast carry out their performances well.<br />The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the music, and the special effects, are all good.<br />In short, What Lies Beneath is a movie worth watching if you are in the mood for a decent thriller as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  4 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>It is rats in the attic or termites in the timbers ( bats in the bell free<br />or bugs in your hat?), but never, never real spirits? Seeing the head doctor<br />and fighting off the men in white coats, people believe in their lonesome fantasy of dead people walking? Is it the neighbor's dead wife or something more sinister? It seems to be a plum role for Michelle Pfeiffer?<br />Harrison Ford is kind of the straight man to the bent housewife<br />with delusions that aren't...MEF and possession.<br />From there things go from bad to worse.<br />Well made, well acted, just not the kind of movie I like.<br />I've watched it twice to make this review.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Claire Spencer's (Michelle Pfieffer) daughter Caitlin is heading off to college.  The retired cellist has nothing to do but enjoy her beautiful Vermont home and her delectible husband, Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford).<br /><br />Empty Nest Syndrome is hard, but nobody ever told Claire she'd become obsessed with her fighting neighbors and see the face of a dead girl underwater...Plus, she's facing the anniversary of an auto crash.<br /><br />The first part builds suspense like only Hitchcock could.  I swear Claire hurts herself so often, she's a walking Band-Aid commercial.  She keeps getting startled by the phone, her husband walking up behind her.<br /><br />When Norman has had enough, he urges Claire to seek professional help.  The psychiatrist suggests Claire get in touch with the ghost.  She and her friend Jodi get an Oija board and have seances to summon the neighbor's wife...<br /><br />And the rest keeps you glued to your seat with the hairs standing up on the back of your neck. "What Lies Beneath" goes further than being an homage to Hitchcock and stands on its own as a classic of the horror genre.  I had to watch in a well-lit room -- and my poor cat couldn't even stay on my lap.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>shirt, not bad for a guy pushing 70.  And Michelle always looks adorable.  Loved the plot, perfect family, perfect house, perfect dog, perfect friends, perfect husband, a scientist with a big salary no less, perfect size 2 wife, and something hidden, dirty and horrifying to screw it all up.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>This movie has all the perfect elements.  Hitchcock was robably beaming in his grave.  This movie has so many layers.  The moment you THINK you know what this story is about, it changes, and then changes again until the truth astonishes you.  I remember when I saw this movie in the theatre-I was just rivited to the screen.  Catching it on TNT so many years later, it still has the same effect.  The young teen screams don't have the corner market on suspense.  I wish there was more movies like this out there.  Bravo.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>....by the obvious animation of the shock ending. This is a thriller, not a comic piece like Scooby Doo or Ghostbusters. A little more work could have been done there. Pfieffer, Ford and the suspense makers in this one did an outstanding job getting the most mileage and mystery from the story, but, I dunno--I expected more than the cartoonish ending. Especially after Zemeckis and his storymakers did so great on "Forrest Gump" and "Death Becomes Her".</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Harrison Ford is in unfamiliar territory in this tense, exciting supernatural thriller, helmed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Castaway). The film has some really effective shocks and twists, with sharp editing and Alan Silverstri's increasingly creepy score. The numerous homages to Hitchcock films are nicely done, and Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer fit well together as a married couple. And with a great story, Zemeckis weaves his magic to full terrifying effect.<p>Originality, however, is not it's strong point, as we are greeted to creaky doors, sudden thunder, dogs barking before something scary happens and so on. But the main plot provides some great shocks and creepy moments throughout the film.<br />The added CGI creates a really spine-chilling feel to the movie, and by the end leaves you chilled, yet satisfied. This is a truly great film, and an awesome DVD. Prepare yourself for a great night in.</p></br></body></html>

Man on Fire is incredibly dark and violent, leading you into the underground world of organized kidnappings in Mexico City.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is John Creasey, an ex-operative who is now an admitted alcoholic.  He takes a job protecting a wealthy young couple's little girl named Pita (Fanning).  Pita breaks through Creasey's tough exterior and gives him a reason to live.  Now I know what you are thinking.  This sounds so Pollyanna-ish.  Lord help me, it is not.<br /><br />Pita is kidnapped.  The drop of the ransom money is compromised, as a third party, not related to the kidnappers, steals the ransom.  When the girl's mother begs the "voice" on the phone to spare Pita, he says it is too late.<br /><br />So begins Creasey's one-man war on the corrupt order of Mexican police know as El Hermandad (The Brotherhood).  He wants to kill everyone remotely involved in Pita's abduction and murder.<br /><br />Kidnappings, or "secuestros" are a real problem in Latin America.  Everyone knows the police down there are highly corrupt, and this movie is bold in that it is not afraid to be politically incorrect.<br /><br />Performances all around are superb.  Even the guys who are about to die at Creasey's hand - you really feel they are going through this incredible emotion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>excellent. He shows whole lot of acting talent as he goes from a depressed, disgraced alcoholic to a brave & tender protector of a little girl & back to the stone-cold agent he once was. He is the bodyguard of a wise beyond her years Dakota Fanning, isolated with her family in Mexico City, where kidnapping is a real fact of life. They bond as he coaches her in sports at school, raisng her confidence & becoming the person she can depend on, her parents being rather occupied with their own lives. She gives him the respect & affection he hasn't had from the outside world in a long time. Washington shows a wide range in this movie & it can be enjoyed by both men & women.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Revenge movies are so popular because we all like to feel that warm fuzzy of satisfaction when the guilty reprobate responsible for causing all that pain to our hero is finally blown up into tiny bloody pieces.  It's a comfortable feeling of validation that makes us glow with a delightful feeling of righteous fulfillment.  Right?<br /><br />Man On Fire is not necessarily a great movie, but it is a great revenge movie, unique in its choice of location, actors, and resolution; and that makes it worthy of a peek.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays John W. Creasy, an ex-assassin from some sort of special ops group, who has retired from his work with Death to become an aimless and hopeless alcoholic.  He travels to Mexico City to visit his old friend Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) who has settled into a comfortable life there.<br /><br />Rayburn sets Creasy up with an easy job as a bodyguard to nine-year old Pita Ramos (expertly played by young Dakota Fanniing) daughter of well-off plant owner Samuel Ramos.  Creasy does not like people, but young Pita manages to wiggle her way into his heart.  Creasy is almost killed when she is kidnapped for ransom, and finds out through Rayburn that the ransom drop went bad.  Creasy then teams up with tenacious and levelheaded reporter Mariana Guerrero (talented Rachel Ticotin) and sets out to do what he does best; dish out death to everyone involved in the kidnapping.<br /><br />In Rayburn's words, "A man can be an artist, food or whatever, it depends on what he's good at.  Creasy's art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece."<br /><br />Watch out for some stellar performances by Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Rahda Mitchell (I am so glad to see this talented actress get another leading role besides Pitch Black, she was great in that movie too), Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, and (surprise) Marc Anthony.  Yes, he can act, and plays his part of Samuel Ramos with a style and substance that is missing in his singing career.<br /><br />There is wonderful scenery from Mexico City, a tight plot, a wonderful musical score, and a unique and bittersweet climax which all allow Man On Fire to rise up above the "just another revenge movie" it could have been.  The movie itself was a pleasure to watch and IMHO, worthy of purchase.  The only part of the actual movie that I didn't like was using too much of what I call Stutter-Flash scenes; jumpy, flashing scenes that alternate slow-mo and sped-up photography.  While adding to the surrealism of Creasy's world, a little goes a long way, and I think the movie over-uses this effect.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the DVD version was that the only special features available were the running commentaries that seem to have become popular with directors and actors.  To me, this is like having people blathering on annoyingly in the theater while you are trying to watch the movie.  I prefer interviews and behind-the-scenes features to the commentaries.  Also, the subtitles on the screen during the Spanish speaking parts were tiny, forcing blind-ol-me to sit closer to the TV than I wanted to in order to be able to read them.<br /><br />All in all, Man On Fire is a great movie; suspenseful and well acted with a little twisty surprise at the end that actually squeezed a tear from my withered and dried up soul.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie. It is dark, challenging and the performances are great.<p>Denzel Washington plays a hired bodyguard and former assassin named Creasy who is to protect an adorable little girl named Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. There relationship is phenominal. Denzel slowly warms to her personality and finds a new purpose in life behind her.<p>Denzel, once again, proves that he is one of, if not THE finest actor in hollywood. In MAN ON FIRE, he takes on 3 personalities and he flawlessly transforms from one to the next with ultimate believability. <p>Revenge is ugly.<p>Everything about the movie is entertaining and engrossing. Yet, one thing really set me off. That one thing was an MTV, flash image story-telling that frequently left me wishing they would just STOP and SHOW THE IMAGES! At times, it was okay, but at times it was frustrating and confusing. <p>Is it art? Is there a point to it? Or is it just a way to be different? I don't know. From what I saw, much of it served no purpose other than to be artsy and NEW AGE.  <p>You know that instance where you GET IT? Where you're watching a scene and you know what is happening and you know what is going to happen? Many of these scenes were dragged on excrutiatingly long and longer to the point of frustration by bizarre closeups, flashes, overdramatization and slow motion.<p>The movie's good. It deserved 4 stars, and if I hadn't gotten frustrated at numerous scenes throughout, I would have given it 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>...IT IS MY JOB TO ARRANGE THE MEETING. Somehow when Denzel Washington says this line it is not as convincing as maybe Van Diesel. Washington and Dakota Fanning did their expected wonderful job, but the ending was all wrong for the movie. The movie starts out slow. Washington plays a Jack Daniels guzzling former CIA agent who reads the Bible. His partner, Christopher Walken, lands him a job guarding Dakota Fanning (Pita). Early in the movie we find out every rich person in Mexico hires a body guard, then gets kidnapping insurance from AIG for 10 million dollars, which the kidnappers know about. This sets you up for the expected plot twists which were not terrific. Denzel doesn't want to get friendly with Dakota, but ends up becoming her friend, father, swimming coach, chauffeur, etc. etc. Dakota Fanning gets kidnapped (box information) Denzel uses his CIA "walking tall" methods to go after the bad guys, which includes half of Mexico. The substandard script and slow beginning deducted one star. The poorly scripted ending took away a second one. The ending should have included a dramatic escape by Fanning involving her ability to swim as the movie centered so much on this aspect of her life.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington is great actor.  He gets a lot of work and sometimes the films he appears in just aren't up to his talent.  My favorite roles that I've seen are GLORY, MALCOLM X and TRAINING DAY (I believe he won Oscars for two and was nominated for the third).<br /><br />Now I'm going to add MAN ON FIRE to that list.  He's great in it.  He plays a haunted Black OPS hitman who ends every day with a Bible and a bottle of Jack Daniels...and a gun.  Christopher Walken arranges for him to be the bodyguard for a little girl in Mexico City, the kidnapping capital of the world.  Just as the little girl--who definitely isn't overplayed as a precocious tot (Dakota Fanning is wonderful too)--is showing Denzel how to live and connect and care again, boom, she's kidnapped.  And the movie is off and running.<br /><br />Tony Scott's stylistical flourishes keep the movie moving, and the intelligent script throws a few curves as Denzel tears through the underbelly of Mexico to get at anyone who had anything to do with the kidnapping.  If you're a fan of Denzel, there's a lot to love here in his performance.<br /><br />Great cast includes Mickey Rourke and the actor who played Mathis in CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This heart-wrenching story is a must see.

Denzel Washington gives a worthy performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>It's a little longer than it needed to be, but this story of a little girl kidnapped by some criminals in Mexico is still intense, beautiful to look at, and generally hard to ignore; Washington and Scott are in fine form, as the colorful 'washed' look of the film suits it perfectly. Christopher Walken is in fine form, as is Dakota Fanning; The relationship between Washington and Fanning is never overdone, but more on a realistic side. And when the s**t goes down for the final few acts of this movie, you can't help but root for Washington the whole way. Great scenery and color schemes help to make this something special to me. Very violent but seemed to fit the premise. On blu ray, it's pretty amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>He doesn't get any better at his job than this movie. Why he didn't get any awards for this flick is beyond me.

No way, Pita is persistent and charming. Creasy's defenses melt and a warm relationship ensues.<br />Creasy quits drinking.<br />Pita conquers a swimming prize.<br />A Kidnappers Team ends this happy association: Pita is abducted and Creasy left bleeding and loaded with lead.<br />Without recovering from his wounds Creasy starts a wild revenge chase, picking one suspect after other with the help of a journalist.<br />Until the bitter end, a blood full cavalcade ensues.<br /><br />When judged as an action film: it is a great movie.<br />Starts a little morosely, but setting very clearly the scenery. After Pita's kidnapping action explodes ceaselessly. Nicely filmed, each photogram is framed with great care.<br /><br />When judged appreciating playacting: it is outstanding.<br />Denzel Washington gives, once more, a very impressive impersonation. He is one of my all times favorite actor. He fleshes with equal success historical characters as Malcolm X ("Malcolm X" 1992) or Steve Biko ("Cry Freedom" 1987), investigators as Grantham ("The Pelican Brief" 1993) or Hobbes ("Fallen" 1998) as in the present role as Creasy.<br />There are not enough words to describe Dakota Fanning's performance: enticing, self-possessed, very expressive and realistic. 10 point to the young lady!<br />Christopher Walken as Rayburn, Radha Mitchell as the child's mother and Giancarlo Giannini as Manzano give the audience very good acting pieces.<br />Special mention must be done for Rachel Ticotin as journalist Mariana, sober but full of stamina acting. She deserves to receive more important personages to flesh up. She is a very fine actress, still underestimated by producers and directors.<br /><br />When judged taking into account ethical values: here is where issue is in doubt.<br />Is Creasy entitled to ruthlessly torture, mutilate and kill? Even if the "Bad Guys" are really bad and wicked as in this film, is it ok to apply such barbaric measures?<br />IMO: no. He or anyone else is not entitled to do such things. There are always other means to obtain justice and give retribution to evil-doers.<br /><br />I consider this an intelligent film that may be enjoyed by action movies lovers. Notwithstanding young audiences should be discouraged.<br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Man on Fire, with actor Denzel Washington playing "a burned-out ex-CIA operative/assassin," is surprisingly good.  Not that I wouldn't or shouldn't expect that level of performance from Washington, but that this was a good role for him, and he performs well.  This certainly would not have been a role for  Sylvester Stallone or Vin Diesel! In Man on Fire, a related series of kidnappings in Mexico City leads everybody who can afford it to hire a bodyguard.  Washington plays John Creasy, a bodyguard to nine-year old Pita Ramos.  As you might expect, Pita is kidnapped, and there is the movie.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent, the directing intentionally choppy at times for (great) effect, and the plot makes sense, from the quid pro quo relationship of the top cop with the top reporter to how Creasy is so comfortable about weapons.<br /><br />My two complaints?  I have no knowledge of the adventures of Creasy before he shows up on the scene.  The director teases the viewer with this!  Also, the actor playing industrialist Samuel Ramos seems miscast here... too young looking, too immature, and too much time hanging around at home.<br /><br />Rated R for violence.  The bad guys get what's coming to them.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Tony Scott is a genius. He makes the movie just as good as the theatrical trailer for the movie. Denzel plays a bodygruard chosen to protect a little girl of a rich political man. But when she gets kidnapped, and rumored to be dead, it's time for him to start asking some questions . . .the hard way. This is a story about no mercy. It's a story about the hard truth: That vengence only gets worse if your try and fight it.<br /><br />I don't think anybody could have put it better than Christopher walken: "This man is an artist. A killer. He's about to paint his masterpeice."</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>Denzel is certainly on fire here.  The movie starts out pretty slow, and then the director figures out he's driving a Ferrari and really pushes it's limits.  Denzel does not hold back in this movie.  Storyline-watch and find out, it's not a great storyline, but it's always changing.  One minute you think you know what is going on, the next you jaw has been dropped.  Then you keep watching to find out what Denzel's gonna do, but we shouldn't have to guess, he's gonan go off on everybody that gets in his way.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys!<br /><br />Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there, "Man on Fire" is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.<br /><br />Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, a former CIA assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed.  So far, he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either.  As the movie opens, Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well-to-do, possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community.  Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety.  The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge, Pita, a sweet little girl who, slowly but surely, works her way into Creasy's initially hardened heart and affections.  The last two-thirds of the film turns into an Avenging Angel melodrama, as Creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.<br /><br />Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell, "Man on Fire," astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter.  It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people.  These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative.  Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie.  Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.<br /><br />Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually.  In addition to the two leads, there are solid performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini.  But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.<br /><br />"Man on Fire" would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time, but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>Man on Fire is an entertaining action flick starring Denzel Washington in the lead role as John Creasy- a former CIA employee who has been hired to act as the bodyguard for a young girl in Mexico City. The city has seen an increase in kidnappings and Washington's character has been hired by the parents of the little girl to keep her out of harm's way.<br /><br />This movie offers some good suspense and a plot that is less predictable than other films, making it more entertaining to watch. It seems like a large number of Hollywood films as of late offer plots that can be predicted in the first ten or fifteen minutes. With Man on Fire, you find yourself predicting the outcome but not really knowing what will happen until the end.<br /><br />One thing about this movie that might turn off some viewers is the level of violence. There are some gruesome, bloody scenes depicted in this movie and the director definitely pushes the limits of censorship on more than one occasion. The movie received an "R" rating, but this could have easily been changed to "NR", "NC-17" or some other rating with a little more visible violence. To keep the rating down to "R", the director wisely decided to keep the violence on screen from crossing the threshold that would have changed it. You know what is going on, but in many cases you cannot see the violence directly.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is the main star of this film and his performance is excellent, like always. He is tough, mostly cool, and most certainly a seeker of justice who shows no remorse for hurting someone who he feels deserves it. His supporting cast, which includes the likes of Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, and others, is only mediocre and they come across as only semi- believable. Young Dakota Fanning- the girl who Denzel is hired to protect- is the only person in the supporting cast who performs above average.<br /><br />Man on Fire is worth a look, and it will appeal mostly to those who like suspenseful drama. The violence can get a little carried away at times and some of it will shock the average viewer. But this movie is a good one with an unpredictable plot that keeps you guessing all the way to the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>This is a really good movie.  Even though its very slow paced.  Its still worth the 2 hours and 26 minutes.  Theres alot of action in this movie.  It is also a touching story between Creasy and Pita.  Very powerful and very touching.  Powerful performances by Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, and Dakota Fanning.  Radha Mitchell is hot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Man on Fire had an interesting plot, with Denzel playing a burn-out "professional soldier" with no direction and emotions.After establishing a relationship as a bodyguard (a position new and way beneath his training) for a young child, he begins to open up and distinguish emotions and feelings. Only after this child's kidnapping and Denzel being critically injured, as well as his belief the child has been killed, does he seek out and administer retribution.Overall, an excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>I rented this DVD because I think Denzel Washington is worth seeing in anything. I thought I was in for a standard, well done, Hollywood action picture with a slightly shopworn premise. After about 30 minutes, I had high hopes for something more. By the closing credits I knew I had seen a great picture, many cuts about the average.<br /><br />The basic plot has a more-than-slightly burned out ex-agent (Washington) hired to protect the daughter of a wealthy businessman during a wave of child kidnappings in Mexico City. Despite the initial coldness of the agent, he develops an emotional attachment to his "client." This basic outline has more than a little moss on it (The Bodyguard, The Transporter, The Professional) and the results have been mixed at best. The nature of the story lends itself to the sort of generic sap that Hollywood producers settle for to please the widest audience possible. Man on Fire, for several reasons, seems almost like a new species of action film. There is an edge to it that I haven't seen in a mainstream film in a long time.<br /><br />Director Tony Scott has produced a dark, taut film that is almost skeletal in its hardness. The images come at a breakneck pace, and not one of them seems clich&eacute;d or standard. The scenes and shot selection seem almost random, until you realize that the overall effect has been one of great power. The director has chosen a somber tone, completely unromantic, and it fits the story beautifully.<br /><br />The writing is excellent throughout. No long speeches, no fluff, and everything sounds painfully true to life. I never had the feeling of any of the actors laboring with a line, or delivering a painful "clinker," where it's clear a writer somewhere was patting themselves on the back for a line that is impossible to deliver without posing.<br /><br />The real triumph of the film, though, is the acting of Denzel Washington. This guy just gets better and better. How many films have you seen where the main character was supposed to be "burned out" but in fact looked, well, like a Hollywood actor - young, well fed, and at worst maybe a little artfully sullen? Think Tom Cruise trying to act like a world-weary ex-soldier in The Last Samurai. Well, Denzel Washington looked truly burnt, both physically and spiritually. He seemed really to be a slightly jittery, slightly ragged shell of a man. In short, he creates a character of great depth, and every move is believable. Importantly, when the movie turned to violence, his character was without the politically correct "misgivings" so many action film leads suffer with, and his attachment to his client was developed beautifully and completely believable.<br /><br />I bought this DVD the day after renting it and plan to watch it again when it is delivered. This is one that will stand the test of time, as well as many repeat viewings. -Mykal Banta</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>This isn't the first bodyguard movie, but it is certainly a good one. Denzel Washington is great playing a moody ex-CIA assassin that becomes a bodygurad for a wealthy Mexicans little girl. Pita played by Dakota Fanning is wonderful as that little girl. Denzel teaches her how to win in a swimming competition and she changes his life. Lots of character development here with some intense action especially three quarters of the way into the movie. Fans of Washington won't want to miss this one. Fans of movies like "Proof of Life", "The Bodyguard", "Eraser" or the Tom Clancy books/movies should like it. All the support cast is excellent and the side stories of their lifes added to the overall entertainment. I was surprised to see the dedication to the main character at the end. Apparently it is loosely based on a true story. This movie is gritty and sometimes hard and bloody. It should not be viewed by small children.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Denzel does a great job playing a former government agent assigned to protect a little girl from kidnapping in Mexico City.  When he is assigned he is ready to kill himself.  He and the little girl develop a type of father/child relationship that is so strong that it gives him reason to live.  When the girl is actually kidnapped, Denzel goes on a rampage against anyone that was involved, meting out vigilante justice.<br /><br />Some scenes may be a little graphically violent and the actual kidnapping scene is a heartbreaker, but it is a story that it is one of those rare action films that has its heartwarming scenes too!  Christopher Walken is pretty good as Denzel's friend and look for Marc Anthony as the little girl's father.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Denzel plays a man with a very checkered past.

But when he accepts a job as a bodyguard for a nine-year-old girl, a little bit of light begins to shine in his life. Of course it doesn't last long. Kidnappers are determined to us the girl to gain a ransom.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is a fantastic actor, and in this movie he once again proves how good he is.  This was a tough role to play. He had to do a lot of non-speaking acting in this one - often portraying anguish, edge-of-happiness, and genuine fear of where he may be heading in his life, over and over again.  He pulled it off every time.<br /><br />I enjoyed the entire cast in this movie, and I believe Brian Helgeland did an excellent job on the screenplay.  The film flows really well, reminding me of a documentary - director Tony Scott is amazing at what he does.<br /><br />I have heard some critics say this movie is too violent.  I say no way!  Heck, it had Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken as cast members, and they never killed anyone - that's a non-violent film for those guys!<br /><br />Dakota Fanning performs magnificently as the girl Denzel's character is asked to protect.  She has a great future in Hollywood - of this I'm sure.<br /><br />All in all, this movie delivers what any good movie should - a good plot, excellent acting, great visuals and one-liners, and characters you begin to care about.<br /><br />Get this movie!

And yet, "Man on Fire" definitely has visceral punch and emotional impact.<br />In a ferocious and fascinating performance, Denzel Washington (Creasy) plays a wounded, sad, conflicted man with a suspect history who is hired to bodyguard the young daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a wealthy Mexico City couple (Mark Anthony and Radha Mitchell).<br />We have not seen a Denzel quite like this before, even though some of  his "Training Day" stuff remains. This is an older, bloated from liquor Denzel: a man who's external<br />body is a physical manifestation of his battle-torn, wounded psychological make-up.<br />We are in the redemptive powers of Love arena here: there is no mistaking Scott's message. All the snazzy visuals cannot hide the fact that "Man on Fire" is a big muscle bound jock of a movie with a big, bloody, sincere and caring heart deep at its center.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>STORY: Ex-Assassin John Creasy is looking for a place to start over.  His friend played by Christopher Walken helps him out by hooking him up as a body guard.  The film takes place in Mexico City where kidnaping has become a profession.  The first half of the movie is spent on the connection of the relationship between Creasy and Pita, a little girl.  I have to admit here that I thought this movie was gonna blow, but then I remembered that I was seeing a Scott film.  And even though Ridley and Tony differ in style they are very similar in some ways.  I wasn't expecting anything to analyze in this film, but there was plenty.  Once the kidnaping takes place and Pita is announced dead we see the once loving John Creasy take a transformation into what he was in his past.  Pita unlocked what was previously locked within him, and that was the John Creasy that isn't a ruthless killer.  As usual when you walk into a Tony Scott film you have some expectations, and they are all there.  His trademark "stop and go" (as I like to call it) camera shots that flitter in different shades of light and dark, and then Harry Gregson-Williams.  I tell you, Harry and Tony seem meant for each other.  Harry's music accompanies Tony's vision so perfectly, and you can see that similarly in Spy Game.  The only thing lacking here is the "believability".  For me I did see the connection that Creasy and Pita had but as I was watching I really didn't see how she was able to make that much of an impact on him that it caused him to kill everybody who took place in her death.  The ending for me was my favorite part, it connects to several other parts of the film, mostly lines said by Creasy, and I won't say anything else that may spoil It for you.  The movie also has some pretty graphic violence but it's done in a way where you don't see much and that allows for your mind to create the graphic image.  The movie is long but it needs to be that way, and for me it was not boring at all.  I never once detracted from the film and started criticizing the film in my head, I was with it all the way through.<p>ACTING: The acting, along with Tony's directing are what makes the movie so powerful.  Denzel Washington played this role perfectly and I really couldn't see anybody else in the role.  Christopher Walken was fantastic as well and finally we get to see him back in a serious role rather than comedic like Joe Dirt, The Rundown, and the recent Envy.  Mickey Rourke plays his typecast role, but he does it good.  Even Marc Anthony (yes, the singer) is good as Pita's father, and let's not forget Dakota Fanning as Pita.  The little child actress did a phenomenal job in my opinion and her acting did not feel forced or rehearsed like most child actors, it was truly genuine.<p>BOTTOM LINE: The overall structure of the plot lacks the emotional connection that's supposed to be there, but the superb acting seems to fill it in fictitiously rather than authentically that works out for the overall effect.  Tony Scott has a distinct style that differs tone wise from his brother but there are similarities.  Man on Fire while isn't a masterpiece, is an emotional evoking film that is both poignant and thrilling at the same time.  For some, that weak emotional connection may be the factor that kills the movie for you and will result in you not liking it, but if you put that aside and allow the well-crafted visuals of the movie to do their job then you'll find the experience well worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I do not understand why you would pay out big bucks to have Denzel Washington do your movie, give him a decent script, and then explore the postmodernist notion of hyper-reality with the way the film is shot and edited, but that is what director Tony Scott ends up doing with "Man on Fire."  We are talking bleaching out the film, jump cuts, smash cuts, shaky hand held shots, and pretty much every bag in the trick.  Take all those away and you would find one of Washington's better performances and you can still see it, but you have to get past the visual garbage.<br /><br />Washington plays Creasy, a former C.I.A. assassin who drinks because he cannot find forgiveness for his past sins.  He shows up in Mexico to see Rayburn (Christopher Walken), an old military buddy, who agrees with the idea that God will never forgive them for what they have done, and who gets him a gig as a bodyguard.  It seems that south of the border there is one kidnapping an hour by gangsters seeking to extort money.  We are given a graphic example of how the practice works at the start of the movie and told that 70% of kidnapped victims are killed.  Because he has a drinking problem Creasy is available at a cut rate, but his anti-terrorism experience makes him a good value.<br /><br />The body Creasy is guarding belongs to young Pita (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of Samuel (Marc Anthony) and his American bride Lisa (Radha Mitchell), which explains the little blonde girl with a Mexican name.  She is cute and smart (it is Dakota Fanning; what were you expecting?), and insists on forming a friendship with her bodyguard.  Creasy resists, primarily for the practical concerns of being better able to protect her if they are not chatting about everything under the sun while he is driving her to and from school or piano lessons.  But she wears him down and he clearly becomes a father figure her, using his Marine Corps experience to teach her how to get off to a good start in her swimming races and suggesting a way of getting out of future piano lessons.  Of course, she is kidnapped just as their bond is strongest, mainly because she refuses to leave her friend behind when he is being shot to pieces in a gunfight.<br /><br />The kidnappers make two mistakes.  The first and most obvious one is that they do not kill Creasy, because he vows to kill all of them.  The second is that the kidnappers never change the license plate on one of their cars.  Creasy and Pita see it tailing them earlier in the film and it appears again during the kidnapping.  My first thought was that they were stupid and did not understand how to be smart about such things.  But then I thought that maybe there was an element of arrogance to their actions.  After all, they have some of the judicial police in their pockets and to these thugs this is just another day at the office.  That is it was until they took Pita away from Creasy.<br /><br />Creasy displays a ruthless efficiency as he tracks down "the Voice," the man who gave the ransom instructions over the phone and is behind Pita's kidnapping.  His interrogation technique will make you grateful for the excesses of stylistic editing but each one does get him closer and closer to his goal.  Creasy has a newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) and an honest police official (Giancarlo Giannini) providing help in connecting the dots and getting him closer to his target.  As Rayburn tells the cop: "A man can be an artist in anything...Ceasey's art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece. Stay out of his way."  Unfortunately besides that burst of eloquence Rayburn tends to lay it on a bit thick, declaring Creasy will "deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals" and the grand overstatement "Creasy's gonna make them wish they hadn't touched one hair on her head."<br /><br />One thing I liked about "Man on Fire" was that when Creasy leaves the hospital to go track down the kidnappers he is still recovering from his wounds, which keep bleeding throughout the last act of the film.  I also liked that while the thought of Pita would stay his hand from killing one particular person, he was still able to ensure that person died as they deserved.  Those who are expecting this film to have a happy ending are going to have to rethink what a happy ending might be under the circumstances here.  Even with all of the bangs in this one the film is going to end with more of a whimper.  The idea of finding redemption through a blood bath mind seem strange, but Washington's powerful performance carries the logic of the film, even thought the director's bag of tricks often gets in the way.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>My Bargain-rack movie for last night was "Man On Fire" starring Denzel Washington. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was quite a good movie, but not for the squeamish. The movie came in two very different parts. The first part was a relatively quiet introduction in which a burned-out ex-CIA agent (Washington) was hired to be the bodyguard of a charming little girl (Dakota Fanning). The locale was Juarez, Mexico, and there had been problems with kidnappers. The first part introduced the family, Washington and his contacts, the city and the Mexican environment where all of this took place. This first part was rather charming and low keyed.<br /><br />The introduction ended abruptly with the kidnapping of the little girl under watch in a bloody gun fight in which Washington was badly wounded. A demand for a pile of money was made in exchange for the girl's safe return. Well, that was a major mistake on the part of the perpetrators. When Washington recovered from his gunshot wounds, he turned into one tough hombre who would make Clint Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" episodes look like a children's Sunday-school picnic. Ruthless? Oh, yeah. Police procedures were out the window. Washington tracked down the kidnappers one by one and their arrest, trial, sentencing and punishment were carried out right there on the spot. You may find it difficult to watch. In any case, almost everyone was corrupt in one way or another, even the little girl's father, but the sweet little girl was safely returned to her mother, sadder but wiser.<br /><br />The movie is well acted and directed. The action of the second half is brisk and very violent. There's no boredom with this story, trust me.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>"Man On Fire" is an intense action thriller that takes you through hell and back.  This is not a "happy" movie, and it's not pretty.  It's extremely violent at times and the storyline is a reflection of a parent's worst nightmare--the kidnapping and possible murder of their child.  While it can be over-stylish at times with fancy editing and camera work, it proves to be a more than effective thriller.<br /><br />John Creasy used to work for the CIA, but now he's an alcoholic who doesn't think there's much to live for.  This is due to the terrible things he has done in his line of work (we never know exactly what he did, but there are more than enough hints).  Starting a new life in Mexico, his best friend finds him a job as a bodyguard to a nine-year-old girl since the family is worried about all of the kidnappings that have taken place in Mexico.  The girl, Pita, takes a liking to Creasy right away, but he doesn't allow her in and treats her as nothing more than a job.  Amazingly, he starts to get attached to Pita and finds a new reason to live.  Not only is he her bodyguard, but he is almost like a second father to her.<br /><br />Things drastically change when Pita gets kidnapped.  Creasy does his best to take out the kidnappers when it happens, but is outnumbered and has been shot multiple times.  While recovering in the hospital, he learns that the ransom for little Pita has gone sour and that her captors have most likely executed her.  This sets off a rage inside Creasy like he has never experienced before.  He checks himself out of the hospital and wages his own war against everybody who was involved in the kidnapping/murder of Pita.  And he vows to kill every single one of them.<br /><br />Tony Scott directs this intense and emotional thriller.  He does a great job with the material and he knows how to get the performances that he wants from his actors.  My complaint is that he goes a little overboard with the fancy camera work and editing at times, but that is something that can be overlooked.  Denzel Washington gives one of his most powerful performances since "Training Day."  He really makes you feel for his character, and his absolute hatred towards the people involved with the horrible kidnapping is done in an extremely realistic and convincing way.  Dakota Fanning does a great job in her role of "Pita" and does well by playing opposite of Denzel.  And, we cannot forget the great Christopher Walken who also does a superb job on his part.  He plays it perfectly and does not try to steal any scenes from Washington.<br /><br />It must be said, this is a vicious movie.  It's not for people with weak stomachs.  There is one scene in particular that makes the ear-cutting scene in "Reservoir Dogs" look like absolutely nothing.  Denzel's  character doesn't only want to murder the bad guys... he wants to make them suffer in the most horrific ways, and he does that many times.  It's not a happy or cute movie.  It will disgust a lot of people, so it's not for everyone.  Make sure you keep that in mind if you decide to rent this.  Other than the option to watch the movie in DTS and two commentary tracks, the DVD has no special features.  It looks and sounds great.  It would've been nice if they did more with the DVD in the special features department, though.<br /><br />"Man On Fire" is a powerful and unforgiving thrill ride that will keep your heart pumping and your forehead sweating.  Other than some of the flashy and fast editing/camera work, the movie really works.  Again, this is not for anybody with weak stomachs.  It is very disturbing and unsettling.  If you're looking for a powerful thriller with a lot of "bang" and real emotion, then this is something to check out.  As dark and brutal as this movie is, I really enjoyed watching this. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>This is a dark, clever and very surreal kind of movie.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I got the chance to see a preview of it at a UK movie theatre this week.<br /><br />It starts off as it means to go on, with the kidnapping of a teenage boy, his torture by his kidnappers, the payment of the ransom by his family and his release, a broken shell of the happy go lucky youth he used to be.<br /><br />It is after this introduction we meet Creasy, played to perfection by the actor Denzel Washington.  He is the tormented killer-come-bodyguard who is slowly drinking himself to death, a man who has forgotten how to live for as his friend Rayburn, the glorious Christopher Walken points out to a Police Officer, "Creasy is a man who has made an art out of killing..."<br /><br />Dakota Fanning gives an excellent performance as Pita, the half Mexican, half American child who gets under Creasy's skin and into his heart and teaches him that it is okay to care and love another person.<br /><br />When Pita is kidnapped and then murdered (or so Creasy thinks), a rage is born inside of Creasy that will only be quenched by the total annihilation of all those involved in her abduction.<br /><br />With the help of a crusading reporter Mariana, the wonderful Rachel Ticotin and the cynical Manzano, a delicious Giancarlo Giannini, Creasy sets about enacting his vow and he does it in style!<br /><br />This is not violence for the sake of violence, and though there is plenty of blood and guts flying, what surprised me was how well it was done!  I am really quite squeamish and though there were a couple of times when I went, "OH YUCK" it certainly wasn't as bad I expected it to be and it fitted in TOTALLY with the plot.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke plays the charming but sleazy lawyer Jordan and I was most impressed by Radha Mitchell who played Lisa, Pitas' mother, she reminded me of Tea Leoni, but with more class whilst Marc Anthony gives a solid performance as Sammy, Pita's weak but loving father and last but not least, Angelina Pel&aacute;ez who only has a bit part as the nun Sister Anna but who is able to see in to Creasy's soul and know he is a fallen angel.<br /><br />"Man on Fire" is not an easy film to get your head around, the plot is quite complex, the cinematography is utterly surreal in parts, flickering in an out as we are treated to images both real and imagined and in the background there is the ever menacing present of corrupt public officials and a man know only as the "The voice" who has kept Mexico in thrall with his constant murderous kidnappings for profit.<br /><br />The director Tony Scott has done a great job; I love this film with all its twists and turns, its many complex characters, the good but tormented soul, (Creasy), the innocent (the child Pita) the bad, (Fuentes a corrupt cop) the ugly (Manzano the good cop), the weak (Sammy Pita's father), the sleaze ball (Jordan the lawyer) the beautiful, (Mariana the crusading reporter), the tragic (Lisa, Pita's mother), the stupid, (Bruno the rather stupid Rave Master) and the downright evil (the Voice).<br /><br />The film score is also a crackingly good example of how you can put music in a film and make it part of the whole visual experience.<br /><br />In fact the music was SO good in my opinion I am breaking one of my rules, I'm buying the CD! I only do buy a soundtrack when I really LOVE the music; this is one of those rare occasions!<br /><br />The whole film is quality on celluloid, and all the actors/actresses are perfect to the parts.<br /><br />A film worthy of many Oscar nominations in my humble opinion but then quality has never been an Oscar trademark so I am not holding my breath in that department!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Man on Fire is the film The Punisher should've been. Raw and unflinching, it's a gripping story of revenge that doesn't pull any punches - anchored by an electrifying performance from Denzel Washington. Director Tony Scott - never one to shy away from cinematic pyrotechnics - is particularly hyperactive here, pummeling us with rapid cuts and various other Oliver Stone-esque camera tricks. But Scott's short attention span serves the story well, giving the film a slightly off-kilter feel (and effectively mirroring Washington's character's state of mind).<br /><br />The film's setup is straight-forward and direct, with Washington playing John Creasy - an ex-mercenary hired to protect the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. Obviously, something goes wrong at a certain point, and Creasy finds himself forced to revive his long-since dormant military training for revenge purposes. Supporting roles are filled by reliable character actors including Christopher Walken (playing a longtime friend of Creasy's) and Mickey Rourke (as a sleazy lawyer, a character he inhabits with ease).<br /><br />About the only negative thing one can say about Man On Fire - aside from the overlong running time, which doesn't feel terribly oppressive - is that it takes a really long time to get used to Scott's over-the-top directorial decisions (if at all). Certain plot points are somewhat obvious (ie Creasy's relationship with the girl goes from purely business to father figure awfully fast), but such things are expected out of a movie like this. What really matters is whether or not we believe Creasy's attachment to Pita (Dakota Fanning), the girl, and there's no denying that the film excels in that regard. Brian Helgeland's screenplay allows for an unusual amount of character development - it's around an hour before anything sinister happens - which gives us ample time to watch the two characters interact with each other.<br /><br />But when the bad stuff does go down, Creasy's sudden change from cuddly teddy bear to violent man-with-a-mission is completely believable. Like Payback, another Helgeland scripted story, Man on Fire proves to be surprisingly brutal when it comes to onscreen violence. And because we're just as angry as Creasy, it's hard not to root for the man - even when he's stuffing bombs up the rear ends of perpetrators. The single-mindedness of Washington's character propels the story forward, even though the plot essentially vanishes somewhere around the one-hour mark; once the movie becomes about revenge, that's literally all it's about. There's some stuff about police corruption and a journalist that provides Creasy with info, but really, the film devotes itself to Creasy's quest.<br /><br />Man on Fire is entering a marketplace that's crowded with similar films - ie The Punisher, Walking Tall, and Kill Bill: Volume 2 - and though it's not quite up there with the latter, it's surely far better than the former two titles. Washington convincingly sheds his nice guy image to become this gritty character (a character that's far less charismatic than Alonzo Harris, his Training Day persona), delivering a performance that's far different from anything he's done before. It's a film that will likely turn off a lot of viewers - primarily because of Scott's direction and the unforgiving nature of the story - but for those willing to stick with it, Man on Fire is one of the more intelligent and compelling thrillers to come around in a while.<br /><br />4.5 outta' 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>American audiences love their Silver Screen heroes that wreak vengeance on the Bad Guys. In MAN ON FIRE, Denzel Washington makes Stallone's Rambo and Eastwood's Dirty Harry look like altar boys. I don't recall either of the latter two lopping off fingers.<p>Washington is Creasy, who, haunted by his past as a counter-insurgency assassin employed by the U.S. government, drinks to excess and contemplates suicide. On a social call to a pal from the old days, Rayburn (Christopher Walken), Creasy rhetorically asks, &quot;Do you think God will forgive us for what we've done?&quot; Rayburn, now living the good life in Juarez, Mexico, would like to see Creasy pull out of his self-destructive funk. So, he puts his friend in touch with Mexican businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), who lives with his American wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) and daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City, where kidnapping offspring of the rich and famous is a growth industry. Samuel and Lisa are in the market for a new bodyguard for their daughter.<p>Creasy, of course, takes the job. At first, he rebuffs the overtures of young Pita, who's an only child in need of a new friend. Slowly, though, he falls under her thrall. Indeed, Pita's innocence and youthful zest for life make Creasy want to live again. So, after she's ultimately kidnapped in a bloody street shootout (that leaves her protector gravely wounded) and ostensibly killed after a ransom attempt gone awry, Creasy vows apocalyptic revenge against all those involved in her abduction. And Rayburn, with his useful contacts, supplies enough firepower to single-handedly topple another Third World despot.<p>MAN ON FIRE has been criticized because Washington, one of Hollywood's finest dramatic actors, supposedly deserves a better role than that of a formula action/special FX Neanderthal. The point seems to be missed that Denzel brings to Creasy's persona a depth of character, albeit an emotionally and psychologically tortured one, rarely seen in the lantern-jawed superheroes of screen legend. Indeed, Denzel's performance is eminently watchable, as is that of each of the major players in the production. Dakota Fanning, at age 10, is incorrigibly engaging as the kid who wins the Tough Guy's heart. Mitchell, whom I've not seen before, is completely convincing as the gorgeous Mom who holds her child dearer than anything. And how about that Christopher Walken, huh? Here, soon after THE RUNDOWN, we have another notable supporting performance.<p>In my mind, the film falls short on two minor points. First, it wasn't clear what happened to Samuel's lawyer - poor scripting or bad editing, perhaps. Second, the casting director apparently bent over backwards to make the Ramos family appeal to WASP audiences. I mean, why not Salma Hayek and some adorable Latino girl instead of the Nordic blonde Lisa and the precocious Pita (who had all the Latino attributes of Shirley Temple in her Cute Phase)? And, as an aside, Mexico City desperately needs a PR makeover after MAN ON FIRE dwells on its police corruption and slums - I wouldn't now go there on a bet.<p>MAN ON FIRE is a violent and gritty shoot-'em-up that transcends most of the genre because of Denzel presence. Four and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>I was not planning on seeing "Man on Fire," but after reading the reviews for it, I decided to go check it out. I was pleased with the outcome. The movie was sad, action-packed, always interesting, and greatly acted. The film stars Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Dakota Fanning, and Radha Mitchell. In brief, "Man on Fire" is about a man who is the bodyguard of a young girl, and when she is kidnapped, he will stop at nothing to get her back, and find the people who did it, and kill them. But it is much more than that. It is a look at the affect that people could have on others, and a look at corruption, greed, and other things that could kill a man's spirit. At a running time of 146 minutes, "Man on Fire" is an epic look into what a man would do to save another person.<p>Denzel Washington plays John Creasy. He has just been hired to be the bodyguard to young Pita, the daughter of Samuel and Lisa Ramos, after his friend Rayburn convinced them to interview him for the job. Creasy has a drinking problem, and he tells this to Samuel before getting the job. Pita thinks that Creasy is a friend, a point that he tells her after too much friendly talk. The two eventually bond when she asks for help from him for her swimming races. Then, a problem occurs. While waiting for her to finish her piano lession, corrupt Mexican cops, and other people come and kidnap her, wounding Creasy, and leaving him under arrest for the murder of two cops. Mexican investigator Miguel Manzano knows that Creasy did not kill the cops, and with the help of him and news reporter Mariana, Creasy goes off to find revenge on the people who kidnapped Pita, and who is now reported dead.<p>"Man on Fire" is not a great film, but it is very entertaining and includes some powerful preformances. Denzel Washington should be nominated for an Oscar from his preformance as John Creasy, and in some scenes young Dakota Fanning steals some of the scenes from him. In reguard to the twist at the end, I did not see anything coming. It is an epic that does not actually feel long. I would see "Man on Fire" again, but I don't recommend it to all. There is some gritty, dark violence, but that is not a problem. The problem is the way the film is shot. It is always moving around, and that got a little annoying at some times. Otherwise, this was a really good film.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for language and strong violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Academy Award winner Denzel Washington (Training Day) is the last man who you don't want to cross in the striking thriller "Man on Fire". In Mexico City, former CIA assassin John Creasy (Washington) is hired by a wealthy Mexican businessman (Marc Anthony) to protect his daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). As Creasy forms a close friendship with the child, she helps him recover some of his humanity. When Pita is kidnapped and her ransom attempt goes wrong, Creasy resorts to brutal methods to punish those responsible for the kidnapping. "Man on Fire" is a gripping thriller from director Tony Scott (Crimson Tide & Enemy of the State). Despite the film's lengthy running time, the storyline holds out well and features some good twists. There are some pretty good action sequences and intense scenes of Washington's character torturing criminals to uncover the truth behind the kidnapping. Denzel Washington's top-notch performance is the film's biggest highlight. "Man on Fire" also stars Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken.<br /><br />Like many previous Blu-Ray releases from Twentieth Century Fox, "Man on Fire" falls short. The 2004 thriller is presented in a fine 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Despite the presence of grain in some scenes, the video transfer offers rich natural colors, great detail and notable resolution. The DTS-HD audio is dynamic with some good surround effects. Unfortunately, the only extras in this Blu-Ray are the theatrical trailers for "Man on Fire" and other Twentieth Century Fox releases. If you're looking for special features, the 2-disc Collector Edition DVD is a better choice. Overall, "Man on Fire" gets a "B-".</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>To my surprise, Tony Scott's remake of Man On Fire isn't the war crime I was expecting by a long shot. Horribly over-directed in places, true, but nowhere near as irritating as Domino, which is the closest ADDS filmmaking has come to projectile vomiting at the audience to date. It helps that Scott has a decent script and a good cast to keep his worst excesses in check, and it has to be said that some of the stylistic touches (such as the very active subtitling) are really pretty good. He's better at framing the surrounding scenes than some of the big moments, which are fairly tension and adrenaline-free for all their imagination, but he's prepared to get his hands far dirtier than you'd expect from a mainstream studio picture, and he even manages a couple of moments of emotional resonance as well. It's certainly much better than the dire original, which only had a good John Scott score (part of which turned up in Die Hard) going for it (aside from the film's change of location from Italy to Mexico, the song has changed from Someone to Watch Over Me - well, Ridley beat him to that one - to Linda Ronstadt's infinitely less relevant cover of Blue Bayou). Good to see Christopher Walken in a good guy role again, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Dakota Fanning is well overdue for an oscar nomination.  She is extremly gifted and this movie showcases that.  I just watched this last night for the second time since my wife had yet to see it and I was stunned for the second time at how well she carries herself in a film.  The story revolves around John Creasy (Washington) who had a troubled past and is now trying to find redemption.  His best friend Roy (Walken, who is great as usual) finds him a job as a bodyguard for young Pita (Fanning).  Her father (Marc Anthony, who in my opinion should never be seen) is a man with many secrets, but none of which I will tell you.  So, when his Incurence Agent Jorden (Rourke) suggest he get a bodyguard for the family he chooses Creasy becasue although he may be good, he's a drunk and so he's cheap.  At first Creasy is cold, distant even towards Pita, but they soon form a very close friendship and that is slashed to pieces when Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is hospitalized.  While Creasy is under there is a deal made that goes sour and Creasy is informed that young Pita is now dead.  He is determined to bring vengence (death) to all those who were involved, who profited from and or who knew about the kidnapping.  This film is intense, dramatic and one edge of your seat ride that is thuroughly enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>There have been several revenge films made in the past such as Death Wish (1974), Kill Bill (2003), and Punisher (2004).  These films have been of various quality, and in Man on Fire the audience can experience another journey down the Avenger Lane.  However, the director Tony Scott provides a new angle on the revenge theme through guilt and alcoholism as it will go full circle through the life of Creasy (Denzel Washington).  Denzel Washington gives a strong performance as he depicts the initial lost soul to the changed man who found life again in order to return to his former self, a ruthless killer.<br /><br />The burden of a man lies upon him in the light in which he sees himself, or at least that is how one could perceives Creasy, a former Special Forces operative.  Creasy is heavily burdened by himself as he reflects upon his past and the things he has done, which he tries to drown in the haze of alcoholic slumber and forgetfulness.  However, reality always returns to Creasy as he slowly resurfaces from the dark depths where he tries to hide his consciousness.  The answer to Creasy's painful memories is to once again fill his belly with Jack Daniels and let the alcohol perform magic on his awareness.  Creasy maintains this alcoholic haze as he travels by cab from United States to Mexico to visit his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), which may be a call for help.<br /><br />Rayburn is a caring person that lives like a king in Mexico, but it pains him to see Creasy in an internal misery.  In order to help Creasy Rayburn gets him a job as a bodyguard for girl in a rich family in Mexico City where there are at least four kidnappings per day.  Creasy's subject is a clever and perceptive young girl by the name Pita (Dakota Fanning), who immediately discovers that she likes him.  When Creasy begins to work there is at tension between him and Pita, as she wants to befriend him and he wants to only do his job.  This is the beginning for a long and detailed character development, which leads Creasy into again finding a purpose in life as he protects Pita.<br /><br />The day comes when someone tries to kidnap her, as most viewers probably can predict, and Creasy will seek his revenge upon those who are involved in the kidnapping.  Creasy becomes the avenging angel that slays those responsible for the kidnapping and it seems as if he seeks redemption from the pain that he is experiencing.  This leads the viewer into a long series of action packed sequences that contain some gruesome scenes as Creasy methodically seeks the guilty people.<br /><br />Scott applies quick jump-cuts to the film in a way which has been seen in film such as Infernal Affairs (2002) and City of God (2003).  The method of using the quick jump-cut induces stress, which elevates the suspense in the film.  The jump-cuts are fused together with grainy photography, which is suppose to provide an authentic experience, much like documentaries, which together provokes further tension between characters in the story.<br /><br />Man on Fire is a troubling story about vengeance where the audience will experience relief when justice has been served by Creasy.  Yet, vengeance functions as a doubled edged sword hurting Creasy as he returns to his former ways, which drove him into deep feelings of guilt and grave alcoholism to begin with.  This notion should be pondered as he systematically progresses through Mexico City's corrupt elements and assassinates those involved in the kidnapping.  There are some interesting scenes that support this idea when Denzel Washington swims in a pool between the killings, as if he was purging himself of what he has done.  However, it seems as if he could not get himself rid of the blood as the blood continues to return.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Thirty some years ago the films "Dirty Harry" and "Death Wish" were released to the public causing debate about the films' advocating maverick policemen and vigilanteism.  Now comes "Man on Fire", a film that received less fanfare but generally dismissed by the critics for it's brutality.  This film is enigmatic because it prescribes to the serious issue of kidnapping in Latin America that the solution is brutal vigilanteism.  On the flip side, this film is so well crafted and entertaining that ultimately you just dimiss such concerns and say it's only a movie.  Director Tony Scott surehandedly directs this film from a script by Brian Helgeland("L.A. Confidential").  The film's best moments come at the beginning as the relationship unfolds between ex-CIA [...] John Creasy(Denzel Wasington) and the child he his hired to guard, Pita Sanchez(Dakota Fanning).  Washington also does a good job at showing a man whose demons are enveloping him.  It's in the film's second half when Creasy ferrets out the child's kidnappers that you take pause.  It's the methods that border on the sadistic that make you jump back.  But the film does overcome these excesses through the strength of the story and the acting.  There is a strong supporting cast here with Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, and Giancarlo Giannini.  I would like to note especially the fine work of Radha Mitchell who plays the girl's mother.  She can be seen in fine form as J.M. Barrie's wife in the recently released "Finding Neverland".</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington plays a man who is hired to protect the daughter of a wealthy man in Mexico City.  Kidnappings are out of control in this area and most people with money find it necessary to hire a body guard for their children.  Washington admits to being an alcoholic and has an unhappy past which is never really explained, but which seems to have brought him to a place in life where he is a true loner.  The relationship between him and the little girl he is guarding is the focal point of the movie.  He at first resists her attempts at friendship, but eventually her sweet and matter-of-fact attitude win him over.  The sweetness of the relationship is juxtaposed with some over-the-top violence, and the blood lust of revenge which Washington exacts on anyone he feels has harmed the little girl.  This is a tense and emotional drama which shows Washington's acting skills at their best.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Tony Scott at last signed his name in the great list of the film noir titles with this work . The script meticulously depicted , is around a looser , and alcoholic ex agent who is hired to keep on safe a charming and clever child - Dakota Fanning - . With a magistral employement of cinema verite style Scott makes a triple journey in this picture : The growing and affective relationship between the bodyguard and the child ; the sordid and corrupt world of the Brotherhood in Mexico and the disturbing world of Pita's parents .<br /><br />Washington is superb in this role . Walken and Gianini outstanding . Rourke would seem to be out of context and commitment with a demanding role .<br /><br />The only negative aspect to remark is the presence of Mark Anthony who simply is out of space .Think in Wilhelm Dafoe , Ray Liotta, Rob Lowe , Jude Law , Ralph Fiennes , Tim Roth, gary Oldman or Jason Patric , to name just a few actors who could make this film to highest level .<br /><br />This was in my opinion , its only fault . Nevertheless the script is so well made that it is still a punch thriller . Bravo for Mr. Scott who finally faced the challenge with this mature work .<br /><br />The film reminds us too much to The Proffesional (1994) that film of Jean Luc Besson with Jean Reno . Nevertheless this film is by far more ambitious and pyramidal .</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington plays a man with a scarred past and a drinking problem. His life changes for the better when he becomes the bodyguard of a little girl (Dakota Fanning) who shows him that it's ok to live again. She is kidnapped and he of course goes nuts and tracks down everyone who was involved. He brutally kills them when he finds them.<br /><br />  The first hour is about Washington and Dakota's friendship and their scenes together are touching. Then once she's kidnapped it quicky becomes a violent revenge movie. However I forgave it for that quick change because it's a very cool revenge movie and Washington does some of his best work. The supporting cast is reall good too.  Christopher Walken is real good as Washington's good friend. Of course gets to deliver another great speeche as he explains that it was a big mistake to kidnap Dekota. After that speech unfortunetly he disapears from the film though.<br /><br />  Plus Dekota Flanning  has really good scenes with Washington. Marc Anthony (The Substitute)) and Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, Phone Booth) are also good as Dekota's parents, especially Mitchell though. Giancarlo Giannini (Hannibal, Mimic) also does some good work as a cop who wants to help out Washington. You also have Rachel Ticotin (Total Recall) as a reporter who gives Washington leads and Mickey Rourke (Angel Heart) as a lawyer. So yes it's really great cast but still even if Washington didn't have great back up he could've still heald it on his own. He's just so good in this and yes I agree with Richard Roeper, maybe he even is better here than he was in Training Day.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>Though certainly not one of the greatest films ever made its still a great film.  Denzel deserves an oscar nom but i think Jesus will win, Dakota is also very good in this movie and might get herself a nom, just goes to show kids CAN ACT.  The story is well done and the dialogue is great.  The style is original and adds a little more to the movie(though sometimes that zooming and spazing get a little annoying), the music is sometimes off for the mood of the scene but doesn't take too much away from the feel, its also very powerful because the relastionship between creasy bear and pita is heartwarming and the ending is also very sad, its got some very funny humor early on to show how they grow on eachother, but soon things get serious.  Don't expect some big huge action sequence, there are some creative killings and some explosions but thats about all the action.  Mostly its a charater drama, a well done one, and for that i think it deserves some oscar noms, i give it a 9 out of a 10, the spaztic camera use and some of the music could have been worked on, but other then that its a brilliant movie.  If you want some good quotes for when your pissed watch this movie, and Kill Bill which is alittle better(more entertaining overall), but there both incredible movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Tony Scott<br /><br />Cast:  Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, Giancarlo Giannini, Rachel Ticotin, Jesus Ochoa, Mickey Rourke.<br /><br />Running Time:  146 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for language and strong violence.<br /><br />Tony Scott, mastermind behind thrillers such as "Crimson Tide", "The Last Boy Scout", and "Enemy of the State", creates this extremely dark, violent portrayal of a man who has nothing to lose takes his rage out on the filth of society.  Washington plays Creasy, a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels, until his old partner (Christopher Walken) offers him a chance at redemption. He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his American-born wife (Radha Mitchell). While he and Fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past. It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed. With almost any other stock action hero (Schwarzenneger; Segal, etc.), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before. But Washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does. Still, he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) out to expose "La Hermanidad" (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction.<br /><br />Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell, "Man on Fire," astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people. These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative. Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.  Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. While the two leads carry the film, there are only mediocre performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini.  "Man on Fire" is saved by Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.<br /><br />'Man on Fire' had potential to be an outstanding film, being based on a great novel but Scott and Helgeland ultimately cut short on the relationship in order for action. Dizzying, MTV-like editing is used for many of the action scene and it feels as if Scott is trying to emulate both his brother, Ridley and filmmaker Oliver Stone. In 1994 Stone released "Natural Born Killers" which used aesthetics as a focal point to the narrative of the film including some hyper-real scenes. Scott seemed to favor using a similar technique in "Man on Fire" however the negatives outweigh the positives. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is at once ferocious, especially considering his work on films like 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' and 'Swordfish'. Christian Wagner (True Romance, Mission: Impossible II) edits with the same kind of speed but instead of adding to the film it also subtracts. The action scenes feel unnecessarily disruptive and it's when the violence on screen happens that Scott actually gains momentum. These scenes last more in the memory than the relationship. Helgeland's script dramatically makes cuts to the novel, and frankly it's uncertain that he even read it! Characters are made into two-dimensional pawns, the setting is changed from Italy to Mexico City, and whole chapters of character development are swiftly cut.  In the end 'Man on Fire' gives into the typical formula. The visuals can be arresting, the action is entertaining, and the leads are worthwhile but the mess created by the filmmakers ultimately drags it down.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington plays an alcoholic bodyguard who vows to take revenge on anyone who profited from the kidnapping of the little girl whom he was protecting.<br /><br /> Man on Fire was a great movie, it seems as though you pretty much know the story and you expect certain things to happen but the plot twists and turns in such a way that you will find yourself on the edge of your seat the throughout the entire movie asking yourself, what is going to happen next? and the way that the subtitling was done was also a nice touch.<br /><br /> This is definitely one of Denzel's best movies and a must see for anybody who is tired of all these wannabe action/dramas that have been coming out latley.<br /><br /> It's not often that a truly great movie comes around, but after seeing this movie I am convinced, and hopefully you will be too; Man on Fire is truly great!</p></br><a href="../users/ATOSQVSOA3D8Q.html">ATOSQVSOA3D8Q</a><br/><p>[RATING BETWEEN 4,5 STARS]. I mainly bought this film because of the girl[dakota fanning] who is in it. I would say this is again one of those films where you have got to like the actors in it or it's pointless buying it. Quite weird in some parts but great performances done by both Denzel washington and Dakota fanning. As i said i wasen't really sure what this was about, i just desperately wanted it before i read about it. I wouldn't of thought it was that good if dakota didn't act a lot in it. ACTION and FRIENDSHIP all in one. GREAT FILM.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>Very few actors possess the talent to make a successful revenge movie. This is pure escapism.  Only a great one can pull it off.  Man on Fire definitely does not have a complicated plot.  There are few surprises and one can easily predict what will happen in the next scene.  This film includes the expected sweet little girl, Pita (Dakota Fanning), who is guaranteed to pull at your heart strings.  She is adorable, innocent, and all that other mushy stuff.  Denzel Washington (John Creasey) portrays the conventional former American secret agent who one upon a time ruthlessly dealt with our country's enemies.  Reading the Bible helps to unburden Creasey's guilty soul, but alcohol helps him get through the day. He is traveling through Mexico when a buddy from the old days, Rayburn (Christopher Walken), persuades him to earn some money as the body guard of Pita.  Abductions are an everyday event in this one step above a third world country.  Corrupt police are a ho-hum reality.  The well-to-do are constantly targeted, and Pita's family will be no exception.  Criminals grab her, something goes wrong during the exchange of money for the child, and you should be able to figure out the rest for yourself.<br /><br />Now comes what you really desire to see in this movie: John Creasey exacting revenge on the bad guys.  The dude punishes the evil doers in some unpleasant ways.  It's gory, brutal---and very satisfying.  Gratuitous violence can sometimes be rewarding.  Hey, we all can't be another Mahatma Ghandi! Denzel Washington should be considered for an Academy Award for his performance, but this type of a artistry rarely garners such respect and adulation from the Hollywood community.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>...any day--but that's just me. It's also far more entertaining to watch a flawed man seek redemption than a superhero flex his perfection anyway. Anyone who sleeps with a fifth of Jacky Dee,  a St James Version of the Holy Bible and a pistol I would say is flawed and when Denzel as Creasy gets to 'do what he does best' is when the movie truly sets 'on fire'. I could do without the herky-jerky hand held feel of the camera and the super-eight style of the edits (which are cool in No Doubt videos, but after a while become irritating in full feature films). Mickey Rourke and Dakota are used too little here: but both serve the film quite well. One thing's for sure--the viewer will never look at suppositories quite the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Tony Scott's "Man on Fire" is a graphic and super violent portrayal of the rampant kidnappings that occur in Latin America. He adroitly also weaves an emotional story of human relationships in his tale which succeeds in resurrecting the life of a down and out Denzel Washington.<br /><br />The talented Washington plays Creasey, a former CIA assassin whose guilt ridden existence has caused him to curl up into a bottle of Jack Daniels.  He aimlessly travels to Mexico to visit ex-comrade Christopher Walken, a mover and shaker down there.  Walken recommends Washington for a job as a bodyguard protecting the vivacious 9 year old Dakota Fanning daughter of wealthy businessman Marc Anthony and attractive wife Radha Mitchell.<br /><br />The aloof and alcoholic Washington gets the job but tries to keep his distance from the friendly and charming child.  Gradually Fanning wears down Washington's resistance and they forge a very solid and caring relationship.  The child is ultimately kidnapped in a plot orchestrated by corrupt policemen with Washington getting severely wounded.<br /><br />By this juncture, Washington had given up the bottle and as he recuperates he commences to exact vengeance against the kidnappers.  In a remorseless reign of terror Washington pulls out all stops to find the young girl.<br /><br />This flick is not recommended for the feint of heart and there are some extremely graphic scenes.  Personal fave Giancarlo Giannini of Lina Wertmuller fame makes a welcome appearance in the movie as a local law enforcement official.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>I would have liked MAN ON FIRE much better if it had been directed by someone else.  Tony Scott's flashy cinematography and quick jumps only served to derail the action, and key plot devices are lost in the cinematic mayhem.  The use of comic book graphics throughout the film, even when you knew what people were saying was another distracting element.  All this flash and artsy fartsy nonsense overshadows good performances from Denzel Washington as the assassin/bodyguard; Dakota Fanning, marvelously realistic in her role as Pita; Radha Mitchell as the child's tormented mother; and Christopher Walken's role as Washington's buddy.  Mark Anthony needs to stick to singing, and the almost unrecognizable Mickey Rourke's role was useless.<br /><br />The movie is graphic in its portrayal of violence, and also sadomasochistic.  Sure, these guys deserved what they got, but Denzel's relentless revenge is not satisfying to watch.  The ending...well, it was to be expected, but didn't serve this viewer.  It's all too long, as well; but if Scott had shown more restraint in his overblown direction, it may have moved faster.  Not a diamond in Washington's career, but it's not his fault.  Give Tony Scott some Zoloft or something, and maybe he'll become a director again instead of an MTV clone.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Man on Fire" is an odd thriller. It seems to be appealing to two different audiences - kids seeking thrills and violence, and adults looking for intelligent entertainment, a la its director, Tony Scott's, "Spy Game" [2001]. In trying to play both ends against the middle, the movie fails to satisfy either audience. At nearly 2 ? hours long, it is too long and convoluted for kids. Beginning in the second half, there is violence so surreal and unexpected that it turns off most adults. Finally, the ending, which I anticipated early in the movie, is so gimmicky it tends to make BOTH audiences feel cheated.<br /><br />Denzel Washington, who plays Creasy, a has-been former CIA operative, leads a cast of consummate professionals. Down on his luck, alcoholic and suicidal, he finds himself in Mexico City. He meets an old buddy [Christopher Walken] who secures him a job as a bodyguard for the young daughter [Dakota Fanning] of a rich couple [Marc Anthony and Rhada Mitchell]. At first Creasy plays his usual, all business self, but soon the girl wins his heart. They bond in the movie's most moving scenes. When the girl is kidnapped, Casey is nearly killed trying to save her. While he is hospitalized, the kidnapping goes terribly wrong, and the kidnappers declare they have killed her. When he recovers, Creasy goes on a revenge rampage of Biblical proportions. It's not a pretty picture, and only an actor of Washington's abilities could sustain our empathy with the character.<br /><br />Supporting actors include such greats as Giancarlo Giannini and Rachel Ticotin. I can imagine all the actors on the set begging the director to tell them where their characters were going. How Scott responded, I will never know, but I also imagine the set as being rather chaotic.<br /><br />Adding to the chaos of "Man on Fire" was the decision to film most of it in a jarring, MTV-style mode. There is nothing in particular wrong with this editing technique, if used sparingly. If used over the course of 2? hours, though, it's the equivalent of writing a book using all caps.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Basically MAN ON FIRE was pretty good.<br /><br />Not quite what I expected from previews (pacing was a bit flat).... but much better than alot of garbage released these days.<br /><br />My biggest complaint ?<br /><br />This film had some of the worst cinematography, lighting, camera angles and editing of any film I have seen this side of low budget camcorder-shot B-films.<br /><br />The camera work, visuals and lighting made the film a bit annoying to watch and detracted from the film's overall impact.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>It's a thin blurry line that separates a classy production of "The Insider" cadre from the indulgent eye-numbing pablum showcased in movies like these, which are fun for 10 minutes but then begin to grate with pointless shots and flashbacks.<br /><br />The story of our Man on Fire is not too bad, it takes its own sweet time to come about, but holds your attention if only for the jarring curiosity to figure out what's going to happen and to whom.<br /><br />The little girl even offers some very compelling moments in the earlier bits of the film. Smart, cute kid.<br /><br />Until it all comes loose with genre devices -- hardened professional killer softened by his friendship with a cuddly child, or a startlingly imaginative rampage of revenge.<br /><br />Cliches as old as the trees abound, "Revenge is a dish best served cold", which forms a feeble precursor to the full justification of our urban cowboy's unbridled violence -- "...because he can deliver more justice in a weekend than the highest authorities working in tandem with the media could deliver in 10 years".<br /><br />Denzel is reliable in inducing his usual doses of intensity but I couldn't help dismissing his character as a caricature when he began chasing goons all round town with gaping bullet wounds in his chest. If the director was going for a humorous touch, it surely sneaked in.<br /><br />Don't miss the intriguing epilogue assuring viewers that Mexico City, seen as little more than a smouldering cauldron of murder and corruption for the previous 140 minutes, is actually "a very special place".<br /><br />More than one can say for the movie, but just about as credible.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Ex-marine alcoholic bodyguard Creasy (Washington) flips into killer mode when his charge gets kidnapped in thriller from director Tony Scott.

This is a tale of two movies.  One is about a bodyguard who is tasked to protect a little girl (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City.  The other is a dark take of the kidnapping trade in Mexico City.  This movie was much better in the second half of the film.  Denzel Washington shows he can be an action hero just like Schwarzenegger and Stallone.  I thought Tony Scott's direction was all glitz and glamour.  We didn't see who or what the character was like and why we should care about him.  All we know is what he was capable of.

This is a gritty story about revenge and redemption and the two saving graces of the film are Denzel and Dakota.  If Ms. Fanning can navigate through the shark-infested waters that mysteriously encircle child actors, I truely believe we're looking at a huge star for the next generation.  Marc Anthony first acting gig wasn't too bad either.  Truth be told, I expected less from him and I'm always thrilled when I'm proven wrong.  Christopher Watkins looks like he just showed up for an easy check and Micky Rouke seemed reduced to wallpaper.<br /><br />But it's all about the story, right?

Quinnell's 1980 novel of the same name, MAN ON FIRE, despite some flaws, is one of the better ation movies of recent times, thanks to superlative performances from Denzel Washington (no surprise there) and 10 year-old Dakota Fanning.<p>In it, Washington plays a former counterinsurgency agent now down on his luck and prone to drinking Jack Daniels like they're going to reinstate Prohibition tomorrow.  But he is offered a chance from a longtime friend (Christopher Walken) to redeem himself by protecting the young daughter (Fanning) of a prominent Mexico City businessman (Marc Antony).  Although he finds both the job and Fanning onerous to be around at first, he eventually develops a bond with the young girl, whose talents involve swimming and playing the piano.  It is that bond that will drive him to get back in the killing business when he is shot twice outside the house where Fanning takes piano lessons, and the young girl is kidnapped.  Fueled by rage and disgusted at the corruption of Mexican officials who not only allowed the kidnapping to happen but even may have taken part in it, Washington works his way up the chain of command in a kidnapping gang known as "La Hermanindad" (The Brotherhood) to get Fanning back.<p>MAN ON FIRE is flawed to a certain degree by the hyperactive directing style of Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), which involves herky-jerky camera work, different film stocks, and mind-warping editing, techniques that are not really new to him (and which had been perfected by Oliver Stone in JFK and NATURAL BORN KILLERS).  Also, the stereotyping of Mexicans here as evil and vicious killers and/or kidnappers is a bit much.  And yet, what makes MAN ON FIRE work as well as it does is that bond that develops between Washington and Fanning early on.  It gives Washington's subsequent killing spree a greater meaning than just another 21st century DEATH WISH bloodbath.  Veteran actress Rachel Ticotin gives a good supporting performance as a Mexican newspaper reporter who assists Washington in finding the members of La Hermanidad, which she has been trying to expose for years.  In between the original Mexican guitar score by Harry Gregson-Williams are splotches of Debussy ("Clair De Lune"), Puccini ("Nessun Dorma"), and, more prominently, Linda Ronstadt's Mexican-tinged 1977 country-rock version of "Blue Bayou", which gives Washington's character a humanizing quality and makes him more than just a remorseless killer.  Walken also gives a good turn as his former partner who tells Mexican officials why he is relentless in going after Fanning's kidnappers--"She taught him what it was like to live again."<p>Definitely not for everyone (it is a rather violent film, and the editing and camera work could give people headaches), MAN ON FIRE is nevertheless a very worthy film, better than most revenge and kidnapping films of the last several years.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Tony Scott's "Man on Fire" written by Mystic River-screenwriter Brian Helgeland is easily Scott's best film and one of the best of last year. There's few things wrong with this movie. The cinematography is great, the use of subtitles is great, Scott's directing and Denzel Washington/Dakota Fanning are in top form. The movie "Man on Fire" is about John Creasy (Washington). Creasy, an alcoholic ex-CIA operative, is given a job opportunity by his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken). He is hired by<br /><br />Samuel (Marc Anthony) and Lisa Ramos (Radha Mitchell) to be a bodyguard for their young daughter Pita (Fanning). Creasy thinks of it as merely a job, but eventually Pita gets to him and changes him. Then she's kidnapped and Creasy goes looking for her killer. Some critics liked the film, some did not. One critic said that he didn't like it because of the violence Creasy uses to find information about her kidnapper. The violence isn't overly graphic nor is it not graphic enough. It's pretty much right on par.<br /><br />This film is great; A</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>MAN ON FIRE is a brilliant film for many reasons: the script by Brian Helgeland is right up  there with his 'Mystic River' and 'LA Confidential', the direction by Tony Scott delivers an almost unbearable exposition of violence and evil while equally metering that aspect with some of the finest moments of acting from his cast that they have ever given, the cinematography is color saturated and creatively shot and edited in a way that propels the force of the story in a Grand Guignol manner, and last - the acting by the principals (and the supporting roles) is first rate.  Briefly, Creasy (Washington) is a burned out alcoholic victim of sensory devastation from being a special ops assassin for the US Intelligence and is called by his old comrade in arms Rayburn (Christopher Walken - in a dynamically rich characterization) to take on the role of bodyguard in Mexico City for a wealthy family's (Marc Anthony ad Radha Mitchell) precocious daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning, who continues to mature into a very fine actress).  Mexico City is seeing kidnapping at an all time high and the 'police force' is so corrupt that everyone is in jeopardy.  Yes, Pita is kidnapped and Creasy, despite severe bodily injury at the time he attempts to abort the kidnapping, recovers and spends his life 'on fire' with revenge, destined to kill everyone who had anything at all to do with what he feels is the death of Pita.  The reason this story works so very well is the powerful, though slow, process of Creasy allowing himself to find spiritual redemption in the love of Pita, a child with more healing powers in her indomitable nature than a legion of nuns and priests.  This relationship as created by Washington and Fanning through Scott's cautious eye is one of the more beautiful definitions of 'friendship' ever filmed.<br /><br />The supporting cast is peppered by both luminaries and newcomers and each gives full throttle performances that never fall into excess:  Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin, and the already mentioned Chistopher Walken, Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell.  Yes, this is a violent film: our world is a violent place and when money reigns over right/wrong situations, impossibly terrible things can happen.  Yet, violent though this film is, I feel that violence and the way in which it is depicted and manipulated by the camera is justified to shake the audience into accepting facts we don't want to see.  If Oscars have not been pre-decided, then Washington and Fanning are definitely candidates.  A very fine film that leaves you drained.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Tony Scott's "Man on Fire" is one of the better revenge flicks to come along in recent years.  It is a visually-dazzling film anchored by a bevy of fine performances.<br /><br />Ex-CIA operative Creasy (Denzel Washington) heads to Mexico to visit his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) and to find employment.  His skills land him a job as the personal bodyguard of Pita (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of a Mexican businessman.  As fate would have it, the young girl is soon abducted while under his care.  When Creasy recovers from the wounds he sustained in the kidnapping, he embarks on a vengeance-fueled quest to punish those responsible for taking Pita.<br /><br />"Man on Fire" has an uncompromising tone that many studio films shy away from these days.  It is a welcome throwback to the savage revenge flicks from prior decades that were made with little concern for those viewers with delicate sensibilities.  Washington turns in a tour-de-force performance that is filled with passion and ire.  You cannot take your eyes off of him when he is on screen.  Fanning distinguishes herself also and serves notice that she is an actress with a bright future ahead of her.  Furthermore, the supporting cast sparkles as Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, and Walken all hit the right notes.  Walken in particular is outstanding in a part that contrasts sharply with the more eccentric roles he usually finds himself in.  "Man on Fire" does have some problems with its ending but the film as a whole is still immensely watchable.  A bullet always tells the truth indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>denzel is a competent actor and very rarely gives into stereotypical roles(RAPPERS TAKE NOTE!!!!!!!!!).here he gives an earnest portrayal of a down to his last quarter drunken body guard.it seems over a decade of military sanctioned killing has sapped''creasy-the charactors name''of his humanity and self motivation.he is however in need of''work''and seeks out an old buddy played by a calm christopher walken.in mexico,body guards are a necessity not unlike cell phones.so creasy is told of a family needing someone to guard their young daughter played fairly well by ms fanning.director tony scott spent a little too much time developing the relationship between body guard and child.she melts away his''im not your friend,so no questions'' facade on cue and they get all cutesy soon after.but once the actual kidnapping occurs(some 65 minutes into the movie,cause for a 1 star deduction)things get moving.i have stated in other reviews about my not liking the 1 man against many genres and theres where another star is deducted.denzel is bumrushed while waiting for dekota to finish up her piano lesson.recovering in a hospital after being left for dead,denzel recovers and begins his tearing apart of those who kidnapped the kid mission.yes he gets the prerequisite inside help from a reporter and a federale besides c.walken.and of course the help is on the money.where no one else was able to crack the kidnapping ring in all of the decades they have been around,all it took was denzel getting shot up and his charge taken to get things done(of course i deducted a star for this).there is a twist here that i didnt really see coming(1 star returned).its a spoiler so stop reading .....NOW.it turns out that marc anthony,dekotas father set up the kidnapping along with the help of crooked police to gain money.the plan was to hijack the ransome drop off so marc anthony's charactor didnt have to live a lie of wealth any longer.turns out he was flat broke and living on fumes.it was supposed to be an easy score but alas......anyway,things get mucked up and lives are ruined.the movie connected the dots nicely and ended with yet another twist....SPOILER TIME......the kidnappers reported the child dead after the bungled ransome ripoff.but they lied.they didnt kill her because they are''professionals''.they were going to ransome the kid off to someone else i suppose.the movie is 40 minutes too long but thankfully not on marc anthony's rat-like mug.a good movie overall.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>The problem with films like "Man on Fire" which features Denzel Washington as a disillusioned, suicidal/not so semi homicidal ex-mercenery CIA ex everything badass is that they tap into our worst impulses as human beings: the instinct for immediate, bloody revenge.  Justice?  Nope.  Immediate, bloody revenge.  Still, one cannot help but be mesmerized by the cinematography and exciting storyline which reminds us, once again, that Mexico City is not a nice place.  And despite what the critics of this film might say--hey, maybe they should go visit MC for awhile, not in the polished sections, but in the actual city, come back and leave a few comments.  If they survive, of course!<br /><br />This film starts out as a nightmarish descent into the psyche of a man of who has done very bad things during his life in the service of the U.S. Government, one of the chief flaws being that we never discover exactly what they were or why.  Hints are dropped but the theme of "redemption through finger flaying/anal tube bombs" would have worked out a lot better if we knew *who* John Creasy really was before the adorable little Dakota Fanning, daughter of a rich Mexican construction bigwig and a sort of blonde statue of a wife (Radha Mitchell was terrible in this movie, mechanical as Johnny Five with no voice) was kidnapped under his watch as drunk bodyguard.  The implications in these movies is that if someone was in the CIA, they must have monstrous MacGyver moves up their sleeves and a lot to regret.  I believe the former, since this was made during the reign of Bush/Cheney.<br /><br />When the girl is taken, what seems to be a straightforward tale of vengeance veers into something much more grisly and mysterious.  People are involved who definitely shouldn't be involved a la Jon Benet Ramsey.  This fuels Creasy's rage, as puzzles pop up (Mickey Rourke, one of the best actors out there today, helps make the movie playing the family's slimeball lawyer) which point in an unpleasant direction.<br /><br />Creasy's methods for extracting information are not bashful.  They seem expressly designed, in fact, to depersonalize their targets and rob them of their criminal pride, so bad are they.  Without screwing up the plot for anyone, though the "hidden ending" about the girl's welfare isn't too hard to understand, this is about a very capable man who feels as though his only reason for living, an innocent with joy the world has yet to take from her, is gone.  And worse.  What follows is a nightmare with a *tinge* of redemption.<br /><br />It succeeds.  Still, as a nation, we should sometimes wonder what it is that relishes revenge so much and not straight forward redemption.  It'd save us a lot of senseless wars.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>if Scott would stop trying to be so damn clever and pseudo-artistic and just direct the damn film. His ridiculous cutaways, speed-ups, distorted angles, strange lighting and COMPLETELY unnecessary subtitles might seem cool to the inexperienced, but if you are a true film fan, you soon realize that none of it adds anything to the film other than make it harder to watch. Denzel, Walken, Fanning, Mickey and even Anthony turn in good performances. The others are just kind of there. As far as the plot goes, it's OK. (Warning! Possible spoiler ahead). A lot of it seems retread from a lot of other revenge films, and I have just one question: with all the other firepower he bought, did Creasy ever hear of bulletproof vests? Duh....</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>It's the cast, and their great acting that saves 'Man on Fire' from being on B-movie list.  See, the director is Tony Scott, the guy behind 'Top Gun' and 'True Romance' which means that you cannot get round characters or anything deep in here.  To be honest, the script by Brian Helgeland (who should have slowed down his pace after 'Mystic River') is full of holes, made out of cliched set-pieces.<br /><br />However, you get real professionals here -- this time, Denzel Washington as our anti-hero Creasy, ex-government special agent how is hired for protecting a little girl 'Pita' in Mexico, where, the film claims, kidnapping became no longer an unusual event.  As this long film (2hrs 26 mins) unfolds, Creasy confronts the crime syndicate alone, who attempt a violent kidnap plan on the little girl.<br /><br />Little girl Pita is played by Dakota Fanning, who had been  incidentally a kidnapped girl in 'Trapped' before, and like that previous so-so film, she easily shows that she is just amazing among the B-action film, especially the amusing bantering humor with Denzel's Creasy, whose job, he supposes at first, doesn't include being friendly.<br /><br />After the slow-moving first half, which concentrates on the relations between the man and the girl, the latter half changes the tone in a drastic way, with the furious Creasy who is bent on revenge, or in plain words, killing.  Denzel Washington manages to get more violent -- I mean, very graphic violence -- than the cop in Oscar-winning 'Training Day,' and some of you may find what he does very questionable.  Well, but that's what Creasy does, the man on fire.<br /><br />The film scores bonus points thanks to the great supports -- Christopher Walken and Giancarlo Giannini are real standout, while Rhada Mitchell, Rachel Ticotin, and Mickey Rourke are all effective.  Believe me or not, Chris is not a bad guy.  Really.<br /><br />The film's total results are, however, hampered by its own overdone cameraworks -- fast-cutting, slow motions, double exposures, and so on and on, all of which are irritating to  us.  While we know that more traditional images would be more effective in creating the mood of the city in Mexico, the MTV style camara only prevents the actions from going on smoothly.  And those subtitles, especially the 'Time to Go' countdown is only laughable.<br /><br />I give as many as four stars simply because I didn't find the film dull all through.  But that's simply because 'Man on Fire' has superb acting from superb actors, and the fact remains that 'Man on Fire' is a well-crafted, well-acted B-action flick with excessive brutality.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington is a force to be reckoned with in Man on Fire, featuring some glossy and overly stylistic direction courtesy of director Tony Scott; something which hurts the film as well as propels it.  Washington plays a burned out assassin/secret agent type who takes a job being a bodyguard for the daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a wealthy couple (Radha Mitchell, Marc Anthony) in Mexico.  Soon enough, the two form a predictable bond which leads our hero to go on a bloody, revenge filled rampage when the girl is kidnapped and presumed dead.  Were it not for Washington's magnetic performance and the surprisingly realistic interplay between him and Fanning, Man on Fire would be a derivative mainstream revenge flick, but it works for the most part despite some mis-steps by Scott.  The visual style is different from anything Scott has done with his more recent projects, but the frequent unnecessary subtitles are more of a distraction than anything else.  Not to mention that the story is predictable, but despite this Man on Fire still manages to be satisfying.  Also featuring Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin, and Hannibal's Giancarlo Giannini; Man on Fire isn't the finest work you'll see from any of the party's involved, but you could do a lot worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>Let me ask a question. The character 'Joe Miller' in "Philadelphia," the character 'Matt Lee Whitlock' in "Out of Time," and the character 'John Creasy' in "Man on Fire"  . . . what's their racial background?<p>See, it's tricky to ask that question and it may appear insensitive and boorish. People look at you as though you just got caught opening a can of beer in the parking lot of a chrome shop and your name is Cooter or Bubba. <p>But I submit to you that Denzel Washington, like myself a Fordham University man (regrettably the comparison ceases there) is so good at what he does that three lines into the script or 40 seconds after the movie begins you forget that he is an African American actor. You are mesmerized (again) by viewing the craft of one of the best actors of our time. <p>Like other African American men and women, Ashe, Jeter, Winfrey, Powell, the skill at which they do and did their jobs becomes the only point of focus. And that's the way it should be. And if an actor can show it to us and speed the process, more power to him. <p>The plot of "Man on Fire" is oft used and simple. Burned out service man, cowboy, boxer, assassin, Knight of the Round Table, Priest, is rescued by a little guy, girl, pet, his girlfriend's sister, and wants to return to a "normal" life. Well not necessarily normal but at least not self destructive with occasional suicidal thoughts.<p>For John Creasy was the CIA and alcohol that started it all. Now his friend Christopher Walken is getting him perhaps the last job he can ever hope to hold, bodyguarding a 10 year old blond girl of wealthy parents. When their relationship develops he finds himself with little experience becoming a sort of surrogfate father, and his 'raison d'etre' is returned to him by the precocious Dakota Fanning. <p>His job is to protect her; when he fails at that she is kidnapped and he begins a journey of retribution, punishing those that took from him the person who gave him the gift of wanting to live again.<p>In that regard it's not an unordinary film. It's heavy handed in the violence department, and while that doesn't detract from Washington's consummate skills, it does point the movie towards "pulpdom." But Denzel Washington brings to the character of John Creasy a depth heretofore unseen in "tortured, wounded, dark heroes." While it's an (only slightly) above average film, Washington is worth the trip. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I have to admit right here that I found the movie annoying.  There is much to admire, particularly a stellar cast all doing a great job.  I also have a strong stomach (and love stuff like RESERVOIR DOGS, KILL BILL, etc. etc. in which the bad guys are dispatched in "creative" ways) and appreciation for well done violence.<br /><br />But there were too many things that bothered me...Director Tony Scott's directing style for starters.  If you haven't seen it, I can't really explain the jitteriness of it.  Most of the scenes have tricky editing, in which the picture jumps around or changes colors, or little snippets of things we've seen in the past are thrown in.  I think it's all supposed to make us feel on edge.  It works in bits and pieces, but the WHOLE DARN MOVIE!!!  Please!  The editor, director and cinematographer were having a bit too much fun for their own good.  You shouldn't be aware CONSTANTLY that you're watching a filmed image that is being heavily manipulated.  I felt constantly pulled away from my efforts to "suspend disbelief."  A movie like TRAFFIC, for example, played around with film stock and was a bit "tricky" in the same way.  But it actually helped us keep track of the myriad story lines, and at least the camera stayed still!<br /><br />And despite this gloss of "artistry," the movie is really nothing more than a simple revenge flick...which I have NO problem with by the way.  But there are bits of dialogue that try to have great import to them...and there's a recurring bit with a bullet that doesn't fire when expected that's simply too FRAUGHT WITH MEANING to be anything but vaguely laughable.  If only the people behind the scenes could have realized that with a cast like they had to work with...they didn't need to work so hard.<br /><br />As you probably know, the film deals with the "damaged" bodyguard/former assassin Denzel Washington, and his relationship with his young charge, played by Dakota Fanning.  She helps make him feel alive again (in some scenes this is done VERY effectively...others are just cloying).  But when misfortune strikes, and Washington lets her down in a major way, he goes on a rampage of revenge that makes his character in TRAINING DAY look like a boy scout.  He not only is merciless, he seems to revel in coming up with creative ways to kill off everyone involved in the plot.  That's all well and good, and is the real reason to see the film.<br /><br />Washington is very good.  His naturally clipped manner works well, and when he dons his sunglasses, he exudes NO friendliness whatsoever.  Dakota Fanning is, of course, a fine young performer and is very good here.  Rhadha Mitchell plays her mother very well.  Marc Anthony is the dad (I won't discuss what happens to him, except to complain that the events Mom sets into motion might be frowned upon by little Dakota later!).  Christopher Walken plays an old friend of Washington's...and low and behold, he can still play a "normal" guy.  No quirks, no vacant stare. He's engaged in his role and feels like a real person.  Not that I don't LOVE his quirky characters, but it's good to remember that he is a skilled actor.  Mickey Rourke has a small role that suits him well.<br /><br />I just couldn't warm up to the film.  It's a bit too long for starters...the plot doesn't really required 2 hours and 15 minutes.  The ending lacks the emotional kick I'm sure it thought it had.  And again, there's the annoying filming style.  I won't say "don't see it," but I will say that I think it could EASILY have been a lot better too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>It's a slow burn for the first half, and it's half an hour too long, although when it kicks into revenge mode it gets more satisfying - if you can stomach people losing digits and such. An interesting challenge to opponents of the death penalty, if nothing else. Good performances all round. Weird captioning thingy going on (you'll see).<br /><br />Much too slow and ponderous, but maybe this movie'll give Mexico a black eye regarding its corruption and kidnapping rackets. It's hard to believe Mexico City cooperated in the making of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AG6UYD56VHOG1.html">AG6UYD56VHOG1</a><br/><p>I will not buy any Blu-Ray DVD's that do Not Include extras that Standard DVD's include.

He could be wearing a clown costume for all I know. What's he doing now? Is he putting a bomb up a man's jacksy while spread eagled on a car bonnet or is he poaching eggs on his buns? I don't know. Denzil Washington is rumoured to be a black man. I see something vaguely dark whizzing accross the screen but it could be a flying wombat for all I can deduce. In fact, I'm not even looking at the screen. I'm in the bathroom getting an aspirin.<br /><br />Those of you who thought 'The Bourne Supremacy' featured the worst direction on a major motion picture in living memory will be truly gob-smacked by this picture. Tony Scott is an experienced director so he has no excuse for this unmitigated disaster. Studios are moaning about the downturn in box office and then make a film that nobody can look at when they actually venture into the cinema.<br /><br />It appears Mr Scott is miffed about the reception his over-long revenge saga 'Revenge' got at the afore-mentioned box office and really wants to punish us this time. A man goes to a foreign country and murders a whole bunch of people for a crime it turned out they were not actually guilty of (sounds familiar?) and the writer wants us to get all sentimental about him. And could someone PLEASE allow Dakota Fanning to have a childhood instead of grooming her to act like a mini adult. It is really creepy.<br /><br />You have got to admire the sheer chutzpuh of the tribute to Mexico City tacked on at the end of this movie. It is also the only part of the film that is thankfully still.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely brilliant, led By Denzel Washington in a powerful performance. He plays John Creasy, once at the top of his game in the CIA, but now he's an alcoholic that takes a job as a bodyguard in Mexico City, where there are so many kidnappings that it made me feel very depressed and sad. He is to protect young Pita, played beautifully by Dakota Fanning. The movie is so powerful and sweet though thanks to the first half of the movie. In this section, Creasy becomes nicer and nicer thanks to Pita, and he falls in love with this little girl. They are now best friends, and now Creasy is no longer an alcoholic thanks to his great friendship with Pita. But when Pita gets kidnapped and Creasy gets shot, things go awry. Creasy awakens in the hospital and he is accused of having killed two cops who helped kidnap her. Creasy is released and is informed that Pita is supposively dead because the ransom exchange went awry. Creasy now is really mad and is bent on revenge. He gets some big guns and declares that he will kill everyone that was involved with the kidnapping. This section is very violent as Creasy chops off people's fingers, and wires bombs to one guy's but. Creasy is determined to show no mercy. This movie is very powerful and emotional. I almost cried because this is based on atrue story and kidnappings do occur sooooooooo very often in places like this. Washington and Fanning are both very powerful and the movie is built around them and their bond until the kidnapping. It shows that Creasy fears not his death but only wants to get revenge even if this means his death. The movie will have you laughing, maybe even crying or just staring in awe at what Creasy does. I strongly recommend this very powerful and wonderful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>First of all, if I could give this movie more stars I would because it actually deserves 10. Secondly, Denzel has not made being bad look this good "Training Day" which I also loved. I absolutely love Denzel Washington, so I expected no less than a phenomenal movie from him, and I'm glad I wasn't disappointed. "Revenge is a dish best served cold" I couldn't have said it better, and Denzel does indeed serve it up cold and raw. I loved every minute of it, and that includes all the violence that some people seem to hate about. I was rooting for Denzel to kill them all too. In fact, I loved this movie so much that I had to add it to my collection. Let's not forget, Dakota Fanning. This has got to be one of the most talented girls in Hollywood right now, at least for her age anyway. I have to say that I adore her more as an actress than some of these other older newcomers to the big screen. I was also surprised that Marc Anthony exceeded my expectations as an actor. I really underestimated him, but he actually did pretty good though. I would definitely watch this movie again. In fact, I have watched it several times, and will probably watch it several more times.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>Wow! I like this movie alot!  Watch it like 5 times or so!  This movie is a great movie overall.  I like the action!  I like the drama!  I like the bonding between Denzel and Dakota characters.  "I'm the Lost Sheep that got away" "You think God will forgive us for the things we've done?"  I like this movie and how it should "there's no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends."  Its a good movie!  My life for my friends life so that they can live.  The Swimming was touching!  The screams of a the little girl shouting for the Bodyguard was almost realistic!  I was at the edge my seat.  "It's between God and them, its my job to arrange the meeting!!!!" I like this movie and its a must OWN!!!! BUY!!! IT!!</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>In addition to the above illogical mixture, the style and cinematography of Man on Fire is like "Traffic" or "21 Grams".<br /><br />Denzel Washington is one of our finest actors, and his performance here does nothing to tarnish his reputation.  Dakota Fanning is a cute kid who has no difficulty delivering precocious lines as a child actor.  In movie after movie in her brief career she has played essentially the same role: the little blonde girl who is smarter than the average little blonde girl.  In "Man on Fire" the aspect that works most effectively is the mentor/protege relationship between Denzel and young Miss Fanning as Pita.<br /><br />Like the Sound of Music this film features a child who is all but neglected by her powerful father.  Someone is hired to be with the child - (now that I think about it, this movie shares that quality with another of Miss Fanning's recent features, Uptown Girls, doesn't it?) But rather than hiring Julie Andrews, a spirited singing Nun, Pita's parents need a bodyguard and hire Denzel's Creasy, a burned-out alcoholic ex-special forces killer.<br /><br />You don't know exactly what Creasy did in his previous life, but you know it haunts him.  Early in the film he is reunited with his old service buddy, Rayburn, played by Christopher Walken.<br /><br />"Do you think God will forgive us for the things we've done?" he asks.<br /><br />"No", says Rayburn.<br /><br />"Me either", says Creasy succinctly.<br /><br />Creasy is initially all business with young Pita.  "I was hired to be your bodyguard, not your friend", he tells her when she tries to chat him up on the way to school.  But they form a believable bond and mutual respect over several weeks and some of the better scenes of the film are of Creasy acting as Pita's swimming coach.<br /><br />Then Pita is kidnapped in a scene that leaves Creasy with a couple of bullet wounds through his chest.  Creasy takes a bullet through the chest better than most people, though, and soon after he is striding through Mexico with a killer bravado that outdoes Charles Bronson in "Death Wish".  There is even a scene where Walken's character persuades the Mexican authorities to let Creasy go after the bad guys that reminded me of a very similar one in Death Wish.  "He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals," says Rayburn.  I wasn't expecting to suddenly find myself in a vigilante movie - and you, the prospective viewer, have to decide for yourself whether or not you'd enjoy such a thing.  Do you LIKE the idea of a well-armed civilian wading into the bad guys and blowing them away.... or do you prefer "traditional" justice, with cops and trials?<br /><br />If the story had partnered Creasy with the authorities in any kind of believable fashion I would have probably given a 4-star rating.  For the creative vigilante act I can only give 3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Death is his art. And he's about to paint his masterpiece." <p>That is the right line for this movie, spoken by Christopher Walken, the right actor. Obsessed with the grandeur of bloodshed, "Man On Fire" is apocalyptic, spun from the roughest parts of the Old Testament. Tony Scott's movie is a kidnapping drama set in Mexico City - a "special place" according the end credits. Special indeed - take the film at its word, and half the cops are corrupt and in competition with kidnappers for ransom money. The corrupt judicial unit, dubbed "La Hermandad," is impenetrable. Unless you're Denzel Washington. <p>In a performance that melds elements of his Oscar-winning turn in "Training Day" and his work in "Courage Under Fire," Washington is John Creasy, a suicidal alcoholic ex-Marine offered a job through war-buddy Rayburn (Walken) to protect the daughter of a sweatshop industrialist (Marc Anthony). This daughter, Pita, played by the increasingly skilled Dakota Fanning - who's given dialogue and mannerisms better suited to a 16-year-old - charms Creasy out of his shell, makes him become her swim coach. Fanning is, in a sense, a peculiar little girl, so far beyond her years in gestures that when she laughs at a joke of Rayburn's that she'd have no way of understanding, we begin to wonder if her maturity has been misused.  <p>So then - Pita's snatched in a setup, Creasy's shot, and after he recovers, his counterpunch makes "Deathwish" look like a cakewalk. <p>"Kill them all," Pita's mother (a glammed-out Radha Mitchell) whispers as Creasy holds his Bible. This vengeance either invigorates you or it doesn't. As these films go, "Man On Fire" is among the most violent and malevolent. The script, by Brian Helgeland, pretends to ask the larger questions about sacrifice and morality, but it isn't into sparing lives. There is torture, then more of it, then death. When a nightclub is blown up, the crowd roars. That's quite a bit unlike the recent fire in Rhode Island. <p>The most controversial scene involves a rectum bomb set to Creasy's digital pager. "I wish - you had more time," Creasy intones ironically. A corrupt cop, stripped to his underwear and bent over a car under a freeway, has no more time. <p>Cynical and a bit beefier, Washington is good as the tough hombre with a rocket launcher. The mark of a good actor is to want what he wants even when we shouldn't. Washington's that guy. Walken shuffles around with his offbeat cadence, utters the movie's best line, and disappears. Anthony is jittery in a limited role. Mickey Rourke makes a cameo using his real, non-sandpaper voice. Mitchell isn't much of an actor, but she's platinum gorgeous, and a perfect trophy wife she makes. Between her and Anthony's character, you wonder where Pita got her smarts.  <p>Mexico City, when we can get a clear view of it from Scott's dizzying camera, is a bright, messy backdrop. Scott's editor on "Spy Game," Christian Wagner, achieves the feat making sense out of chaos and vice versa, though an early scene featuring a drunk, bawling Creasy could have been pieced together more clearly. Helgeland adapts A.J. Quinnel's novel, and it's not his best work - the plot holes are big enough to drive Hummers through. Scott resorts to flashing dialogue, both Spanish and English, on the screen in a pop-art, free-verse-poetry presentation that's at first unique, then distracting, then annoying. Notice, too, that it doesn't start happening until Fanning's offscreen.<p>As it unfolds on a desolate bridge near a Biblical tree in the middle of Mexico, the end of "Man On Fire" is the kind of preordained, wide-shot-to-show-significance material Scott has loved since "Enemy of the State," the first of his "import" trilogy that hopefully ends with this film. Prior to that Will Smith vehicle, Scott made hard-boiled, straight-ahead popcorn flicks - "Days of Thunder," "Top Gun," "The Last Boy Scout" "Crimson Tide" - that were shallow, lurid, painfully macho but, at the very least, aware of themselves and fun. "Man On Fire" is enamored with its potential greatness when it's really a B-movie playing with an A-list star and budget.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>This is a good action tale if you relax and suspend disbelief, just going with the flow.  It's curious, though, how the protagonast reacted to the murder of his client.  He did not ask, "Why did they hate her?"  He did not sit in the corner and do yoga.  He did not form a coalition, dispatch inspectors, or levy economic sanctions.  He did not seek any routes of compassion, inclusion, diversity or tolerance.  He acted unilaterally, and merely set out to kill the murderers.  Shouldn't he have at least attempted some sort of non-violent appeasement, a more civilized, European approach?  Isn't that the best way to deal with savage murderers?  It's NOT ??</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Man On Fire" is an excellent movie! It is a remake of the 1987 movie with Scott Glenn as John W. Creasy, a man who accepts a job as a bodyguard to a wealthy family. Denzel Washington plays the same character with the same name as the Scott Glenn character in the original. It also has the same plot as the original. But this remake looks better than the original. The movie runs at nearly 2 1/2 hours long, which is pretty long, but, it is still an excellent movie with style and charisma, thanks to Denzel. His performance is a possible Oscar nomination for Best Actor at next year's Oscars, he is excellent in this performance. Dakota Fanning, stars as Pita Ramos, the daughter of the wealthy family he protects. Her performance is as excellent as Denzel's is. Creasy, at first, resents life, but, then, something unexpected happens. Creasy and Pita strike up a friendship. Then she gets kidnapped and Creasy is shot, trying to protect her. Then the story revolves around him trying to find her, hence the title "Man On Fire". Christopher Walken, stars as Rayburn, Creasy's friend who helps him in his journey of getting Pita back. Tony Scott's directing is excellent and has made a well done movie. The screenplay by Brian Helgeland, based on the novel by A.J. Quinnell, is excellent. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is excellent. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is excellent. The film editing by Christian Wagner is excellent. The casting by Lucinda Syson, Manuel Teil, & Bonnie Timmermann is excellent. The production design by Benjam&iacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez & Chris Seagers and the costume design by Louise Frogley is excellent. The art direction by Hector C. Romero is excellent. The set decoration by Elli Griff is excellent. This movie is well made and fast paced. It is a emotional and powerful movie. This has to be Denzel's best movie ever. Go see this movie, if you can or if you want to.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>I viewed this on a 42" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player. Transfer is a 4/5 on PQ and 4/5 on AQ. This will probably take its  place among my favorite Denzel Washington films. While it is highly stylized in shooting style, the story and relationship between him and the little girl and his redemption made this an above average thriller. Dakota and Denzel are outstanding, and this film is a nailbaiting rollercoaster ride to the end. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>This intense action thriller is great from start to finish.<br /><br />It features Denzel Washington as Creasy, a burnt out alcoholic ex-CIA agent type.  He has gotten to the point where he is just existing and does not seem to see much point in living.  His friend gets him a job as a bodyguard to a young girl, Pita (Dakota Fanning), in kidnapping capital Mexico City.<br /><br />Although he clearly views it as just a job and wants no conversation or other personal involvement, she starts to grow on him and he warms to her.<br /><br />She ends up getting kidnapped.  Creasy is wounded during the kidnapping.  While he is recovering, he finds out that a ransom exchange went bad and it becomes clear that Pita's abductors plan to kill her.  Creasy becomes totally fixed on revenge against anyone who was involved.  He functions like he is half Jack Bauer and half Dirty Harry.  Needless to say, the action is constant.  Not only is there a lot of violence and excitement, there is also a good human story about the father-like relationship Creasy develops with Pita.<br /><br />This is really a great flick, but probably not one for those who are too squeamish about violence</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Here's a gritty, get-the-bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough Denzel Washington. He's three personalities here: a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray DVD is one of the sharpest-looking I have seen. It's very impressive and made me elevate this film from four to five stars.<br /><br />The story is about Washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little American girl living in Mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the movie.) He becomes attached to the kid, played winningly by THE child actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one. Beware: this film is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />This is stylish film-making, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera-work is one that could give you a headache. I thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view, and, as mentioned, looks spectacular on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Besides the two stars, there is the always-interesting Christopher Walken, in an uncharacteristically low-key role, and a number of other fine actors. The film panders to the base emotions in all of us, but it works.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / FOX / Region A<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />Running time: 2:26:05<br />Movie size: 40,20 GB<br />Disc size: 42,80 GB<br />Total bit rate: 36.69 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 29.92 Mbps<br />Extras: None<br />DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 48Khz/24-bit English<br /><br />********************************************************<br /><br />Version: AUSTRALIA / FOX / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />Running time: 2:26:07<br />Movie size: 39,56 GB<br />Disc size: 48,70 GB<br />Total bit rate: 36.10 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 28.98 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 28<br />Subtitles: English SDH, Chinese, Indonesian, Korean, Tagalog, Thai<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  3978 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 3978 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Thai  448 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br /><br />#Audio commentary by Director Tony Scott<br />#Audio commentary by Production - Lucas Foster, Brian Helgeland and Dakota Fanning<br />#Vengeance is Mine: Re-inventing Man on Fire Documentary<br />#15 Deleted Scenes with Optional Audio Commentary by Director Tony Scott<br />#Pita's Abduction: Multi-Angle Sequence with Optional Commentary by Director Tony Scott<br />#Pita's Abduction: Tony Scott's Storyboards (53 stills)<br />#Pita's Abduction: Script Excerpt (8 stills)<br />#Photo Gallery (60 stills)<br />#Music Video: Kinky Oye Como Va<br />#Theatrical Trailers<br /><br />***************************************************************</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>A movie that taps into the alter-ego of a perpetually liked actor, maybe even one of the most favorite actors in Hollywood, is always a tempting and dangerous proposition.  Whereas some may go in opposition of their nice-guy fa?ade for a sappy, genre-bridging attempt at drama (I'm talking to you Jim Carey), others, like Denzel Washington, have embraced the dark side of his repertoire, and taken on roles in which their characters are disturbed at best, and borderline maniacal at worst.<br /><br />Man on Fire is part revenge, part crisis, a movie that plays upon humanity's protective nature and sympathies for children.  John W. Creasy (Washington) is a former soldier whose expertise is in death-dealing; he is a firearms, demolitions, and battle expert who has many notches on his belt of death.  Unfortunately, his propensity for alcohol has diminished his skills and marketability, and has led him to Mexico to work as a bargain-bin bodyguard for a wealthy family.  His mission is to protect Pita (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of Samuel (Marc Anthony) and Lisa (Radha Mitchell).  As Pita is quick to point out - and quote stats - there are a bunch of kidnappings in Mexico City, especially when there are unprotected children of prosperous foreign families running around.<br /><br />Sure enough, Pita is kidnapped, and the Pandora's Box of Creasy's vengeance is opened.  I can't really blame the abductors; Creasy didn't look imposing.  However, his worn-down but determined visage belies the cauldron of vindictive sadism ready to explode on anyone and anything that gets in his way.<br /><br />From there the direction of the movie uses a jerky, staccato filming style to convey the internal grief of the characters and the impending chaos that Creasy is about to unleash as he uncovers those responsible for the kidnapping.  I especially like the interactions between Creasy and the Spanish-speaking criminals, as the translation is shown on-screen in a very unique manner, adding to the frantic feel that the window of opportunity to save Pita may be eroding.  Along the way he receives help from a friendly journlist (Rachel Ticotin) hell-bent on removing the veil from the face of police corruption.  He also gets assistance from a former soldier buddy (Chrisopher Walken), who refers to Creasy's skill as a soldier and a killer by stating that Creasy is an artist of death about to paint a masterpiece.<br /><br />I love the film,, but had trouble feeling any remorse for Creasy.  The film sets up for redemption, and plays upon the audience's pathos, but the effort (which works for Pita) just doesn't work well for Creasy - possibly a direct result of his passion for revenge and muder juxtaposed against his seemingly pious regret aimed at his carnage-filled past.  Nonethelss, this movie is superb, and highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I can pretty much take anything cinema has to offer (I survived "Caddyshack II", for example), but I gotta admit, MAN ON FIRE made me look away from the carnage at least once or twice.  Any movie headlined by Denzel Washington translates into an instant spellbinder; Washington puts an extra gear into all of his roles.  Yet the gritty, malevolent, gratuitous violence of this film transcends Washington's powerful acting--and it's violence enhanced, yet ultimately punished, by director Tony Scott's eery cinematography.<br /><br />The plot is certainly nothing original:  A man with emotional baggage befriends a youngster (a precocious Dakota Fanning), then embarks on a one-man apocalyptic quest to avenge a kidnapping gone awry.  Yet this is not your grandmother's quest for vengeance; Washington punishes the bad guys until your stomach flip-flops, and his brooding protagonism is amplified by camera shots and angles and blurs and stop-motion and hand-held sequences. . .compelling cinematography so dominant it eventally interferes with the story itself.  And because much of this movie (set in a very urban Mexico City) is in Spanish, director Scott dubiously inserts subtitles--even when the dialogue is in broken English.<br /><br />Scott is also the star of this DVD's extra features; he tells us, gleefully, about shooting the auto smash-ups, dusting off and using an old 1910-ish winding camera--he even recalls a delightful story about his bodyguard getting beaten up by gangbangers during a late-night filmmaking session in the bowels of Mexico City.  This is all good stuff, and only enhances the "ick" factor of this most troubling film.  MAN ON FIRE gets your attention, and keeps it, through all the muck and the gore, even while you're wishing the camera shot would stay still, and come into focus.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p>I'm not normally an action flick fan, but I really enjoyed this movie. The story does not drag at all, it seems everyone involved in the kidnapping is corrupt, even our hero Creasy, but it is also surprisingly touching at a couple of points. The action sequences are really well done and I like the overall dark, gritty feel. Denzel Washington gives a superb performance,  as does Christopher Walken, but young Dakota Fanning absolutely shines.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>With a story that appears to have been ripped directly from the headlines, director Tony Scott reteams with his "Crimson Tide" star, Denzel Washington, and delivers what is possibly one of the most suspenseful, well-written, well-directed and acted revenge tales ever committed to film.  In "Man on Fire", Tony Scott chose to shed some light on the terrible tragedy of kidnappings that occur almost daily in Mexico.  Even though I generally despise movie studios that re-release movies to DVD less than a year after the intial release, this All-Access edition of "Man on Fire" gives the movie the proper treatment it deserves.<br /><br />"Man on Fire" is the story of a former C.I.A. agent, John Creasy (Denzel Washington), who takes on the role of bodyguard and mentor for the young daughter of a wealthy family in Mexico City.  However, when the young girl, Pita (Dakota Fanning), is kidnapped for ransom, the kidnappers unwittingly bring about a firestorm of unbridled fury from inside Creasy.  Now, Creasy embarks on a quest to rescue Pita, and God be with anyone who gets in his way, because no one else will be.<br /><br />"Man on Fire" accomplishes something many other revenge tales never even aspire to, that is actually delivering a story of substance, and not just violence.  The scenes between Denzel and Dakota are touching, and paint a brilliant portrait of the love Creasy is beginning to feel for this young girl, and how she is showing him that it is ok to live and feel again.  Once she's kidnapped the movie really kicks into overdrive and never lets up.  With outstanding performances from Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington, and terrific supporting actors like Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke, this movie is top-notch all the way.  Definitely not a movie to be missed!<br /><br />"Man on Fire" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>I was upset when I heard they were re-releasing this on DVD within MONTHS of it coming out for the first time! They've also done this for The Day After Tomorrow and I, Robot in order to promote Fantastic Four in theaters. Fox is also re-releasing Dodgeball on DVD with one minute of extra footage, but no new features. There are also rumors that Fox will be re-releasing Die Hard Collector's Edition sometime this year or next to tie in to the release of Die Hard 4.0 (whenever it finally gets made, that is). It seems Fox has reversed -- they used to release Special Editions first (Fight Club, Big Trouble in Little China), then stop making those and release one-disc versions. Now, they do the opposite. They release one-disc versions and then months later release two-discs. Europe does not. Here in the UK, I Robot and Man on Fire were given two-disc treatments from the very beginning.<br /><br />Also, Miramax is releasing a barebones, no special features edition of SIN CITY in August, but they've already confirmed that a Special Edition is planned for Christmas '05. That's four months after the initial release. Why can't they just get it right the first time instead of suckering us all out of our hard-earned cash?<br /><br />I do like this DVD and it's not the cash-in I thought it would be (hey, it comes with an insert, how rare is THAT these days?!). But it's still not right and I refuse to buy I Robot and the others, just to make a point. I hope we'll soon learn and stop this ridiculous marketing ploy.<br /><br />It was bad enough when old releases were given Special Editions right after we bought the old DVDs, but to release Special Editions of brand new films mere months after they've been released for the very first time is a real shame.<br /><br />My advice is this: Do not buy any single-disc new release Fox DVDs, because chances are later down the road there'll be a Special Edition.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>If you don't like violence, then, this movie is not for you. Man on Fire is one of those rare movies that takes you deep into the characters and their inner beings. Denzel shows a stunning performance as John W. Creasy, a heavy drinker in need of employment. The bond he has with "Pita", Dakota Fanning's character is almost magical. It's hard to talk about the movie without giving it away, but all I can say is, it's the best action movie I've seen in a long while. The movie seemed confusing at times due to the cinematography. You can't go to sleep on this one or you'll surely miss something important. There are subtitles throughout even when the characters are speaking English. But, even that concept was quite fascinating. This movie is Action, Drama, and Comedy all rolled into one. For all those Denzel fans, it's all you would expect him to be and then some. Great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington takes on another 'dark' role in 'Man on Fire.'  Washington plays Creasy, a former marine that is haunted by the those things he had to do in service to his country.  He struggles with God and agonizes over his past.  This malaise has manifested in a drinking problem.  On a trip to Mexico, Creasy meets up a comrade named Rayburn, played by Christopher Walken.  Rayburn encourages Creasy to take a job in Mexico City.<br /><br />Apparently, there is a severe kidnapping problem in Mexico.  Many prominent businessmen take out kidnapping policies on themselves and their families.  One of the requirements of the insurance policy is that they hire a bodyguard.  Creasy is hired by Samuel, played by Marc Anthony, at a discounted rate due to Creasy's drinking problem.  Samuel has a daughter named Pita, played by Dakota Fanning, that Creasy is hired specifically to protect.<br /><br />At first, Creasy resists developing a friendship with Pita.  However, he soon softens and develops a mentor role with the young lady.  This mentorship helps redeem Creasy...and then Pita is kidnapped while under Creasy's watch...<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, this is a dark film.  Washington's role is considerably darker than many of his other roles with notable exception of his role in 'Training Day.'  The difference is that despite what Creasy is capable of, he is still likeable.  What Creasy is capable of is some monstrous acts of revenge.<br /><br />Walken, although his role is limited, is also superb.  Unlike some of his recent roles, his performance in this film is comprehenisble and first rate.  Marc Anthony and Dakota Fanning also perform admirably.<br /><br />This movie is about redemption and revenge.  The themes are not subtle in the least.  Fans of revenge flicks will probably enjoy this film.  Those that like action may be a bit disappointed by the pace.  There is some predictability to this film as far as the story goes, but not in the acting.  The second half of the movie is rather gruesome, so it is not recommended to young viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>Denzel Washington plays a terrific redemption role as bodyguard Creasy in this revenge thriller: Man on Fire.<br /><br />With a nose for the truth and killer instincts only somewhat deadened by alcohol, Creasy fulfills his responsiblities to guard a precocious young girl, Peta. When he is crossed and double-crossed, he prepares to do his worst: interrogation and revenge on a large scale.<br /><br />The ending provides twists and turns but the strength of this film lies in its unabashed primary motive: revenge. And it is dastardly, effective, and sweet.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>This is a tale about a soul that's lost in the dark after years of personal torment. Denzel Washington plays to perfection that part,an ex fed Creasy, owner of the lost soul. After reaching the end of the road and the entrance of the pit a little stream of light shone on him via an unexpected source. What is amazing is how the relationship developes and how it climaxes to an emotional end.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>At the heart of Tony Scott's "Man on Fire" is Creasy (Denzel Washington) a tortured  alcoholic and emotionally scarred former Marine and CIA agent who's haunted by his past. Creasy finds work guarding nine-year-old Pita (Dakota Fanning) of  rich Mexican industrialist Samuel (Marc Anthony) and his American-born wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) at the recommendation of one of his old collegues (Christopher Walken). With so many family members "disappeared" south of the border and a major deal pending to manufacture cars, there's concern that Pita might be a target of kidnappers. Creasy expresses no interest in bonding with the girl because it reminds him to much of an incident from his past but Pita breaks through Creasy's hardened exterior reminding him of his humanity.  When Pita is taken, the wounded Creasy makes it his business to find her before she's killed.<br /><br />This is the second time "Man on Fire" has been adapted for the big screen. The first adaptation in 1987 featuring Scott Glenn, Jonathan Pryce, Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams and Jade Malle and directed by Elie Chouraqui disappeared without a trace when it was released. Since Tony Scott was originally on tap to direct the 1987 version, he looked to the past when looking for his next project after the well received "Spy Game". With Marlon Brando completely out of the picture for the role (he was considered for Scott's planned version in 1987), Bruce Willis, Will Smith and Robert De Niro all taking passes on the role, Denzel Washington stepped into the role after a chance meeting with director Scott. Washington plays the role to perfection. His Creasy although a burned out husk of a man, has just enough spark of humanity left so that he can be touched by Pita. Fanning once again gives an incandescent performance and the other members of the supporting cast including Radha Mitchell ("Pitch Black"), singer Marc Anthony, Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke all give marvelously detailed performances. Although Scott becomes a bit obsessed with technique over story once the abduction occurs, his showy directorial style doesn't overwhelm the strong emotional material at the core of the story. Although it runs about 20 minutes too long, "Man on Fire" is a perfect action thriller and compliments Scott's best work ("Crimson Tide", "The Hunger", "True Romance") avoiding the cliches of his hack work ("Beverly Hills Cop II", "Top Gun", "The Last Boy Scout").<br /><br /> Another top notch transfer from Fox, "Man on Fire" looks very good on DVD with most of its disc space devoted to the feature itself. The grainy look of the film, unusual textures and the muted colors that represent Creasy's emotional state are all captured remarkably well. The explosive 5.1 sound mix also grabs your attention. Scott and his sound mixer do a stellar job at reproducing the atmosphere of Mexico City in the detailed surround mix. There's a considerable amount of texture and detail that's well reproduced for the DVD.<br /><br />When it comes to extras "Man on Fire" runs cold. We only get a Fox advertisement "Inside Look" that gives us a glimpse at the trailer for the forthcoming thriller "Hide and Seek" and a brief behind-the-scenes promo for "Taxi".<br /><br />We get two wonderful commentary tracks. The first features director Tony Scott solo discussing what attracted him to the story in the first place both in 1986 and in 2002 when he chose to direct screenwriter Brian Helgeland's ("Mystic River", "L.A. Confidential", "The Order" and "A Knight's Tale"). Writer Helgeland, producer Foster ("Walking Tall", "Crimson Tide") and actress Fanning all vie for your attention on a second audio commentary track. All three discuss Scott's edgy direction, the performances and the changes the script when through from inception to production. Surprisingly, Fanning more than holds her own with these two seasoned veterans. Hearing these three discuss Scott's approach to the film and their candid assessment of what works and doesn't is also a highlight.<br /><br /> A taunt, well directed thriller "Man on Fire" provides Denzel Washington to investigate the haunted world of Creasy. Filled with a number of marvelous performances, edgy direction and a well written script, "Man on Fire" received an undeserved critical drubbing by many critics (probably because of Scott's association with the project). Seeing it on home video makes the over-the-top production and visual style less of an issue because the emotional aspect of the film becomes more powerful.</p></br></body></html>

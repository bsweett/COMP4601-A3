Hence I passed on it when it was in theaters and I waited this long to finally watch it On Demand. Turns out that Moneyball is the best movie that I've watched so far this year.<br /><br />The movie adapts Michael Lewis's 2003 book of the same name and is the story of how Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane took the team from the sound of losing to the roar of winning. Brad Pitt plays Beane and Jonah Hill plays assistant GM Peter Brand, and both were masterfully casted for the roles.<br /><br />I've heard the endless criticism that Brad Pitt is successful only because he's a pretty boy, and I have to ask: what the heck is that all about? Pitt is excellent in Moneyball and at times I felt like I was watching a video documentary of the actual Oakland A's back-office for most of the movie. Pitt can act, and Hill seamlessly stepped away from comedy for this dramatic role. The rest of the cast was great too; I thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman really was A's Manager Art Howe.<br /><br />The movie runs a little long at about 2 and a quarter hours, but the time went fast and it felt shorter than that. So that's a good thing. There's really not a lot more to say here other than to reiterate that what may seem like a boring movie on the surface is actually an uplifting, compelling movie that entertained me from start to finish. May not be a collector's item, but it's certainly worth a spot in the top of your viewing queue. Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Bennett Miller's "Moneyball", starring Brad Pitt, was an enjoyable look at what goes on behind the scenes in the world of baseball.  I'm still not quite sure what was so radical about the "new way" Pitt's Billy Beane character selected players, as he just seemed to think outside the box a little more often than his scouts and advisors did, but then I'm not a huge baseball expert.  I did enjoy that it was a sports movie that was generous in its subtlety and light on simplistic moments of triumph.  The skillful, effective balance of heart and smarts helped, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Sabermetrics is at the soul of this film, which has been adapted from Michael Lewis's book based on Oakland Athletics's remarkable 2002 season. The story begins with the bolting of three free agents. The dilemma for Billy Beane ( Brad Pitt) as the GM is how to compete with a team with a payroll like the New York Yankees. Guided by the ideas of Sabermetrics and a young assistant Peter Brand ( Jonah Hill) they come up with a list of players who are affordable but have been given a chance because of negative perceptions about them. This approach shakes up the team and upsets the scouts and the manager Art Howe ( Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Director Benett Miller takes us through the season all the way to their history making victory streak. This may sound like a documentary but the director and the screen writer have looked for stories within the team such as the arrogance of David Justice, the lack of interest in the game by Jeremy Giambi and the reluctant but ultimate hero Scott Hatteberg. It is however Billy Beane and his assistant Charles Brand who walk away with the accolades as their performance is amazing, understated and amazing. Money Ball is worth a look at  the game you thought you knew so much about but know so little.

That defeat hurts but now he is losing his best team players, the stars, to teams like the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Socks at salaries that his cash poor team cannot begin to match!<br /><br />The question is, "How do you beat big money?"<br /><br />While in meetings with his scouting agents, he listens to them about all of the prospects that they are recommending. While he hears about baseball skills he also hears about "handsome faces" and "ugly girlfriends". He realizes that baseball scouting is not the panacea to solve his biggest problem. How do you build a winning team with a limited budget?<br /><br />While out trying to trade players he meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who is a Yale economics graduate working for the Cleveland Indians. He learns that young Peter is a man who has no baseball experience but is listened to by the management of the Indians. He hires him and finds out that Pete has developed a mathematical relationship between baseball players and their skills and how to match those skills to a team to win games. Billy's goal is to win the last game of the season! The World Series!<br /><br />What develops is that Billy and Pete rebuild the Oakland A's with a bunch of misfits that nobody else wants and tries to build a winning team. The team's field coach fights them every step of the way.<br /><br />This is based on a true story about how these guys' vision of professional baseball reworked the model that is used today to build championship teams.</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>There are well over 100 reviews of this film on Amazon now - most of them based on the theatrical release - so I won't bore you with many more details about the film itself. I'll concentrate more on the DVD release - especially the Blu-Ray disc which has a few more Special Features than the Standard DVD.<br /><br />As for the film, I'm not a huge sports fan but I was engaged throughout the full two-hour-plus length. Though Brad Pitt will always look like Brad Pitt playing someone, the rest of the cast including Philip Seymour Hoffman and the amazing Jonah Hill (sooooooo low key that you almost overlook his performance, but cheer with him in the end) blend in well with the REAL sports players that Director Bennett Miller incorporated into his cast. And fans of "The West Wing" (I'm a huge one) will spot some of the well-crafted lines by the screenplay writer, Aaron Sorkin.<br /><br />The Standard DVD bonus features include four deleted scenes (12 minutes), Blooper Rell (3 minutes), and  "Moneyball - Playing The Game" the standard "behind the scenes" featurette with lots of clips you have just seen(19 minutes).. The BD adds two more featurettes that are more interesting: "Drafting the Team" about casting (20 minutes) and "Adapting Moneyball" (about it's conversion into a film with discussions by the screenwriter. (16 minutes).<br /><br />Sports fans of any sport will love this.

Well, yes, in the case of Moneyball. Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, the general manager of the small market Oakland Athletics; his mission is to find a way to field a winning team with a fraction of the money that the Yankees and Red Sox have to snag big time players. With the help of stat geek Peter Brand, Beane acquires a ragtag group of castoffs and old timers who share a common trait: they have abilities that the entrenched scouting establishment has ignored. Based upon Michael Lewis' bestseller, Moneyball is an amazing film, and while baseball obsessives will find a couple things to quibble about -- the movie barely mentions the contributions of stars like Miguel Tejada, Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, or Eric Chavez -- this is an intelligent, witty piece of moviemaking. A new Blu-ray/DVD/UltraViolet combo pack comes with several making-of featurettes and bloopers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>I am not a baseball fan but I did find this picture pretty interesting. Moneyball refers to wealthier teams getting the better players and in this film we see Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill coming up with a new analysis on how to effectively use baseball players who are underrated. It's a nice ride as to how the Oakland A's had their big wins  Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a supporting roll as the A's manager. Note that this is based on a novel of a similar title by Michael Lewis. Baseball fans will enjoy this picture more than me.

But this is the basis for the movie Moneyball. Brad Pitt stars as Athletic A's General Manager Billy Beane.<br /><br />Back in the day, Beane was drafted into the Pros right out of High School on the promise that he was going to be one of the greatest ball players in the history of baseball. Alas, this prophecy did not pan out. Beane never grew into the athlete the scouts imagined he would become, and after multiple trades, he became a scout and then GM of the A's.<br /><br />After losing three of their greatest players to the Yankees, Beane realizes they will never compete with the kind of money teams like New York or Boston are willing to throw around. He visits Cleveland for a possible trade and meets a fresh-from-Yale gradutate, played by Jonah Hill.<br /><br />Hill's ideas about players and how the stats come into play for scouts intrigues Beane who hires him as his new Assistant.<br /><br />Of course, their new ways of doing things upsets the veteran scouts and even the team's field manager. (Philip Seymour Hoffman)<br /><br />How could a bunch of no-namers lead a team to victory?<br /><br />I was impressed with Jonah Hill. I have grown tired of his kind of comedy so it was refreshing to see him in a semi-serious role next to the always-great Pitt. And Philip Seymour Hoffman can hit any role out of the park.<br /><br />This is a decent baseball movie. It tacks on the added bonus of being based on actual events. So even though you may know how the movie will end, it's fun to see how things worked out behind the scenes.<br /><br />The only downside was the length. There were many times I felt it could have ended or, at least, cut out a few scenes to make it not as long. Of course it could have been that I was tired and ready for bed but had to finish the film first...</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>This movie does a great job of relating how a small market team attempted to compete with the evil Yankees.

"Moneyball" based on the book by Michael Lewis that documented how General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt)for the Oakland A's used an unconvetional approach to put together a team on a budget--using computer analysis to draft players that will fill their slots but still allow them to reach their goal of the play-offs and, perhaps, the World Series. Since Bean can't afford the team that the Yankees can he has to find a way to out play them by finding undervalued players.<br />Beane taps Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to help him find those players that can provide them what they need--to get on base and make runs.<br /><br />Pitt does a terrific job as Beane a former major league player who "had it all" but didn't end up living up to his potential. Pitt is ably supported by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the team's manager who has an adversarial relationship<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks magnificent on Blu-ray with a sharp, colorful transfer with great depth and textures (this, of course, is the case for the film itself not for the TV footage that shows up in the film).<br /><br />Audio sounds terrific with an immersive DTS lossless 5.1 presentation that puts audio action all around your system. The film also features subtitles in English.<br /><br />The special features for this set are quite good as well. "Drafting The Team" focuses on casting the movie while "Adapting Moneyball" focuses on the challanges of making the non-fiction book into a dramatic film and combining two different drafts of the script one written by Aaron Sorkin and the other written by Steven Zallian. "Reinventing The Game" focuses on how Beane's approach helped revolutionize the game having an impact that helped other smaller market teams to make it to the World Series. "Playing The Game" focuses on MLB's involvement in making the film.<br /><br />Finally we get a couple of extended/alternate scenes as well as a brief gag reel.<br /><br />The set also includes a standard DVD as well as the dreaded Ultra Violet copy that allows you to stream the film (but only while online and only if you have an account which really does suck for those who want to watch this on their portable device).<br /><br />You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy "Moneyball" which gives us the story of an underdog team and their GM's attempt to give them some parity withy the big city teams.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>This movie is based on a true story and is a must see for baseball fans, especially those who play fantasy ball. After losing his top ballplayers, Oakland A's GM Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) finds himself a computer nerd (Jonah Hill) to pick players for him, players that are cheap. They sign a catcher (Chris Pratt) who can't throw, an outfielder (Nick Porrazzo) with an iron glove, a "has been" with bad knees (Stephen Bishop), and a pitcher (Casey Bond) who throws underhand. The stat they use to obtain talent in the film is primarily "On Base Percentage" (OBP).<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman, nearly unrecognizable with his head shaved, plays Art Howe the field manager of the team. The movie is interrupted by flash backs in Billy Beane's baseball player career, and his present home life. Art Howe doesn't like the team he has been dealt and fails to manager the team according to the expectations of Billy Beane. This is primarily the fault of Billy Beane who failed to bring in Art Howe on the decision making process to obtain the new players. Howe looks at them as being defective and unusable.<br /><br />A person can watch and enjoy "Secretariat" without being a horse race fan. This movie is different in that it incorporates a lot of baseball jargon. It attempts to have universal appeal, but I would suspect non-fans might lose interest.

In the process the team is losing three of its best players. The Athletics have a thirty million dollar cap on their players versus the Red Sox and New York Yanklees, who have hundreds of millions. Beane needs to replace these players, but the members of his scouting teams just give him the same old tired story of the players that will probably work out with practice. Beane wants another method to pick his players. At a meeting with another team he finds a young, short, chubby man, Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill, who spouts statistics and crunched numbers to arrive at an algorithm for players who will do well. He hires Brand and changes his methods and that of his team.<br /><br />Brand is a nerdy Yale graduate who looked at the  strict cost-benefit analysis of baseball players. He persuaded Beane that he should hire based on key performance statistics that pointed to undervalued players. They assembled a team that seemed foolhardy at first, but during the course of a season, proved itself the biggest bargain in baseball. Beane antagonized most of his scouts, but he was proved correct. At the end of the season he is invited to Boston to meet the Red Sox owner. When he returns to Oakland he talks with Brand, and tells him, "I don't play for money, I play for the love of the game". Oh, yes, the love of what you are doing. A lucky man and one who knows and is happy with himself. A loner, a divorced man with a daughter he loves, but all in all a man who is fine living alone.<br /><br />This is not just a film for baseball lovers, but a film for all of us who can see that a new way, a change from the old ways is almost always a good thing.<br /><br />Highly Recommended,  prisrob 01-12-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UKJX4E">The Tree Of Life</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IZJZIU">Accepted (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Moneyball", based on Michael Lewis' book of the same name, follows the 2002 season of baseball's Oakland Athletics, behind the scenes, as General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) meets a lot of resistance to his new strategy. In an effort to put together a winning team on a paltry budget, Beane has taken the advice of his new Assistant Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale-educated statistician, and decided to choose players strictly by the numbers. He looks for players who have particular talents but whom other teams have undervalued, so he can pick them up cheap. The team's talent scouts take a dim view of the project, and the team's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is downright uncooperative.<br /><br />Michael Lewis was interested in Billy Beane's story, because it paralleled the shift from old-school experience and intuition to quantitatively-motivated decision-making that Lewis experienced on Wall Street in the 1980s and wrote about in his breakthrough book "Liar's Poker". Billy Beane taught baseball that it was choosing players the wrong way, and his "sabermetric", or quantitative, approach has gained considerable following since. The name of his assistant who crunched all the numbers in real life was Paul DePodesta, and he was educated at Harvard, not Yale. The methods they used were based on the work of Bill James, who pioneered the statistical approach to baseball in the 1980s.<br /><br />Unfortunately, screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin played it safe by including irrelevant, saccharine tidbits about Billy Beane's relationship with his 12-year-old daughter in order to "connect" with the audience or to "humanize" him or some such nonsense. This extraneous material only serves to make the movie too long. The writers use a classic underdog sports team structure, which is awkward, because the battle is not being waged by players on the baseball diamond, but rather between recruitment philosophies behind the scenes. Sorkin and Zaillian have plugged a story that is not about human relationships or underdogs into a paint-by-numbers plot that is.<br /><br />"Moneyball" would have done better to focus on the implications of the conflict between statistical analyses and the Old School, as this battle has been waged in many professions in recent decades. The fact that it reached professional sports, with its deeply entrenched traditions and market that thrives on nostalgia, shows how radically business culture has changed. But the filmmakers take a conventional approach, presumably to appeal to a wider audience. The writers sidestep the real conflict in favor of predictable filler. They dumb it down. It's an entertaining film but would have been a lot better had the writers done some writing instead of plugging the story into a pre-fab plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Last season after 20 years in the doldroms the Pittsburgh Pirates with a collection of little knowns on their roster found themselves in first place in the National League Central Division shortly after the All Star Break.  I was rooting for them to succeed except at the expense of my beloved Phillies.  Alas the dream was not to be as the Bucs wilted in the heat of the pennant race.  While their success lasted it was good for baseball.  Whether you are a large market team or small you break from spring training with the intention of winning the whole ball of wax.  If you are a Kansas City Royals fan you don't want to be told that your team doesn't have a chance from Jump Street.  As the baseball adage goes a season is a marathon not a sprint.  "Moneyball" starts after the 2001 campaign where the Oakland A's fall short in the American League Championship Series.  The small market A's are losing their star players for greener pastures and paychecks.  General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) asks the owner of the A's for more money to attract suitable replacements.  The money is not forthcoming.  Beane, not willing to throw in the towel, decides to think outside the box.  With the assistance of Yale economist Peter Brandt (Jonah Hill) they reconstruct the team with modestly priced players who compliment each other.  Is this fluorish enough to win the World Series?  Baseball fans already know the answer and novices would be behooved to find out.  The thing I admire most about "Moneyball" is it's affinity for our national pastime.  Sure the film has it's share of aracana and statistics but it gets everything right from the crack of the bat to the calls to sportstalk radio.  Pitt is charismatic as the wheeler-dealer Beane.  You believe he can charm a decent utility player from another team for one of his skirt chasing headaches.  Hill is every geeks dream.  He gets to play fantasy baseball with the Real McCoy!  Philip Seymour Hoffman is effectively taciturn as manager Art Howe who has to sink or swim with the machinations of Beane.  There has been much debate whether this is the greatest baseball film of all time.  That would be unfair to "Moneyball" or "Field of Dreams" or "Pride of the Yankees".  They are all quite different films that have baseball as a subtext.  As a fan of forty years it's impossible for me to say if the movie is accessible to non-fans.  Regardless, "Moneyball" hits a grand slam.</p></br><a href="../users/A18HHKM6WGEF9D.html">A18HHKM6WGEF9D</a><br/><p>...but it helps. This isn't strictly speaking a baseball movie, since it's focused on the business side of things. But there's still a lot of baseball talk and baseball footage, so being somewhat of a fan certainly helped me appreciate this movie. The main thing however, is that I really enjoyed Brad Pitt in this in a way I haven't in along time. He was perfect for his role as Billy Beane, General Manager for the Oakland A's in 2002 who revolutionized the way players are recruited and even the way the game is played by focusing on complex player statistics, as opposed to 'soft' factors. Pitt played the right combination of cockiness and desperation, and I thought it was one of his better career performances.<br /><br />Jonah Hill was also great as the Yale educated economist/statistician he hires, and the entire supporting cast worked. It's a fascinating story. The only thing that kept it from 5-stars for me is that it did drag a bit at times. I felt it could have been shortened a little in the middle, to keep the momentum going. But other than that this is a great movie for anyone looking for a mature adult drama...and if you like baseball, all the better!</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Don't like sports movies?  Me neither.  They're predictable; even the best of them (I'm thinking of THE FIGHTER) ultimately succumb to genre convictions.  Have no fear, however: MONEYBALL never truly does.  Because it's not a sports movie; it's a movie about sports movies, which also happens to be based on a true story of an underdog team that came up from the depths to take the industry by storm.<br /><br />Let me throw something out there, because it will become immediately transparent: with the exception of a hot girl in my high school geometry class, and Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, math and baseball are two of the most boring things in the world to me.  So when I tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed--and may even come to love--MONEYBALL, you'll get where I'm coming from.  Because it's a film about both.  It follows a general manager (Brad Pitt) who takes the advice of a novice scout (Jonah Hill) and decides to put together a team based not on money but on winning power, despite the resistance of his own scouts and managers.<br /><br />The film has an impressive pedigree behind it.  Director Bennett Miller (CAPOTE) has a sure hand; he knows how to create a scene and keep a story moving along.  The script comes from the likes of Steve Zaillan (everything from SCHINDLER'S LIST to THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) and Aaron Sorkin ("The West Wing," THE SOCIAL NETWORK), who both know how to craft character and story.  But this is really an actor's film, and the lead actor here is the film's anchor.  Brad Pitt gives an award-worthy performance: subtle, nuanced, not necessarily the thing that wins Oscars but that deserves to (and just might; let us hold our breath in anticipation...or not).  He's helped out with a tremendous supporting cast, most notably Jonah Hill, giving a surprisingly straight-laced (though still quietly humorous) performance, Kerris Dorsey (grossly underused as Beane's daughter), and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the resistant manager who tangles with Beane's forward-thinking policies.  They help flesh out a film that would have been an interesting story, but may have become a big of a drag.  Truly, watch this film for Pitt's performance; stay for Hill's; and relish in a true story that manages to defy genre stereotypes and is, ultimately, a refreshing "behind the scenes" sports film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>I've never been a big fan of Brad Pitt, but even I have to admit that he knocked it out of the park here on two levels: as the producer and driving force behind the film (even as it lingered in turnaround h-ll for years) and in his spot-on portrayal of Billy Beane.  I am, however, a long-time fan of Michael Lewis dating back to his debut with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039333869X">Liar's Poker</a>.  [Heck, I even read 'Losers' in its little-remembered original incarnation as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0517286955">Trail Fever</a>.]  It says a lot that Lewis - skeptical as to how 'Moneyball' could ever be made into a film - has come out as a huge fan of the end product (I suspect - even though he took the money - that the same cannot be said of his view of the celluloid version of "The Blind Side").<br /><br />Lewis' hard-won approval says a lot about the combined talents of director Bennett Miller, screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, producer/star Pitt and an inspired cast, most notably Jonah Hill (an unlikely but relevatory pick as composite character, Peter Brand) and Phil Hoffman (who nails the dyspeptic Art Howe and his Venus and Mars relationship with Beane).  They distilled the essence of the story, delicately nailing the balance that Lewis achieves in the book: the juxtaposition of the deep-dive into the statistical arcania of Sabermetrics hard alongside rich character studies of the fascinating, complex Beane (Lewis knew he hit a goldmine there) and intriguing cases like Scott Hatteberg, a player whose career both defined and vindicated this new approach to baseball.  That juxtaposition is the Lewis oeuvre in a nutshell: it's the same feat he pulled off in "The Blind Side" (unlike "Moneyball," that film's makers gave only the briefest glimpse to the economics behind the fascination with Michael Oher's playing potential)<br /><br />About the only headscratcher here: why Paul Depodesta (Bean's real-life Peter Brand) would pull his participation from the film.  The guy's out giving speeches trading on that relationship (he even uses Lewis' agency), so why he passed on getting himself represented directly in the film doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>I think you have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this slow-paced adaptation of Michael Lewis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393338398">book</a>.  I thought Brad Pitt was very good as Billy Beane, and Jonah Hill excellent as Peter Brand, who used Bill James' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0879464739">methods</a> to evaluate ballplayers and help Beane rebuild a team on a relatively shoe-string budget at Oakland.  The film offers flashbacks to Beane's playing time, a kid with great potential but had failed to measure up to the big leagues.  This seemed to influence Beane's decision to play the percentages rather than become overly enamored with a ball player's swing or the crack of the bat.  Beaneball, as it would come to be called, worked predominantly with on-base percentages, driving scouts and manager Art Howe up the wall.  There are a lot of nice personal touches in the film, such as Beane's relationship to his 12-year-old daughter and his attempts to reach out to his players when the A's were in a big slump.  The film captures the emotional high of the A's improbably 20-game run, and the low of their playoff defeat to the Twins.  For Beane, it was all about winning the last game.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 2.5<br /><br />  In many respects, 'Moneyball' is not any different from most 'baseball' movies that place the national pastime on its ubiquitous, saccharine pedestal. That can be expected. Where 'Moneyball' differs, is that it seeks to invite a new 'player' to the table--the computer geek. Now all the aspiring Bill Gates' of the world can take a seat with the battle-scarred, beer-swilling veterans, who've been analyzing the game for years, utilizing an intuition grounded in their 'gut' perceptions, instead of a set of statistics, organized by a computer program. This is the basic premise of Brad Pitt's overrated Academy Award nominated film, which is more about the business of baseball, than the game itself.<br /><br />  For awhile, the story of Billy Beane, the former mediocre baseball player turned general manager of the Oakland A's baseball team, proves to be fairly interesting. After failing to beat the NY Yankees in the first round of the playoffs in 2001, the owner of the As gives Beane an ultimatum: win the World Series next year, but with a vastly reduced budget (as the A's principal players, such as Jason Giambi, have been traded away). Beane meets with his staff of scouts (played by former professional baseball players and scouts), who lend a real air of credibility to the proceedings. That group appears to be clueless and sends Beane in search of a new approach to resolve his quandary of finding underrated baseball talent, without the aid of the big bucks.<br /><br />  While attempting to negotiate a trade with the Cleveland Indians, Beane discovers a low level Indian employee, statistician Peter Brand, a Yale graduate, who picks players by means of sophisticated computer analysis (Brand is a composite character based primarily on Beane's real-life top assistant, Paul DePodesta, who refused permission to use his name in the film). Geeky Jonah Hill plays Brand, and for half of Act 2, he advises Beane on which bargain basement players to trade for. Brand looks primarily at 'on base percentage' and Beane (with Brand in tow) makes a house call , on one occasion, to fading major league catcher, Scott Hatteberg, asking him whether he'd be interested in converting to playing first base (the answer is of course, affirmative!). Beane manages to pick up more bargains, including submarine hurler, Chad Bradford, with the aid of Brand, and by the time spring training rolls around, Beane is confident that his motley crew, can compete against the more financially endowed teams, including their ultimate nemesis: the Yanks!<br /><br />  The drama (and one's interest), only lasts for a little while longer. There's an effective scene where Beane comes into conflict with his scouting crew, who resent the presence of Brand, and his disdain for their 'intuition'. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, manages to acquit himself nicely as A's manager, Art Howe, who doesn't like Beane telling him how to manage his team (but his part is all too brief). Sadly, the narrative eventually has nowhere to go, as there's virtually no additional interesting enough conflict, which propelled the characters so fitfully along, in the film's first half. The A's 20 game winning streak is attributed to Brand's highly questionable miracle system (it should be noted that the A's still had some 'big money' holdovers, such as pitchers Zito and Hudson, who were not selected as a result of Brand's machinations). Brand has little to do in the second half of the film, except act as Beane's glorified cheerleader, with Beane, now wheeling and dealing on his own, sometimes acting outside the purview of his brainiac assistant. Nonetheless, the film's scenarists afford the geeky Brand, with his own hagiography, now allowed to sit at the table with 'the big boys'.<br /><br />  Without a doubt, 'Moneyball' has perhaps the most anti-climactic climax, in recent film history. Not only do the A's fail to make the first round of the Division playoffs but we're told that Beane is still trying to earn his first World Series ring. Even more embarrassing (and this is supposed to be impressive), we're told that the Red Sox, utilizing Beane and Brand's statistical approach, win their first World Series since 1918, a couple of years later. Beane's consolation prize is thus held up as some kind of great victory for humanity!<br /><br />  'Moneyball' is one of the few baseball films, that refuses to fictionalize the characters they are portraying. Unfortunately, we learn next to nothing about any of them, except for the fact that they have hearts of gold (again, as to be expected). Some time is spent portraying the aging David Justice, as a surly, 'non-team' player. But after a pep talk from Beane, he agrees to 'step up to the plate', and provide guidance to the 'younger players', who soon come together and accomplish the miracle 20 game winning streak.<br /><br />  All-Star writers Sorkin and Zaillian fall flat in attempting to infuse Beane's character, with a meaningful internal arc. Beane must not only overcome his past failure as a player (which we see in a series of flashbacks), but also must bond with his teenage daughter. Beane's nobility is undercut by such pretentious pronouncements as "money is not important", even though he's portrayed as a ruthless wheeler dealer, who uses shady tactics to gain an advantage over his rivals. According to Beane, introducing the new dry world of statistics, is what he wants to be remembered for, not earning a World Series ring.<br /><br />  'Moneyball' must also contend with the additional deficit of another 'phone in' Brad Pitt performance. No matter how hard he tries, Pitt invariably cannot play anyone but Brad Pitt. Ultimately, Pitt should not be completely blamed for attempting to elevate Beane (and baseball) to mythic status. In the end, however, it's the general public, who, year after year, places the 'national pastime', on that saccharine pedestal. After all, baseball, is nothing more than a business and entertainment spectacle, and anyone who tells you otherwise, is, I believe, trying to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>this is one of brad pitt's very best performances.  he buries himself underneath general manager billy beane of the oakland  baseball team. he looks average.  he has a down home manner when he relates to other people. you completely believe that he is billy and not brad pitt.  this is not achieved through five hours in a makeup chair either.<br /><br />we have another all star in the making of this movie too by having aaron sorkin as the screenwriter.  sorkin writes brilliant script after brilliant script.  The Social Network was just one of these.<br /><br />jonah hill as the yale grad in econonmics is great as billy's sidekick, pete.  it is his idea that you can create a better team by not going after stars but by instead analyzing their worth and abilities by computer program. billy and pete build an entirely new team using this radical new premise.  they thus can build a more competitive team with the money they have since they do not have the money to go after stars.  i wish MARGIN CALL had been able to explain the economics in its premise as well as Sorkin does the economics of baseball.<br /><br />a lot of the dramatic tension in the film comes from all the underlings to billy who absolutely want to stick to the old way of doing things, especially the coach played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. all in all, it is an excellent film about a little known but all important aspect of professional baseball.</p></br><a href="../users/A3J5V2GMXMOGCI.html">A3J5V2GMXMOGCI</a><br/><p>A baseball movie about the sports racket, and applying corporate concepts to picking players.  Director Bennett Miller manages to milk some suspense out of a foregone story, but it still boils down to a locker-room soap opera.  Pitt plays it with conceited ease, and the casting of lardass Hill and a wasted Hoffman is questionable.  There is some terrible pandering with hokey, maudlin scenes between Daddy and daughter (yuck!).  Typical of the genre inspite of what you may have heard.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Baseball is a game of spitting, crotch scratching and often interminably long innings. Moneyball is a movie that deconstructs the myths of America's home-style game and shows how it becomes an exemplar of big business. By the time Moneyball is over, baseball's traditions are as quaint as long underwear, the players have become work units, and computer analysis is still unknown by the fans as they munch their expensive hot dogs, slosh beer on their neighbors and scream joyously for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />This might seem harsh, but the first third of Moneyball, as Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, tears down traditions, rips the barnacles off the tradition-bound scouts and coaches, makes decisions that either are misunderstood or threaten the traditionalists, and gets rid of the players who don't produce just as heartlessly as a surgeon lopping off a useless finger or two, is great fun and great movie construction. The pairing of Brad Pitt (looking his nearly 50 years) as Billy Beane and Jonah Hill, as the young, round Peter Brand who doesn't know much about baseball but does know logic and analysis, is inspired. The two characters make a rich combination. The two actors make a faultless team. As Peter Brand tries to explain to Billy Beane his concept of building a winning team, we begin to understand the movie and Beane.<br /><br />Says Brand, "There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what is really happening. And this leads people who run Major League Baseball teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams. People who run ball clubs, they think in terms of buying players. Your goal shouldn't be to buy players, your goal should be to buy wins. And in order to buy wins, you need to buy runs. ...The Boston Red Sox see Johnny Damon and they see a star who's worth seven and half million dollars a year. When I see Johnny Damon, what I see is... is... an imperfect understanding of where runs come from. The guy's got a great glove. He's a decent leadoff hitter. He can steal bases. But is he worth the seven and half million dollars a year that the Boston Red Sox are paying him? No. No. Baseball thinking is medieval. They are asking all the wrong questions."<br /><br />Then there's the middle. We learn about Billy's sadness...his ex-wife, who seems a nice lady; his young daughter, who plays a guitar and sings awful songs of her own, I assume, composing. The brightest spot here is a brief scene with his former wife's new husband, played by Spike Jonz.  All of this is irrelevant, both to the story and to maintaining our interest.<br /><br />Then there's the last third: Final validation. An offer hard to refuse. A grand gesture. The loneliness of Billy Beane. A lot of driving around. Its all piece parts that writer Aaron Sorkin most probably couldn't bear to cut or eliminate.<br /><br />We start out with a superbly constructed and acted feel-good movie. The slow letdown into Hollywood predictability, earnestness and personal angst is disappointing. The movie runs 2 hours and 13 minutes. Slogging through the last half makes it seem longer.<br /><br />Phillip Seymore Hoffman is unnecessarily cast as the Athletics' head coach, an experienced baseball traditionalist who disagrees with Billy Beane. Any competent character actor could have effectively played the role. Casting Hoffman was indulgence on someone's part, I assume, so that Pitt and Hoffman could have a couple of "acting" moments.<br /><br />The first third of Moneyball was so good I wished the rest of the movie had kept up.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>MONEYBALL is gathering a lot of acclaim as an Oscar potential contender on several levels, so much so that for those who have little interest in baseball in general have overcome that inertia and have watched this film primarily out of devotion to the work of Brad Pitt.  For this viewer the film is long on tedium, lacking in excitement and character involvement and focusing on the financial background of a sport that is supposed to be for the pleasure of the public. Yes, there are moments of interest in the concept of building a team based on saving money by hiring players who by statistics realized on a computer program show potential for building a solid team (as opposed to scouting for popular 'names' with the public and the media). These moments are underlined by the strong performance of Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, the Yale Economics graduate who comes up with `the concept'.<br /><br />The story is based on Michal Lewis' book `Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game' and adapted for the screen by Stan Chervin, Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian.  Bennett Miller directs.  The story is basically a docudrama about the Oakland Athletic's  General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who is faced with the loss of the best payers of his team to scouts from other clubs with bigger dollars. If he ever wants to win the World Series, Billy must find a competitive advantage. Billy is about to turn baseball on its ear when he uses statistical data to analyze and place value on the players he picks for the team.<br /><br />Oakland A's GM Billy Beane is handicapped with the lowest salary constraint in baseball. If he ever wants to win the World Series, Billy must find a competitive advantage. Billy is about to turn baseball on its ear when he uses statistical data to analyze and place value on the players he picks for the team. The rest of the film is a push pull game played in the boardroom, with the manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and with certain players (Chris Pratt, Stephen Bishop et al). Tossed in for some reality testing is Billy's daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey), ex-wife (Robin Wright), and a few encounters with reappearing people.<br /><br />The idea for the film is solid but it wears thin because it is so insular to Oakland.  The fact that it is a true story (with a less than satisfying ending) probably will attract some viewers.  It certainly is not Brad Pitt's best role to date, not does the film seem that it will have much holding power.  But, if you are a fan of baseball it just may ring your chimes.

How many times have you watched the story of an underdog triumphing? How many movies introduce us to a controversial coach who is initially resented because of his methods and then revered by all when he succeeds? This story is certainly a celebration of success, but not in the typical sense. In fact, it asks us to define success.<br /><br />It's based on the true story of how General Manager Billy Beane (Pitt) employed a new way of thinking in order to enable the Oakland Athletics to compete with the likes of the New York Yankees. He did this with just one third of the payroll of that available to the Yankees.The opening scenes show Beane negotiating with the team's owner. He knows that his payroll won't jump from $40 million to $120 million, but can he get a little more money to help the A's compete?<br /><br />The first thing I was taught in my college marketing class was to define the problem. How you can analyze a problem if you don't know what it is? You won't solve anything until you know what you are trying to do. I find that I use the same technique in all areas of my life. If a friend needs help or advice, I ask a series of questions so that they can eventually define their own problem. It works. That's what Beane did at the start of Moneyball.<br /><br />Beane's first move was to hire Peter Brand (Hill); an economics graduate from Yale. Instead of relying on traditional scouting methods, Brand used statistical analysis to determine the true value of baseball players. Instead of paying huge salaries based on a player's potential, he sought out value by considering players who were believed to have flaws. These might include injury or advancing age. Beane collaborated with Brand to assemble a team on a low budget. Departing stars were replaced with players who were a good fit for the team.<br /><br />I have a strong connection with the film because the way Beane and Brand think reminds me of how I manage my Fantasy Football teams. Which players are good value because age or injury has changed people's perceptions of their true ability? How much are this year's top draft picks really going to be worth when compared to proven veterans? I make those determinations every year when I build my team. Beane and Brand think like I do, and we tend to like people who are similar to ourselves.<br /><br />I rely on my own way of thinking rather than following conventional wisdom. That doesn't mean I will ignore everything, but I will question the opinions of others and decide whether I agree. It's something I have done my entire life and one reason I review movies. You might not agree with me, and that's absolutely fine, but at least you know that I'm not just repeating the opinions of others. Take a look at my thoughts on The Artist if you want an example.<br /><br />Groupthink is a dangerous thing. I encounter it every year in my Fantasy Football leagues when the rankings of the "experts" all start to look the same. If you go against the grain, you'll have to be ready to defend your view. As a result, people are afraid to say what they really think or act on their true instincts. It also happens in the workplace. In fact, you can find examples of groupthink every day if you seek out opinions on the Internet on just about any topic.<br /><br />Back to Moneyball.<br /><br />Look at how Beane's scouts present their opinions. How many are really their opinions, and how many of them fail to think outside the established framework?<br /><br />The dialogue is intelligent and full of humor. Some of the scenes, such as Beane pursuing trades with other teams, are quite exciting. Pitt and Hill work well together and are in most of the scenes. One source of conflict is Coach Art Howe (Hoffman). He's concerned about his own situation and future in the sport, and is reluctant to adopt Beane's desired strategy.<br /><br />I enjoyed Moneyball because it was different and the story was told in an appealing way. I won't ruin the ending for those who don't remember whether the A's won the World Series, but I will say that the story doesn't show a huge amount of baseball action. This is about the people behind the scenes and the way in which they affected the sport.<br /><br />Rarely has 133 minutes of Dialogue been so interesting. The time passes almost too quickly. I've seen Moneyball about six times since buying it in January, so there's no need to wonder about the replay value. From my ramblings in this review, you can see how thought-provoking the story can be.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />One final point I would like to consider is Beane's decision at the end of the film.<br /><br />Most of us are trained at a very young age to chase success and be the best we can be. Success is usually defined as having a good job, a great salary, expensive and prestigious possessions, and a traditional family. If we reach any of our goals, we set new ones and want more. We always want more.<br /><br />Beane's final decision mirrored his thoughts on baseball management. He considered what would truly make him happy. I don't see people thinking along those lines very often. We are trapped by the expectations of society. It's groupthink on a grand scale. Ask your friends what they dream of. How many mention money? That's the wrong answer. Money is a tool that helps you live the way you want to live, but it's not the overall goal. The goal is different for everyone and should be what makes you happy. Does your lifestyle actually allow you time to enjoy that happiness?<br /><br />Would you have made the same choice as Beane?<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br /><br />Sony's presentation looks great for the most part. There's plenty of detail and depth. Colors appear accurate and well-defined. The only minor fault is the presence of noise in many of the scenes. It doesn't ruin the experience, but it's hard to dismiss it completely. The movie uses a few TV shots and some archive footage, and that's clearly of lesser quality than the majority of the presentation. That's purely intentional and no fault in the transfer.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br /><br />This is a story which relies more on dialog than anything else.

They tend to be uplifting or inspiring in some way, but they're ultimately just too generic for my taste. Moneyball, based on Michael Lewis' book of the same name and derived from a true story, isn't a run-of-the-mill baseball movie and successfully breaks from some of those generic conventions, while managing to be crowd-pleasing enough for the average viewer. Adapted by two Academy Award-winning screenwriters, Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (coincidentally, the writers behind David Fincher's previous two films), it's an intelligent, well-structured film that moves quickly and hits all the right emotional cues.<br /><br />`Based on a true story' is a relative term in Hollywood and I'm not sure how closely Moneyball sticks to the truth in its story, but that has little bearing on how well the story is told. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, a former Major League baseball player, working as the general manager of the Oakland Athletics. Upset with his underfunded team's recent loss and the impending departure of three star players, Billy attempts to overcome the financial restrictions that stand in his way of putting together a competitive. At a failed meeting, Billy meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a young man with an economics degree from Yale, who specializes in player analysis. Using a sabermetric approach, based on a theory by Bill James, Brand has formulated an unorthodox way to assess a player's value. Beane hires Peter as Assistant General Manager and begins to put his theories to the test, despite the opposition from the more traditional baseball scouts who don't see the theories assisting Billy's ramshackle team. Billy faces a particularly dismissive attitude from the Oakland A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who refuses to put some of Billy and Peter's ideas into motion due to his stress of working under a one-year contract. Baseball history buffs may know how everything pans out here, but I found it mostly unexpected.<br /><br />Pitt is charismatic and quick-witted in his role. It's a gum-smacking, charming performance that is just subtle enough to score a potential Oscar win. He has some tough competition, but appearing in two of the best films of the year certainly won't hurt his chances. Hill has received some attention for playing against type and he shows a previously unseen dramatic depth playing Peter Brand. Hill has been written off in some circles as a one-note comedic actor, but with his performance here and in last year's Cyrus he proves that he may have quite the emotional well to tap from. I wouldn't call his performance Oscar-worthy (no reflection on him, it's just not written to be), but his character is such a departure from his typical sarcastic persona, as well as likable and meek enough, that he may be nominated for one of the big awards. The screen is populated with some fine actors, but with so much focus on Pitt and Hill most are relegated to the background. Hoffman, reuniting with director Bennett Miller, who directed Hoffman to Oscar glory in Capote, deserves some recognition for his role as the cynical manager. Also noteworthy is Robin Wright as Billy's ex-wife and director Spike Jonze, in a one-scene role, as Wright's awkward new husband.<br /><br />Unheard of in a baseball movie, there is more focus on people behind the scenes rather than on the field. The statistics and those who used them are the focal point, with attention being given to the players and actual on-field games only when it's necessary for an emotional payoff or to further the plot. Like he did in his Oscar-winning script for The Social Network, Sorkin takes numbers and data that would be incomprehensible to the average person in life and dull/confusing onscreen and somehow makes these pass by in an accessible, compelling manner. Along with Zaillian, he has made the thinking-man's baseball movie that, ironically, does the thinking for you.<br /><br />Moneyball is a strange version of the Hollywood, sports film that follows the traditional template enough to draw viewers in and breaks from it enough to please viewers looking for something a little different. With two of Hollywood's brightest screenwriters, a talented director, and an eclectic cast giving some terrific performances, it carries a rather anti-Hollywood message and is accessible enough to be enjoyed by sports fans and non-sports fans. Against the odds, it's an exceptional slice of Americana and extraordinarily crowd-pleasing entertainment.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>A baseball GM tries to change the way things are done, and succeeds, somewhat.

As such, I vividly remember the events surrounding the 2002 Oakland Athletics that are the prime content of this film.  "Moneyball" does an incredible job of recreating the nostalgia of those events, as well as telling the story behind them that likely was not known at the time.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Moneyball" focuses on the character of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the GM of the Oakland A's who realizes in the early 2000s that he can't spend with the "big boys" (e.g. New York) that comprised his competition.  As such, with the help of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and to the consternation of A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Beane uses the statistical analyses popularized by Bill James to build a team capable of dethroning the Yankees on a shoestring budget.<br /><br />The hallmark of this film is that, to the viewer, it really won't matter if you're familiar with this story.  The narrative works either way:<br /><br />If your a newbie to all this "baseball-o-nomics" stuff, "Moneyball" does a great job of breaking things down and giving you the "Reader's Digest" version of the Moneyball concept.  You don't even have to be a baseball fan to "get it", as Beane's mindset and principles can be utilized in many walks of life.<br /><br />For those (like I) who devoured "Moneyball" in print form, it is just flat out amazing to see the events played out on the big screen.  Those of us who have been intrigued by the whole concept since those "early years" can sit back and be amazed by how it has truly changed the game.  The fact that a great deal of actual baseball footage is used only adds to the effect.<br /><br />About the only nitpick I can possibly find with this film is that the choreographed baseball scenes are not always entirely accurate.  This is a small nitpick, of course, but one that bugged me just a bit considering how easy it would have been to fix.<br /><br />Overall, "Moneyball" is a fantastic re-telling at perhaps the most revolutionary concept to ever be introduced to the sport...using in-depth statistical analysis to mine for talent that may be lost to the human eye.  Whether a hard-core baseball nut or just a casual movie-goer, "Moneyball" will impress you...just in different ways.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>I know little about baseball, but I quite liked this movie. It is the true story about how Oaklands Athletics manager Billy Beane (a fine performance by Brad Pitt), facing the loss of some of his best players after the end of the season, and with very little budget to hire good replacements, decided to apply statistical methods to find good but undervalued (and therefore, cheap) players. By traveling this path, he gets the opposition of much of the official baseball establishment (though this should not be exaggerated). To help him in this endeavor, he hired a young university graduate (played by Jonah Hill) to whom he soon becomes a mentor, introducing him to the business side of baseball. With these methods, Beane assembled a team for the following season that, while was unable to win the championship, did make it to the playoffs, and generally did much better than expected initially.<br /><br />The filmmakers are honest enough not to show Beane as a completely nice guy. He has a bad temper. He is cold and aloof with the players (he never travels with the team), refusing to become friends with them, in order to be easier to fire them. It is hinted that he wasn't that good as a husband. Despite these flaws, he is a compelling, generally sympathetic character.<br /><br />The movie basically believes that human intuition (in the form of the aging scouts) is no match for the mathematical and statistical methods of young nerds. If one has the romantic notion that not everything in life can be quantified, and that in some fields the human brain can still do better than a computer, then one feels oneself to be on the other side of the argument proposed by this movie.<br /><br />Also, although I'm not very knowledgeable about baseball, it seems to me that the changes proposed by Beane (no stolen bases, emphasis on reaching first base and not taking unnecessary risks) makes for a duller, if more standardized, game. So whether the end result of these changes he proposed made for a more entertaining game, it is debatable.<br /><br />But despite the fact that I was a bit uncomfortable with its thesis, I did like and enjoy the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Sitting with a cool beer in one hand, a hot dog in the other, a group of friends could easily argue the semantics of modern baseball until they were blue in the face.  With constant shut-outs, players pulling multi-million dollar deals and product-placement as the new American dream; it is not hard to see the modern athlete as being less skill-oriented and more pop-culture celebrity as they step up to the plate.  Who will sell more tickets?  Who will look good with an A-list actress on his arm?  Who can ensure Gatorade will always be sold in grocery stores?  These are tough questions facing baseball today, not who is the better player? Who can hit the ball further?  Who makes runs?  This change in one of America's most endearing past times is the topic of conversation in Bennett Miller's recent film, Moneyball, and his subject of choice - Oakland A's General Manager, Billy Beane - baseball's most notorious loser.<br /><br />Beane has always been interested in sports.  Playing basketball, baseball, and football in high school, he dropped football to ensure an old injury wouldn't hurt his baseball dreams.  After declining admission into Stanford University to join with the New York Mets, Beane soon realized that he couldn't match the same skill set.  Unable to change his decision about Stanford, Beane found comfort behind the scenes as first a scout and later as General Manager of the A's.  In Moneyball, he is played with lacking simplicity by Brad Pitt.  While Pitt's performance is being romanticized as award season rolls out, one can easily see it is not his best performance.  That does not mean Moneyball is a lackluster film.  While many argue this is Pitt's Blind Side, one could easily argue that this is Miller's The Departed (the film that Scorsese finally won for).  Like Scorsese, this isn't the greatest character film - but the best directorial effort this cinematic year.  This is a movie about statistics, about how over-valued the game of baseball has become, and how large pools of dollars do not necessarily man pennants at home.  This, without someone strong behind the camera, would be either a very dull movie about numbers or just another bio-pic about a leader that fell short in the final moments.  Thankfully, with Miller's ease, this becomes a watchable film about the "girth" of baseball.  As he intermixes real moments in baseball coupled with our actors doing their part, he also races the screen with statistical numbers, computer logarithms, and as Hill says early in the film, "...their own Island of Misfit Toys".  Miller transforms this from an underdog sports film to a story about the human condition.  He lingers on scenes that show Pitt on the phone arguing contracts, he demonstrates the absurdity of draft picks by painting a table of geriatrics looking for "Fabio", the endearing close shot of Pitt's worked eyes, and lacking voice of humanity when it is time to trade someone.  Yet, despite Pitt receiving most of the praise, Miller demonstrates finesse by giving us a movie that doesn't paint baseball in the greatest light.  Miller's visual of baseball isn't pretty, and throughout this very well lit film, a trained eye can catch his jabs and insults at today's modern game.<br /><br />To appease those who have read this far, we will discuss Brad Pitt, who meanders his way through this film by tossing chairs and snapping his fingers at Jonah Hill.  His character portrayal of Beane, to those who are unaware of Beane's life, will be confusing.  What is his relationship with his daughter?  Why is Spike Jonze with his wife?  Why does he work out so much during games?  Why did his mind suddenly flip statistically when he met Hill?  All of these questions will remain unanswered as you sit through the nearly two hours of Pitt attempting to grab at anything sports related.  I will give him that he is inspiring when he speaks, but as a majority of this film he is sitting, considering possibilities, and transforming into Zen Pitt - he just becomes pointless.  Perhaps it was Sorkin's writing that failed at developing anything secure, but Beane feels bland, like it is Pitt being Pitt on a lazy Sunday.  Sorkin's writing also creates further ailments as the film progresses - mismatched messages make us ask why we think Beane's daughter is creative, only to underscore the feeling by having her lip-sync a song about her Dad being a loser?  That immediately destroyed the emotion needed at that final moment by using a mere "American Idol" throwback.  It was instances like this that fumbled horribly in this film as well and felt like the film leftovers of Sorkin's other work, the greatly overpraised The Social Network.  Michael Lewis' work needed to have a stronger writer onboard to show value in the book that literally changed the face of baseball.  Pitt's performance will not even be remembered in a year's time.  Moneyball is Bennett Miller's film.  It is not a Brad Pitt movie.  It is about the broken nature of baseball.  It demands that we re-evaluate the grassroots of statistical analysis in the game and apply it to the valuation of the modern player (not just because he has an ugly girlfriend, he will be less confident).<br /><br />Needless to say, Moneyball is not a film that will make you feel good about baseball.  It is a dirty picture (despite the gloss of the frame) about a rag-tag band of losers that remain losers by the end of the film, and Pitt tries - and fails - as our trout swimming against the current trying to find greener pastures.  Is this a movie about being a loser?  Plenty of questions are proposed and later forgotten as the film progresses, and the stand-out star becomes the statistics and Miller's direction.  Moneyball is the type of film that gets you excited for no reason, and in the end, shows a guy who believed in the technology, but didn't follow through.  This is a film about the passion of math, and how its technical applications can be used to burst a bloated game.  Baseball should fear Moneyball.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>I was somewhat underwhelmed by "Moneyball".  Perhaps my expectations were simply too high.  The film is based on a book by Michael Lewis.  I had previously read "Liar's Poker" and thought it to be a great piece of modern literature.  The film also had a top quality cast including Brad Pitt in the lead role.  What could have gone wrong?  I'm not really sure but the whole package didn't gel.<br /><br />In brief, "Moneyball" covers a season in the life of the Oakland A's, an American major league baseball team.  The franchise is not rich as it is based in a comparatively small and not particularly wealthy region.  In fact, the team has only a third to spend in comparison with the New York Yankees.  On this basis alone, the team will always lose in the long run.<br /><br />However, within this difficult environment, the viewer is introduced to Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who is the manager of the team.  Billy understands his situation and knows he cannot compete on the basis of money alone.  He has to be creative.  He is assisted in this task by the chance discovery of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who is a nerdy baseball statistics geek.  It is Peter who convinces Billy to look deeper into the numbers to locate unwanted and, therefore, cheap, playing talent.<br /><br />Although the film is based on a true baseball story, it fails to please.  Something is missing.  To baseball aficionados, my word may seem sacrilegious.  However, the fact remains that the film is based on a weak thread and the quality of the cast is unable to overcome this handicap.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie was so boring. the only thing i can say what i liked about this movie was brad pitt's acting. but other than that i found it boring. thats because i really don't know much about baseball. it was just not my type of film. if you are a hardcore baseball fan then this movie is for you. if not then i don't recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>And so Oscar nominated for best picture of 2011????

My take on this movie is that it was a Brad Pitt project of some kind and in retrospect, should have been very cheap to produce as really not much more than a stage play with limited scenery sets and actors. Honestly, how could anyone get all that emotionally involved in a movie that has only "baseball team member selection" at its core???? Intended audience?  Perhaps 30+ year old males with a love of baseball but no one else. If you have a wife or girlfriend and although they may love Pitt, do not try this movie on them. No sex, no violence, no nothing of note or interest. Oscar nomination for best picture????? "The Help" is 1000 times better in all reguards that this turkey. Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Billy Beane has a problem.  As general manager for the cash-strapped Oakland A's, Beane is having a hard time recruiting quality players, mainly because, with the limited budget the owner has given him to work with, he can't possibly compete with the multimillion dollar contracts being proffered by A-tier teams like the Yankees and the Red Sox.  To add insult to injury, those teams keep pilfering the few decent players Beane's already got.  Into the breach steps Peter Brand, a  23-year-old numbers-cruncher straight out of Yale who's devised a complex algorithm out of players' statistics that will allow recruiters to focus in on the less obviously flashy - and thereby far less expensive - players whom the Big Boy franchises have managed to overlook.  The skeptics question the wisdom and efficacy of reducing team-building to mere mathematic formulas and science, but Brand's method winds up working so well that it forever revolutionizes the way major league baseball teams recruit their players.<br /><br />Based on the 2003 book by Michael Lewis, with screenplay by Steve Zaillion and Aaron Sorkin and direction by Bennett Miller, "Moneyball" provides a literal inside-baseball glimpse into the inside of baseball.  In many ways, "Moneyball" is a kind of grownup version of "The Bad News Bears" and every other tale of a coach who pulls together a motley crew of misfits and second-stringers and, against all odds, transforms them into a winning team. The difference is that this story has actual history behind it, recounting the 2002 season in which the A`s won a record 20 games in a row (yet still lost in the playoffs).  Plus, the movie finds its drama more in the behind-the-scenes wrangling among the highly skeptical managers, owners, coaches and staff than in the action on the field (indeed, most of the ballpark scenes appear as grainy clips from actual games).  The intelligent screenplay avoids most of the clich&eacute;s inherent in the genre - and those it doesn't avoid it somehow manages to make seem fresh and vital again.  The writing also adds depth and dimension to Beane's character by occasionally flashing back to his own somewhat underwhelming career as a player in the big leagues, showing how that disappointment helped to mold him into the man he is today.<br /><br />Despite the sterling quality of the writing and direction, "Moneyball" is clearly an actors' picture, and the filmmakers have recruited a first-rate cast to carry out the drama (I wonder if they used a similar algorithm for that). Brad Pitt has probably never been better than he is here as the Quixotic visionary who's such a bundle of nerves that he can't even bring himself to watch his own games.  A mixture of pragmatist and romantic when it comes to the game of baseball, Beane is the perfect person to serve as iconoclast for a game whose roots lie deep in the American psyche but a game that has lost its way in recent times with its huge salaries and uncompetitive money advantages among teams.  Jonah Hill is excellent as Brand, as is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the A's highly skeptical and understandably disgruntled manager, who initially balks at what he believes is the disastrous direction in which Beane is taking the team.  Chris Pratt ("Everwood," "Parks and Recreation") and Kerris Dorsey ("Parenthood") also score in small but important roles.<br /><br />There's drama and suspense aplenty in this film, with literal edge-of-the-seat excitement generated by its re-creation of the nail-biting 20th game that got the A`s into the record books.  But "Moneyball" never overplays its hand, never indulges in corny melodramatics or cheap sentiment to win us over to its side.  In fact, it is its very restraint and subtlety - both in performance and execution - that draws us so deeply into the tale it's telling.</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>This is a really good movie.

With the advent of instant global communication and the wealth of information that's available at the speed of thought today, the focus of our collective interest in sports has shifted and deepened. While the contests will always be the main focus, rightly, there's also a sweeping undercurrent of interest in the games behind the games. Player swaps, contract negotiations, deep statistical analysis; these are as formidable an arsenal for the modern team as a bat and glove, and it's about time Hollywood made the effort to examine that fundamental shift. Moneyball does it exceptionally well, delving into the theories and risks behind this new way of thinking without going too far into the realm of obsessive over-explanation. As the team's roster and strategies begin to change shape and coalesce, the film shifts into something larger than a mere underdog sports story, interpersonal drama or heady mathematical essay. It's all of those things and more, with an ambitiously large toolbox and the confident knowledge of how to most efficiently use each implement: an evolution of sports-themed material on film. It's the rare film that non-fans can enjoy just as much as season ticket holders, and a justified candidate for the Oscars' top honor.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>I've often been amazed at the salaries of professional athletes. I mean it's great that they have the abilities that they do and can perform unlike anyone else out there. But to be paid millions of dollars to basically play a game? I'm more concerned that the guy cleaning out the septic tank gets paid better than an athlete. Which one would you rather depend on?<br /><br />This brings us to the new release MONEYBALL. Brad Pitt stars in this real life story of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics in 2001. The A's have just lost their three best players to teams that could afford to pay them higher salaries. The home office just doesn't have the money to compete with bigger cities that offer bigger paychecks. So how can a team that spends close to $30 million compete with a team that costs $130 million?<br /><br />Billy finds the answer by sheer chance. While discussing possible trades in Cleveland he watches as the head men keep deferring to a fresh looking young guy named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Cornering him later on Brand explains to him that teams far too often look for players rather than points. They seek out and pay stars for their attraction quotient but never look to see if they can justify their salaries with their abilities. Brand believes that a great team could be made of semi-decent players, but players who score runs.<br /><br />Beane embraces the idea much to the consternation of the talent scouts and the team's coach Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He bypasses their recommendations and instead puts together a team based on stats that Peter puts together for him. In so doing he believes the team may have no major stars but they will have a winning season. Too bad everyone attempts to stop him rather than go along.<br /><br />Beane and Howe butt heads as to who will play where and when. Eventually Beane puts Howe into a position where he has no option but to place the players he wants where he wants them. That's when the team suddenly begins to win and win big going so far as to break previous records of consistent wins.<br /><br />Based on the book of the same name, MONEYBALL is an interesting film about a subject that along with apple pie is near and dear to the hearts of most American's, baseball. We romanticize about the players; we celebrate the victories and losses of our favorite teams. But how many people actually consider what it takes to put together a winning team? That is the main subject behind this film.<br /><br />But it's more than discussing the choice of winning versus the romantic notion of pure athleticism that makes us love the game. The movie is about a man pushed into a corner who needs to find a way to bring home a winning team without being able to spend the money that bigger cities can afford and who more or less succeeds in doing so. After Beane went on to create this format other teams followed with more success.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is an actor that could easily fall back on his good looks and make movies that offer little depth but plenty of eye candy for the ladies. Instead he takes risks now and then with movies that show he is a better actor than many would give him credit for. The subtle style he offers here as Beane makes you believe you are watching the man instead of an actor portraying him and that's the sign of an actor worth watching.<br /><br />Hill steps out of the comic foil he's played in nearly every movie he's ever made. Instead he's the straight man here, the character (based on several real life individuals) that comes up with the plan that just might save the A's. He never gives this performance the same old styling that he's used before, instead making this character as believable as Pitt's Beane.<br /><br />You don't have to be a baseball fanatic to enjoy this movie but it wouldn't hurt. More action takes place off the field than on. In any event what you will end up with is an evening's entertainment that is worth the effort to take the movie home. Not only will you want to consider renting this one, it might actually be worth adding to your collection. I know I'll be watching it more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>Not about the players, but about the back stage team that forms it.  Brad Pitt did a great job of acting, and he should stick more to these kinds of films because his acting ability shines through so much more than action films. I especially liked it because I live in Baltimore and the Orioles have fallen down to nothing because of poor management and the unwillingness of the rich owner to spend any money on better players.  Beyond that, he's not even a baseball fan and doesn't care what happens to the team as long as he doesn't have to spend much money.  The team has declined more and more since he bought it, and is in last place, all good players sold.<br /><br />Everyone in town would be happy to see Moneyball happen here.  We could use a different approach.  If the manager ever leaves or retires or dies, his sons will take the money with them.  It won't go for the team.  I loved this movie, because it does show that if a team has a clever manager and the right know how, even a team with little money can bring back the fans.  It should only happen to us.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>I love movies, all kinds of movies, but sports genre movies aren't usually my first choice.  But I liked "Moneyball" very much.  It's loosely based on the true life story of General Manager Billy Beane and the Oakland A's baseball team.<br /><br />I'm always a sucker for an underdog story and I like unusual, offbeat movies so this was a win-win for me.  Brad Pitt was low key in the role of Beane, playing the GM/ex-baseball player - a maverick, going against tradition and hiring players by numbers rather than an arcane convoluted instinctual system that had been used previously.<br /><br />My favorite in the movie is Jonah Hill, playing Yale graduate, Peter Brand, who had majored in economics and uses a complex system of statistics to rank ball players.  He is hired to be Beane's assistant GM.  This is a much more serious role for Hill than I've seen him in before and in my opinion, it's his performance that makes the movie a success.<br /><br />I also liked the Good Ole Boy scouts and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the team manager.<br /><br />Good story, great casting, some unnecessary family moments - all-in-all a sports movie that I enjoyed and will probably watch again in the future.<br /><br />(Oh - I did like Beane's daughter in the movie, Kerris Dorsey, singing "The Show" sung previously by Lenka.  Good song and Dorsey does an admirable job on it.)<br /><br />As an extra on the DVD was also a segment that has the real Billy Beane talking about reinventing the game - liked that, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>Anyone can sell a horror, a rom-com, a fantasy or an epic storyline to a captured audience. Not that hard. But, by way of metaphor, it takes a creative mind to look at a desert of what to most of us is a seemingly endless sand and see hidden beauty and then guide the rest of us in how to also find beauty in a desert. Thus, the back room machinations of baseball are not normally likely to wake even a snail from it's slumber (let alone most of us humans) yet Pitt crafted this tale so well that even the snails in my yard were unwaveringly intrigued by this story. Snails vote five stars.<br /><br />On rather insignificant minor notes: First, "The Show" sung by Dorsey in the movie was around 2002 but wasn't written/released by Lenka until 2008/2009. My second minor note is the interpretation of the metaphor at the end of the movie. First, Beane says "I made one decision in my life based on money. And, I swore I would never do it again." Which is actually a form of rigid thinking that the premise of the movie argues against. One poor decision doesn't imprison you to all subsequent decisions of that type. Then the metaphor comes in, "You're doing it for what the money says. That you're worth it." "He hit a home run and didn't even realize it." All suggest to me that Beane's thinking out of the box worked and all that the money does is confirm it. So he should have gone to where the support was (in all it's forms).</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I hate sports.  Honestly, I don't care for them at all.  I find them boring and pointless and lacking all excitement that so many heap upon them.  But, I love movies, and I love the Oscars, and when a film (and especially a performance) is talked up as Oscar potential then I feel the necessity to indulge, to take a bite, to `see for myself'.<br /><br />That is basically how `Moneyball' and I met.<br /><br />On paper, this sounds awful.  The trailers looked simple and boring and kind of dumb.  I remember making that comment on an Oscar forum, because there was just no way that this movie was going to be remotely interesting.  Then the reviews started pouring in and the praise started to mount and Pitt got his career best mentions and I sat back in bewilderment because all of this praise meant that I really needed to see this movie.  My best friend was happy, because he's always pestering me about accompanying him to sports related events (yeah, better luck next time) and so we went to the movies and I fully expected to hate this and wound up being completely absorbed in every frame.<br /><br />I have decided that if there is ever to be a movie made about my life, I want Aaron Sorkin to write the screenplay.  Seriously, between this and last year's epic `The Social Network', he is the master of spinning such detailed and rapturous webs out of seemingly mundane situations (baseball and facebook...seriously?).<br /><br />`Moneyball' tells the story of Oakland A's manager, Billy Beane' and his determination to make the A's a winning team.  The terms refers to the fact that wealthier teams get an unfair advantage in creating winning teams because they can outbid and thus buy better players.  Oakland was not a wealthy team, and yet by hiring a numbers man with a big idea (that no one believed in), Beane was able to turn things around and start something big for himself and his team.  Pitt is wonderful here, fleshing out a man who is very lived in and weathered.  He understands Beane and helps the audience to relate to him.  But, as great as Pitt (and the rest of the cast) is, this film really lives and breathes at the hands of the men behind the camera.  Sorkin and Zaillian build a marvelous script here, and Bennett Miller (should have won that Oscar back in 05) has such depth within his directorial work here that he illuminates every frame and draws you in.<br /><br />So, coming from a guy who wrote this off because of a genre, watch this...it truly is one of the best films of the year!</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Let me start by saying I'm a big baseball fan and I think Brad Pitt is excellent in his performance as Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane. I also think Jonah Hill is superb and earns his best supporting actor nomination as made-up Yale-educated baseball statistician "Peter Brand". It is worth noting that it is Brand's real-life ideas, embodied by on-field application of real-life statistician Bill James' Sabermetrics, that make up the heart and soul of "Moneyball" - both the film and the idea.<br /><br />Beane's A's have had some success. In 2001 with a roster that cost a third of the high-ballin' Yankees the A's take the mighty Yanks down to the last game of the playoffs prior to losing, then losing stars Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen to teams that can afford their now high-price salaries. (From an even playing field standpoint, Major League Baseball is still miles behind any American ideal of "fairness".) Beane is "rewarded" with the task of rebuilding the A's with the available funds to attract... no one.<br /><br />He goes to another organization to talk a trade and notices Brand in the corner whispering in the ear of a rival general manager. Beane, who was a professional player himself, knows that Jonah Hill doesn't look like anyone's idea of a sports guy. He tracks him down after the meeting and asks why the Indian's General Manager listens to him.<br /><br />And thus is presented the whole idea of Moneyball: although home runs and batting averages are flashy and show up on Sportscenter highlights, the bottom line in baseball is wins. A walk, while not ostentatious, is pretty much exactly as valuable as a single, and players with good on-base percentages (judiciously mixing walks in with swings of the bat) are as valuable as players with a good batting average.<br /><br />Beane buys into the idea and puts all his eggs into the Moneyball basket, upsetting pretty much everyone else in the organization.  He seems to have nothing to lose - his owner isn't going to provide one of those multi-million dollar contracts, so Beane and Brand have to find bargain players.<br /><br />The drama comes in watching Beane coax and cajole the rest of the A's organization into buying the concept. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays field manager Art Howe, who frankly tells Beane that he thinks the whole experiment is going to get him fired. (My recollection of the real Howe is a thin, gaunt man physically almost completely dissimilar from the moon-faced Hoffman, but hey, it's a movie.)<br /><br />The problem I have with the film is the manner in which they reduce the national pastime, the hope and dream of millions of boys and girls (and boys and girls at heart) to a cold, statistical business. I don't know the real Billy Beane. I suspect that they model many of his film idiosyncrasies on real life, such as the fact that he doesn't travel with the team or even go out to the field to watch the games. For the little boy in me this makes as much sense as changing the end of Willy Wonka to put the Chocolate Factory away in the closet and watch it occasionally on television.<br /><br />As a "renegade businessman upsetting the apple-cart" story, Moneyball works. After all, the screenplay is by that double-dog genius of screenwriters, Aaron Sorkin. As a baseball movie - it's not even as fun as watching batting practice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>You don't have to be a fan of baseball to relish this film, no you don't. MONEYBALL can be enjoyed as a compelling underdog sports film, or as a terrifically-acted drama, or as a slice of Americana. This is the biopic of Billy Beane and how he changed the game of baseball, or the numbers crunching bits of it anyway. I confess that when Billy Beane first overhauled the Oakland A's system back in the early oughts, I was as skeptical as any guy watching from a distance and taking in his odd shenanigans. But then the Oakland Athletics made that historic run. Back then, I remained a skeptic. It took this film and its examination of the nuts and bolts of the moneyball process for me to fully appreciate what this man had done. This film injects a bit of soulfulness into a soulless system that is inherently calculating and is all about the gathering and analyzing of computer-generated statistical data to draft a team's players. You have to remember that Billy Beane had no choice but to go the sabermetric route.<br /><br />Beane has an insider's perspective. He, after all, actually was in the show, having played in the professional league for some years... and abjectly failing. How must it have felt to be courted by baseball scouts and skipping college to go pro, only to realize that you don't belong? It painfully dawns on Beane that scouts don't really have any magic formula. Sometimes, the product is purchased based on its potential and it doesn't pan out, like Beane didn't pan out. He opted for a sudden career shift, becoming a scout himself. From there he rose up the career ladder and ended up General Manager of the Oakland A's. And yet his inner demons continue to haunt him.<br /><br />Brad Pitt deserves all the award nominations he gets. He is so good here. As MONEYBALL opens with Oakland and its big guns getting eliminated in the playoffs, the camera shoots to a frustrated Billy Beane who prefers to listen to the game on the radio rather than actually watching it. With Oakland done for the season, Beane focuses on rebuilding the team, what with free agency threatening to take away Oakland's marquee players. Except that the A's are a small market team, and the owner just can't compete with the obscene salaries doled out by the big market teams (cough*damnyankees*cough). The owner directs Beane to make do with the budget he's got, which is a pittance.<br /><br />"You don't put a team together with a computer, Billy," some naysayer remarks, but never mind that. The moneyball scheme was constructed by a desperate Beane and lowly Yale economics graduate and stats fiend Peter Brand (a shockingly effective Jonah Hill). Brand is based on Paul DePodesta who was Billy Beane's real-life assistant. The film goes on to chronicle how the 2002 Oakland A's became the laughingstock of the Major League Baseball with its dismal early losses and its no-name roster made up of players who are either too old or who throw funny or have unmanageable tempers. "Island of misfit toys," is how someone describes it. But, somewhere along the way, Oakland began to surge up the rankings and then there was that phenomenal winning streak, another instance of fact being stranger than fiction. Nowadays what MLB team isn't using sabermetrics?<br /><br />Pitt's performance fuels the film, but his outstanding rapport with Jonah Hill and with Kerris Dorsey, who plays his sensitive young daughter, cannot be overlooked. It's never as good as when Pitt is sharing a scene with either of them. But you have to credit Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian's sharp, lively, and emotionally satisfying screenplay. You'll laugh and cheer and maybe even get misty-eyed. I don't think it's a secret anymore that Brad Pitt really can act, but the man's suffered from the infamous pretty face syndrome. When he finally began to show wear and tear on his mug, I think that's when folks began to take him seriously as an actor. In MONEYBALL he commands the screen utterly. Just give him the Oscar already and let's all go home.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.7 stars<br /><br />It's a good sign when you're two hours into a film and wishing it would go on another two. Pitt carries this one so well that it's just a pleasure watching him work, and the script is what lets him be this good.<br /><br />Everything is measured yet compelling, and every bit role is cast and played perfectly. Some movies just feel good from front to back, and Moneyball is in that league. Then again, I love baseball, so maybe I'm biased, but I'd put this one up there with Bang The Drum Slowly and Bull Durham.<br /><br />It was a great real-life story, and so many details are caught just right in this exemplary screenplay. The score has moments of real beauty, and the heavy drama during the 20th win is played to the hilt while the music says it all. It's a treat to see a movie round the bases this convincingly.<br /><br />The box score says that Moneyball is a great baseball movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"Moneyball"  is the story of the Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his then-unheard-of policy of relying on cold statistics to acquire players who could score runs.  With a budget that prevented the team from snagging acknowledged top talent and competing with the deep pockets of the Yankees and Red Sox, Beane teams up with the Harvard-educated economist Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to rebuild the club and make it competitive.<br /><br />This is an unusual baseball movie since most of it takes place off the field and images of actual play do not dominate.  Performances are terrific, from Pitt's rebellious Beane, bucking the accumulated wisdom of his scouts who rely on their instincts and the age and physical condition of players, to Jonah Hill, who departs from his goofy sidekick roles to take on an actual, believable character.  The scenes between Pitt and Hill are especially enjoyable.  They have great chemistry.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays team manager Art Howe, a guy who clearly draws a line in the sand when it comes to game strategy and has little love or respect for Beane.<br /><br />Sports films always face the problem of appealing to a wide audience, and casting Pitt in the lead role is certainly one way to lick the problem.  The script by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin takes us into the offices of a mid-level major league baseball team, underscoring the tensions, resentments, disappointments, and resistance to new ideas.  Those who think baseball is only a game will see that it is big business predicated on taking chances on players who are undervalued, past their prime, or injured.<br /><br />A few scenes show Billy with his daughter (Kerris Dorsey) and ex-wife (Robin Wright), but they are incidental.  The movie really percolates when we see Billy working the phone with another general manager, trying to make the most advantageous deal, or when he has to move ahead with a method of team building that is contrary to the status quo.<br /><br />"Moneyball" is available in a two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack.  Bonus extras include a blooper reel and featurettes on the real Billy Beane, drafting the team, playing the game, and adapting the original book into film. The movie is also available in single-disc Blu-ray and DVD editions.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>Being a lifelong A's fan I was fascinated exactly as to how Brad Pitt (oops, Brapi playing A's general manager Billy Beane) rebuilt the team in 2002 and got them back into the playoffs after losing three key players (including 2000 American League Most Valuable Player Jason Giambi) to free agency from the 2001 playoff team using a sabremetric (basically, a unique statistical method of evaluating player performance) strategy dubbed "Moneyball" by the author Michael Lewis who wrote the book of the same name that the movie is based on.<br /><br />Now, if this sounds too much like fantasy baseball, it kind of is. So, if you're not a sports fan who is interested in the behind-the-scenes machinations of how players are drafted, how trades are made and the inner workings of a baseball franchise, this is probably not the movie for you. There are long stretches where it seems like a lot of talking is going on and not much game action.<br /><br />The actual game footage spliced into the movie footage works great. It does capture the thrill of the A's record 20 consecutive win streak during that season. Yet, like the book, the movie overlooks two major factors that have nothing to do with this Moneyball approach. Firstly, is although ex-Giants shortstop Royce Clayton plays that season's AL MVP Miguel Tejada, a holdover from the 2001 team, he's barely a footnote in the story onscreen. Secondly, the A's starting pitching troika of Mike Mulder, Barry Zito and Tim Hudson were huge in the A's 2000-2003 playoff run. In fact, they were arguably one of the best starting pitching staffs in recent MLB history. You do see Hudson a bit in the movie, but the other two are not mentioned at all.<br /><br />Also, there was a lot of artistic license as Jeremy Giambi and Carlos Pena end up being traded on the same day for dramatic effect. The reality was Giambi was traded on May 22, 2002, and Pena was dealt July 5. Also, when Pitt discusses picking up submarining relief pitcher Chad Bradford at his meeting with the team's scouts prior to the 2002, I half expected some scout to tell Pitt that Bradford was already on the team. The A's acquired him in 2001.<br /><br />The fictional Ivy League educated stat wizard Peter Brand (played brilliantly low key by Jonah Hill) in the movies joins the A's in 2002 as Beane's righthand man. The real-life Paul DePodesta, whom the fictional Brand is based on, actually joined the A's in 1999.<br /><br />Also, the movie seems a bit unfair to A's manager Art Howe (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Howe led the A's to three straight playoff appearances. He may have been old school but did he really butt heads that much with Beane over lineup choices? Maybe he did but how about giving Howe a bit of credit for that 20-game winning streak as well. I'm pretty sure some of his managerial moves helped that streak along.<br /><br />OK, that's the nitpicking as an A's fan. Moneyball is still a terrific movie in showing how a small market team with a very low budget could compete with the likes of the deep pockets New York Yankees et al. The search for undervalued players was spot on and how Beane faced off against the old school style of scouting and evaluating players. The hero of the movie, Scott Hatteburg, a catcher turned first baseman, did prove to be of good value and a bargain to boot. Yet like the book, the movie makes too much of a case that the Moneyball way of finding undervalued assets led to the A's success in 2002. Moneyball was just part of the winning formula as having an MVP (Tejada) and those three great pitchers were major factors in the streak. Still it's pretty compelling to watch the streak unfold on the big screen.<br /><br />The extras have a terrific behind-the-scenes look at how the movie was made with Major League Baseball's full cooperation in helping the baseball scenes in actual MLB ballparks look as real as possible right down to the era's uniforms. There's also a good discussion on the whole Moneyball theory with Billy Beane adding his own insight.<br /><br />Lastly, for trivia buffs, you have got to love the framed Clash posters in Beane's office. Who wouldn't love a baseball GM into punk rock from his era?</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Moneyball was a great movie about baseball, but from a fresh perspective. Really it was about money, and how money impacts the game and how you could use a different approach to picking players that would overcome the disadvantage of having less money then other clubs, like The Yankees.<br /><br />Brad Pitt gave a great performance as General Manager of the under financed Oakland A's, Billy Beane. He passed up a full scholarship to Stanford for a career as a player in Major League Baseball, but it didn't work out and throughput the film pivotal moments are illuminated by flashbacks of his dashed hopes. Pitt conveys the frustrations and determination of Beane, a true maverick trying to cut against the grain of Major League Baseball. I rank this performance right up there with Fight Club for Mr. Pitt.<br /><br />While trying to bag some players from the Cleveland Indians Billy Beane spots a talented analyst, a composite character named Peter Brand. The Cleveland management doesn't appreciate the young firebrand's ideas, but Beane knows talent when he sees it. He asks if perhaps he is someone's nephew, but finds that it is Brand's first job, not only in baseball, but his very first job of any sort since graduating from Yale with a degree in Economics. Jonah Hill was nominated for a well deserved supporting actor Oscar for his performance--an understated, dead pan performance that is still quite funny, but doesn't undercut the drama.<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman blended into his role as A's coach Art Howe so well that I didn't even recognize him. Also notable was Kerris Dorsey as Billy's daughter Casey Beane. I recognized her from the TV drama Brothers  & Sisters. Finally, Chris Pratt, from TV comedy Parks & Recreation, was outstanding in his field as Scott Hatteberg, one of the underrated players, chosen for his ability to get on base--even if he has to walk to get there. All the supporting cast rang very true, like it was a documentary but with better lighting.<br /><br />The movie grabbed me right from the beginning and wouldn't let go, even though I am not really much of a baseball fan. Like the people it depicts, this film was a real game changer. It was the first baseball film to be nominated for best picture since Field of Dreams 22 years ago.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>Professional sports in America (and more recently elsewhere as well) has always been about making money, making money for the owners, making money for the players, and making money for the inevitable ten-percenters that come around whenever the smell of money  is in the air. Professional big time sports, moreover is about big money, real big money as this slice of sports management film, Moneyball, amply demonstrates. But it is also, at some level, depending on the sport, the team, and the guys who put together such teams about winning, winning the brass ring. And that is what makes this film that I would probably pass over on other grounds so intriguing<br /><br />Frankly it has been a while since I have even summoned the courage to watch sports on television much less attend some event in person. And that takes some doing in a city like Boston which over the past decade or so has won championships in all of the four major sports in America (baseball, football, basketball, hockey for the very clueless). And the main reason for that stance is the point I made above about the money pit. But it also about the obscene price of the winning that has distorted the legitimate role of sports in society way out of kilter. Winning and winning merely by overwhelming out-spending the other guys seems to have diminished my capacity to watch  guys who are mostly going through the motions.<br /><br />But Moneyball, and the story behind it presents another story, a story that I could actually relate to. What if you just, strapped for cash and in a minor franchise market, used every available method, including technology to build a team not of hot shots (although they are nice to see) but of guys who could stand to be together in the same room for more than fifteen minutes. That seemed like a premise worth trying.<br /><br />And that premise gets a tryout here as Billy Beane (played by Robert Redford, oops, Brad Pitts), as the general manager of the Oakland As (a team that back in the glory days, back in the Reggie, Catfish, Sal, Blue Moon, et. al days,  back in the early 1970s when I lived there, I followed like crazy), a wonk from Yale and a recalcitrant manger (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) work their magic, and work it almost to that final game of the year. The one that in the end is the only one that counts. But, except maybe in horseshoes, almost doesn't count doesn't mean a thing so it in the end is back to the drawing board to work out the missing links. Nice try though, nice premise, and nice sports film even for non-sports nuts.</p></br></body></html>

What I love so much about `Ghost World' is that it understands that balance between humor and heart, and it knows that the darkest realities of loneliness and alienation use sarcasm and wit to mask themselves.  `Ghost World' feels richly honest.  This is certainly not a film that everyone will fall head over heels for; the humor alone is an acquired taste (not everyone will `get it' or find it funny) but for those of us who do `get it', this is a beautiful piece of cinema.  Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi are all spectacular here, especially Buscemi, who tears at the heart in ways unexpected.  Birch and Johansson find the normalcy in Clowes biting dialog, handling their lines with an ease that is richly rewarding.  The beautiful core of `Ghost World' lies in the idea that growing up comes in stages and is, as we all can attest to, very hard to do.  As the central characters are fleshed out (Enid, Rebecca and Seymour all get their room to shine) we see them interact and play off one another, and the true `thickness' of their relationships is tested and exposed.  Life isn't easy, and making that transition from childhood to adulthood is one of the hardest avenues of life.  For me, there are few films that can capture the emotional impact of the experience with as much style as `Ghost World'.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>An inspired take on adolescent alienation and angst, Zwigoff's "Ghost World"--adapted from the graphic novel by Daniel Clowes--is a clever and quirky character piece. The three leads are great, but Ileanna Douglas almost steals the film as eccentric art teacher Roberta, who pushes Enid to realize her creative talents. Yes, "Ghost World" is funny, but there's also wisdom and heart behind the laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>An underrated yet excellent movie, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is an enticing indie offering from director Terry Zwigoff. Yes, it`s another movie about teenagers, still it`s far from being a useless collection of jokes glued together a la &quot;American Pie&quot; or &quot;Roadtrip&quot;. Instead, this film, inspired by the Daniel Clowes` underground comic, focuses meaningful themes like alienation, consumism, (sub)culture and the first steps into the adult world. <p>Thora Birch plays Enid, a clever, creative yet confused suburban young girl straight out of highschool. She and her friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) must face a new and unpredictable future where they have to be on their own and face multiple and relevant choices. They never seemed to really fit in, and for the first time realize that pherhaps they should. But is it worth it? And what`s the price to pay? <p>Zwigoff manages to combine drama and comedy with great effect, delivering a cinematic experience that is satirical and ironic while being poignant and emotional as well. In a way, it`s like MTV`s show &quot;Daria&quot;, but in this movie the results are more deep, intense and relateable. <p>At times, the pacing is a bit slow, still it makes sense since the story focuses some points like the everyday mundane monotony and suburban inertia where nothing interesting or gripping seems to happen. <p>&quot;Ghost World&quot; is also a twisted, witty and original coming-of-age story, focusing the nerds, geeks and losers that are as clever and brilliant as they are ignored and virtually invisible (like ghosts). As a result, they don`t have much of a social life and remain incapable of relating with most of those who surround them. Enid is such a character, and when she dares to try helping someone she ends up being used and hurt. <p>One of the most innovative and surprising independent movies of the last years, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a little gem worth discovering that gets better with each viewing. Probably most, or at least many people won`t like it much, since this is not a typical, laugh-a-minute and brainless teen movie, but a thought-provoking and genuine cinematic experience. Still, for those who try to get deep into it, it will surely be a memmorable and unique film to watch. <p>Related movies: &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, &quot;American Splendor&quot;, &quot;SubUrbia&quot;, &quot;The Good Girl&quot;, &quot;Storytelling&quot;, &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;L.I.E.&quot;, all very good choices as well</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>The movie started with Thora Birch dancing to a East Indian music video, and it was wierd and captured my attention simutaneously. It's a good intro to a different kind of teenage dramedy.<br /><br />Thora Birch gives her very best performance in this film that had won her the best actress award at the Seattle Film Festival, but failed to get an Oscar nomination just like her equally amazing co-star Steve Buscemi. Her character is like a rebellious version of Carrie without telekinetic power. She and her best friend(Scarlett Johanson) will do anything but be normal.They like to act and look wierd and original in school, and she loves vintage music that was also in Buscemi's collection.<br /><br />In high school, she's a gifted artist, and her work impressed her funky and essentric teacher(Illeanor Douglas), who was a total comic relief in this movie. She's very supportive to Birch, but her work was too provocative that she was not accepted for the scholarship.<br /><br />After graduation, Birch find it hard to maintain her friendship with Johanson, because their interests and ideals are different. Ultimately, her only friend left was Buscemi, but he was being pressured by his new girlfriend to stop seeing her. So she's feeling like a ghost in her world, and she wants to leave her environment. She eventually headed to the bustop that she previously saw a old man got on an "imaginery bus" that goes to other worlds. She got on the bus and off she goes away from the ghost world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>I rented Ghost World because I never got to see it in the theatres.I never knew about it when it was in the theatres and one day just saw it at my local video store.One day I decided to just check it out and I was very very glad.The movie was filled with great things.The acting was great,the plot was great,the score was excellant,and just the combination of every thing put together.It all makes one great two hours of comendy and drama,and it just makes you think alot about things.Even though the movie is not a teen movie there are teens in it making it good for everybody who is a teen and above.The movie does have alot of profanity which makes it not for children but everybody eles is ok.The is definatly one of the greatest movies of all time.<p>The cast is consisted to about 5 main characters.Those main characters are Enid who is played by Thora Birch,Scarlett Johansson,Steve Buscemi,Brad Renfero,and Illiana Douglas.Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansson are two of my favorite actors and they shine on the screen in this movie while Thora Birch who I never saw in anything didn't have me to much.Even though she was very good in the movie I just never knew how to rate her.Illiana Douglas I only saw on an episode of Frasier where in the credits I aroused myself to one simple question.Who the heck is Brad Renfero?<p>The plot is focused around Enid(Thora Birch)and Rebbeca(Scarlett Johansson)who just graduated from hign school and are planning to skip collage and move in with each other.They are very different from other people and seem to always be in there own little world as they love to pester there friend Josh who works ay a grocery store called the Sidewinder where a trouble maker loves to hang out at and basecially cause trouble.One day they follow two Satanists and end up at a 50's theme diner.There they decide to call a man who wrote a ad in the personals asking about is some girl remembered him from a couple of days ago.They decide to call and pretend to be her and then they watch as he gets stood up by no one.Enid ends up befriending the man whose name is Seymour(Steve Buscemi)and one things leads after anthor and then by the end of the summer her whole life is turned upside down.<p>Ghost World was very different then what I thought it was going to be like.One of the greatest elements of the movie was it's score which blew me away.Ghost World is almost perfect in everyway and I am proud to own a copy of the DVD.<p>ENJOY!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I never would have known this movie existed if it wasn't for my sister who insisted I watch it. This is a good movie, but to be honest it's not something I would want to watch again just because it's a bit bland and slow for my taste.<p>It's about Enid (Birch) and Rebecca (Johansen), two girls who just graduated and have little direction in life. Rebecca is a bit more stable, opting to get a job and find an apartment of her own. Enid on the other hand finds joy in drawing random people's pictures, &quot;torturing&quot; the guy who works at the convenient store, and befriending a strange, older man called Seymour (Buscemi) who doesn't really like anything, just like her. They find solace in each other.<p>It's a strange film and chugs along at it's own pace, showing us only what we need to make up our minds about their own little world. The film does have it's moments and is in fact wonderfully written. Check this one out if you haven't and find out what you think about this one because honestly, you have to see this one for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>One of the few teen films to adequately capture the paralyzing emptiness of the post-high school blues (and most of Western pop culture). Thora Birch is particularly convincing as the too-cool-for-school teen coming to terms with her future and her friends.  But it's the minor players like Illeana Douglas as Roberta the art teacher and Dave Sheridan as Doug the crazy Sidewinder customer, who'll you'll remember forever. Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff's script is pitched at precisely the right level. It's brutally real without losing its sense of humour, and ultimately hopeful without slipping into sappiness: that's a fine line to walk, but they do it to perfection. Quite an achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>I will admit that I didn't like this movie very much after the first twenty minutes.  I thought this was going to be another "Daria", the "Beavis and Butthead" spinoff.  In that cartoon, the character Daria has a lot of good cynical observations about other people, but in the end, Daria really doesn't have anything of her own to offer, so it ends up as whining.  <p>Which is where I thought this one was going.  You have a couple of very intelligent recent high school graduates that, we are led to believe, participated in absolutely nothing in their four years, mostly because it was beneath them.  They are snobs about just about anything except themselves, but like Daria, contribute virtually nothing to make them interesting on their own.  <p>But this turns out to be just character establishment, and if you give the movie a chance, you see how life continues to chip away at the suits of armor the girls wear against the world. The blonde, Scarlett Johansson, cracks first.  She lowers herself to actually get a job, and even though she still agrees that most of her customers are idiots, she starts to see that, well, that's what people are.  And like it or not, you still have to exist with others to some degree.  <p>The unrecognizable, but still brilliant Thora Birch holds out a lot longer.  She makes almost no attempt to get a job, and with the one she gets, she refuses to play the game.  When she first meets the Steve Buscemi character, it's to humiliate him, then try to help what she sees as a total loser.  In her world, practically everyone is a loser, but if they are a big enough loser, this makes them cool to some degree, and worthy of attention.  There is a lot of mental work to be done when one has this personality.  <p>Besides the slow unraveling of the girls' shields, the movie is also great by not having a neatly wrapped up ending, either happy or sad.  Enid (Birch) finds that because she's bothered when people reject her, this must mean that she actually must care for these people, and therefore, must have feelings.  We don't see any clear direction of where she's going, but we do see an awakening.  She will probably never totally play the game, but with seven billion people in the world, there might be more than one that are worth associating with.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.<br /><br />The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.<br /><br />As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to "fit in".<br /><br />In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.<br /><br />Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.<br /><br />Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.<br /><br />What a marvellously done film. Rent it pronto, even the credits are worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>&quot;Ghost World&quot; is not a horror movie like the title suggests.  Rather, it's a comedy for all ages to enjoy.  Some may call it a teen comedy, some may call it an adult comedy, but none will call it an ordinary comedy.  None will forget its sarcastic lines and cruel humor.  However, some scenes become serious and inspirational, giving the audiences the realisms of the characters' behaviors.  This proves the cruel humor voiced by the characters, not the writers.  The writers combine everything wonderfully and uniquely.<p>Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi act her characters delightfully, receiving Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor.  Their chemistry perfects their roles as a critical teaser and an unpopular man.  She joking acts as the blonde from his newspaper ad, therefore standing him up on a date.  Unexpectedly, they meet days later in his record selling sale.  She buys one and soon becomes influenced by more than the music.  The scenes beyond this gives Thora Birch's character more conflict and backlash against all of her other aquaintances, especially her best friend.  All other character, major or minor, are unforgettably funny, making the movie incomplete without them.  Many unexpected events occur, leaving the audience anxious for the next scene.  Those who like &quot;Ghost World&quot; should buy the DVD.  It will be a classic years from now.<p>***Note: There is a scene after the credits so don't push &quot;stop&quot; quickly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>Directed by Terry Zwigoff (CRUMB) and scripted by Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes from the latter's comic book.<br />It is the early 80s, and punk rock has been replaced by new wave. Wannabe punk Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johnansen) are a pair of misfit best friends who reply to a personal ad as a prank. The victim turns out to be an eccentric loner named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a guy who according to Enid is "such a dork, he's almost kind of cool". But when Enid and Rebecca start to drift apart after graduating high school, Enid ends up befriending Seymour; who lives for his LP collection and she soon finds in him a kindred spirit. Enid discovers she needs Seymour a lot more than she ever thought.<br />GHOST WORLD features a rather simple story (A basic but effective subplot involves Enid's interaction with an elderly man who is each day waiting for a bus which never seems to arrive) but one that is real and affecting. Both leads are great; especially Buscemi in what is for me his best role since RESERVOIR DOGS. GHOST WORLD is one movie you must see this year. One of Robert Crumb's drawings also appears in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AS7B4W4KOPQNV.html">AS7B4W4KOPQNV</a><br/><p>I love this film.  It mixes together comedy and drama really well.  Steve Buscemi was great in his role as the nerdy record collector.  The movie was about an 18 year old girl, Enid(Thora Birch), who just graduated high school and doesn't quite know what she wants out of life.  Her best friend, Rebecca(Scarlett Johanson), keeps nagging her about moving into an apartment with her.  While playing a prank on a lonely middle-aged man, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), Enid becomes very close to him and learns that he is very interesting.  Although this film stars teen actresses, it is not a teen movie.  I highly reccomend this to everyone, it was THAT good!</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>This movie has two potential audiences.<p>1.  Seymour&#65533;s 99%, i.e., that segment of the population which he (or I) can&#65533;t relate to at all.  People lacking any modicum of self-awareness, whose lives are spent in the mall or in front of the TV watching prime time network television.  People whose record collection may include the complete works of Ashford &amp; Simpson, and whose car radio is tuned to any cloying morning Zoo program.  People in this group may enjoy &#65533;Ghost World&#65533; to a degree.  They will find Enid&#65533;s green hair and Rebecca&#65533;s cynical attitude amusing.  They will laugh at Seymour&#65533;s bland wardrobe and jagged brown teeth.  And when the movie&#65533;s over, they will leave the theatre quietly, walk to their SUVs, and head home to their quiet suburban existence.<p>But really, this movie is not for them.<p>2.  It&#65533;s really for Seymour&#65533;s 1%, i.e., that segment of the population distressed by conformity, obsessed by weirdness, and repressed because of it.  These are the people who surround themselves with massive record collections, or H.R. Pufnstuf dolls, or Bollywood videos, in an effort to beat a different path.  They are lonely, frustrated, and on the verge of giving up any hope at a social life, in favour of a hermetic existence.  These are the people that will be able to relate to &#65533;Ghost World&#65533;s startling menagerie of misfits.  And feel tremendous sadness for themselves as well.<p>Terry Zwigoff mines much of the same material here that he did with his documentary &#65533;Crumb&#65533;, save for the emphasis on ill mental health.  It&#65533;s an amazing turn for a man previously known only as a documentarian.  I suppose that&#65533;s why the reality of the characters&#65533; surrounding is so real.  Each scene is populated with mile and miles of personable knick-knacks and bland consumer products.  Seymour and Enid&#65533;s rooms perfectly reflect their personalities.  The screenplay, conceived with &#65533;Ghost World&#65533; originator Daniel Clowes, manages to tackle the banality of suburban life, and the oppression of consumer culture with just the right amount of bite and bile.  Their collective sense of humour is put on display right away, by showing a high school valedictorian confined to a wheelchair and a monstrous neck brace, in a scene played for laughs.  If you don&#65533;t giggle at the hypocrisy of this moment (her old intoxicated ways gave her a &#65533;spiritual perspective on life&#65533; while it was robbing her of the use of her legs), then I recommend avoiding the film altogether.<p>Another reason to avoid the film is if you are squeamish at the idea of a 40+-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl having a relationship.  One of &#65533;Ghost World&#65533; most powerful points is in Enid and Seymour&#65533;s friendship.  These are two kindred spirits, oddballs to the rest of the world, who&#65533;ve found each other and cherish each other&#65533;s oddness.  Sure, chronologically one may be twice the age of the other, but Enid and Seymour have so much in common that it would be a shame to keep them apart just for that.<p>Thora Birch, playing a similar character here as in &#65533;American Beauty&#65533;, is asked to carry the movie, and boy does she.  Even while showing Enid&#65533;s enormous extroverted ego, you always get a sense that she is as fragile and scared on the inside as the weirdoes she torments.  And Birch exudes an odd strength (both physical and emotional) that allows Enid to get away with more than she really deserves.  Enid&#65533;s relationship with Rebecca, played by Scarlett Johansson, is confusing at first.  These girls seem to be so much at odds with each other.  There are some tangible hints at malice bubbling beneath the surface.  Silly me.  They&#65533;re supposed to be there.  Enid and Rebecca may or may not be nearing the end of their friendship, for adulthood is looming and it&#65533;s time to grow up.  Rebecca (Johansson does fine work, content with being subdued and allowing Birch to steal the show) wants to move out and get a real job; Enid is still obsessed with punk rock.<p>Seymour is an inspired creation.  He&#65533;s in the paradoxical position of desperately wanting female companionship, while simultaneously despising nearly every person he meets.  His passions rule him, bubbling up at the inappropriate times (like when he tries to pick up a woman in a bar, only to find himself yammering on about the difference between Ragtime blues and conventional blues&#65533; 12-bar structure; his prospective score wears an expression of utter confusion).  Steve Buscemi -- the most recognizable face in the cast -- manages to disappear into Seymour&#65533;s everyman/loser persona seamlessly.  Buscemi&#65533;s Seymour hates his life immensely, but never becomes whiny or unpleasant.  He just goes about his business, allowing his undercurrent of anger to seethe gently to the surface in rare moments (e.g. Enid: &#65533;I&#65533;d kill for a collection like this!&#65533;  Seymour: &#65533;Go ahead and kill me.&#65533;).<p>&#65533;Ghost World&#65533; isn&#65533;t for everyone.  But it should be.  It gives a window into the world of the disenchanted, those of us who walk the streets and feel ill at the sights of the conformist and soulless masses.  So maybe there is, after all, a third potential audience for the film.  Those who pay good money for tickets, and walk out of the theatre befuddled at what they just saw, unable to relate to the wonderful characters on screen.  Which in an odd way reminds me of the old poker axiom:<p>&#65533;If you sit down at the table, and you can&#65533;t spot the sucker, it&#65533;s probably you.&#65533;</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>Dan Clowes, the only comic book artist to be nominated for an Oscar (for best screenplay this film, along with the director Terry Zwigoff), brings to life characters created in one particular storyline from his highly popular and very odd independent comic book Eightball, specifically in the unconventional film Ghost World (2001).<p>The film, directed by Terry Zwigoff, who also directed the acclaimed biopic about underground artist Robert Crumb aptly entitled Crumb (1994) and Bad Santa (2004), stars Thora Birch as Enid, Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca, and Steve Buscemi as Seymour.  The story begins with Enid and Rebecca, who are best friends, graduating from high school.  During their slightly reflective moments of high school, we begin to learn that these two girls are among the fringe dwellers.  You may be familiar with them, as they were the kids who dressed oddly, oozed sarcasm, shunned almost all after school activities, and seemed to have a negative view of most everything, seeing what they perceived as the phoniness and superficialities rampantly inherent within their environment, and taking pleasure in tormenting and alienating those around them and purposely ostracizing themselves from their peers.  They often emit an aura of superiority, believing they are above the banalities, relishing their positions as outsiders smart enough to see through the perceived lameness, but their non-conformist attitudes often rendered them to most as snide, obnoxious losers with extremely limited social circles whose actions seemed to mask a deeper, desperately needing to belong but due to physical differences, lack of athletic abilities and just general awkwardness of youth put them in a not so unique position of never really fitting in with their peers.  <p>Anyway, as the post graduation phase sets in, Enid and Rebecca's paths begin to separate as they had originally intended to get an apartment together, which requires money ergo jobs, but Enid must take a summer school art class to complete her requirements for her high school diploma.  Rebecca, seemingly beginning to grow out of the non-conformist phase takes a job at a coffee shop understanding that her goals rely on the very real fact that things cost money, while Enid's less than heartfelt attempts at work fail miserably (her stint working in a movie theater is truly funny...Movie Patron: Do you serve beer or any alcohol? Enid: I wish. Actually you wish... after about five minutes of this movie, you're gonna wish you had ten beers.)  Through a particularly obnoxious and uncomfortable prank pulled on a completely unsuspecting and random individual, they meet Seymour, someone most would consider an unassuming loser in that he lives a very isolated life, has no misconceptions about his identity or attractiveness in general, and obsesses over rare records, devoting an entire room in his modest apartment to this pursuit. Enid later develops a relationship mostly due to the fact, in her words, `I kind of like him. He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate. In a way, he's such a clueless dork, he's almost kind of cool.'  Enid begins to identify with Seymour, someone who has excepted his loser status and has even managed to squeeze an existence out of it, while Rebecca seems to be conforming more and more to achieve a goal once shared by both girls, straining their relationship, and effectively isolating Enid even more, especially once Seymour begins to develop a relationship with a woman that Enid helped him meet, not thinking it would ever go very far...<p>The story sort of rambles along, but seemingly with a purpose.  Certain elements appear completely odd and disconnected from any plot, but if you've ever read Eightball, you may have more of an understanding of this, as is how the comic book (graphic novel) is set up, which is one of the elements that made it so popular, at least within the individuals that followed the comic.  Offbeat, irrelevant, irregular, spooky, ethereal, sarcastic, witty, genuine, scary, sad, humorous, these are all words I would use to describe both the comic book and the film.  I was surprised to see this movie made, much more so a major studio release, as the comic didn't seem to lend itself to this kind of treatment, especially given that the main character is not one your normal viewer would like or develop much empathy for...The characters are very well developed, warts and all, and Birch is wonderful as the snotty, snooty outsider who finds life certainly isn't the same as when she was in high school, suffering, in part, to her unwillingness to grow from her childish attitudes and develop a path to follow.  Buscemi seems made for his part as Seymour `I can't relate to 99% of humanity', given his unique physical appearance and understanding created within the context of his character of his lot in life, embracing that which is comfortable, while the rest being more of a means to an end supporting his passion.  He knows what he is, but seems to harbor no ill will or outward hatred towards society in general, accepting his role in life, taking what comes his way and just going with the flow.  <p>The wide screen picture looks really sharp with matching audio.  Special features include deleted scenes, a ten minute featurette entitled Making of Ghost World which, in its' brevity and use of various scenes from the film hardly shares much of anything, a music video for the sixties Indian music sequence presented at the beginning of the film (which we see as Enid is watching it on her television), and an original theatrical trailer for the film, along with a TV spot, and a couple of other trailers for more popular films.  If you enjoyed this film, I would also recommend Crumb (1994), American Splendor (2003) and the upcoming Clowes/Zwigoff production of Art School Confidential (2004).  By the way, watch the film all the way through the credits as a nice little surprise awaits you.<p>Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>Probably the best praise I can offer for "Ghost World," directed by Terry Zwigoff, is that the film had me laughing heartily from the start nearly to the end. Yes, it's a great comedy. But it's also a surprisingly melancholy and touching character study that is graced with superb performances by an excellent cast.<p>"Ghost World" tells the story of Enid (played by Thora Birch) and her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johannson), recent high school grads who are struggling through this transitional phase in their lives. Early in the film the girls, who scorn much of "mainstream" society, play a cruel joke on an eccentric loner named Seymour (Steve Buscemi). But what begins as a joke leads into a quirky, engaging relationship between Seymour and Enid. The main story is well complemented by some equally quirky subplots, all of which blend together to form an effective larger story.<p>"Ghost World" is filled with witty, funny, irony-laden dialogue. And these great words are delivered with flair by the wonderful cast. Birch really shines as an offbeat leading lady; her performance has bite, but she's also appealing and vulnerable. Johannson complements her well as pal Rebecca, and Ileana Douglas is a lot of fun as Enid's politically conscious summer school art teacher. And I can't say enough good things about Steve Buscemi as Seymour. He takes what could have been a stereotypical antisocial loser and instead brings real depth and humanity to the character.<p>The great script and performances are well enhanced by thoughtful, inventive production details; "Ghost World" is almost as much fun to look at as it is to listen to. This is a really outstanding film that effectively deals with such universal issues as alienation, nonconformity, friendship, and the transition to young adulthood.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>Touted as a film on "over 140 Top Ten Lists" and "Best Film of the Year," "Ghost World" really works. The fact that I had to watch it twice just to finish it doesn't mean much. I fell asleep the first time. I was tired and the movie was boring. Nix that. Because I was tired, the movie was boring.<br /><br />The second time I was totally alert to this film rife with meaning. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johannson) have been friends for ten years and have that mental telepathy of friendship of the closest kind. However, their friendship is based on being outsiders and isolated from the slightest connection with others, thus a friendship by default.<br /><br />Cynical and world-weary even as a recent graduate from high school, Enid finally finds a job in a movie theater doling out snacks to wary and unwary moviegoers. Enid does not mince words and if she says, How much chemical sludge do you want on your popcorn?,  you really can't blame the supervisor for firing her.<br /><br />The fact that the two young women are going to get an apartment together means a job is essential. Score a negative for Enid. Rebecca is disappointed. Again Rebecca expresses disapproval of Enid's cynical nature concerning boys. None is any good! The viewer can watch Rebecca's slow, yet discernible twist away from her best friend in this significant summer of growth. Change is inevitable, life is inexorable.<br /><br />The second weak link of summer is Enid's art class which she must pass to keep her diploma. The art teacher is a pseudo-hippy, quarking out artisms, not to impress, but because she is a product of this Ghost World. What has meaning? Art? What kind of art?<br /><br />Two oddities stream out of this segment: the poster Enid submits to make a statement and the art that is real, Enid's notebook of art created because she really is talented.<br /><br />The poster unifies the film in that it is the possession of Seymour (Steve Buscemi), an older version of Enid, disillusioned, unsettled with the world at large, and a citizen in the world of his own making. Seymour is Enid's hero and she unlikely bonds with him mentally and physically.<br /><br />Sleepwalk. The major characters sleepwalk through their lives, until Rebecca wakes up to self in the grand way that recent graduates can do. Enid becomes more entrenched in her self-imposed isolation in this Ghost World. It's not a happy film, but then life does not always offer happiness. Take it the way you find it or change it. That's what Enid does. (Intentional ambiguity)</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>"Ghost World" was the best movie I've seen in a LONG damn time.  The key to a great movie is that it's its own world --<br />a self-contained universe.  "Bringing Up Baby" is one such example, so is "Vertigo" and "For a Few Dollars More."  Any of Billy Wilder's movies, too.  This one was one of them.  <p>I love Enid.  A teenage H.L. Mencken, she skewers pretentious poseurs and tips over sacred cows.  But, underneath her outer punk persona, there is a soft-hearted hero-worshipper.  Her predicament is that she's stranded on a social desert island and uses cynicism as a shield to protect her from the hopeless banality in which heroes and passion are deemed passe by people who walk through life questioning nothing, but just parroting the answers they've picked up from the larger society.  <p>"Ghost World" abounds in social commentary, but doesn't fall into the schmaltzy trap of trying to "solve" the world's social ills.  Although on the surface Enid is directionless, she nonetheless has a mania for sketching a diary of the oddballs and weirdos that make up her small town.  An excellent artist and charicaturist, Enid ends up failing art class TWICE.  <p>Her airheaded hippy/burnout art teacher, Roberta (Illeana Douglas), is a walking cliche of a total conformist affecting an air of anti-authoritarianism.  She blows off Enid's diary and her cartoons of Don Knotts, but pushes her students to instead produce so-called "controversial" art.  A really dead-on scene is when one of Roberta's sycophantic students creates a sculpture out of coathangers, which represents "a woman's right to choose, something I feel super-strongly about."  It's a gem of a parody on political art in which the politics are much stronger than the art.  I was rolling on the floor when Roberta's real bad college art film "Mirror/Father/Mirror" clip was playing. God damn, that rings true.  Roberta doesn't encourage the artistic impulse so much as pushing her agenda on the students to be "controversial" and "confront people's attitudes."<p>So, Enid decides to spoof Roberta and bring in a "found object" of a Jim Crow charicature from the 1920s of "Coon's Chicken," which depicts a monkey-like negro.  This pisses off the other students (who were sotto voce receiving the message that they should only confront people with PC controversy), but the irony of the movie is in how Roberta reacts to the Jim Crow poster; Enid can't get the time of day from her when it comes to her own talented artwork, but her jokes on Roberta's inanities wins Roberta over to her cause and even inspires Roberta to get Enid a scholarship to art college.  All this falls apart when Roberta enters the piece in an exhibit, and the local censors force her to remove the poster and fail Enid in her class.  Her capitulation reveals her devotion to "controversy" and "confrontation" to be a hollow pose, and she covers her [rear] by letting Enid be the lamb to the slaughter.<p>The relationship between Enid and Seymour (Steve Buscemi) evinces Enid's yearnings to find someone to look up to, rather than down upon.  I liked Steve Buscemi a lot.  I'm so used to him playing funny roles, that it was sort of incongruous seeing him play it (mostly) straight in a comedic movie, but it worked quite well. Like Enid, Seymour is a middle-aged outcast, and at first becomes the victim to one of Enid's and her best friend Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) cruel pranks.  But underneath the nerdish and pitiful exterior, Enid comes to discover in Seymour someone as isolated and alientated from society as she is.  She finds in him a noble soul, whose passions are worn less on his sleeve than Enid's are, but locked up in his 1920s-themed room dedicated to his 78 rpm blues and ragtime records and poster art from the same era.  Enid sees in Seymour a lot of herself, but also someone who has been run over once too many times in life and whose social rebellions have shrivelled into repressed loneliness.  Enid finds in Seymour a hero, and gushes "I'd kill for a room like this" when complimenting his passion for nostalgia.  To which Seymour -- who has given up on the possibility of ever fitting in or finding love -- replies "go ahead, kill me."<p>By the movie's end, Seymour starts asserting his inwardly pent-up feelings to relate to the world through his romance with Enid.  Finally getting up the nerve to break up with Dana, a nice, though conventionally-thinking person, in order to be with Enid, who shares his passions, and thinks like he does, Seymour nonetheless has his love for Enid somewhat unrequited. Just as the revelation that Seymour deserves happiness manifests itself, Enid alientates herself from the world -- and the two people she most treasured in the world, Seymour and Rebecca.  A happy ending does not win the day, because Enid is compelled to travel down the same lonely path that Seymour has.  Perhaps in twenty years, she will have become what he is now.<p>As I recall, this movie was nomimated for absolutely NOTHING by the Academy of Motion Pictures "Arts and Sciences."  And yet, this was the best movie in a year barren of talent, originality and true cinematic art.  Now I understand why this movie is called "Ghost World."</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>Two teenages girls named Enid and Rebecca (Played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson) have finish thier high school and the two of them, are planning to live together.

Enid and Seymour beings an unlikely friendship and a lot more than that but it`s slowly hurting the Friendship of Enid and Rebecca.<p>This is the first time, i realize after watching the film, it was closer to Real-Life but the thing, i find sad about this film is it was, i didn`t want to see the world of Enid to End.

There wasn't really much plot, except a pair of supposedly &quot;hip&quot; high-school grads who dislike most things and most people interact with a particular nerd.<p>That being said, it was an entertaining movie, and Steve Buscemi was great as Seymour - good enough to recommend the movie just for that. If you are a fan of Steve Buscemi, Thora Birch (who supposedly gained about 20 pounds for the role) or Scarlett Johansson, then you should like this movie. <p>It has enough odd-ball scenes and dialog so that most people will find something good, but the search for a meaningful overall &quot;story&quot; may be elusive - thereby assuring its status as a cult favorite.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Ghost World could have been a lot better and more special. Thora Birch is a great actress and she's good in this unique indie film but the plot and ending leaves the audience with many unanswered questions. Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansson also star and the late Brad Renfro. Ghost World is based on a comic book, so expect a dark comedy. Wish I liked this film more but it is just ok for me.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>For my money, a much better movie than the other recent underground comic book translation, &quot;American Splendor&quot;. It's about two female high school graduates who bravely confront impending adulthood in the mundane suburbs of California and it is funny without being loud and cynical without being abrasive. Probably a more precise deptction of the teen scene than the current slice of silly cinematic pie, it's a rewarding, funny thoughful film for all concerned.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie a lot, although I feel the ending was unnecessarily (and unconvincingly) bleak and gratuitously cruel to the characters.  It felt a bit forced, as if they said, &quot;we must make this an un-Hollywood, bummer of an ending!&quot; and then just took the quickest, easiest path to make that so.  That quibble aside, this is a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>Ghost World is certainly not a "blockbuster" by any means.  It's was a comic book first, and the movie is very different.  I thought that both the book and movie were very good.  But they have their differences, such as some characters were taken out of the movie, and replaced with different ones.<br />Steven Buscemi's character was based on a comic one, but is basically new.  He also directs the movie.<br />The movie is basically about Enid, played to perfection by Thora Birch, but it starts off at high school graduation.  Then Enid and her friend, Rebecca, spend the summer contemplating what they want to do with the rest of their lives.<br />The movie is funny, and a refreshing change from the ... that has come out this year.  It certainly isn't totally uplifting.  It is Thora Birch who really makes this film worthwhile.  She is so great in this.  It's as if this role was made for her.<br />The characters in the movie are all great, and very entertaining.  This is for that day you say to yourself: I'm tired of all that's out there in the movies, and want something different.<br />I promise you won't be disappointed.  Oh, and stick around til the credits stop rolling.  There's a hysterically funny outtake.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>A well-received film in which two cynical teenagers, having just graduated from high school, spend a summer casting sarcasm and disdain over the superficiality and expectations of them. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who make fun of things, play pranks and approach everything with a condescending eye. Having planned to move into an apartment together, their plans immediately face obstacles. Rebecca gets a job and starts to conform to a lifestyle Enid wants no part of. Rebecca matures and sees the reality of needing money to live independently, while Enid wants to linger in this adolescent-aimless-loser phase (ruining all her job possibilities almost as soon as they start). One of her pranks leads her to meet Seymour (Steve Buscemi) a middle-aged loser of sorts whose one passion in life is collecting rare records. Perhaps because they each personify the loner-loser stereotype so well, Enid and Seymour are drawn together. Other reviewers have quite thoroughly covered Enid's attitude, her wasted intelligence and self-destructive nature, and certainly provide a glowing recommendation for this film, which my review only supports.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>I do think that this is one of the best roles for Thora Birch so far, Enid, the bitter Daria like outsider.  The movie unfortunately is made to be a realistic look of a time that I would rather forget, and people that you don't always want to know.<br /><br />Enid is a classically angst ridden girl.  She is smart enough to know how illusion ridden the world is around her, but not smart enough to know what her part in this is.  So she and her friend are the definition of defeatist youth.  They have little ambition, like to play cruel jokes, and everything seems to exist for them to criticize.  Due to their temperment they aren't good at keeping jobs, so spend a lot of time with their artwork and practical jokes.  School wasn't over long ago, but they have few friends from the experience and it is quickly turning into faded memories.<br /><br />This turns around when they are looking through the I saw you ads of their local paper and find one of a lonely man who felt that something had passed between him and a girl he met at an airport.  So they make a response to the ad and arrange a meeting to see what will happen when the man shows up finds no one is coming to meet him.  This is where they meet Steve Buscemi's nerdy character, working at an office for a fried chicken company, and a vinyl junkie.<br /><br />They watch him and for some reason Enid becomes fascinated with him and starts befriending him and learning about his life.  Trying to break him out of his dull day by day existence.<br /><br />Then the film seems to take a down turn.  Enid starts to see her world quickly crumbling around her.  Her father has a new girlfriend and thinks she should move out.  Her best friend is getting frustrated with the fact that Enid isn't going anywhere and giving up on their plans.  Her attempts at holding a job with her tendency to make jokes at everything around her and temper fail miserably.<br /><br />I think that this movie is well made, but I just didn't like it.  The characters were realistic, the situations familar, the filming and casting had a gritty and realistic quality, but it seemed shallow in a lot of ways.  A lot of the characters just are, there is little to no background on them.<br /><br />Plus the main character, Enid, is extremely difficult to like.  She is too defeatist and depressing to really get into.  Her character goes from one self initiated disaster to another, her wit seeming less and less endearing, and her character seeming less and less intelligent.  There are some times when the feelings of lonlieness and confusion hit her character and you feel a spark for her.  But her tendency to take others with her when she falls ruins it.  Enid attacks people for fun or lashes out at others for her emotional problems.  You never really see why she is so hostile to everybody in her life, and this is a big part of her character. Or why she is so intersted in Steve Buschemi's character.  I also found her best friend a mystery, a girl thats just there.<br /><br />Though I think that the film was wonderfully made, I just didn't like it.  The characters were too defeatist and their rapid spiral downward too frustrating to want to watch twice.  As well as the many unanswered questions about the characters.<br /><br />I hope that the director and actress do something else that is in similar caliber, but with different material, because it shows a lot of potential.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>3 1/2<p>It's very typical for these kind of film's to be more liked by the &quot;underground&quot; anti-everything crowd then main stream audiences. It appeals more to the teenager who feels the same way  Enid does. (Love her name btw) Thora Birch truly brings out the &quot;Daria&quot; like depressing charm in this not-so-unique but well done role. BTW-She looked absolutely cute through out this whole film, I totally fell for her with that short black hair, bold glasses, and perky outfits. She is such a doll! Too bad it seems like she lost all that weight now. ANYWAY <p>The movie has some great comedic moments following our pal Enid through her pessimistic look at life. Like when she get's a job at the theatre and the art class scenes to name two. While at first it seems creepy  that she likes this old dude Steve Buscemi they each have a charm that makes them perfect for eachother. Steve plays the dud like no one else can, but he always has a dignity about him. The movie is colorfuly and is really nice to watch it has a 50's charm in the decor and feel of the sets. The supporting cast is a riot and makes for an all round good 2hrs of film.<p>The film is not flawed though, while I'm all for endings that one can discuss with others. I feel that the Enid character didn't have any sort of redemption at the end. She talked about dissapointing everyone, and yet does nothing to fix this. I felt so bad for Steve at the end that I just couldn't appreciate what happens at the end. I know it's  supposed to symbolize that their ARE NO certainties in life, and there will always be things that suprise you. Enid realized this and went for it, BUT she should have fixed things with Steve before she left, I cannot forgive her for this.<p>Well if you like these Village-type movies or anti-everything  Art house films check out Waking Life, Fight Club, Mulholland Dr., or Vanilla Sky</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch star in this misfire attempt to film the graphic novel "Ghost World".  I'm not sure who this flick will disappoint more - those who've read the original and will nitpick over the differences, or those who have no familiarity with Daniel Clowes's offbeat characters, and may have no other reason to bond with the characters.  Like the original the movie tells of the what may be the end of a great friendship - the final summer for Enid and Rebecca.  With high school over, their ideas of the future (vague at first, but soon to reveal themselves as painfully distinct) may tear them apart.  Enid and Rebecca aren't so much as friends as two girls of similar age who loathe themselves and the entire world, but strangely not each other.  In their minds, the world is surrounded by freaks and fakes about whom they pursue, joke and otherwise exploit ruthlessly.  <p>The film gets the graphic novel's surface gloss right - John Ellis, Josh, the creeps who hang out at the "Zine-o-Phobia", the Satanists, Melorra, Enid's lame father, that "Weird Al" looking waiter (not played by "Weird Al" though) and that pair of pants that nobody ever picks off the street.  Now, Enid must take summer art classes to get her HS diploma.  A gifted cartoonist in the Daniel Clowes vein, Enid must nevertheless pass muster with a dippy art school teacher (Ileanna Douglas) and her PC students.  More significantly, the flick bravely tries splitting the friendship between Rebecca and Enid who finds herself drawn to another.  While the original Enid had desires, the flick gives her the chance for a real relationship.  In the book, Enid and Rebecca cruelly prank an older guy with a faked personal ad.  While the graphic novel victim dissappears in a cloud of anger, the flick hangs onto him - turning him into a luckless, feckless misanthrope with a name to match: Seymour (Steve Buscemi).  Curious at first, Enid gets closer to Seymour determined to help guide the guy to a real relationship, one apart from the losers who share his love of old 78 records.  Determined to use her powers for good and not evil, Enid becomes determined get Seymour snagged.  Unfortunately, when efforts prove successful, and Seymour improbably snags the woman of his dreams, Enid begins to realize her own feelings for Seymour.  Unsure of what she wants, Enid's mixed-up life begins to strain her relationship with Rebecca (with whom she's apartment hunting) and her art classes (which she must take to graduate HS).  <p>"Ghost" the graphic novel was an enigma, a grab bag of mixed-up tricks and treats.  The flick seems impenetrable, unfortunately to the guys who wrote it, and it's not as sucessful at turning the original's episodic storyline into a coherent narartive.  Seymour's painfully underwritten, especially given Buscemi's normal gift for banter - and nothing explains why Enid's attracted to him.  He ofcourse finds her beautiful, which is a problem - Enid wasn't supposed to be beautiful.  Not to be true to the original for the sake of authenticity, but Thora Birch is simply too radiant (if malevolently so) and youthful to play the self-loathing Enid.  Enid's secret desire is to suddenly become someone else and leave home forever.  In the novel, that works, but it doesn't seem to go with the rest of the movie, making the final shot (or panel) look forced - what is she supposed to be running from.  The flick also suffers the loss of Bob Skeetes, a mysterious seer whose few appearances in the story are more than compensated by the presence he casts over Enid's world.<p>IN SUM: If you never read GW, you'll probably spend most of your time just scratiching your head.  If you loved GW so much that you'll do anything to see Thora Birch say "Joey McCobb, he's our god!!" this is your flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>"Ghost World" wins my award for best movie of the past ten years.

This is a strange and very well made film that is touching, funny, sad and twisted.  One of those rare gems that did not fall victim to a &quot;Hollywood&quot; formula.  I don't know why it took me so long to finally watch this, but I'm glad that on a day when I had nothing to do that I decided to pop this into the DVD player.<p>Based on the underground comic book by Daniel Clowes, the story focuses on two characters who have just graduated from high school, Enid and Rebecca.  They love to snoop around in other people's lives and find ways to humiliate them for their own amusement.  When they play a practical joke on an isolating loner, Seymour, Enid can't help to feel a little guilty--which is something she never feels in similar situations.  She ends up forming a strange and open relationship with him after that, and that's when things become complicated for Enid.  While Rebecca has more of a focus on where to go next after finishing high school, Enid doesn't have a clue about her future.  She feels trapped in a dead end town that offers no sanctuary for her.  All of this makes way for a drama/comedy that sticks out from other films.<p>I had been told many times that this was a movie that I had to see, and now I finally understand why.  It was completely different from what I thought the movie would end up being.  It's funny and sad at the same time, which is a very difficult task to accomplish without it ending up being corny.  The movie is very well written (co-written by the very man who did the comic book), with very realistic dialogue and characters.  The movie doesn't really feel like a movie, because it feels like real life.  You feel like you know these characters and have seen them before.  We all went to school with people like this at some point.  That's when you know when something really works--when you feel like you are there.<p>One of the great things about the movie is that there is not a big payoff in the end.  There's on grand finale or an ending that lets you know that everything is going to be all right.  I know this was a disappointment for some people, but I couldn't envision the film ending in any other way.  It's a realistic and beautiful moment.  And to me, that was the greatest payoff you could find.  It also shows you that this film refuses to conform to Hollywood standards, which is always refreshing.<p>The DVD has a few things to offer--&quot;few&quot; being the keyword here.  Don't get me wrong, I was happy with the features that were included, but I was hoping there'd be a few more goodies for a standout movie like this.  The picture and sound is very good, so no problems there.  Extras included are deleted and alternate scenes, a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, trailers and a music video.  I think a great opportunity was missed here, as this is the perfect movie that screams for a commentary from the cast and crew.  Despite the fact that it isn't loaded with a ton of extras, it's still a very nice package.<p>&quot;Ghost World&quot; is a phenomenal achievement in filmmaking, in my opinion.  True, it is not something that everybody will be head-over-heels for, but those who end up loving it will really appreciate it for what it is.  It's a film that takes risks and never falls into a basic movie formula.  If you're looking for a movie that is different from the rest, this is an excellent choice.  A superb film on all fronts. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Ghost World" is a rare movie find, a shrewdly observant tale of societal outcasts that, in its own low-keyed, understated way, offers profound insights into the workings of human nature.  It is rare to see a film this confident in its purpose and tone.  Writer/director Terry Zwigoff and co-writer Daniel Clowes have fashioned a tale totally lacking in the sort of sensationalistic melodrama that blights so many films dealing with the issue of teenage alienation and angst.  Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson portray Enid and Rebecca, two long time friends who have just been released from that prison known as high school and are now forced to make their way in a world full of people towards whom they feel utterly contemptuous.  Enid and Rebecca, like many youngsters who find it hard to fit in, camouflage their insecurities in a cloak of blas&eacute; cynicism, adopting a tone of superiority to all the "cool" people who have rejected them.  Indeed, to these two young women, even being "cool" is uncool, so they comfort each other with the knowledge that they are simply too good for the society around them.  The problem is that while this "pose" may suffice to get one through high school, it becomes a definite hindrance when one is confronted by the realities of life on the outside - finding a job, planning a future, establishing relationships.  <p>In the latter department, Enid finds herself drawn to an awkward middle-aged man named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who is, in many ways, an older version of herself, a socially backward "dork" who frankly admits that the reason he collects so much memorabilia is because he prefers objects to people.  Enid and Seymour strike up a tentative relationship, but what makes "Ghost World" so extraordinary is that we never quite know where the story is going.  The writers don't go for the obvious plot turns so that, even by the end, although we leave the film feeling satisfied, we don't sense that all the loose ends have been tied up into a nice neat little package for our facile consumption.  In fact, it is the very ambiguous, open-ended nature of the film that makes it seem so truthful.  Even the characters remain strangely enigmatic throughout.  Rebecca begins to feel the stirrings of conformity as she starts working at a job and looking for an apartment in a conventional suburban neighborhood.  This tension causes the girls to start drifting apart, as does Enid's sudden interest in Seymour, a relationship Rebecca begins to view with a measure of jealousy and resentment.  Enid is also very recognizable in her refusal to confront the people who mean the most to her when times of conflict or crisis arise - preferring to let her answering machine cope with her problems for her, in the vain (but all too human) belief that by screening her calls she will also be screening herself from some of the problems she has helped to create.  We also see how these generally lost, but well-intentioned people, allow themselves to do very hurtful things to the people they love.  The emotional terrain of this film is surprisingly credible and complex.<p>As far as I can tell, there is really not an untrue moment in "Ghost World."  It creates fascinating characters and remains true to them to the end, never requiring them to utter a false-sounding statement or indulge in cheap theatricalities to get the point across.  Birch, Johannson and Buscemi give dazzlingly understated performances, never missing a beat as they create this strangely charming "ghost world" full of people who feel unconnected to the corporeal world around them.  On every level this film is a certified triumph.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>I watched this movie only after it was released on video and because my brother recommended it so highly.  I had absolutely no idea what the movie was about, apart from that it was a comedy, so what I got was a pleasant surprise when much of the comedy here is not only biting but tinged with loneliness and despair.  The film follows two girls, Enid (Birch) and her best friend Scarlett Johannson, as they graduate from high school and slum it through the summer vacation.  Playing pranks on the boring people of the Nowheresville where they live Enid suddenly finds herself attracted to an older man (Buscemi) who collects records obsessively.  Gradually she finds herself leaving her best friend behind for this older man and discovering that slumming it isn't a possibility for the rest of your life.<p>It's difficult to sum up exactly what the movie is about other than to say that it's basically about life, love, hope, despair and tragedy.  However, the caustic comedy lends this an edge that few other films have, not to mention a sometimes overwhelming honesty that is often incredibly moving.  Despite being billed as a comedy (and, indeed, it is very funny at times - in particular in its comments about modern art) this is really more of a drama with comedy in it.  The performances are all top notch, and Thora Birch really sets herself up as the next big thing with a beautifully understated performance that is well matched by the likes of Johannson, Buscemi and the fantastic Illeana Douglas, in a small but instantly recognisable role.<p>The thing with this kind of movie is that it's intelligent, and certainly doesn't belong to the 'American Pie' ilk of teen movies, but in fact is a much more mature little flick that is destined to become a cult classic given enough time.  Sure there are parts of it that are slow, but the emotional weight of the movie is undeniably, with an ending that is either hopeful or tragic given your point of view.  It only really hits you a few days later how good this film really is, and speaking as someone who watched it during the summer vacation before I went to university, it sums up perfectly the fears, dreams and hopes that becoming an adult entails.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CFNHYZG6WS8.html">A27CFNHYZG6WS8</a><br/><p>No matter how unmanagable, anti-social or hopeless a teenager is, it's always assumed that it's just a phase, that eventually you will take your proper place in society, get a job and home, begin relationships, have a family, generally contribute to your community and society, if only by paying tax.  this process should be increasingly likely is you are as pretty, intelligent, witty, self-assured and creative as Enid in 'Ghost World'.  but what if you don't?  what happens if you bypass or postpone the 'right' decisions?  You find yourself out of the loop, outgrown by friends, ignored by family, a lack of social identity resulting in lack of identity full stop.  You become a ghost, and 'Ghost World' is a film defined by absence and lack - of people not having what they want, with major decisions taken by others as if they didn't exist; when even your ideal better half is more of a waning shadow.  Some of the crucial scenes pivoting on Enid's life occur when she isn't even there.  in such a scenario, familiar reality, with its hierarchies and compartments and classification, stops looking familiar and real, becomes a ghost world of grotesques, empty dream landscapes, randomness, spectral impossibilities.  But you can disappear from and for everyone except yourself - Enid is afflicted with an infernal self-consciousness.<p>'Ghost World' is a very funny and smart film, the ultimate teen movie.  But because the reassuring resolutions and socialisations of the teen movie are dislocated, it is an incredibly sad, almost tragic film, a kind of downbeat accompaniment to 'Amelie', another heroine as ghostlike manipulator of others' lives, threatened with her own empty solitude.  <p>'Ghost World' is based on a celebrated graphic novel by Daniel Clowes, and this aesthetic is pushed (for the first time on film it seems to me) to powerful emotional effect.  As in a comic book, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, often caricatures, the film's look broad and flat - even Enid's front of calm, contemptuous self-assurance.  the emotion of the film, as in the classic Hollywood melodrama, is displaced onto the bright, almost day-glo colours; onto the wonderful clothes Enid wears (increasingly red, tactlessly suggesting the border between adolescence and adulthood she is reluctant to cross); onto the locales, especially Enid's and Seymour's rooms, beautiful pop culture attempts to reveal personalities ignored in the real world; onto the rich musical soundtrack, from Hindi rock'n'roll to classic, eerie country and blues; to Zwigoff's creeping, methodical camerawork.  For the patient viewer, the pay-off is devastating, in an accumulative, low-key way.  <p>this faith in popular culture (Enid's remarkable illustrated diary; graffiti; porn shops; jumble sales; old corporate logos etc.), the transient, quickly obsolescent, quickly rewritten or surpressed alternative history of America, of our own lives, the ghosts that won't stay buried, forms a merciful release from the current mind-numbing obfuscations of both high and low culture.  An Americana masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>From reviews I'd read, I expected to be blown away by Ghost World--much the way I'd been blown away by American Beauty and Lost in Translation.  I wasn't.  It's a good movie, mind you.  Interesting characters who feel very genuine albeit somewhat one dimensional, and an odd tangle relationships.  It also very effectively captures the alienation of smart teens growing up in a world that seems populated by zombies of one kind or another.  So, it's very much worthwhile watching it--maybe more than once.  (I can't help but think of Thora Birch as a smart version of Kelly Osbourne from her dress and mannerisms in this movie.  But that's neither here nor there.)<p>So what's wrong with it?  What keeps it from being great?  In part, it's the almost relentlessly brooding tone that keeps the characters from being fully realized human beings.  Maybe, just maybe, there are people as unreliable, aimless, and alienated all the time--just like Thora Birch's character.  But do we really need a movie about someone who is so malignantly morose?  And no one else in the movie really picks up the slack, showing that intelligent people can be sharp and effective, as well as cynical.  Without that counterpoint, the story has a mushy center, and starts to get--well--a little boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>I love the actors in this movie!  Ileana Douglas is a total goddess!!  Any role she plays is always done with such a passion; I am still scratching my head as to why she doesn't get roles that show what kind of talent that lady really has.  If you've seen the HBO series "Six Feet Under" I don't think there is anyone out there that has seen it that can honestly say they weren't moved or totally annoyed by her briefly displayed character in that series.  The irony is, her character "made" that series and provided something no other actress could have pulled off.  Well, Ileana does a little number in "Ghost World" too.  You can honestly look at her character and know there is not one actress in Hollywood that can pull off playing an overtly passionate art teacher like Ileana!  She's brilliant!  Unfortunately, this movie isn't!  It moves too slowly, has a dull plot, uses other extremely talented actors to play dumb-downed roles and fires jokes off at random without a punchline.  There are moments in "Ghost World" that are reminiscent of "Romi and Michelle's High School Reunion," (a far better film that uses humor as a background and not as the focus of the story) which makes me think this film doesn't really have much originality.  Countless movies have been made using the Goth genre as the setting for much more engaging stories but this movie simply doesn't bring home the bacon.  As much as critics have hailed this movie, the only thing this proves is exactly how catatonic critics really are!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like Terry Zwigoff's &quot;Ghost World.&quot; And there is much to appreciate in the performance of Steve Buscemi. But unfortunately there is much to dislike especially the zombie-like performance of Thora Birch who was asked to play the role of Enid after Chritina Ricci turned it down. Birch plays Enid with the same notes that she played her role in &quot;American Beauty.&quot; The difference is that in AB she was a supporting player but in this film she is the lead. And a lead role requires variety and shading. By the end of the film Birch's never-ending bank stare is bewildering . On the plus side much of the script is smart and witty. But Don Roos did this sort of thing 100% better in &quot;The Opposite of Sex.&quot; And just imagine what Ricci could have done with the role of Enid.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>Let me guess, you think im gonna use words like &quot;gritty&quot; and &quot;realistic&quot; to describe this movie. Right? Wrong.<p>Now when I wake up, the first thing that comes to my mind is, &quot;Gee, I could really go for a depressing movie that doesn't make me feel good at all.&quot; Seriously, this movie isn't &quot;art&quot;. It isn't good. Wonder why it didn't go to theatres? The reason this movie didn't go to theatres is because it relies too much on showing a depressive girl's obsession with some loner(Steve Buscemi in his first role that I haven't liked). The fact that anyone would want to see such a depressing movie amazes me. Even more amazing, people call this movie realistic and artistic. It isn't either of those things. It's just a movie that didn't make it to theatres and didn't sell that well on dvd.<p>In the end, this movie did horrible with the critics and being depressive isn't brilliant. It's depressing and boring.<p>But of course, people will defend it for some reason because it is apparently art. Any movies that don't go to theatre are brilliant!</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>"Ghost World" was the best movie I've seen in a LONG damn time. The key to a great movie is that it's its own world --<br />a self-contained universe. "Bringing Up Baby" is one such example, so is "Vertigo" and "For a Few Dollars More." Any of Billy Wilder's movies, too. This one was one of them.<br />I love Enid. A teenage H.L. Mencken, she skewers pretentious poseurs and tips over sacred cows. But, underneath her outer punk persona, there is a soft-hearted hero-worshipper. Her predicament is that she's stranded on a social desert island and uses cynicism as a shield to protect her from the hopeless banality in which heroes and passion are deemed passe by people who walk through life questioning nothing, but just parroting the answers they've picked up from the larger society.<br /><br />"Ghost World" abounds in social commentary, but doesn't fall into the schmaltzy trap of trying to "solve" the world's social ills. Although on the surface Enid is directionless, she nonetheless has a mania for sketching a diary of the oddballs and weirdos that make up her small town. An excellent artist and charicaturist, Enid ends up failing art class TWICE.<br /><br />Her airheaded hippy/burnout art teacher, Roberta (Illeana Douglas), is a walking cliche of a total conformist affecting an air of anti-authoritarianism. She blows off Enid's diary and her cartoons of Don Knotts, but pushes her students to instead produce so-called "controversial" art. A really dead-on scene is when one of Roberta's sycophantic students creates a sculpture out of coathangers, which represents "a woman's right to choose, something I feel super-strongly about." It's a gem of a parody on political art in which the politics are much stronger than the art. I was rolling on the floor when Roberta's real bad college art film "Mirror/Father/Mirror" clip was playing. God damn, that rings true. Roberta doesn't encourage the artistic impulse so much as pushing her agenda on the students to be "controversial" and "confront people's attitudes."<br /><br />So, Enid decides to spoof Roberta and bring in a "found object" of a Jim Crow charicature from the 1920s of "Coon's Chicken," which depicts a monkey-like negro. This pisses off the other students (who were sotto voce receiving the message that they should only confront people with PC controversy), but the irony of the movie is in how Roberta reacts to the Jim Crow poster; Enid can't get the time of day from her when it comes to her own talented artwork, but her jokes on Roberta's inanities wins Roberta over to her cause and even inspires Roberta to get Enid a scholarship to art college. All this falls apart when Roberta enters the piece in an exhibit, and the local censors force her to remove the poster and fail Enid in her class. Her capitulation reveals her devotion to "controversy" and "confrontation" to be a hollow pose, and she covers her [rear] by letting Enid be the lamb to the slaughter.<br /><br />The relationship between Enid and Seymour (Steve Buscemi) evinces Enid's yearnings to find someone to look up to, rather than down upon. I liked Steve Buscemi a lot. I'm so used to him playing funny roles, that it was sort of incongruous seeing him play it (mostly) straight in a comedic movie, but it worked quite well. Like Enid, Seymour is a middle-aged outcast, and at first becomes the victim to one of Enid's and her best friend Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) cruel pranks. But underneath the nerdish and pitiful exterior, Enid comes to discover in Seymour someone as isolated and alientated from society as she is. She finds in him a noble soul, whose passions are worn less on his sleeve than Enid's are, but locked up in his 1920s-themed room dedicated to his 78 rpm blues and ragtime records and poster art from the same era. Enid sees in Seymour a lot of herself, but also someone who has been run over once too many times in life and whose social rebellions have shrivelled into repressed loneliness. Enid finds in Seymour a hero, and gushes "I'd kill for a room like this" when complimenting his passion for nostalgia. To which Seymour -- who has given up on the possibility of ever fitting in or finding love -- replies "go ahead, kill me."<br /><br />By the movie's end, Seymour starts asserting his inwardly pent-up feelings to relate to the world through his romance with Enid. Finally getting up the nerve to break up with Dana, a nice, though conventionally-thinking person, in order to be with Enid, who shares his passions, and thinks like he does, Seymour nonetheless has his love for Enid somewhat unrequited. Just as the revelation that Seymour deserves happiness manifests itself, Enid alientates herself from the world -- and the two people she most treasured in the world, Seymour and Rebecca. A happy ending does not win the day, because Enid is compelled to travel down the same lonely path that Seymour has. Perhaps in twenty years, she will have become what he is now.<br /><br />As I recall, this movie was nomimated for absolutely NOTHING by the Academy of Motion Pictures "Arts and Sciences." And yet, this was the best movie in a year barren of talent, originality and true cinematic art. Now I understand why this movie is called "Ghost World."</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Ghost World , a dark comedy about teen angst, serves as an antidote to all those mindless Hollywood teen comedies and/or dramas that sprout up in multiplexes like summer weeds. Be forewarned that this antidote is far stronger than many viewers can tolerate. Consider the tag line that appeared on its theatrical posters: "Accentuate the Negative"<p>Movies about the alienation that some teenagers feel can be traced back fifty years to the James Dean classic, Rebel Without a Cause. Prior to this film, pathologically unhappy kids were always depicted as residents of slums and orphanages. Suddenly, here was a movie that showed kids growing up lost and miserable in a middle-class environment. The idea that the American Dream had a dark side was controversial then. It still is. <p>In Ghost World, Enid and Rebecca [brilliantly played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson] are best friends who are just graduating from high school. They're of the super cool, intelligent group that sees beyond the hype and myths of our consumer driven society. As the movie plainly shows, those who see the world too clearly can end up even more clueless than those who see it through a mental fog can. It points out that belief in false values can be more comforting than belief in no values at all. This, of course, presents one of the great conundrums of life in suburbia. <p>Enid and Rebecca's plans for the summer include getting an apartment together. Rebecca is the more realistic of the two. She gets a job and goes about looking for a place for them to live. Enid is paralyzed from seeing little of meaning in her life. Her assessment of the world around her is accurate, but her attitude starts to cause a rift in her relationship with Rebecca. <p>The girls alleviate their boredom by play mind games with people. When they read a pathetic personal ad in the newspaper, they decide to contact the nerdy-sounding guy who placed it. This turns out to be Seymour [Steve Buscemi], who collects old 78 rpm records, hasn't had a date in years, has forgotten how to carry on a normal [meaning banal] conversation, and has made a lifestyle out of alienation. Enid has found her soul mate, but can two such searching souls ever truly bond with another person?<p>Director Zwigoff, who in real life is not unacquainted with alienation, has made an ingeniously original movie. The subject matter may be dark, but it is never brooding. Humor abounds in nearly every scene, although much of it is the kind that some people don't understand or don't appreciate. Too dry, too scathing, etc.<p>Ghost World is based on a famous underground comic book `novel', which may be why the world it shows often seems to be coming from some alternate reality. The place the girls live in exists in its own time and space. Everything's just a little too bright, a little too strange, a little too off center. I liked this odd point of view. It made the black humor more palatable. This city wasn't like the one I live in. Or was it? I couldn't really solve my problems the way Enid did at the end. Or could I? Is her world science fiction, or is the real fiction the world we have created? <p>Some people will always dismiss the problems that cause teenagers who have been given `everything' to see their lives as lacking in meaning. Ghost World  doesn't provide answers or solutions. It does do its quirky best to show us that there are valid reasons why some people see life's illusions too clearly, both in the movie's world and in the real one. It also says that such people are not necessarily as weak as they appear. They can and do go on to lead useful, productive lives. But first they must find their way out of the mess they were born into.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>From the conspiratory frowns of disdain between Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) at the graduation scene, to when they both give the finger at the graduation sign outside the school, we see that our two heroines are not the typical ordinary Generation Y-ers. Both don't want to go to college like many of their peers. Rebecca at least has some vague idea, such as moving out of her parents' home and saving enough from work to get a place of her own as a first move. She does get a job at a coffee shop, where she learns about customers. "Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody." Sounds like me at work.<p>They spend their first weeks of freedom following people whom Enid thinks might be Satanists, going to Wowsville, "the Taj Mahal of fake 50's diners" complete with a waiter they nickname Weird Al, and make caustic comments about their conformist peers, such as Melorra, a bubbly extraverted dingbat from high school whom they mimic behind her back." With some female cajoling, they get Josh, a guy they like to torment, to drive them places. The note they leave on his apartment door is funny!<p>Their lives begin to diverge when they play a practical joke on Seymour (Steve Buscemi) at Wowsville. They follow him home and later, Enid buys an old blues-country record at his garage sale, of which she's totally enthralled by Skip James' "Devil Got My Woman." From then on, she hangs with him, slowly pushing Rebecca to the sidelines.<p>Seymour's a reclusive eccentric, collecting memorabilia from the 1930's and 1940's. Like Enid, he isn't comfortable with mainstream life. "I can't relate to 99% of humanity." he tells her, to which she replies, "I can't relate to humanity either but it's not completely hopeless." His statement of not being in the same universe rang a chord inside me. Another time, he asks her, "You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? [You] can't connect with other people so you fill your life with...I'm just like all these other collector losers." Fits me to a tee.<p>Enid (with her ever-changing glasses) really has a blast at Anthony's, an adult shop, laughing and pointing at the paraphernalia inside, much to the discomfort of the other shoppers.  And check out that sexy leopard mini and black blouse she's wearing.  Rowr!<p>Brilliant dialogue peppers this gem of a movie. Enid uses her usual sarcasm on her job at the theatre, to a popcorn customer who wants extra butter: "Smothered in delicious yellow chemical sludge." Seymour makes a commentary on racism in America: "People still hate each other, they just know how to hide it better."<p>At the high school graduation we first see Enid in her red gown. She's also dressed in red at the end of the movie, coming full circle, meaning, that yes, she has gone through a lot during the few months after high school, but in a sense, she's still where she is, alienated by the rest of society.<p>Contrary to what I've heard or read, Scarlet Johannsson makes an excellent compliment to Thora Birch. She's more reserved and more knowing on what's expected of her now. Thora Birch is a marvel as Enid, unsure what she wants, as she undergoes a transition period that takes her into the unknown. However, Steve Buscemi's Seymour made me think, "Is this really the same guy who was Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs and that guy 'who was funny-looking in a general sort of way' in Fargo? WOW!"<p>So for those of you who don't relate to the rest of humanity in a major way, whose disillusioned lives are full of enlarged holes and tight cracks, this movie's especially for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>To begin with, let&#8217;s dispel any misconception that his is just another &#8220;teen&#8221; film; the main characters are teens, to be sure, but it is decidedly anything but.  Rather, it&#8217;s an examination of the methods we employ in the attempt to connect with the world in which we live, and how we negotiate our own specific time, place and environment.  A comedy/drama by director Terry Zwigoff, &#8220;Ghost World&#8221; explores what it means to be on the outside looking in, without necessarily wanting to be on the inside, but unsure of what the next move should be or to whom or what we should reach out and embrace.  And, as the story unfolds, we discover that the elusive answers have much to do with our own preferences and perceptions of a world in a constant state of flux that refuses to slow down or wait for us to make our decisions.<p> Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) have just graduated from high school.  Their plans for the future include sharing an apartment-- and so far, that&#8217;s it.  Toward that end, Rebecca has secured a job at a local Starbucks, but Enid is stuck in the procrastination phase, job-search wise.  Be advised, however, these two are no &#8220;Romy and Michele;&#8221; mature beyond their years-- especially Enid-- they have a jaded, cynical view of the world in which they live and those who populate it.  They possess a keen insight into human nature, but regard those around them with a rather cold and detached perspective.  They observe people, Enid sometimes sketching them from a distance, and often they follow their subjects just to see where they go and what they might do.  Life to them is something of an academic character study, with perhaps an underlying sense that by so doing they just may stumble onto their own niche-- though without realizing what they&#8217;re doing themselves. <p> It&#8217;s all fairly harmless, at any rate, until one day they inadvertently get too close to one of their marks, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a man they view initially as a pathetic little geek.  They initiate an incident involving him that is cruel in the extreme, and when they follow it up rather than just dropping it and letting it (and Seymour) go, their lives take an unexpected turn, and for the first time they get caught up in their own scheme of deceit.  And it&#8217;s a step toward the inevitable changes we all face in our lives-- and slowly they begin to understand at least one thing:  That once the die is cast, there is no going back.<p> From the outset, you realize these characters are not your typical, average cinematic teens, and as the story evolves, Zwigoff does an exemplary job of developing them.  They change, they evolve; and you see it.  And given the fact that this story is adapted from a comic book, there is an unexpected depth to it, along the lines of &#8220;American Beauty&#8221; or &#8220;The Ice Storm.&#8221;  It&#8217;s funny, as well-- hilarious, in fact-- but the humor is never contrived or forced, but flows quite naturally from the characters and their situations, just as in real life where you find that even the most serious situation has a humorous side, though to find it you may have to take a step back and look for it.  Zwigoff allows us to take that step back and see that side, along with the drama; and the result is a film that is funny, incisive, insightful, and at times extremely moving and poignant.  The ending alone is enough to initiate hours of discussion.  Extremely well crafted and delivered, Zwigoff&#8217;s work here should have earned him an Oscar nomination, as it is clearly superior to some that were rewarded with that honor.<p> For years now, in numerous films, from &#8220;Fargo&#8221; to the sleeper &#8220;Trees Lounge,&#8221; Steve Buscemi has been one of the best character actors in the business, and the role of Seymour is arguably his best work to date.  And inexplicably, like Zwigoff, the Academy overlooked him.  Buscemi&#8217;s Seymour is the epitome of a regular guy who, if not exactly content with his life, accepts it and has no delusions as to who and what he is; and Buscemi plays him beautifully.  There&#8217;s a touch of Donnie from &#8220;The Big Lebowski&#8221; in him, but with much more depth, and an attitude that is decidedly acquiescent.  This is a guy who doesn&#8217;t expect much, because he knows he&#8217;ll never get it anyway.  It&#8217;s an engagingly subtle and honest portrayal that also gives definition to the contrast between his stage of life and that of Enid and Rebecca&#8217;s.  Buscemi was perfectly cast in this part-- absolutely no one could have played Seymour better.<p> One of the true revelations of this film, however, is in the emergence of Thora Birch, who turns in an absolutely commanding performance.  All that she&#8217;s done previously has been but a warm-up for her portrayal of Enid, which, without question, will propel her already successful career to an even higher level.  With an understated and oh-so-subtle manner, she manages to convey so much about what is going on behind Enid&#8217;s eyes; all the emotion, all the confusion that hides behind her mask of external indifference.  Birch knows her character inside and out, and presents Enid accordingly, letting us know unequivocally how she feels about those around her, including Rebecca, her father (Bob Balaban), and especially Seymour-- through her relationship with whom we learn so much about her.  It&#8217;s terrific work by an extremely gifted young actor.<p> Johansson gives a striking performance, as well, though her character is ultimately overshadowed by Birch&#8217;s Enid.  But it&#8217;s good work, and one of the strengths of the film.<p> The supporting cast includes Brad Renfro (Josh), Illeana Douglas (Roberta) and Stacy Travis (Dana).  Filled with memorable characters and scenes, &#8220;Ghost World&#8221; is a thoughtful and highly entertaining film, deservedly recognized with an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay.  This is the magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I went in to Ghost World expecting an oddball comedy, so I was surprised by the nuance, depth, and emotional complexity of this film.  There are some funny moments, certainly, but the whole movie is just too deep, dark, and meaningful to be dismissed as mere comedy.  Your reaction to the film may well depend on what kind of person you are - or were back in school.  If you were cool and ran with the in crowd, you'll probably laugh - condescendingly, of course - at the losers who make up the main characters of the story.  If you were an oddball and have drunk deeply from the waters of alienation, however, you will feel a real kinship with these characters.  The only bad thing about this film is the fact that there isn't enough of Scarlett Johansson in it.  It's really all about the character of Enid (Thora Birch), an incredibly complex character who wears alienation like a crown and tries to avoid total decimation at the hands of a cruel, mixed-up life.  We start out with Enid and her friend Rebecca (Johansson), but - for obvious reasons - Rebecca has a lifeline to normalcy and makes a much better transition to post-high school existence than her friend.  The fact that her partner is crime begins to grow apart from her only makes Enid's journey all the more difficult to navigate - and there is much to fuel her contempt for the world.<br /><br />The plan is for Enid and Rebecca to gets jobs and rent an apartment together, playing pranks and generally complaining about how fake and stupid everyone else is in their spare time.  After Rebecca starts working, though, you can start to see that her heart's just not in their long-held plans, while Enid just sort of sleepwalks through each day with no purpose whatsoever - apart from attending the remedial art class she has to take during the summer.  She does find a project for herself, though - one extremely weird fellow named Seymour (Steve Buscemi).  Of course, it begins with her setting the hapless Seymour up on a fake blind date and watching him suffer through the internal agony of being stood up.  She follows him, though, and the two strike up an unusual friendship.  Seymour is a great collector of classic jazz and blues records and an odd assortment of other things, and he basically lives in that forgotten world he has recreated for himself.  Enid sets out to find Seymour a girlfriend - which is quite a project indeed, as Seymour is almost hopelessly undesirable in the eyes of the world (or at least the 99% of it that Enid hates so much).<br /><br />Then Enid's world starts closing in on her in all sorts of ways.  Always alienated, she now begins to feel completely alone, and she basically keeps sabotaging her chances of reversing course (which is an unfortunate habit most of us weirdoes seem to have).  Every day brings bad news on some front.  By this point, the comedy is basically over and done with, and the final third of the film comes across as a nuanced, poignant look at this poor soul who truly doesn't know what she is going to do with the rest of her life - or even tomorrow, for that matter.<br /><br />I could say more, but this is really one of those films that you can't really explain.  There's no real sense of closure when the movie ends, but that is indicative of life itself - and that is really what Ghost World is all about.  Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi give inspired performances that will stay with you, Scarlett Johansson is marvelous, and some oddball characters (such as Numchuck Guy) round the film out quite well.  It's quirky, but quirky is almost always good.  I'm not sure how older people will react to this sort of film, but the younger generation will see much of themselves somewhere in this weird story, making Ghost World one of the most impressive coming-of-age movies of the new millennium.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Ghost World is a very comical, very dark look at American society through the eyes of two teenage misfits.  Recent high school graduates Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two girls who are outsiders, and that's how they like it.  They can't stand America's obsession with pop-culture, non-conformism, and retro styles.  They try to seperate themselves any way that they can.  They like to play cruel pranks on people they don't like or tell people awful things, true or false.  They hassle a boy (Brad Renfro) who works at a convenience store, they make fun of the valedictorian (Rini Bell), who is in a wheel chair and neck brace due to an accident involving alcohol, and they show up at Wowsville, a 50's nostalgia cafe that plays rap and techno music, just so they can mock the establishment to the waiters.  Neither of them are virgins, but I think that they were only messing with the guys that had sex with them (it's never directly stated, but I came to that conclusion myself, especially since their personalities would drive most guys away).  While most of the people/things that they attack deserve criticim (the valedictorian states in her speech that she no longer needs drugs, she is later seen drinking from a flask, and Wowsville is a poor excuse for a 50's diner), they still focus their time and energy on these things.  They even buy food at Wowsville, thus supporting the very thing they make fun of.  It seems as if even they can't seem to completely detatch themselves from the things they claim to hate so much.<br /><br />Neither of them plan on going to college, probably because it's what "everyone" is doing.  Instead, they try to find jobs so that they can move in together.  However, while Rebecca gets a job at a coffee shop (not Starbucks, but the same kind of place) and begins to grow up out of her high school persona, Enid is unable to either hold a job or outgrow her old, sarcastic self (which is part of the reason she can't hold onto a job).  She is perfectly happy going through life, criticizing the people and things she finds to be stupid (which is nearly everyone and everything).  Then she meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a middle-aged record collector who turns out to be a target of one of her pranks.  Even though she looks down on him, thinking he's a loser, she can't help but become somewhat attracted to him, both mentally and physically.  As she later states, "He's the opposite of everything I hate".<br /><br />Ghost World follows Enid, Rebecca, and Seymour over the course of the summer following their graduation.  Enid must attend a summer school art class (she failed during the year, and probably because even though she is a great artist, she doesn't conform to the teacher's nonconformist ways, if that makes sense).  Rebecca searches for apartments, while Enid shoots down her every suggestion, and the two best friends begin to pull apart.  Enid also spends a lot of time with Seymour, trying to get him to go on dates, but secretly hoping that he will ask her out.<br /><br />Not everyone will understand this movie.  Some people who do may find it to be too dark, or depressing, or pessimistic.  Personally, I found it to be hilarious and somewhat poignant, which is strange, seeing as how I am probably a likely target for one of their pranks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Ghost World' is one of those movies that you'll enjoy much more if you can relate, which I can.  When I was in school I was the social outcast, the uncool kid who hated everyone around him because they were too normal.  It's just so funny to watch a movie like `Ghost World' and think about my own high-school days.  The entire cast, notably the two female stars Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson turn in brilliant performances as best friends whose lives change shortly after graduating high-school.<br /><br />Thora stars as Enid, the social outcast who hates everyone and everything normal in her peers and finds her only sense of comfort in playing cruel pranks of those she feels unworthy.  Her latest prank includes Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a 40ish vintage record collector who is lonely and reclusive and is seeking female companionship through an add in the paper.  What Enid never expected is that she would develop a crush on this man who is "the opposite of everything I completely hate."<br /><br />As Enid's relationship with Seymour develops her relationship with her best friend Becky (Scarlett Johansson) begins to suffer.  Her negativity to everything associated with Becky and their plans is starting to push them apart.  Becky is trying to establish a life apart from the dependency of her parents roof, getting a job, an apartment, but Enid and her uncertain and complete fickleness is driving a wedge into those plans.<br /><br />Complete with that perfect deadpan sarcasm that laces almost every word, and the brilliant dry expression-ridden performances that only `accentuate the negative', `Ghost World' works on every level to deliver a brilliant comedy that is bound to please all who watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>"Ghost World" is based on a serial comic by "Eightball" scrawler Dan Clowes, who has a knack for examining pitiful characters without regard for the readers' tolerance of weird. I'm a regular reader of his work, and to hear that something of his was going to hit the major screen, I was amazed and thrilled. Im also waiting for Pete Bagge's Buddy Bradley to make his screen debut too, but I wont hold my breath.<br />When I first heard this was going to be made, I was expecting a full length cartoon, where the characters drift through a blue, black, and gray urban world like the comic. What we get instead is a live, semi-colorful, middle class, just near the suburbs world of convenience and sameness. Kind of like the town I grew up in. Thora Birch plays Enid Coleslaw, and she is mind bogglingly adorable as the pesky, dowdy, splay footed smart aleck  high school grad with an affectation for combat boots and outre culture. The movie spends a slow half hour accustoming the audience to Enid and her girlfriend Rebecca's weltaanschung of sarcasm and disdain for everything around them. This is the essence of the "ghost world", I believe; they disassociate with everything around them to the point where nothing good is tangible, where nothing happens, just like they expect it to. This, in and of itself, would be relatively intolerable for two hours...enter Steve Buscemi's character, who plays me...I mean..Seymour, another member of a "ghost world" except he's almost 40. He's an obsessive collector of old music and nostalgia that Enid befriends, and this is where the movie begins to build drama. You can see that these two have everything in common except age and station. They both choose to withdraw from the culture that has judged them inferior. What follows is a suffocating, tragic friendship that Enid can only mess up because she discovers that she is truly scared of everything, and after all, only 18. You wish them to be together, but their ghost worlds drift apart because their union is just as frightening as anything else. There is no happy ending here. In fact, this isn't even a comedy; anyone expecting a slacker send up has rented the wrong movie for the evening. There is nothing exploitative in this film at all, no violence and no sex, just enough claustrophobic human emotion to make anyone squirm. See if your ghost world is like theirs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Here's an unHollyowood film about life, roles, friendship and departure that transcends most of the trash available on the big or little screen. I saw this on TV last night, followed by the big screen spectacular &quot;Three Kings&quot;. It was more than clear to me which film was about ideas and real life, and which one was a cure for insomnia. I'll talk about the one about ideas and real life.<p>Unlike the Amazon synopsis and Leonard Maltin's opinion, this movie is not about alienation. It is about a cynical high school graduate's attempt to find a niche to fit into when her world undergoes changes she cannot understand. Thora Birch (&quot;American Beauty&quot;) is very good as the high school graduate with a dark view of everything in the world...until she meets milquetoast record collector Steve Buscemi. There is a good deal of cliche in this meeting but it serves to break the holocaust of darkness in her life, which is compounded by her best friend changing roles, her schlemiel father being an empty, vacuous figure in her life, and her indecision about what to do with her own life.<p>Birch focuses on loser Buscemi, trying to improve his lot in life. She successfully helps set him up with another woman, then injects herself in his life in a way to locate her own life when everyone she knows seemingly abandons her. When this fails, she follows the pattern of the only other stable role model in her life, a mentally ill middle age man who sits at a bus stop, waiting for a bus that never arrives. When his bus one day arrives, she decides to take it, too, as the movie ends.<br /><br />This is Birch's final removal from the world, the alienation most critics disucssed. I prefer to think of it as role acceptance, as finding her niche, as getting to a place she wants. This very simple film portrays a reality for many high school kids that come from single parent homes and lack direction after school. It tells a real story in an uncomfortable circumstance. People that enjoy nice neat stories in films will be very distrubed watching this. People whose minds look for meaning in film portrayals will become more involved the longer the movie goes on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I was totally not expecting to like this movie, the cover wasn't that creative, just two rather unattractive chicks. One of whom people seem to go ga-ga for, and she looks much better without the 20lbs she had to gain for this! I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself laughing along with Seymour (played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi) and identifying (slightly) with Thora Birch's character, Enid. She's the kinda person you could be friends with; she's so fantastic with the dry humour! However, I'll always know Thora Birch as Teeny in Now &amp; Then, and she's still the same, just a little more grown up, but she still does the same facial expressions. At least she doesn't have to put Jell-O filled balloons in her bra anymore! <p>Steve Buscemi did his character, the overly eccentric and dorky Seymour, who Enid almost seems to grow an obsession with, which results in something which is quite embarrassing and cringe-worthy, especially the aftermath. You really do feel sorry for him, especially since he seems to be after Enid more than usual afterwards.<p>You get a whole background to Enid's character - her wimpy father, her dress sense, her bedroom, her taste in music/films. But what was really disappointing was the lack of background information about Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) character. She was basically a tag-along, and did all the following of the leader, Enid. Her character could have lots of development to it, but she was pushed aside to overly-extend Enid's character and home-life. Scarlett has definitely changed since Ghost World - she's gone platinum blonde since 'appearing' in films like Girl With A Pearl Earring and Lost In Translation. Rebecca seems to come and go in the film, she doesn't appear that much, and disappears for a lot of the film, along popping up now and then.<p>I really saw similarities between this and Romy &amp; Michele's High School Reunion. And any other high school movies along these lines. <p>At the start, I did not like Enid. She basically bossed Rebecca about, told her what to do and when and then she started on Seymour! Towards the end, I really began to feel for her, and felt a bit sad. This film said it was like no other &quot;teen comedy&quot; which seemed to imply it was a teen 'comedy'. Am I missing something, cos most of the film made me feel really sad, when it came to Enid &amp; Rebecca falling out, or the awkwardness with Enid &amp; Seymour. Sure, Seymour was funny, but with me identifying with Enid, I think you'll find this film a bit sad. If you identify with Rebecca, then you'll find it even sadder! <p>I'm so happy to have seen this movie, and it's a great addition to my collection, don't you think?! I'm still a bit freaked that I identified with Enid that much! But this is definitely a movie to get, although the whole Ghost World title doesn't have a lot to do with the movie (although a very cool and original title) - just don't think you're actually seeing a film about ghosts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This is a great, great movie.  It could have easily gone off into another variation of the typical indie film.  Instead of being smug and overly quirky like many indie films can be, this film is genuine, intelligent, and humanistic as well.  I atttribute this to the director, Terry Zwigoff, who directed one of my favorite documentaries, Crumb, and the two excellent leads, Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch.  Buscemi here is especially good, playing a character that could have easily turned into a caricature with a lesser director and actor.  Buscemi plays a lonely 42 year old bachelor who lives with an astonishing record collection.  Some may have portrayed him with snark and made him look like a loser, but Buscemi and Zwigoff give him humanity and soul, and it makes for one of Buscemi's greatest performances.  He's really underrated as an actor.  Birch is excellent, too, as the sarcastic, yet human girl who takes a liking to Buscemi.  Again, their romance feels real, and she seems to genuinely like him, despite the differences in age.  It's not forced, sleazy, and it's not done for the sake of being quirky.  This is one of the best indie films I've ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Enid and Rebecca (Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson) have just graduated from high school. Part of the anti-social crowd, they hate just about everything and make fun of everything else. Enid seems happy enough to live this way for the rest of her life, but Rebecca soon gets a job and starts looking for an apartment in earnest. Enid becomes fascinated with Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a rare record collector, that they set-up on a false blind date. She genuinely likes Seymour and they become friends. As Enid and Seymour become closer, Rebecca moves towards a more normal, middle-class life.<br /><br />"Ghost World", directed by Terry Zwigoff ("Crumb") and written by Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes have created a really wonderful comic film. Clowes and Zwigoff have adapted Clowes graphic novel of the same name into a film that is original, funny and very memorable.<br /><br />Thora Birch ("American Beauty") is Enid, an 18 year old high school graduate who is floundering a bit now that she doesn't have the security of high school. As much as she hated it, it provided structure. Now she seems to be working overtime to find things to amuse her. Slightly chunky, wearing dark mismatched clothes, Birch accurately channels the spirit of a dissatisfied teenager. Scarlet Johansson is also very good as the second half of this relationship. More willing to adapt to the outside world, she is sort of the flipside of this record. A bit off the wall, but also more mainstream. The situations that they become involved in seem completely natural. It just seems natural for Enid to buy a leather cat woman mask at an adult book store. It just seems natural for Enid to wear the same mask proudly on the street.<br /><br />Steve Buscemi is brilliant as Seymour. Seymour is the type of guy who has let life pass him by. Forty something and still living with a roommate, he seems to covet his rare records than he does a relationship, causing him to be awkward and tentative when confronted by women.<br /><br />Illeana Douglas is also memorable as the summer school art teacher, the perfect embodiment of an artist who is struggling to make ends meet. It could be a caricature, but I have seen people like this in real life, and she captures it perfectly.<br /><br />Zwigoff has a decidedly offbeat sense of humor. His film is intelligent, thoughtful and very funny. The differences between this film and any mainstream studio effort at comedy (i.e., `American Pie', `Rush Hour 2') is that the comedy comes from natural situations, believable situations, which makes the comedy seem more real, more memorable and more funny.<br /><br />"Ghost World" is a great film and will most likely be on my list of best films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Terry Zwigoff's "Ghost World" is an adaptation of Daniel Clowes' graphic novel and is quite simply one of the best films of 2001. All filmgoers who felt that Thora Birch was a mountain of potential after seeing her in "American Beauty" have had their assessments validated - she gives the performance of her young career. Her character not only reminds you of the exact things that ran through your mind when you were 18, but also shows how much more sophisticated the current generation of teens have become in verbalizing these thoughts. The current teen is a master of intermixing angst, irony, humor, and insight and Birch is their perfect embodiment. "Ghost World" follows the adventures of Enid (Birch) and her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson). After both girls graduate high school, the question both of them have is "what's next?" "What's next" is Rebecca trying to make a life for herself and Enid choosing to remain in her world of irrelevance and mischief. However, she soon reassesses her life when she starts to fall in love with a kindred spirit in Seymour (Steve Buscemi). Yet this love does not stabilize her life, instead it makes it more chaotic and leads Enid to make a fateful decision that closes the film. Birch and Johansson are great and Buscemi adds a new vulnerable dimension to the trademark neurotic supporting performance he so often gives. Special ackowledgement must also be given to director Zwigoff who makes a seamless transition from making documentaries to making a feature. All in all, "Ghost World" is a wonderful cinematic experience and an ideal candidate for future cult status.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>Actually, I don't know what was more fun - watching Thora Birch's excellent acting in this movie, or reading the one-star reviews posted here on amazon[.com] from people who didn't like the film.  I agree that 'Ghost World' is an acquired taste.<p>The one scene that sticks in my head is the series of encounters Birch's Enid has when she decides to give it go as counter help at a movie concession stand.  Her snarky, jaded look at the world results in a series of hilarious "customer friendly" interactions.  And...she's out of there.  It's a perfect set of takes by Birch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This has got to be one of the most thought provoking films ever. Thora Birch, Steve Buschemi, and Brad Renfro all give memorable performances. It was so funny in it's own little sarcastic way! Any teen who watches this movie, or any adult for that matter, knows that they have been through the same situations before in life, or atleast have felt that way before..all alienated, like the world just hates you. The writer of this film new how to find humor in these situations, and pulled it off! <p>All together, a very moving and funny film that all should see! Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>Outsiders Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) have clung to each other for years, counting the days until their high school graduation when they can finally get an apartment together and begin their "real" lives - or so they think. But life for these two alienated young women is far from easy, even after high school. Finding a place for themselves is going to be a longer, stranger trip than they can imagine.<br />  Birch and Johannson have a weird but fascinating symmetry, with their masks of cynicism and hardness and sharp humor to keep the rest of the world at bay. Enid ( Thora Birch) is the real center of this picture, especially as her veneer cracks and her insecurities begin to show. She turns out to be far more alienated and lonely than she seems at first and I was awed by Birch's performance here.<br />  When they decide to play a prank on an equally alienated adult, played by Steve Buscemi, Enid and Rebecca begin to spin off from each other. Enid is fascinated by the guy but Rebecca is not. Enid forms a strange relationship with him, one that affects her profoundly and threatens her friendship with Rebecca.<br /> Not just another teen flick (in fact, I'd guess the average teen might find it depressing) but more of a coming of age story made for the outsiders in the world. Loved it!</p></br></body></html>

I lying in bed with a bad cold, and figured--What the heck, it's a scary movie and Nicole Kidman is in it. Might be ok.<p>By the time THE OTHERS was over, I was bolt upright in bed and feeling the chills, not from my cold but from a perfectly crafted ghost movie. I hadn't felt so absorbed and horrified (in a good sense) since I'd read Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS or James' TURN OF THE SCREW. And I think it's for the same reason a previous reviewer had mentioned: this movie has the feel of a 19th century ghost story and not a 20th century horror story. Not a single drop of blood is spilled. No skeletal or decaying corpse-like spectre threatening violence prowling around here. These &quot;others&quot;--from the other side of life--are an unknowable entity. Nicole Kidman's character is terrified by what the others don't tell her about themselves (once she believes they exist). She doesn't know what they want, and the perceived consequences of that are what fuel the second half of the film. This, combined with the fact that her children have been in touch with the others, yet they can only tell her mother so much, keeps her frustration and vigilance at fever pitch.<p>The gloomy setting, the inscrutible domestic staff, and the constant bickering of the children all add to the suspense. <p>This is an example of quality horror film making. It's the situation, the acting, the lighting, and of course a story with substance that keep it going. This is a profoundly moving ghost story with great performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>With the onset of big special-effect production houses like &quot;Industrial Light &amp; Magic,&quot; and &quot;Dreamworks&quot; there have been few movies in this genre of macabre horror that haven't capatilized on using visual imagery to achieve scares.  Monsters are more foul, more hideous than ever, and with the use of computers, almost anything can be created.  And yet, in a twist of irony, it is these very same effect houses that have diminished our ability to be scared by de-sensitizing us to the macabre by making it so readily available.<p>This is why some of the more inventive directors in Hollywood are again turning to more traditional means of filmmaking, focusing on camera effect, light and shadow, and most importantly, story-telling, to achieve bigger screams and better thrills.  &quot;The Others&quot; is a prime example of such a film.<p>Set in the long halls, and lofty rooms of an old English manor, the story tells of a woman and her ill children, living alone and abandoned on an island in the throws of a world war.  The woman, played brilliantly by Nicole Kidman, is met by a trio of housekeepers who arrive unexpectedly at her doorstep.  She invites them in and hires them immediately, explaining the house has been left in disarray since the last set of servants disappeared very unexpectedly.<p>It isn't long before the story really starts to build momentum.  The children, who suffer from an illness that makes sunlight lethal to them, move about the house in darkness, each room's windows carefully covered to avoid exposure.  Relationships begin to develop between the family and the servants, and as they do, so too does the house begin to fill with the sound of the &quot;others&quot; who seem to have taken residence.  <p>The story is very simple, almost linear in its development, but its strong focus on developing its characters a layer at a time provide more scares, more edge-of-your-seat than any effect could.  Ironically, there are no obvious special-effects in this film.  It is the masterful use of light and shadow, odd camera angles, and a beautifully written soundtrack that make this film both frightening and genuinely interesting to watch, right up to the suprise ending in the final minutes of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Nicole Kidman got some fine notices when she first appeared in DEAD CALM and FLIRTING, but she pretty much disappeared into dull girlfriend roles during the years of her marriage to Tom Cruise. She did garner critical attention for her funny comic turn in TO DIE FOR, but the part closely approximated the press's conception of her (as scheming arm-candy) and it wasn't until this fine thriller by Alejandro Almenabar came out in 2001 that people began treating her seriously. (Although she was nominated for her first Best Actress Oscar for MOULIN ROUGE--which came out earlier that year--, it wasn't until the fine notices for her work in THE OTHERS that people started taking her role in MR more seriously.) <p>Even without Kidman's splendid turn as the neurotically brittle Grace, the mistress of the mysterious Isle of Jersey mansion where she lives during WWII with her small children, this Gothic chiller would be a real treat. The pace is purposefully slow, and the colors are all watery and muted: the gigantic house surrounded by fog and greenery seems like something out of a Willkie Collins sensation novel. Grace lives in the mansion bereft of her husband (who has left her to go to War) and servants (who recently left Grace and her children on a  traumatic day in the recent past we hear referred to again and again in the film ). Her eldest child, the willful Anne (Alakina Mann, in a memorable child's performance), is reporting encounters with a frightened and angry family of ghosts living in the house with them. It is into this that on one day a trio of strangers, led by Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flannagan) approach Grace in the mansion looking for work... but it seems they know this house already from before...<p>Many who saw this film in 2001 were disappointed in that its ending reminded them too much of another popular ghost film. But this is unfair, especially given that THE OTHERS started filming before the other film had been released. It's a superbly scary Gothic, and offers three superlatives for the three women at its core: FLannagan, Mann, and the amazingly complex Kidman.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>An evocative, old-fashioned ghost story with a series of increasingly shuddery twists, The Others is absolutely terrific.  If you love suspenseful, eerie scary movies with a genuine surprise ending, look no further.  The look and feel of this movie, with its perfect cast -- those British children are haunting, and Nicole Kidman is excellent as their high-strung mother -- give it an ageless, classic aura.  It is hard to shake the wildly original story from your head, once you make it to the spine-tingling finale.  With the same smart, well-crafted feel of The Sixth Sense, but set in a big, old, creepy house perpetually in darkness and fog, this movie delivers the goods and then some.  Boo!</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>Atmospheric, brooding, eerie - this movie is all that and more. "The Others" isn't filled with shocking emanations. Actual scares are few and far between. You'll realize the haunted nature of this house isolated on one of the Channel Islands just after World War II - more by soft, suggestive steps.<br /><br />When Nicole Kidman's character explains that her children are photosensitive and have to be shut away from all natural light - the scene is set for flickering candlelight and dark corners. But it isn't all these elements of the classic ghost story that make "The Others" memorable. It's the brilliant way it's all wrapped up.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of essential material on the separate "Extras" disc that comes with this Collector's Edition. The only feature I found to be really interesting is the mini-documentary about photosensitivity, a rare condition whose medical name is "Xeroderma Pigmentosum." A family that has a child living with the condition explains the lifestyle adjustments that they've made to accommodate the condition. One of the most helpful things they've done is to get their children in touch with other children who have the condition. They gather from all over periodically and have, not a day camp - but a night camp. They learn to appreciate the beauties of the night - as the characters in this outstanding movie must.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a superb, atmospheric ghost story that will have the viewer thinking right from the get go. There are things afoot here that go bump in the night, but it may not be what the viewer thinks.<br /><br />On the Isle of Jersey, during the last days of World War II, a lovely, isolated mansion sits in the shrouding mists. The house is adequately, though sparsely, furnished. It is occupied by a mother, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). The children are afflicted with a great sensitivity to light, so much so that they must, at all times, have the curtains drawn and the shutters closed. Grace's husband, the children's father, had left them to fight in the war. This is a perfect and stark setting for what is to come.<br /><br />One day, three strangers arrive on her doorstep. Grace presumes that they are there in response to her post for domestic help and hires Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) on the spot. Grace instructs them on the idiosyncratic ways she has of handling her children's sensitivities to light. It soon becomes clear, however, that this triumvirate has their own agenda and are not strangers to this house.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman give a remarkable performance in this film. Tightly wound and controlling, she appears to be a woman on the brink of a breakdown, holding herself together only by a great effort of will, as she awaits her husband's return. Her performance as a lonely wife and seemingly protective mother contributes greatly to the tense and suspenseful atmosphere in the household. While I am not generally a fan of Ms. Kidman's, finding her ice maiden demeanor to be too cool for my tastes, even I must agree that her performance in this film is superlative and contributes greatly to its overall success.<br /><br />The children both give excellent performances. It is the young boy, James Bentley, however, who deserves special mention. He shines in the role of Nicholas, giving a sensitive performance that conveys his pervasive fear of what seems to be going on in the household. It is a poignant and moving performance that will capture the viewer's heart.<br /><br />Christopher Eccleston is marvelous in the role of Grace's husband and the children's father, who returns all too briefly, like a deus ex machina, conveying an infinite and bittersweet sadness that only adds to the disturbing portents that seem to be gathering about the Stewart household. Eccleston is an outstanding actor who manages to contribute greatly to the film in this small, but pivotal, role.<br /><br />It is, however, Fionnula Flanagan in the role of the mysterious housekeeper, Bertha Mills, who steals the show. She is like the voice crying in the wilderness to those who will not hear her message. Strong and commanding in her performance, it is she, and not Nicole Kidman, who is the backbone of this film. Her presence lends such an eerie and discordant note, that one feels her presence to be that of a harbinger of doom. Yet, things are not all that they seem in this household, as the ending has a surprising twist to it.<br /><br />This wonderful and highly atmospheric ghost story is one that is sure to delight those appreciative of this genre of film. Intelligent and finely crafted, it reveals an eerie story borne of psychological despair and horror. Beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar, it succeeds where others have failed. Relying on well nuanced moments, rather than grotesque special effects, this is a film that is sure to withstand the test of time and emerge as a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>I just finished watching this movie after renting it tonight.  Time to review it.<br /><br />This movie was recommended to me by my friend here on Amazon, Brian Nallick ("Metalman Minnesota").  Thanks Brian.<br /><br />I don't want to go into a summary of the plot, etc. because there are 743 reviews already written.  I just want to say a few things.<br /><br />I had heard a lot about this movie over the years, but had never seen it until tonight.  It's definitely a movie that is right up my alley - a haunted house/ghost story that relies on atmosphere and psychological horror and suspense rather than CGI, blood, gore, and anything and everything that is obvious.  This movie is often compared to The Innocents (1961).  The stories are at least loosely similar and certain scenes look alike in both movies.  In my opinion, The Others isn't quite as good as The Innocents, but it's definitely up there with the best haunted house/ghost story movies ever made.  Nicole Kidman does some great acting.  I think The Innocents has a spookier and more haunting atmosphere, but The Others has a lot of spooky moments as well.  Check out the outdoor scenes in the fog and at night.  The dim lighting throughout much of the movie really works (of course, the children need to be protected from the light).  The era that this movie takes place in is immediately after World War II, whereas The Innocents takes place in the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Overall, The Others is a fine film that definitely deserves the praise it has gotten over the years.  I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>I love it when a movie can surprise me since it's rare that ever happens.  So when I come across a movie like "The Others" that I thought I had all figured out, only to be delightfully proved wrong, I get very excited.  There's a plot twist involving the elderly couple that I guessed early on, and I suspect most audiences will suspect early on.  However, the final ending was something I had NO idea was going to happen.<br /><br />This movie moves slowly in some parts, however, Nicole Kidman's character is so bizarre that I was able to keep interested in this movie even during the slow parts.  I kept trying to figure her out.<br />An example of her bizarre behavior is in the beginning when she takes all these special precautions and administers warnings before anyone can even see her kids.  I kept wondering if her kids had rabies or something.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased that there's still master filmmakers out there who can delight audiences with great plot twists.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>...which is surprising since I'm not that big of a Nicole Kidman fan.  But she was cast-perfect as an over-stressed mother who had done the unthinkable.  This was the film she should have gotten a nomination for and not that Moulin Rouge nonsense.  I was totally blow away by the acting, direction, cinematography and even the score. Pace perfect-spooky and an all around thriller.  If you haven't seen this film, you're serious missing out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Others is a stylish horror movie. The film stars Nicole Kidman, she should have received an oscar nomination for her fearless performance instead of Moulin Rouge. She is absolutely spellbinding as an isolated mother who's husband is off in war and her two small adorable children suffer from a disease which makes them photo sensitive to light. Grace (Kidman) is a religious woman but she is torn between her life and her will to live. Gorgeously directed, terrific acting from the entire cast, The Others has to be the one of the best horror movies in the last decade. I loved every frame, every scene, every camera trick, if you are not a fan of Kidman's, you will be after you watch The Others.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>This movie is one of my favorite ghost movies out there. I LOVE the twist it has. AWESOME! I HIGHLY recommend this one!</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>The Others is a directorial triumph for Alejandro Amenabar, as the film succeeds at maintaining a certain level of emotional intensity throughout. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is an overprotective mother, shielding her two light sensitive children from the outside world. She hires several people to assist in care of the children and household, but these servants share a certain secret, protecting both Grace and the children from the reality of what is happening. The pace of the film is slow but measured, the characters convey the intensity and sometimes terror of what they feel; Nicole Kidman particularly ratchets up the level of intensity and territorialism, acting as a mother in the most protective and frenzied manner. The reality of the situation finally comes to light at the end, one of the psychological twists one expects from a particularly well done film. The film is a fine cinematic achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>This film has all the essential qualities of a classic ghost story. It really comes down to the fact that if a ghost story is told well, it will scare you. ~The Others~ is extremely well made, each scene is crafted to ensure it evokes a particular mood or feeling in the most subtle ways. Director Alejandro Amenaber, (Open your Eyes) is a Spanish craftsman who has a gift for telling a story with subtlety, nothing is ever apparent, but is hinted at through the visuals and clues in the dialogue. Personally, the in-your-face horror stories do nothing for me. I find Eddie Krugger, for example, hilarious. What is horrifying, for me, is subtle irrational behaviour. Grace (Nicole Kidman) at the opening of the film instructs the servants to ensure they close and lock every door in the house as they move through them. As she believes the sunlight is dangerous to her two children, she is absolutely adamant that the light must be contained. Suddenly our normal sensibilities are reversed, the light is the enemy and the darkness must be secured at any cost. I find this sort of thing more disturbing than 'Jason' rising from the depths and decapitating a few unlucky teenagers. Subtlety is the key for a good ghost story.<p>Nicole Kidman is a versatile actor who possesses a huge range. She has shown that she can play just about any character and play it with believability. In this film her neurotic behaviour is honest to the point of irritability. She is also an attractive and elegant woman and a pleasure to view on the big screen. Her performance in this film is quite good, but Fionnula Flanagan as the head housekeeper stole the show. Her expressions throughout the film would constantly put me off balance - the characters intentions are never clear until the end. She plays a veneer of kindness with a hint of evil bubbling just under the surface. Again, this was a subtle performance which created a huge impact. In fact, all the performances from the cast, particularly the children, were first rate.<p>This is a good film to have in your collection because it can be seen more than once, as there are subtle aspects in the story that will be missed on a single viewing. The mark of a good ghost story or any tale is its light touch and unexpected twist. This film has both.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>This film is unique in that it relies almost entirely on the audience's imagination. Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963) was quite similar, and far superior, as were the two "English" haunted house movies that come to mind ("The Innocents", "The Uninvited"). From a 2001 perspective, I'm so completely impressed that elements of my 3 favorite haunted-house films have resurfaced so intelligently today without resorting to smarmy fake CGI effects. Most of the credit must go to Alejandro Amenabar, director and visionary (he also "wrote" the score...with the help of a computer...to eerie and substantial effect). Amenabar controlled the slow descent into abject terror so perfectly that I was totally taken in. Other reviewers suggested that the ending was obvious..sorry, I kept my mind a little more open to the flow of events. Nicole Kidman was justly given kudos for this performance, and I was very impressed with Fionnula Flannigan as the housekeeper. But the real treats here are the performances of two absolutely superb kid actors, Alakina Mann & James Bentley. Nothing annoys me more than bad kid actors; these two were brilliant: natural and genuinely convincing...a rarity! The 2-disc DVD has a great transfer of the film; the 2nd disc has some extra "stuff", though not enough to warrant an extra disc. One interesting "extra" is an explanation of XP (Xeroderma Pigmentosum), which I found interesting because I'm a fan of Dean Koontz, and one of his best heroes suffered from this ("Fear Nothing" and its sequel "Seize the Night"). There's also a fine background regarding Amenabar and his methods in directing the film. I'm not going to explain those previous comments, because I don't want to blab-away any plot-points. I really enjoy a good ghost story, and this IS a very good one. Check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Once `The Sixth Sense' opened to major critical acclaim back in 1999 it seemed that there was a sudden rush of `ghost films' making their way to your local theater.  Some of them failed miserably to capitalize on what made `The Sixth Sense' so remarkable and groundbreaking.  And then there were a select few that just got it right.<br /><br />`The Others' is one of those few.<br /><br />Now, working off of my last review for `Planet of the Apes' where I showed a negative example of `suffering' through the same film twice in a row; I actually saw `The Others' in the theater twice in the same day as well.  Yes, I had a lot of time to kill back in 2001 (apparently).  I also worked in the mall, so when I got off work I moseyed over to the theater (right around the corner from the store I worked in) and picked a flick to watch.  After watching `The Others' I was moved to call my friends and recommend they see it.  I was lucky enough to accompany them.<br /><br />This movie still gives me shivers today.<br /><br />I think what makes `The Others' so compelling is the way it uses the genre clich&eacute;s to its benefit.  There is a lot going on here that is `standard' so-to-speak when you consider the genre, but this film manages to make it all work for it in a way that appears fresh and new to us.  The scares may be familiar (loud stomping in the dark) but this film pulls it off flawlessly.  The mood is beautifully set, with sets that are genuinely creepy without ever `trying to hard' to accomplish something.  The direction is sharp and the attention to detail is stellar here, actually building tension with every slipping frame.<br /><br />And then there is the acting.<br /><br />A lot of my friends consider Nicole Kidman's performance in `The Others' to actually be better than her Oscar nominated performance in `Moulin Rouge!'  It's hard for me to judge really, since they are so different, but truth be told that 2001 was a great year for Nicole.  She brilliantly captures the whole essence of this character, flawlessly exhibiting the right amount of chilled desolation needed to bring us into her shoes.  I also really enjoyed the young actors here, Alakina Mann and James Bentley.  They really understood the layers their characters needed to appear relatable and engaging.<br /><br />And Fionnula Flanagan is just brilliantly creepy.<br /><br />One thing I really LOVED about this film was the surprise ending that I NEVER SAW COMING.  There is a lot to be said about a twist ending that catches the viewer off guard without ever appearing to be forced or manipulated or preposterous.  This twist may even be better and more shocking than the one presented in `The Sixth Sense'!<br /><br />Just watch this movie; and then watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Nicole Kidman was at the top of her game in this film. It is a crackling good suspense movie, that unwinds its chills in slow twists of plot, and superb dialogue. Amenabar quietly, subtly, and ever so deftly reveals the twisted secrets of a haunted mansion, seemingly perpetually wrapped in fog, and seething with dark psychological underpinnings.<br /><br />THE OTHERS is a trance-like walk into a deviously, evolving nightmare, with a deliciously macabre finishing flourish. Not many ghost stories are comparable to THE SIXTH SENSE, or THE INNOCENTS. This lusciously atmospheric morsel is- in spades!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>This movie has some of the best acting I've ever seen in a spooky movie, not just by Kidman but by all of the cast. The storyline draws you in and I actually felt as if I were in that dark house with them. I guess many of the twists, I had the 6th Sense figured out right away, but this I wasn't sure of. I love it when a twist works like that!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>This is a welcome throwback to honest-to-goodness thrillers - no gore, just psychological spookieness. No senseless nudity, foul language or gouged eyeballs here - but fear reminiscent of the George C. Scott thriller, "The Changeling" or more recently, "The Sixth Sense."<br /><br />Nicole Kidman's acting is so impressive, as is the acting of the entire cast, you will find yourself on the edge of your seat. Set in post World War II England, Kidman's character, Grace,  lives in a large mansion on a posh estate. Her two children, Anne and Nicholas, suffer from a rare genetic anomoly that makes them sensitive to light beyond that of a strong lamp. Pure sunlight - even ambient light can raise blisters on their skin and ala Dracula, will kill them.<br /><br />Grace pines over her missing husband who never returned from battling the Germans, yet is not a confirmed MIA or KIA casualty. She finds herself housebound, unable to mingle with anyone in polite society or travel anywhere out of fear for her children's safety.<br /><br />Acustomed to being without electricity during the German bombardments throughout the war, Grace has decided to leave the luxury turned off, depending on heavy curtains to block out the light during the day and using oil lamps at night.<br /><br />Grace tells her 3 house servants that her daughter, Anne, has a vivid imagination who tells of ghastly eyeless women and an invisible boy named Victor. Grace repeatedly punishes Anne for lying... but soon she realizes there really might be 'others' living in the house with them.<br /><br />Whispering voices, creaky floors and other things that go bump in the night have you on your mental toes to figure out who might be dead, who might be alive and if one or more of the characters is just plain nuts and imagining the whole thing.<br /><br />I must admit, this is not my favorite genre. I do not belive there are earth-bound spirits of the previously living people walking around in people's homes - so it's not like at the end when all the loose ends got tied up that I had chills going up my spine - but if you had an experience like that with "The Sixth Sense" or "The Changeling," this movie will not disappoint.<br /><br />Having an intelligent storyline, superb acting and all devoid of rampant sex and toilet humor is a welcome relief compared to most movie fare coming out of today's Hollywood. While there are many scene changes in the large manor, the closed rooms and constant darkness and chiaroscuro lighting give the viewer a very claustrophobic feeling to the point you feel Grace's almost psychotic desperation and feeling of being trapped. Even the few moments when you see her outside the manor, the dense, eerie fog furthers the trapped sensation of the viewer and the characters.<br /><br />The acting of Alakina Mann (Anne) and James Bentley (Nicholas) cannot be understated in making this more of an experience than a film. Much of Kidman's acting shines through in the scenes in which she is by herself, panicking in fear and desperation. This is one of those films that truly highlights the depth of her acting acumen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>I love atmospheric ghost stories, and some of my favorites are The Changeling, The Haunting, Burnt Offerings etc. The Others is one such atmospheric horror movie with enough plot twists to keep you guessing almost right till the end. Yes, the movie tends to be a tad too long and plodding in the first half, but if you're patient, and just try to pay close attention to all the details, the rewards more than make up for the slow start. Nicole Kidman shines in her role as the overprotective & obsessive mother, and the two kids who play her children do justice to their roles as well ,coming off as creepy and innocent at the same time. I won't delve into the actual plot as it will only spoil one's viewing experience but I will definitely recommend this movie for those atmospheric horror movie buffs who love unexpected twists, and an intelligent ghost story!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>This is about the perfect thriller film for me, scary, but not scary enough to keep you awake the rest of your natural life, (although I'll admit, watching this before bed wasn't the best idea I've ever had.) Anyways, basically this film comprises elements of "The Sixth Sense" "Secret Window" "The Village" and some really good mystery film, and adds an eerily supernatural touch. In my opion, this film contained one of the 5 most chilling scenes I've ever seen, and no, I won't spoil it, (just beware of old people in communion gowns.) lol<br /><br />In the end, this is a very worthwhile thriller, and I reccomend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>An unapologetically civilized, old-fashioned horror movie that generates its chills from mood and suggestion, not gore and special effects. Kidman's Grace, a controlling woman perilously close to losing control, anchors the film, yet all supporting players excel too. Director Amenabar's eerie set pieces are bound to make your skin crawl. A jarring surprise ending caps an otherwise first-rate spook-fest.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>The story of a mother(Nicole Kidman) and her two sick kids dealing with creepy things and possible ghosts in their new home, a mansion that is dark and mysterious inside, while waiting for her soldier husband to return. They only used candles in the house, and the servants are also eerie folks. This film is not a typical scary  movie, and it excels at creating a spooky atmosphere and psychologically scarry. It is almost entirely set inside the house, except for a few exterior scenes. Fionnula Flanagan is memorable as the servant who knows what's really going on in the house. This is probably Kidman's best work alongside To Die For and Moulin Rouge. She looks great in the '50s makeup and hair, and gets to deliver a wide range of emotions throughout this film. Don't expect this film to have scarry looking faces popping out of the dark, because it's more striking at the mind than the eyes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>THE OTHERS is every inch as good as SIXTH SENSE which you will be forgiven for thinking that they stole ideas from - but as many have stated, it was the other way around.  THE OTHERS was penned long before SIXTH SENSE.<p>Whatever, nothing can quite prepare you for the spectacular ending (which I won't give away). Let's just say that it had an impact on me.<p>Nicole Kidman is excellent as a housewife caring for her two children while her husband is away apparently fighting for the War. When everything starts to unfold, we learn that this is not the case.<p>THE OTHERS is an incredibly sad tale, and Kidman's performance is such that you really do feel sympathy for her character.

The manic slightly claustrophobic anxiety to the whole thing.  Nicole Kidman is an actress I enjoy because of her versatility and the fact that she always seems to have something going on underneath her performances.  Like someone who is intelligent but may be too wrapped up in one focus.  Thats how several of her performances have struck me.  Which is a good thing.  Conveying both intelligence and life of character as well as a sub-mood is very skilled.  The twist here again is that her and her family are ghosts who haven't accepted death, much like the Sixth Sense but this movie goes a little further in the characters being disturbed.<br />I think that there tends to be a trend in consciousness or idea-streams in movies.  Lately it's been about consciousness---The Sixth Sense, the Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, big movies about the reality of existence, of what is alterable and what isn't.  I read somewhere that Hollywood/films are a projection of teh masses consciousness-------so when there are more violent movies and so on thats what we as a culture are experiencing on a level.  I think this can be seen with the proliferation of war movies and their ilk and at the same time these films about metaphysics, the ones that ask existentialism questions are fascinating as well.  I enjoy them because it does seem like there is challenge to them, a challenge to be more than just cookie cutter films.<br />Also what I will credit this film with is that it completely avoids being gorey, all of the violence is languaged/explained, not shown, which ratchetts up the tension even more.  We've all seen the horror pics of blood and gore, but psychological tension is much harder to create and maintain and pull off satisfyingly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>"The Others" does what no suspense/thriller/horror/drama hybrid of the recent decades has been able to do, instill fear and a genuine sense of the unsettling without resorting to gore, guts and gruesomeness to get its shock value across.  The story concerns itself with a young mother of two children who is hold up in a grand English manor waiting for WWII to be over.  However, when she employs three peasants who used to work the same land some time before, the scares really start to add up.  There's noises in the attic, shadows on the wall and "the others" - a set of disturbing (?) that wreak terror on the entire family.  The ending will truly shock.<br />Miramax 2-disc edition has been handsomely attempted.  Colors are intentionally faded but well balanced.  There is some minor edge enhancement, some scenes that have extremely low contrast and a hint of fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will terribly distract.  Also, there are a few scenes in which the picture appears slightly out of focus.  This is a very dark visual presentation and watching it in a completely darkened room is recommended to get the most out of the experience.  The sound is 5.1 and quite effective.  Dialogue is presented at perhaps a listening level a few notches below what is considered normal so turn up your volume before you start to watch.  Extras on disc 2 include documentaries, featurettes, theatrical trailers, interviews and stills.  Overall a very nice job.</p></br><a href="../users/A281NPSIMI1C2R.html">A281NPSIMI1C2R</a><br/><p>The irony is I was "more scared" of viewing this movie than I was while watching it. The previews gave me more chills, but honestly there is nothing really scary in this movie. It just made me feel "tense." You wait in anticipation for something absolutely scary to happen and the most scary thing is the curtains being left open.<br /><br />Reading the reviews here at Amazon makes this movie worth watching. I mean, watching and then reading. GLBT's review had me almost rolling on the floor. It was worth watching the movie to understand why he said what he did. Sweetmolly's review is probably more in line with how I felt about the movie. Lleu Christopher (Author of The Stone of Alexandria) mentioned it reminded him of "Rebecca" and I have to agree. Although I found "Rebecca" more creepy.<br /><br />There is this one scene where Nicole gets walloped with a door that is quite hilarious in a slapstick type way. Finally there was some comic relief. Otherwise there is a "certain tension" throughout the movie. Nicole is perfect for the role of the obsessive compulsive mother.<br /><br />You don't understand the implication until the creepy twist at the end. I want to start asking questions about the "logic of the story," however that would completely give away the interesting aspects. You will also feel yourself becoming very skeptical about the characters as the movie progresses.<br /><br />What you basically have is an obsessive mother living in a mansion in a misty woods where she keeps all the curtains closed. She believes her children to be photosensitive (acutely sensitive to all forms of Ultra Violet light) and keeps the light out of the rooms by locking one door and then opening the next. To get to her children, she has to lock and unlock doors. This adds a bit of fun when she has to get to them when she thinks they are screaming. Except her children are not the ones making the noise. It is a boy named Victor who she can't see, but her children can see.<br /><br />The entire story occurs at one house with most of the activity occurring inside one room or the other.<br /><br />They really don't develop the characters. We know they are religious, but we have no ideas what they actually enjoy doing. The children only study, the mother only locks doors and embroiders. There are a few religious discussions. The script writers make a  point of having the children question religion in a way that is beyond their understanding.<br /><br />Not riveting, but interesting from an artistic perspective. If you are waiting for blood to drip through cracks in an old wood floor, you will be slightly disappointed. What is impressive is a movie with a lack of sex, swearing (can't remember any) and slaughter. It proves a movie can be entertaining without being excessive.<br /><br />Honestly, this is a nice movie you can watch on a quiet evening and not feel afraid to walk down the hallway to bed. I'm pretty sure that was not the case if you saw it in the theatre.<br /><br />Intellectual Horror with Old-Fashioned Appeal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></br><a href="../users/A8M4WE1MT4R4O.html">A8M4WE1MT4R4O</a><br/><p>A fantastic film with extrodinary acting by all the actors.  I have gained alot of respect for Nicole Kidman, she is addicting to watch, and her intelligence is apparent when watching her act through scenes.  Above all else, I was especially impressed with the acting of the two children in the film.  Where do they find these kids?  They were remarkable.  &quot;The Others&quot; is a creepy, spine tingling film that gave me chills all over.  I watched it at night by myself and I was freaked out.

It has no dazzling special effects. Instead, it relies on atmosphere [darkness and shadows, fog, sounds, a malevolent old house], a literate script and great acting. Because it is somewhat old-fashioned and because its pace isn't lightening fast, it's at least as appealing to adults as it is to teens. <p>Grace Stewart lives in a vast, isolated mansion on an island off the coast of England with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas. Her husband has yet to come home from the recently ended W.W.II. The children have a disease that makes them allergic to bright light. All the curtains must be drawn in any room they are in. Doors must be kept closed. The servants have recently vanished in the night, leaving the high-strung, fanatically religious Grace alone to care for the kids. It is a lonely and claustrophobic existence. Help arrives in the form of three servants who once worked in the house years before the Stewarts moved in. Before long, Anne claims that she's seeing strange people in the house. Grace refuses to believe her until even odder events occur. And the three servants, who at first seemed so kind and caring, become somehow threatening. What on earth is going on? Or is it of this earth? <p>Nicole Kidman is mesmerizing as Grace Stewart. She is in nearly every scene. Her character is a difficult one that vacillates between loving mother and screaming banshee. At the hands of a less accomplished actress, the role might have produced some unintentional laughter, but Ms. Kidman makes us feel empathy and compassion for sad, unhappy Grace. Also of note are Alakina Mann as Anne and Fionula Flanigan as Bertha Mills, one of the mysterious servants. Like Bette Davis and Meryl Streep, Kidman is an extremely versatile and powerful actress, but Mann and Flanigan manage to hold their own with her admirably.<p>"The Others" was written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, a young Spaniard whose 1997 film, "Abre les ojos" was recently remade by Cameron Crowe as "Vanilla Sky". He also wrote the music. His accomplished, sophisticated score adds a great deal to the film. He's a remarkable talent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I waited a long time to see "The Others" but only because it was playing at all of the worst, most inconvenient theaters in LA. I was waiting for the opportunity to see it on a somewhat respectable screen, to enhance my viewing experience. I fully believe that the screen and theater play a big part in the overall enjoyment of a film. If you see an OK film at a shoebox theater, you will likely report that the film was no good. If you see a bad film at a good theater, you will probably enjoy the film a little more. Over the Labor Day Weekend, I found myself on vacation, with a few hours on my hand, and `The Others' playing at a theater nearby. Unfortunately, the theater was one of the absolute worst that I have ever been in, so it may have colored my judgement a little. Note to theater goers: It is absolutely the most inconsiderate thing in the world to bring a cell phone to a movie theater and take calls during the film. It is inconceivably inconsiderate to take calls on a cell phone that lights up, casting shadows and a laser light show throughout the small, darkened theater. If this happened once, I could understand the mistake, but three or four times? Turn your damn cell phones and pagers off. People can call you back after the movie!<br /><br />Now, about the movie...<br /><br />Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) live in an old mansion on Jersey, an island off the English coast, during World War II. Grace, a puritanical woman, devoutly quoting the bible, teaches her children at home and in fact won't let them go into a room in which the sun is shining. Each child has a rare condition which can kill them if they are exposed to sunlight. Grace closes the curtains of each room as they move through, to protect them. Naturally, both Grace and the children become a little sick of being confined to the house. The perpetual fog outside does little to alleviate anyone's spirits. Grace and the children are also concerned about the whereabouts of the man of the family, Charles (Christopher Eccleston). He went off to fight in the war, but has not been heard from since, and the war has been over for at least a year. One day, three people show up on the doorstep to answer Grace's ad for domestic help. The previous three servants simply disappeared a week before. They are: Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flannagan), Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) and Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes). About the same time, Grace and the children begin hearing noises.<br /><br />"The Others", written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, is a haunted house film like they used to make, more similar to the original "The Haunting" or any other good horror film. The filmmaker relies on acting and storytelling to create an atmosphere of fright and horror, eschewing all CGI and gross-out tricks. How refreshing!<br /><br />Nicole Kidman has now created two films in a row that any actor would like to be remembered for. In my eyes, this is a huge achievement. Previously, I couldn't stand her. Every role made her seem like an ice princess. Only "To Die For" showed any acting ability and even this role did nothing for her personality. Now with "Moulin Rouge" and "The Others", Kidman is showing both range and warmth, shattering previous conceptions of her. Both films show an actress with amazing ability.<br /><br />Fionnula Flanagan, Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes are all very effective as the competent, but at times, mysterious help who arrive mysteriously. Their characters are most effective when they aren't revealing things to the audience. This was a mistake on Amenabar's part, as it reveals too much of their characters. It is always better to keep the audience in the dark for as long as possible.<br /><br />Alakina Mann and James Bentley are especially effective as Grace's children. Never able to run and play, they seem perfect as they try to remain in their mother's good graces. As they talk of `mother's episodes', we don't know if they are simply telling tall tales or revealing something that we should really pay attention to.<br /><br />The cinematography and set design help to create an atmosphere of confusion and dread. The fog surrounding the house serves to confine them further. As Grace fanatically moves from one room to the next, closing curtains, to shield the children from light, she herself creates an atmosphere of dread that we as the audience never seem to be able to escape.<br /><br />A lot has been said of the `big twist' at the end. The less said about this, the better. Most reviews of this film compare the big twist to another very memorable big twist in another very memorable film. If you know what this previous twists is, you can pretty much figure out the twist in "The Others", which is too bad.<br /><br />A lot has also been said about the film being too slow. I didn't find it slow at all. The suspense and tension build as we learn more about the story and the characters. I don't think it is necessary or relevant for every film to have quick or MTV-like editing. It wouldn't be appropriate to this story and I am thankful that they didn't use it here.<br /><br />"The Others" is a chilling, frightening old-fashioned haunted house film. Great entertainment worth your money.</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>Every summer I have serious expectations for a great summer sleeper film that no one knows about but ends up being box office success.  &quot;The Others,&quot; is this summers sleeper!  Like &quot;Ghost,&quot; &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; this movie follows in that tradition of bringing to the screen atmosphere and substance rather than hokey special effects and cheap thrills.  The thrills in this movie are far from cheap.  Each scene in &quot;The Others,&quot; builds with a slow gradual pace much like what Kubrick did with &quot;The Shining.&quot;  Nicole Kidman provides quite possibly the best performance of her career and I would go as far to say loosely &quot;Oscar!&quot;  All the characters are truly superb and effective, the story striking and intense and the scenery is ultimately dark and creepy, especially the scene where Nicole Kidman gets lost in &quot;the fog.&quot;  If you want a true spooky ghost story, this is the one to see, along with the forthcoming &quot;Jeepers Creepers,&quot; which opens in theatres August 31st.  Cheers!</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>Amazing!  This movie was extremely well done!

It's amazing how she go from being a courtesan in 'Moulin Rouge' to a religious mother in 'The Others'.  She is extremely convincing in this role!  The others actors were great, I was also very impressed with the kids who played her two children in the movie, they were great!<p>The costumes and effects were excellent!

It does not try to be a slasher/scary film.  Instead, it is a classic (and classy) "haunted house" movie. THE OTHERS does more scaring with sound and implied camera angles than a slasher flick will ever do.  Its haunted house atmosphere (fog, creaky floors, old rooms) is spooky.  One effective scene involves a glowing, ghostly face that ends up being a painting.<p>The tone is set right away.  Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, shows the new servants around the house.  There are some weird house rules!  Every door must be closed and locked before the next one is opened.  The curtains must be drawn at all times.  Her children are photosensitive, you see, and could erupt in sores and smother to death if exposed to daylight.  Weird.  Kidman plays all her scenes with a wide-eyed neurotic energy - Grace is on the edge!  One wonders how Kidman the actress sustained this type of frenetic energy over the course of the shoot?  She's really good here.<p>THE OTHERS telegraphs its ending by dropping some clues along the way.  I had it figured out. The execution of the revealing scene is very good, though, and still manages to surprise you.<p>I jumped out of my couch several times.  The sound design is particularly good -- there's one scene where the thud-thud-thud of a "ghost" upstairs will shake you out of your chair!<p>Boo!</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>This is one of my all time favourite movies.

With that simple phrase uttered in "The Others", perhaps the greatest horror/thriller in cinema history commences.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Others" sees Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two photo-sensitive (can't be exposed to any natural light) children living in an old mansion in post-WW2 Europe.  While waiting for the father of the house to return from war, the house and family are suddenly intruded-upon by seemingly otherworldly inhabitants, who have the ability to come and go as they please, sight unseen.<br /><br />I wish I could say so much more about this incredible film, but doing so would likely ruin the overall experience.  As such, I'll just say this: The only other films in this genre that even challenge this on are "The Sixth Sense" and "What Lies Beneath".  Not too shabby of company, for sure.<br /><br />Also, please--whatever you do!--do not pass this movie by because it is advertised as a "ghost story".  It is more truly a psychological thriller with a paranormal element.<br /><br />Overall, "The Others" is on my "short list" of greatest films of all-time.  Many films claim to channel master director Alfred Hitchcock, and most fail (often miserably).  This one actually delivers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>A well acted, spooky movie, but once you have seen it there is no need to see it again.  All the action is based upon what is revealed at the end of the movie, so a second viewing leaves one wondering why they are wasting time watching the movie.  Unless you just like the acting.  Rent first, then decide if you want a copy in your library.</p></br><a href="../users/AXSH6O4OP5L4M.html">AXSH6O4OP5L4M</a><br/><p>I think that there's been so much hype over the Kidman-Cruise love-hate relationship over the years, that I haven't really been willing to give the actress her due professionally.  I bought The Others because I enjoy a good ghost story, and this one sounded pretty good from the descriptions I'd read of it.  Surprisingly I not only got the great ghost story I wanted, I got a new definition for Ms Kidman:  superb performer.  Her portrayal of a slightly unbalanced woman with an obsessive concern over the health and well being of her children was a jewel.  The diligent closing of curtains, the compulsive locking of doors behind her created a natural tension that built gradually as an apparently normal mother grew more and more dysfunctional before the viewer's eyes.  The slightly suspect servants who appear at her door in search of employment, after the woman's previous domestics had left without notice, heightens the sense of &quot;something's not quite right&quot; which builds to the denouement.  <p>Although not totally unpredictable, the movie is still a masterpiece of craftsmanship.  While The Sixth Sense, another film I liked, relied more substantially on CGI for its effect upon the viewer, The Others relies completely upon it's set, the progression of events, and the talent of its actors to create that sense of otherworldliness that makes a good story. <p>Since the action occurs almost totally in the various rooms of an old house and to some extent on it's immediate grounds, the movie might make a good stage play, if it isn't one already.  As such it would certainly give ample opportunity for the set designer and the lighting and sound managers to give vent to their creativity.  I'd certainly look forward to such a production.  In all an enjoyable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Writer/director Alejandro Amenabar has burst onto the motion picture scene in a major way with this, his first American film.  The Spanish auteur had already made a mark in Spain with "Abre Los Ojos", a film he wrote, directed and scored, which was remade four years later by Cameron Crowe as "Vanilla Sky", starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman's ex-husband who co-produced both films.<p>This film is outstanding in almost every respect.  With a microscopic budget of $17 million and one bankable star, Amenabar turned a great idea into a brilliant film.  As he has in past films, he also composed the music, which is exceptionally powerful and a perfect fit for the story.  There are few directors with the talent to write, direct and compose this effectively.  It is even more impressive when you consider that he is barely 30 years old.<p>Amenabar's use of shadow and light is phenomenal and he is extremely adroit at utilizing the camera to maximize the suspense.  He is also very insightful in his direction of the actors.  While Nicole Kidman is a veteran, the children are both in their first film and Amenabar elicits terrific performances from each.<p>The story is elegant in its simplicity and the ending is difficult to predict.  The use of the s&eacute;ance scene to flip the film on its ear is inspired, creating a defining moment by taking an indirect approach.  He brings us a supernatural thriller that is scary without the need for blood and gore, making the most of what is unseen.  Often compared with "Sixth Sense" because of the final plot twist, this film is better in most of its technical elements, despite being slightly less flashy in its presentation.<p>As if Amenabar's genius weren't enough, Nicole Kidman kicks out the jams and delivers one of her best performances to date.  She is utterly believable as Grace, the neurotically overprotective matriarch and mistress of the house.  Her interaction with the children is exceedingly genuine, replete with nurturing affection and backbiting irritation at her daughter's perceived recalcitrance.  Grace's daughter Anne is played by Alakina Mann who gives a phenomenal performance in her first film.  Mann is sassy and stubborn and shows a strong backbone in the face of her oppressive mother.  James Bentley, as her brother Nicholas, plays off Mann extremely well.  Bentley's timidity and reliance on his sister creates a strong symbiosis between them that is extremely realistic.<p>This is a fantastic thriller by a director with a very promising future.  While the pacing is sometimes overly deliberate, the story, music, camerawork, and the acting are first rate.  I rated it 9/10.  Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a superb, atmospheric ghost story that will have the viewer thinking right from the get go. There are things afoot here that go bump in the night, but it may not be what the viewer thinks.<br /><br />On the Isle of Jersey, during the last days of World War II, a lovely, isolated mansion sits in the shrouding mists. The house is adequately, though sparsely, furnished. It is  occupied by a mother, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). The children are afflicted with a great sensitivity to light, so much so that they must, at all times, have the curtains drawn and the shutters closed. Grace's husband, the children's father, had left them to fight in the war. This is a perfect and stark setting for what is to come.<br /><br />One day, three strangers arrive on her doorstep. Grace presumes that they are there in response to her post for domestic help and hires Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) on the spot. Grace instructs them on the idiosyncratic ways she has of handling her children's sensitivities to light. It soon becomes clear, however, that this triumvirate has their own agenda and are not strangers to this house.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman give a remarkable performance in this film. Tightly wound and controlling, she appears to be a woman on the brink of a breakdown, holding herself together only by a great effort of will, as she awaits her husband's return. Her performance as a lonely wife and seemingly protective mother contributes greatly to the tense and suspenseful atmosphere in the household. While I am not generally a fan of Ms. Kidman's, finding her ice maiden demeanor to be too cool for my tastes, even I must agree that her performance in this film is superlative and contributes greatly to its overall success.<br /><br />The children both give excellent performances. It is the young boy, James Bentley, however, who deserves special mention. He shines in the role of Nicholas, giving a sensitive performance that conveys his pervasive fear of what seems to be going on in the household. It is a poignant and moving performance that will capture the viewer's heart.<br /><br />Christopher Eccleston is marvelous in the role of Grace's husband and the children's father, who returns all too briefly, like a deus ex machina, conveying an infinite and bittersweet sadness that only adds to the disturbing portents that seem to be gathering about the Stewart household. Eccleston is an outstanding actor who manages to contribute greatly to the film in this small, but pivotal, role.<br /><br />It is, however, Fionnula Flanagan in the role of the mysterious housekeeper, Bertha Mills, who steals the show. She is like the voice crying in the wilderness to those who will not hear her message. Strong and commanding in her performance, it is she, and not Nicole Kidman, who is the backbone of this film. Her presence lends such an eerie and discordant note, that one feels her presence to be that of a harbinger of doom. Yet, things are not all that they seem in this household, as the ending has a surprising twist to it.<br /><br />This wonderful and highly atmospheric ghost story is one that is sure to delight those appreciative of this genre of film. Intelligent and finely crafted, it reveals an eerie story borne of psychological despair and horror. Beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar, it succeeds where others have failed. Relying on well nuanced moments, rather than grotesque special effects, this is a film that is sure to withstand the test of time and emerge as a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Alejandro Amenabar<br /><br />Cast:  Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Alakina Mann, James Bentley, Eric Sykes, Elaine Cassidy, Renee Asherson, Gordon Reid, Keith Allen, Michelle Fairley.<br /><br />Running Time:  104 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and frightening moments.<br /><br />In the critically acclaimed "The Others", Nicole Kidman is Grace, an emphatically religious woman, devoted to her two creepy children, who appear to be afflicted with a severe sensitivity to light, so much so that they can not handle anything more than candlelight (which conveniently allows for lots of dark atmosphere to occupy the film). Every door in her huge, cavernous Victorian mansion off the coast of England must be closed and locked before the next can be opened, in order to prevent any light from leaking into a room where her children may be. Grace's husband is off fighting in World War II, which, strangely has just come to an end when the film opens. Of course, the audience can pretty much deduce that the poor guy has died during battle. Out of nowhere enter three domestic servants, apparently arriving to replace the previous three domestic servants who have abruptly and mysteriously disappeared one week earlier.  Things seem to be going along rather smoothly: servants tending to the house and kids (especially the bratty daughter, played to spine-tingly perfection by Alakina Mann) and Grace frantically opening and closing doors. Then doors open by themselves, curtains, once drawn, are oddly pulled back with no one in the room to do so, Grace and her kids (mostly the daughter) start hearing weird noises that seem to indicate the presence of others in the house. Ghosts? Maybe, but Grace will hear none of that nonsense. She just keeps telling her kids to shut up and stop lying to her about the noises.  Obviously, these noises aren't the imagination of the children and Grave soon learns that some her biggest fears are now a reality.<br /><br />Co-produced by Tom Cruise (Kidman's husband at the time) and filmed in Spain with an international cast, "The Others" marked the English-language debut of Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar, previously responsible for such high profile Spanish entries as "Thesis" and "Open Your Eyes". Amen&aacute;bar's film aspires to Jamesian sophistication, rejecting bombast for subtlety at every turn, as Kidman's troubled heroine struggles to identify the source of her supernatural experiences (are they real, or just a figment of her overheated imagination?). Kidman is too young for the role, and lacks the necessary gravitas, but she plays it with a fair degree of brittle dignity, particularly in her scenes with Mann, the most confrontational of her children, who is either a malicious prankster intent on frightening her younger brother with manufactured ghost stories, or is genuinely in contact with something sinister lurking within the house.  Like "The Sixth Sense" before it, "The Others" prides itself on a series of climactic 'revelations', some of which tip their hand too early, but Amen&aacute;bar's screenplay has more than a few surprises in store, especially on second viewing, when the multilayered dialogue is revealed as a masterful patchwork of irony and misdirection. Stage actress Fionnula Flanagan is appropriately enigmatic as Kidman's stoical housekeeper, and there's strong support from Christopher Eccleston and veteran comedian Eric Sykes (here playing it very straight indeed). Beautiful, atmospheric sets by Benjam&iacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez, photographed with exquisite grace by Javier Aguirresarobe.<br /><br />With "The Others", Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. The actors who play Grace's children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent.  "The Others" is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. "The Others" takes its time to get to its reveal, and for the most part it is worth every minute.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I watched this film because of the trailer which I found quite interesting. The film is about a mother with two children and a husband who's away at the war. At the end of the film, there were a few questions which were unanswered. I did not quite get the end of the film and it seemed more hurried than anything. The screenplay of this movie is good but all in all there's not much in it. It's not the kind of film you'd talk to people about. There were two scenes in the film that made me jump and if I say I was not frightened, I'd be a darn liar.Watch this film if only you are as curious as I am and like Nicole Kidman in a similar way.<br /><br />A five star film I would recommend to anyone who liked The Others would have to be "The Village"</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>This is a great movie from start to finish. This is one of<br /><br />those movies that alot of the actions and words will not<br /><br />make complete sense until you see the ending. The acting<br /><br />in this movie is great. The young kids put most movie stars<br /><br />to shame. Nicole Kidman also gives a good showing as the<br /><br />stubborn wife that can't see anyway but her way. She manages<br /><br />to be onscreen almost the whole movie, but she doesn't hog<br /><br />the spotlight or take away all the focus.<br /><br />The movie is different from most movies of it's genre<br /><br />nowdays because it doesn't try and overwhelm you with<br /><br />special effects and gore... The music and emotions and<br /><br />such to draw you in. It's just so rare for a movie to<br /><br />be this flawless in times were movies try to use<br /><br />computers and such instead of the talents the actors and<br /><br />actresses.<br /><br />It's a movie that if you have a short attention spand you<br /><br />might want to avoid because you will get bored. But if you<br /><br />want a movie that will require you think and watch then<br /><br />this is a nice change of pace it's better than most any<br /><br />movies that came out in 2001.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M3FG82ZE1J8I.html">A3M3FG82ZE1J8I</a><br/><p>Okay, someone PLEASE explain to me HOW Nicole Kidman did not win an Oscar for her superb performance in this film, ...<p>But The Others...now this is a good film.  It's one of those European horror films, which already makes it better than most American films (forget the production values or Tom Cruise as the producer, this is NOT a typical Hollywood film).  It probably helps that the director, most of the cast, and most of the production team are European.  Plus, filming was done in Europe.  The result is one of the best haunted house films in a long time.  In a nutshell, the plot is about a family (Kidman and her, uh, 2 kids; the husband is off at war) near the end of WWII who begin to believe their home (one of those great crumbly mansions with long halls and dark chambers) is haunted.  But is it truly haunted or is Kidman slowly going mad? ....  These are but a few possibilities in this genuinely spooky film.  <p>What's more, the suspense is achieved almost entirely by direction, set design, sound, and acting.  The 2 kids are simply amazing.  The girl in particular is easily the equal of "Sixth Sense" Haley Joel Osment.  Kidman is a revelation, her controlled and mannered performance probably the best I've seen her do.  Special effects play almost no role in this film (to be honest, there are special effects but they are so well-disguised that you would never have known it unless the 2nd disc of this 2-DVD set revealed them.).  It is a bit like the film Castaway, which had a lot of special effects that were darn invisible.  I much prefer this sort of filming, where the special effects augment the storyline, rather than calling attention to themselves.  The strength of this film is that...even without any special effects at all, it would still be a powerful film.  Now that's good filmmaking!<p>...Guaranteed to be scary!</p></br><a href="../users/A27CFNHYZG6WS8.html">A27CFNHYZG6WS8</a><br/><p>'the Others' is the best Hollywood movie of the year, a genuinely spooky ghost story; that rare thing in this age of high concepts, preview audiences, market research and CGI effects, a film that is all about plot, that uses plot to reveal (and conceal) character, that uses the consoling properties of plot (explanation, resolution, reconciliation) to create further ambiguities and mysteries.<p>in its story of a woman who may or may not be seeing ghosts; of seemingly malevolent servants; of innocent children in danger of corruption; the film has been compared to Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw', the scariest book ever written.  it shares with that tale a slow-burning, nerve-fraying suspense narrative; a vividly atmospheric locale (in this case a remote manor on a remote English island further removed from Britain having been occupied by the Germans) and a mood of barely suppressed panic.  Working in a popular medium under a studio system, director Amenebar cannot follow James into completely terrifying irresolution, but there are sequences where the tension goes beyond the confines of narrative into the truly uncanny, such as the scene where Kidman leaves the house at the pitch of the action, walks down a cold and forlorn wooded lane, the first time we have been out of the estate's confines, and is soon lost in fog.<p>Amenebar is a Spaniard and has taken a predominantly Protestant genre - the haunted house story - with its pseudo-rationalist basis in psychological or allegorical crises, and infused it with a very scary Catholic mythology, such as Hell and Limbo, the idea of being dead but unrested forever; the idea of photosensitive children forced to live like moles in endless night.  The film is full of brilliantly low-key nuances rarely spoken about in British cinema or culture - the one German invasion in British soil (with Kidman's possible collusion resonating throughout); the destruction of the family by the patriotic need to go to war; the trauma of a single mother in a culture that demeans them.  <p>There is a strange disjunction between the very Victorian atmosphere, with its lack of modern technology, its outmoded clothes, its formal way of speech, its obsessions with ghosts and cemetaries, its gruesome photo albums of the dead (which, it was hoped, would keep alive the deceased spirit) and the nominal setting, 1945, which, though an age away, seems so much more familiar and modern to us.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Joyce had never been to a scary movie with me before. I warned her that I could get very frightened and that she might not like the experience. (Neither hubby nor my brother-in-law like seeing scary movies with me after my freaking out on them in theaters. So I knew how bad I could be.) The amazing thing is that I figured out the big twist in this film within the first thirty minutes or so. Did this calm me down? Of course not! I was still scared! The plot line involves a woman waiting for her husband to return from World War II in its winding down aspect, circa 1945. She lives in a big house on the Channel Islands with her two children who must avoid daylight since they are allergic to it. Thus, the house is perpetually dark and gloomy, fitting the ghostly aspect of the story. Has this woman's house been invaded by ghosts or others and, if so, who are they? That is the crux of the thriller and it will have you on the edge of your seat. Nicole Kidman is superb in the lead role. When the film is well written, she is showing again and again that she has what it takes as an actress. Regardless of to whom she is married, she should be recognized as a considerable talent in her own right.</p></br><a href="../users/A7P9LPMSBAAME.html">A7P9LPMSBAAME</a><br/><p>This movie is a smart, HAUNTING (no pun intended) film done by a brilliant young director that has gone on to create great cinema.

Without any fore-knowledge, I was properly surprized at how the film evolved and finished.  Along the way there were a number goosebumps as well as a bit of confusion.  The film starts out a bit too complicated and some of the complications could have been jetisonned from the script.  On the other hand, I'm assuming that a number of people will have watched it at least one more time to see how well everything fits together after they've seen it once.  Personally, once was enough but I'm glad I watched it.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Very strong ghost story, with excellent performances and clever twists.

Some very smart and unexpected turns, and a lot of real emotion for this genre.

Grace has been raising her two young children alone in her beautiful, cavernous Victorian mansion, the one place she believes them to be safe. But they are not safe. Not anymore. This movie is a ghost story with some honest scares. A supernatural thriller that is involving, suspenseful and interesting. This is one scary movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>THE OTHERS is another wonderfully dark, modern ghost story like THE SIXTH SENSE, THE RING, etc. Nicole Kidman (Invasion, Dead Calm, Practical Magic) is the center and soul of the movie. She carries the story all the way through to its twisty conclusion. She is not only beautiful, but a fantastic actress as well. The film itself is gloriously sombre and mysterious. THE OTHERS turns the typical supernatural tale inside-out! This "haunted" house is not your run-of-the-mill spooky mansion. Something is going on within its walls that will cool even the most jaded heart. Unlike fx-dependent mush like the re-makes of THE HAUNTING or HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, THE OTHERS relies on excellent story-telling, bleak atmosphere, and fine performances to do the job. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>Brilliant.  Not only well acted and haunting but something entirely original.

It's a scary movie with devastating secrets and a story reminiscent of Henry James's "Turn of the Screw", but this plot has more chills. Nicole Kidman, playing a widow, does a superb job of acting in this movie, and everyone involved is excellent. A creepy old mansion is constantly dark within; the drapes are always drawn because Kidman's young son and daughter are severely sensitive to sunlight.<br /> The photography and atmospherics are wonderfully done. The three servants who just show up at the door and whom Kidman hires foreshadow bad stuff to follow. Kidman is constantly locking and unlocking inside doors in the big house which lacks electricity and phones. The suspenseful isolation becomes a part of the gripping film with its ghosts and Gothic horrors. Kidman plays the cold, forbidding role of the mother who frightens her own children with her fears and her piousness.<br /> Isolate the principals, shut out the sun, bring in the fog, shake in some supernatural elements, and voil&aacute;, a fine movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>There is a difference between being scared and being creeped out. The Others is in no way a horror film. But it will give you constant chills. Its superbly acted and effective atmosphere make it one of the best ghost type films out there. This is more than a 'huge creepy house' type mystery. And there is mystery. There is suspence. But there is a great sadness to this film too and Nicole Kidman perfectly accomplishes this by acting as she has never acted before. Its no wonder she got nominated for this role. Its so subtle but you really have to be able to pull it off. The scenery is just so perfectly morose you really get into it. This movie does not dissapoint.</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>Luckily I saved my VHS tape which has normal, evenly recorded dialogue and music and effects. I can't watch the dvd any longer because of the awful audio. The character's lines are incredibly faint and soft.<br />I wonder if they do it on purpose with some dvd's, making the dialogue so quiet that you need to crank your tv volume up a great deal. Then comes a deafening sound effect (or part of the film score, or a scream, etc) and it shakes the house.<br /><br />That one negative being said, this is one of my favorite old fashioned, haunted house films. It is genuinely frightening. And the scares aren't cheap tricks or gimmicks that we've become used to from Hollywood. This film is a refreshing change from the usual junk that calls itself a horror movie but never really gets under your skin or genuinely creeps you out.<br /><br />The atmosphere, acting, script, cinematography, score, and direction are wonderful. If you like brilliant, creepy ghost movies like The Innocents, The Changeling, and The Haunting (1963), then this is for you. Watch it at night in total darkness. I dare you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a superb, atmospheric ghost story that will have the viewer thinking right from the get go. There are things afoot here that go bump in the night, but it may not be what the viewer thinks.<br /><br />On the Isle of Jersey, during the last days of World War II, a lovely, isolated mansion sits in the shrouding mists. The house is adequately, though sparsely, furnished. It is occupied by a mother, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). The children are afflicted with a great sensitivity to light, so much so that they must, at all times, have the curtains drawn and the shutters closed. Grace's husband, the children's father, had left them to fight in the war. This is a perfect and stark setting for what is to come.<br /><br />One day, three strangers arrive on her doorstep. Grace presumes that they are there in response to her post for domestic help and hires Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) on the spot. Grace instructs them on the idiosyncratic ways she has of handling her children's sensitivities to light. It soon becomes clear, however, that this triumvirate has their own agenda and are not strangers to this house.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman give a remarkable performance in this film. Tightly wound and controlling, she appears to be a woman on the brink of a breakdown, holding herself together only by a great effort of will, as she awaits her husband's return. Her performance as a lonely wife and seemingly protective mother contributes greatly to the tense and suspenseful atmosphere in the household. While I am not generally a fan of Ms. Kidman's, finding her ice maiden demeanor to be too cool for my tastes, even I must agree that her performance in this film is superlative and contributes greatly to its overall success.<br /><br />The children both give excellent performances. It is the young boy, James Bentley, however, who deserves special mention. He shines in the role of Nicholas, giving a sensitive performance that conveys his pervasive fear of what seems to be going on in the household. It is a poignant and moving performance that will capture the viewer's heart.<br /><br />Christopher Eccleston is marvelous in the role of Grace's husband and the children's father, who returns all too briefly, like a deus ex machina, conveying an infinite and bittersweet sadness that only adds to the disturbing portents that seem to be gathering about the Stewart household. Eccleston is an outstanding actor who manages to contribute greatly to the film in this small, but pivotal, role.<br /><br />It is, however, Fionnula Flanagan in the role of the mysterious housekeeper, Bertha Mills, who steals the show. She is like the voice crying in the wilderness to those who will not hear her message. Strong and commanding in her performance, it is she, and not Nicole Kidman, who is the backbone of this film. Her presence lends such an eerie and discordant note, that one feels her presence to be that of a harbinger of doom. Yet, things are not all that they seem in this household, as the ending has a surprising twist to it.<br /><br />This wonderful and highly atmospheric ghost story is one that is sure to delight those appreciative of this genre of film. Intelligent and finely crafted, it reveals an eerie story borne of psychological despair and horror. Beautifully directed by Alejandro Amenabar, it succeeds where others have failed. Relying on well nuanced moments, rather than grotesque special effects, this is a film that is sure to withstand the test of time and emerge as a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>A new variation of the classic history of ghosts - an enchanted, solitary and scary house-, returns to the big screen thanks to the excellent hands of director Alejandro Amenabar.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman is Grace, mother of Anne and Nicholas, living in an isolated big house on a European island. The year is 1945 and Grace's husband is fighting against the Nazis in the final days of World War II.<br /><br />The film begins when Grace receives three new servants - a governess, a gardener and a servant who will help at the mansion. Her previous servants went all away; we do not know why.<br /><br />Grace gives few instructions to the help, but the most important thing to do is to keep closed all the doors whenever they change rooms. Apparently, Grace's children suffer a condition that does not allow them to receive sunrays.<br /><br />Thus, the children live without going out, surrounded by shades and candlesticks. Her mother educates them, and many of their lessons are focused on religious values. The children, particularly Anna, feel the presence of other ghostly beings and their actions - doors and windows that are opened without touching them, pianos making music alone.<br /><br />Grace is skeptical in the beginning and does not believe the stories, but it just a matter of time before she's convinced of the reality.<br /><br />Gothic and terrifying, The Others is a thriller that creates a suggestive and dark atmosphere. Supported by the flawless characterizations of the actors and a wonderful script, this film does not rely on the special effects and fast-paced edition that usually defines contemporary terror movies. With genuine moments of terror, Amenabar has constructed a supernatural piece that causes great mental anguish.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman gives a fantastic performance like the rigid and frustrating mother, constantly trying to stay in control of her emotions and to give a logical explanation to all the incomprehensible facts happening before her eyes. Deep down, we see the emotional collapse of a woman forced to accept the destruction of all her beliefs and values.<br /><br />The children are equally memorable in their roles. Next to Kidman, they make us fear everything that hides behind each closed door, the shades rambling in the mansion and the secrets hiding in their corridors.<br /><br />And it's finally when a chilling and unexpected ending is revealed, that The Others smashes us with its impressive weight, disturbing and making us revisit every moment, satisfied for have witnessed such a sublime work.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>I fell in love with Kidman after seing this movie, not only is she beautiful, but her acting is SUPERB! Seriously - I thought The Ring was perhaps creepier, but the story and the acting and, not to mention, the plot is not to be compared to The Others. It is inspired by The Sixth Sence, no doubt there, but these movies are just as good, and expect for their surprise-endings there are few other similarities - Nicole Kidman must be one of the best actresses in the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Don't be fooled at the start where it says that it's 'set' in Jersey. It looks more to be set in the Yorkshire moors, but in reality it was set in Spain! Of course.<p>I'm not sure what I was expecting of this movie. When it started, it reminded me very much of Sixth Sense, and very much of M. Night Shyamalan's camera work, rather than Alejandro Amenabar. (Try saying THAT when you've had a few) As it went on, the whole fog outside the house, and not being able to escape the house/gardens reminded me of Beetlejuice - and again, the Yorkshire moors.<p>Unfortunately (no thanks to a Scottish newspaper) I found out the twist at the end, so I was expecting it, although it wasn't quite what I expected! So at least that was something.<p>I actually wondered after this movie was finished - and after finishing the discussion about what I didn't understand - how much of it was based on real life. As it was set towards the end of World War II, there were many wives wondering if they would see their husbands again - presuming they hadn't already received a telegram saying they were missing. How many wives would subsequently go mad, upon being trapped alone with children, without family around, and the fear of not being able to remarry? (Amazon, I am NOT giving anything away, so do not even start with me!) How many children had to put up with an overbearing, overprotective mother, while wishing they could see their father, and not understanding why he had to go and maybe not come back? Or wishing they could go out in the sunshine?<p>I must say, Nicole Kidman came off very well as a 40s wife - right down to the hairstyle, clothes, and manner. (Although I did find the hairstyle was a little too harsh) She was terrific as Grace, and had great chemistry with the children - although the girl was a little witch at times!<p>What didn't I get about this movie? The servants - how they couldn't come through the door, even after it was explained what they really were, but I suppose that's just too cartoonish maybe? - and the father coming back from the war. What was the point in Christopher Eccleston appearing in the movie for no apparent reason? But you could dig deeper into his whole appearing/disappearing act - and I could, but Amazon would get their red pen out. And I know he's come back from the war and everything, and he's seen some horrific things which he didn't want to talk about, but he could have at least given his wife a kiss! (In this day and age, I probably would have pounced on him, but this is in the 40s) But what I want to know is: did he remove the curtains?! Or did the servants? I found the mute servant's reason for being mute very strange. Surely if it happened to her, it could have happened to the rest of them, after they &quot;found out&quot;.<p>The finale is terrific, and in the scenes leading up to it, I was really, really scared, and looking for someone to hold on to! (A friendly cushion kept me comforted kind of) After the film has finished, you look back on the film in a different light. Although I'll have to re-watch it many times before I get all the clues. <p>As a final note: don't be surprised if the sound isn't that great. I had this turned right up, and I still could only just hear what Nicole was saying. I thought this was a problem with my hearing. But I've read in other reviews, that people have had problems with the sound. So at least it's not me!</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>The Others is a remarkable film. There is no crazed axe murderer. The are no car chases. There are no naked ladies and no lame jokes. In short, it's one of the few movies for grown folks that hit the theaters last year. <p>Nicole Kidman gives a performance as Grace, the mother, that will stop people from saying, "Oh yeah, Tom Cruise's ex wife," once and for all. Kidman shows that she's an A-list actress and not just a gorgeous face. <p>The character, Grace is a complicated woman. It's obvious from the first moment we see her that she's just barely hanging on. Her children have a life threatening condition and can not be exposed to sun light. Her daughter is angry with her. Her estate is lonely and no one ever comes to visit. Her husband is at war. Her nerves are shot and it's just a matter of time before she cracks. And then weird things start happening...Is someone trying to scare Grace or is she imagining all this?<br />The ending, which I won't give away completely shocked me. It's the last thing you'd expect and explains everything that's gone on in the film perfectly.<br />If you like your horror to be in the Shirley Jackson mode  or if you're just a Kidman fan this movie is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>After hearing all the hype surrounding The Others I finally decided to give it a look and found it better than what I had expected.  Nicole Kidman plays a religious mother living in her large home on the island of Jersey in 1945 with her two children, both of which suffer from a disorder where they blister and turn very sick from being exposed to too much sunlight.  When Kidman hires some new servants strange things start going on, and an otherworldly presence is felt.  Kidman is great in her role as an overbearing mother who really does love her children, but takes it to a new level.  Director/writer  Alejandro Amenabar (who wrote and directed Open Your Eyes which would be re-made as Vanilla Sky) effectively uses atmosphere over flashy special effects to achieve a chilling tale of mystery and suspense with a twist ending that seemingly comes from nowhere.  All in all, anyone looking for a good thriller should definitely check out The Others.</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>Alejandro Amenabar has done a wonderful job with the direction of The Others.  On top of this is a cast of actors who work seamlessly together.  Nicole Kidman brings to life her role.  What I loved most about The Others was the little use of special effects.  The unknown is much more fearful than a 50 million dollar FX budget.  Place this movie among the classics like Halloween.  This type of film will make you jump and cringe at what might be around the corner without losing your interest in the middle.  I loved The Others and think that any horror movie freak will also have a fond enjoyment of it.<br />Apart from the film the DVD transfer is excellent.  Most of the movie takes place in a dark house.  Colors are dark and deep.  I recommend to turn out the lights taking away the reflection which might occur.  In Digital 5.1 I heard an array of sounds perfectly placed to enhance the experience.  I felt as if I was in the house.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>I was quite impressed with this film. There were some frightening moments here and there, but the thing that impressed me about the film was the story. It was well done, well written, and moved swiftly through the plot. The arrival of a certain relative in the middle of the film threw me off just slightly, but I understood well after the twist at the end, which, while not as impressive of a surprise as the Sixth Sense, was quite good. <p>Great Film!</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>Yes, I know it's the movies, and yes, it's only acting, and yes, I like her as an actress tremendously.  Yet after seeing movie after movie with Nicole Kidman playing a cold as ice man manipulator, my movie psyche needs some payback.  I got it with this movie.  <p>So even though she introduces what may be her bitchiest character yet, it was nice to see she doesn't have nearly the power over people she would like you to think.  She plays a mother of two children, probably a widow, in post-war England.  She lives in a huge mansion, and has children who cannot be exposed to sunlight.  It is this condition that forces her to be tough and disciplined, especially to the new trio of servants she has just hired.  <p>But it is not only toughness out of necessity.  If you see how she OVER-punishes her children, and assumes it is the servants who left some doors open (it couldn't be HER!) that she also has some inner meanness to her.  If you've seen her other movies, you KNOW it, but if this is your first Nicole Kidman movie, you have to watch to see the true nature of the character come out.  <p>So when her fragile world starts crumbling around her, I for one was glad to see her unwind by finding that maybe she doesn't have all the power over her house she thinks she has.  We see all the beginning classic symptoms of the haunted house, with unexplained noises and physical things being mysteriously altered.  Of course, all around her deny everything, and after several instances of this, she has to make a decision to accept this, become stronger, or breakdown.  <p>I will reveal to you that all three things happen, but not necessarily in that order.  She does valiantly make a stand to hold her title of Ice Queen. But eventually the supernatural gauntlet she is dragged through causes her to eventually break down.  This was a big moment of the movie for me.  <p>However, I wouldn't be giving the movie four stars if it didn't have other things going for it.  There is a big secret plot twist that I imangine people will say was taken from another recent movie, but I will say it did get me hook, line, and sinker.  And just like that other movie, it honestly gives all the clues necessary to reach this conclusion upon a second viewing.  <p>Which is another reason why I like this.  I did not like "Vanilla Sky" (by the way, not the movie this one "borrows" from), and even upon a second viewing of "Sky", when I knew the secret, I still though the movie did not play fair with the audience.  "The Others" does play fair, and was enjoyable upon the second viewing, where it becomes interesting all over again once you know the secret.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Well, I would disagree with some of the reviews that this was an altogether "predictable" movie. I think this movie was a very worthy effort and quite better than most scary movies they make these days. I like movies that are actually scary, and that's what this movie is (unlike the useless "Scream" or "I know what you did" type genre horror flicks). Yeah, there are similarities to "The Sixth Sense" within the movie, and these perhaps don't make this movie as refreshing as it could have been. Still, that being said, I would rent this video again and watch it because I feel as though it was entertaining and the horror aspect of it was believable and worked. The dreary movie effects and the cast of this movie were successful in creating an uneasy feeling for the viewer, which is what horror movies are all about.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>With references to Hammer horror films and The Innocents (one of the best suspense thrillers of its type and a great ghost story as well based on Henry James' Turn of the Screw), The Others is the type of film America has forgotten how to make. It's intelligent, well acted with interesting twists and turns in its plot. I suspose The Others has as much to do with gothic thrillers as it does with more horror films.<p>Anyone expecting a jump out of your seat, blunt witless horror film should look elsewhere. Yes, the director does linger a bit too long on his mystery and it does take a bit too long to reach its climax but, on the whole, the film is a rewarding bit of entertainment. The performances are top notch and, again, the acting references the melodramatic style of Peter Cushing or  period dramas from the 40's and 50's. Kidman in fact is a perfect female counterpart to Cushing. Cushing's edgy, almost over the top performances were a highlight of even the weakest Hammer film. Here Kidman's acting choices seem inspired by both Cushing and the stable of Hammer actors from the 50's (including the underrated Michael Gough and Christopher Lee).<p>It's not The Matrix nor does it pretend to be. This fine film is a throw back to an older film tradition where a director actually expected intelligence from his audience. Approach The Others with an open mind. It's rather ironic, because I read a review posted at amazon that claimed Alien was a lame horror film. Remember, that horror is showing the audience but suspense is withholding until the very last minute. The later takes more skill. Hitchcock was a master of suspense (much like Ridley Scott is at his best). It's always scarrier not knowing what you're up against than having it all laid out for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>I can 't believe this came out of hollywood a clean horror imagine that . It's scary also this a gem of film a throw back to the horror films of yester year the way horror should be.<br /><br />Warning: to who it may concern this film is very dark& scary would'nt recommend taking young kids to it . The reason for it being PG-13 is it's very tense . why i'm giving it 4 stars is I was bugged by anti-reglion tone part in the film besides that i'd go again to get scared out of my head.

This is the first movie, I've EVER watched, that actually had me gripping my seat in suspense, not knowing what was going to happen next. There were times the pace was a bit slow, but it was only to give more shape to the plot, and I found all of those scenes interesting. Nicole Kidman gave a stunning performance as a religious, over protective mother of two young children who are resistant to any kind of light other than candle light. The 2 children in this movie are wonderful, and truly did very well. The remaining cast were also great. A movie with a completely great cast? Yep! The Others is a movie you can't give too much plot detail of, for it would ruin the entire thing. Therefore, this is going to be a pretty short review. But I must say, the ending is one to make you gasp or have to rethink the whole movie over. I wish I could talk more and more about The Others, but I would end up giving the whole thing away. It's a wonderful, thrilling movie with true scares that didn't require blood or a knife. I'm very much anticipating the DVD release.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A ghost story that does not look like one. A quite acceptable situation, though rather bizarre, without being strange. Every detail is slightly surprising, or original but believable. The whole object of the film is to reverse the situation of the beginning to reveal the truth and those who seem normal and pretend they are haunted by some ghosts end up being the real ghosts. It all hinges around the paranoia of the mother. She is obsessed by something that makes her tense or angry in no time and for little. Till one day she breaks down completely when those they call the intruders take down all the curtains that are draping all the windows of the house. The end then is banal: the living intruders abandon the house in the hands of the dead ghosts. The interest of the film is this inverted situation, this upside down ghost story. Then we are irritated or bothered by the way they don't speak but only whisper, the way they are obsessed by keys and locked doors, by any sound that is not explainable from their sole point of view. Everything is done in nuances, discretely, hardly fully expressed. We have to navigate among these strange milestones or obstacles to finally understand the truth but only when it is revealed to us. A very effective film but a film that does not require a second viewing because it only works if we do not know the truth. We have to be fooled to enjoy the film.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Nicole Kidman is excellent (as are the other cast) in this well done movie !<br /><br />Released in the wake of the "Sixth Sense"-type movies, it does not quite have the super twist surprise that 6th Sense does, but is it a great film and example of movie-making and acting at it's best.<br /><br />Now a part of our permanent DVD collection !</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>The Others is a good movie that unfortunately can not hold out its 104 minute running time because of the confines of the twist - that we have seen before. Comparisons will be made to certain other horror twist vehicles that did the circuit around the same time as this movie.<p>The problem with these twist films is that the entire weight of the picture is balancing on that twist. This means that the film can not really extend past those boundaries of what that has to offer. In one scene Nichole Kidman leaves her home only to be enveloped in a fog and she must return back to where she came from. That pretty much sums up what is on display here.<p>Nichole Kidman plays a somewhat wealthy land owner whose husband has not returned from the war, her kids can not go near sunlight, her servants have left her and she is trying to keep everything together. When most of the film has played itself out to establish everything in the first twenty minutes it does not really go anywhere else until the climax. The film mostly repeats itself - Kidman acts desperately to keep control, the new servants act strange, the house is haunted. The material is recycled over and over again but this is what we usually expect from films that hang onto that twist as the final affirmation that will effectively blow out our candle.<p>Overall the twist does work but is nothing that you have not seen before if you have seen other types of these themes. The acting from Kidman is quite good but everyone else is a little under par including Christopher Eccleston's performance. It all looks very stage-like and has more television appeal than DVD or the cinema screen. In fact it works better as something you switch onto after seeing the news. This would be a more apt market niche for it than mainstream cinema and it plays better as a Television movie. It is more along that "quality" of film making than what the A-list leading lady suggests.<p>This is a good horror yarn and a nice Ghost story, but not spectacular cinema, powerhouse performing or the brilliant film as some may tout. It is just good but nothing new or original. It does boost a few scares but these can be handled by most teenagers or anyone above the 12 age group category.... maybe even some people below that age. It really depends on your kids but I know plenty that watched it and enjoyed it and still went to sleep that night. There is no blood or violence in this horror movie which is good. Like I said it is more akin to an episode of the Twilight Zone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Often touted as a horror movie &#65533;The Others&#65533; is actually a gently creeping period piece.  Set in 1945 on the island of Jersey, Grace (Kidman) and her two children live by themselves in a lonely house surrounded by fog and bad weather.  After all the servants suddenly leave in the night Grace hires three new ones, informing them that the windows and doors must always be closed to protect the two children, both of whom are allergic to daylight.  Things begin to unravel as one of the children claims to see a little boy and his family and mysterious things start happening around the house.<p>What makes this movie particularly special is the fact that it sets its audience on edge rather than outright scares them.  A claustrophobic atmosphere is built up as the characters are all literally kept behind closed doors and the dingy photography depicts the monotonous life that the family lead.  However, it is Kidman that really holds it together.  Giving a blistering performance of a woman on the edge of insanity, desperate to retain her decorum whilst the absence of her husband gnaws at her.  Definitely very different to her role as a courtesan in &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533;, this shows what breadth the actress has, which anyone who has watched &#65533;To Die For&#65533; will know.  Thankfully the rest of the cast are very good indeed, especially the two children.<p>The feeling of mystery and locked-away feelings is evoked well as we&#65533;re given pieces of the puzzle gradually throughout the film.  Furthermore, &#65533;The Others&#65533; has created a whole new genre in its reliance of flesh-crawling creepiness rather than gratuitous gore.  It certainly makes a refreshing change and is all the better for having an actress of Kidman&#65533;s calibre on board.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>The Others is a movie that I still remember even though I saw it only once, back when it was released in 2001. The movie is a horror movie, and a good one. While it wasn't as scary as the Shining, and to me because not a lot of unrealistic horror movies, but it still had some freaky moments. I jumped at some and the ending had a great twist. Compared to most modern horror movies, I have to give this 4 stars. The plot is about a woman whose husband has vanished (he's off at war) who moves into a large mansion with her two children who are very unique. They cannot go into the light EVER. (they're like allergic to it in a way) And there's also a mysterious maid and ah yeah, some ghosts. This ghost story had me guessing till the highy unpredictable ending and I was jumping at some parts and freaked out at others. A very good horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Alejandro Amenabar's &quot;The Others&quot; is a reminder that very good films need not be glitzy or gimmicky.  Neither is an excess of special effects or action sequences required.  Film is an exercise in storytelling and good films succeed in telling their story well no matter how small and quaint the film may appear to be.<p>Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Nicholas (James Bentley) and Anne (Alakina Mann), live in a manor off the British coast.  Three strangers arrive one day in answer to a placed advertisement for domestic help.  For some strange reason, the three strangers prove to be familiar with Grace's house.  Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and the gardener Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) soon immerse themselves in the daily routine of the manor, but the mood of the house suddenly seems changed with them around.  Is there something to the strangers or is Grace's imagination just getting the better of her?  <p>&quot;The Others&quot; revels in its simplicity.  This is a film reminiscent of an earlier era in terms of filmmaking craft but it does not at all feel like a time-displaced relic when viewed through the filter of modern sensibilities.  A legitimately unsettling atmosphere is created under the deft direction of Amenabar and Kidman is granted a wonderful opportunity to put her acting talents on display.  She takes full advantage of her chance to carry a film on her own and succeeds admirably.  Kidman is the emotional and dramatic catalyst of the story and the film as a whole would have been far less effective had she faltered.  Flanagan, Cassidy, and Sykes are also great as the sweet but creepy strangers.  From the outset, we know that there is something amiss by their arrival on the scene but we cannot put our finger on it.  A tip of the hat to Amenabar for keeping us in suspense until the very end.  Good work all around.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>This has all the mood and style of &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot;  There, I said it.  I've joined the club.  There is even a surprise plot-twist at the end.  The darkly mesmerizing ambience is carefully captured with elegant photography, and all the actors here are notable.  I love seeing a film with great child acting.  The universal child-like fear of the unknown is the central theme throughout, and the two child actors here convey authentic fear.  But the standout performance here is from Nicole Kidman.  This is one of my favorites in her catalog.  There are many films in which she is stoic or comes across as an Ice Queen, fairly reluctant to show her emotional range.  But here she had me interested in her character on an emotional level; and how her character is dealing with the unusual, supernatural circumstances.  Like &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; this film will look completely different during the second viewing.  This is a well-acted film with tight direction and a good script.  I was enthralled all the way to the creepy conclusion.  Turn the lights out and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>It's her eyes.  It's rare for an actress to make such expressive and impressive use of their eyes.  Nicole Kidman does this in "The Others."  It reminded me of the underrated Lara Parker (Angelique on the old "Dark Shadows" soap).  Ms. Parker also was able to say a million words with those eyes.  Just as Nicole does in this eerily effective thriller.  Alejandro Amenabar's direction is right on target, with the slow, yet tense, pacing; the impeccable cinametography; the great score which Amenabar also wrote; and of course, casting Nicole Kidman in the title role.  We meet Grace as she is awakening from some kind of nightmare, screaming.  The house she lives in is spookier than one would imagine for a "modern day" movie.  However, being set in the 1940's, it becomes as integral character as the humans.  Along with Ms. Kidman, Fionnaula Flannagan is superb as the mysterious housekeeper Mrs. Mills.  Also effective is Alikena Mann in the role of Ann, the precocious daughter.  James Bentley as Nicholas is also perfect.  Amenabar manages to meld old-time spook scares with a religiously influenced plot.  Although the ending is telegraphed early on, it's resolution is quite a turn of events.<br />Kidman certainly has proven she can emerge from the shadow of ex-hubby Cruise, and stand on her own as a versatile and talented actress.  She will win an Oscar someday; particularly if she handles roles as magnificently as Grace.<br />RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>one is up there with Rosemary's Baby, one of my favorite movies.

No blood or gore, just a good story and good acting.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>This movie is an example of the type critic Pauline Kael describes as a &quot;Boo Movie.&quot;  The handle refers to the fact that, intermittently, monsters jump out, yell &quot;Boo,&quot; and then return back to the woodwork from whence they came.<p>The first problem is that the movie is set in 1945 a house on the island of Jersey, one of the Channel Islands that belongs nominally to England, is set just off the shores of France, and is functionally independent.  This choice of setting appears to be an attempt to emulate classic movies like &#65533;Rebecca.&#65533;  The problem is that &#65533;Rebecca&#65533; was set in what was then a contemporary atmosphere.  Placing the action on an island few people will ever see, at a time more than half a century removed, enables the casual viewer to keep events at arm&#65533;s length, unaffected.<p>Nicole Kidman, the graceful and stunningly attractive redhead who was the basic reason anybody went to see &#65533;Moulin Rouge,&#65533; stars as Grace, a wife and mother who&#65533;s lived in isolation in her sprawling mansion ever since her husband went to France to fight in the war.  Though the war in Europe is over, her husband still hasn&#65533;t come home, but she steadfastly refuses to give up hope.  Her two children, however, are convinced they&#65533;re going to live the rest of their lives in this sepulchral, unlit building.<p>Are we supposed to believe that Kidman, who has a waist like my ankle, is the mother of two children as old as the kids in the movie?  Kidman and her ex-husband Tom Cruise are the adoptive parents of two young children, but most women who have given birth twice, and have children as old as these, have figures that reflect that fact.  I for one wouldn&#65533;t mind seeing a woman with such a figure cast in the lead of a movie, as I find that figure attractive.  But Kidman, who is extremely thin and graceful, simply doesn&#65533;t look like a mother of two.<p>Grace&#65533;s children suffer from a rare (and very real) disorder that causes them to suffer severe burns, asphyxiation, and other gruesome symptoms on exposure to bright light.  Left to itself, the disorder will eventually result in the children&#65533;s death.  This plot twist is interesting and offers a few material contributions to the storyline, but essentially, its purpose is as a macguffin to keep most of the house as dark as possible for as much of the movie as possible.<p>The movie tries to move through a series of suspenseful interludes, complete with a few red herrings designed to throw viewers who aren&#65533;t paying exacting attention off the true path.  The effect isn&#65533;t what the director had in mind, and where there is anything scary, it tends to be more startling than deep-seatedly frightening.  Slamming doors, unexpected music, moving furniture, and more seem to be contrived to make viewers jump out of their seats, but fail to establish a necessary environment of underlying dread.<p>The hired help, three people of mysterious background who simply show up one day and get hired that quickly, serve to create interplay and tension.  By showing us scraps of their conversations and giving us hints at unseen actions, we are led to think that they are trying to manipulate Grace and her children, in the style of Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper from &#65533;Rebecca.&#65533;  However, we see such short snippets of the characters that we get no real feel for them, nor do we understand why they&#65533;re doing anything they do.  This undercuts the desired tension, leaving us with a trio of characters who say one thing, do another, and serve still another purpose in the plot.  Indeed, some of the shots featuring these characters seem designed to willfully deceive us as to who they are.  Red herrings are fine and most critics appreciate them, but we are simply lied to as to what these characters are about, setting us up for a payoff that never comes.<p>The movie prides itself of its surprise ending.  This is fine, except that it&#65533;s not a surprise.  Because it&#65533;s deeply reminiscent of another recent movie (I won&#65533;t say which in case some reader of this review is actually going to be startled), careful viewers see it coming well in advance, and it actually serves as something of a letdown.  What tension is built up through the course of the movie is never effectively released, and viewers who are accustomed to horror in the style of Daphne du Maurier, whom the movie&#65533;s creators seem to be consciously imitating, will be disappointed.<p>In total, the movie is adequate, creating a few startled squeals and a few jumps from the seat.  However, it fails to create the desired dread seasoned suspense fans have grown to appreciate, and the setup fails to equal the payoff.  The creators of this movie seem to be testing the water for a more mature, sophisticated attempt at horror later; here&#65533;s hoping that, next time, they pay less attention to dress-up atmospherics and more to the actual events that cause us to feel fear.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>this film was fairly easy to predict how things would go after the first half hour.it wasn't long before I felt this film was a 6th sense clone.Nicole Kidman is easily one of the Most-Overrated folks in the Acting Business Ever.She brings no Emotion to me in Her Work.She is a ALright Actress but not worth all the Hype She gets.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>What a great surprise "the Others" was! In the wake of a glut of "Sixth Sense" clones, I see the dead, I talk to the dead, I help the dead, the haunted house/ghost movie sub-genre was getting as stale as the overworked Zombie sub-genre. Dozens upon dozens of films, both big budget & straight to video haunting every rental DVD shelve in six continents! I was tired of seeing people in movies seeing the dead, ad nauseam.<br /><br />So why was "the Others" so different? First of all, it was not a "Sixth Sense" clone, if anything, a anti "Sixth Sense." It was not a modern day haunted house/ghost film at all, but harkened back to "The Innocents" from 1961. It also reminded me of another great early 60's film, that was not a horror film at all, but had it's spooky moments, 1962's, "To Kill a Mockingbird." Both these films had a brother & sister as main characters. Both these films had a single parent main character, or in the case "of "the Innocents," a nanny/governess, who was hired by a single parent. Both those films had strong bonds between the siblings. "The Others," mother character, & "the Innocents," governess character, were both overwrought to the point of insanity. All three films share a very intimate almost child like opening soundtrack. "The Others" & "To Kill a Mockingbird," especially. All three films were intimate, not a large cast, nor did they need one, though "To Kill a Mockingbird" did have a larger cast of characters, though it still remained a intimate childhood story of a adult world.<br /><br />It has been said that Nicole Kidman's performance as "Grace Stewart" in "the Others," is the greatest of her career, & I have to agree. Nicole is the epitome of a woman pushed over the edge of insanity. A nervous break down performance if there ever was one! It must have drained her, not only mentally, but physically. The siblings, Alakina Mann as "Anne Stewart," & James Bently as "Nicholas Stewart," provide this film with some of the strongest & most believable child performances I've ever seen! The supporting cast was excellent as well.<br /><br />"The Others" work so well because a taught & sturdy script, claustrophobic cinematography, spot on directing, & a soundtrack that is subtle, & when need be, crashing down like thunder. But it is the totally convincing acting, the effective spooky yet elegant mansion, & the tense well done sound effects that make this movie genuinely scary. It is the imagination of what could be lurking around the corner or behind a door that raises the prickly hairs on my neck. The thump in the dark. It is the twist ending that just blows me away every time I see this film! It is truly, the anti "Sixth Sense," just when the badly over trodden haunted house/ghost sub-genre needed it the most!<br /><br />This Blu-ray is highly recommended as a upgrade. Colors, images, lighting, & sound are about as good as it gets for a film like this!<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>While most of the movie-goers will focus on the inevitable irony of Nicole Kidman starring in a movie produced by her erstwhile husband Tom Cruise, THE OTHERS directed by Alejandro Amenabar of Open Your Eyes fame scores beautifully with its elegantly controlled suspense and horror. Just when you thought Ms. Kidman's career has taken a backseat after the divorce, she slams critics with an intensifying performance as Grace, the mother of two children, Annie and Nick (James Bentley) subjected to a mysterious disease that forbids them to come under strong light. With the misty landscape of a British coast and a cavernous mansion, where Grace practises locking one door before entering the next to prevent sunlight from filtering in - the mystery sets in - even more so after a housekeeper Mrs. Mills with her motley gang steps in. <p>THE OTHERS may lack the intrigue in the Sixth sense as a paramormal scarefest but it boasts an unexpected twist that justifies the slow pacing. The performance of Ms. Kidman as a forlorn wife waiting for the return of her husband (Christopher Eccleston) is sterlingly vulnerable and emotive. THE OTHERS after a slew of right-in-your-face horror gore offered by this summer's Jeepers Creepers and 13th ghost is almost acutely refreshing. With its seasoned acting and Amenabar's prudent directing, it more than compensates for the gloomy mood enshrouding the movie that tests the patience of the audience. However, when the ending is revealed, the melancholic tragedy of Grace comes out hauntingly poignant and judiciously rewards the audience for the wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>Have you ever been offered the stale advice that one's view of the world depends on where that one is standing? Well, quite right, and THE OTHERS is an effective illustration of that truth.<p>Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, is the mistress of a gloomy old pile of a mansion on the British island of Jersey very soon after the end of World War II. Her husband, of His Majesty's Army, was, or maybe wasn't, killed during the conflict. Grace's children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), ostensibly have a fatal hypersensitivity to sunlight, which means that heavy drapes must always be drawn over the windows of the rooms they're occupying. To make matters worse, the electricity isn't working - the effects of the war and German occupation, you know - so lots of candle wax gets burned.<p>The movie opens as three former servants of the house, employed there before Grace's ownership, gain re-employment. They're led by the kind and imperturbable Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). The three are witness to the family's increasing awareness of mysterious household "intruders", which open curtains, play the piano, and rumble about in upstairs rooms. Ghosts, perhaps? They remain unseen to Grace and Nicholas, the epitome of a frightened young boy, but are regularly observed by the sassy older sibling, Anne. And there's more than just a little mother-daughter friction, not helped by the fact that Anne is not shy about telling the help that Mom recently went crazy.<p>The trepidation that builds in this very atmospheric film is not due to any overt horrors. There are no skeletons or mutilated bodies falling out of closets. No ghastly spirits go "boo" from around dim corners, and no razor-sharp knives flash from behind curtains to carve up unsuspecting flesh in the middle of the night. Rather, the suspense builds slowly in the flickering candlelight, in a house surrounded by an interminable mist, and in the mind of an increasingly agitated Grace. Both she and the audience know something is amiss, but what could it be? And what's with those old pictures of posed dead people lying about?<p>Kidman is superb as the edgy Grace, and Mann, a new face to this moviegoer, is great fun as the feisty Anne. Despite that, THE OTHERS is one of those movies about which I felt ambiguous up until the end, at which time I suddenly became a big fan and said "Wow!" I would pay to see it a second time just to revel again in the delight of watching the perspective suddenly flip. This is clever scriptwriting.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>This movie was awesome.  I love it - even after having seen it quite a few times.  You won't be able to understand this until after you've seen it,  but, once you've seen it entirely, the movie isn't really scary (this will make sense once you've watched it).  The whole movie had an erie sense about it being that it was set in the countryside in post war time in a big castle type property with many many doorways in it.  Nicole Kidman has two children in the movie who can't be exposed to the light and this leads to doors being locked and curtains always drawn.  The caretakers in and of themselves are a bit freaky, but the main focus are the noises that are heard throughout the house coming from 'The Others'.  You really have to see this.  I can't say too much more without giving anything away, but it will scare you silly and everyone does an excellent job acting in this.  I love it and could see it quite a few times. It's great and gripping and will have you on the edge of your seat for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>I was so bored watching this movie,but it was worth it after seeing the last half hour.Thats all I'm saying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>How obvious can this twist be?  We had it figured out within the first 45 minutes, and then had endure the seemingly endless histrionics of the crazed Nicole Kidman, as she rushes from room to room to room in the big spooky house with all of the weird noises and voices etc etc etc...<p>After a point, all of the supposed buildup just gets tiresome.  The acting only serves to exhaust one's patience even further.  Kidman veers between brittleness and hysteria and simply wears the viewer out as a result.  As for the children, I was ready to tie rocks to them and drop down the well.  How irritating can they get?  That little boy has got to be one of the single most irritating actors to afflict the movie screen in decades.<p>If you want a truly creepy movie, watch &quot;The Innocents.&quot;  You won't know what the hell is going on, even when you are done, and as many questions remain at the end as at the beginning.  With &quot;The Others,&quot; the only question is why you would bother watching it in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>THE OTHERS is a classic film.  It is superbly written, directed and most importantly acted.  Nicole Kidman radiates in one of her finest performances and carries this film on her shoulders from beginning to end.  And this film has no gimmicks or over the top special effects.  It is a true ghost story and a very intelligent one at that.  If you are reading this you are probably already a fan of the film.  But how is it on blu ray.  Blu ray when used correctly can highly raise the bar of presentation on a film.  One would assume THE OTHERS might present a challenge for it is a dark film shot mostly in shadows and fog.  But the video presentation on the blu ray here does an amazing job.  The present graininess is original to the film and the atmospeheric fog and shadows take on new life while characters appear clearly throughout. Characters and scenery show through strong and clear with very strong clarity and crispness and skin tones are very realistic.  Colors are otherwise subdued for they are meant to be but the whole picture manages to shine levels above the dvd.  With this superb video we get an even better audio presentation.  The DTS HD Master 5.1 audio is superb.  This is mostly a dialogue driven film but there is beautiful soundtrack music and this is indeed a ghost story.  And what we get is very strong and present dialogue with surround sounds that come to dynamic life with the scares and chills and thrills.  This is indeed a haunting film and the audio presentation puts blu ray to great use.  Your whole speaker system will come to life and have you jumping out of your skin at all the right places.<br /><br />This classic film gets the treatment it deserves on blu ray.  THE OTHERS is a film so intricate and detailed that multiple viewings will strongly be desired and the blu ray presentation will make each viewing that much better.  Every excellent thing about this film is made that much better on blu ray.  I highly recommend this film.  And if you already own the dvd give yourself a treat and get the blu ray.  This is an example of blu ray put to its best use.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>The Others is an absolutely incredible movie.  Only too rarely does a movie come along that can absolutely stun you all at once with its implications.  The ending of this movie absolutely caught me unawares, and in one single instant, before the movie even told me what was happening, a blow of shocking revelation hit me right in the stomach.  Few movies deliver a personal epiphany to the viewer, but The Others does just that.  I cannot point to any part of the film that was not perfectly done.  Nicole Kidman gives her best performance ever, carrying the audience along with her character's pain and confusion.  The children plays their roles remarkably well, with all the subtlety and believability required to make this movie succeed as a psychological masterpiece.  The three servants were magnificent, although I did not appreciate the true greatness of their performance until the end.  The house itself is very much a character in the movie, and the darkness, gloominess, and vulnerability it projects into every scene is palpable.  There are surely great challenges to directing a movie with such an atmosphere and darkness and isolation, but not only did a twenty-eight year old Alejandro Amenabar direct a masterpiece, he also wrote the screenplay and composed the musical score.  The music, without a doubt, greatly magnifies the effects of the increasingly tense, otherworldly atmosphere.<p>This movie was quite different from what I expected from the trailers I had seen.  It definitely has the power to frighten and unnerve its audience, but this is so much more than just some kind of psychological horror.  Anyone passing the movie by as just another haunted house story is robbing  himself/herself of a great experience.  The DVD package contains a number of extra features on a second disc, and the supporting material does add depth and meaning to the movie's themes.  Along with a look at the making of the movie, there is a feature on the rare disease the children in the film suffer from, an affliction so rare that there is very little awareness of it among the public.  The only thing missing is an audio commentary of the movie by the director and/or actors.  <p>This is really one of the best motion pictures I have ever seen and truly deserving of the critical acclaim it has garnered.  The ending really hits you like a ton of bricks.  Calling The Others a movie is doing it a disservice; it is a profound, unparalleled  motion picture experience that you should not allow yourself to be deprived of.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>What exactly are "The Others"? That is the question haunting the audience through most of this elegant, sophisticated, and scary gothic thriller. The film, from Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amenabar, takes the "old dark house" movie and reinvigorates it through intelligence and imagination. With its star, Nicole Kidman--at her enigmatic, beautiful best--the movie holds you in its clutches from the opening moment, when Kidman's troubled character awakens in bed with a terrifying scream, and doesn't let go until the final twist at the end.<p>The story takes place in the absolute seclusion of a stately, cavernous mansion on the fog-enshrouded Isle of Jersey, the southernmost of Britain's Channel Islands, in the days following the end of World War II. (the entire film was shot in Spain.) Grace (Kidman) lives here with her two young children. All are sadly aware that her husband and their father is not likely to return from the front. Three servants arrive to replace those who have inexplicably disappeared. Everyone tries to settle into a semblance of normalcy, but something is definitely not right. The children suffer from extreme photosensitivity whereby sunlight might kill them. So Grace darkens every room with heavy curtains, using only candles or fireplaces for light. Then, her daughter claims that she has seen and talked to "intruders." A deeply religious woman, Grace refuses to believe her "ghost" stories. Yet locked doors are discovered open, and a piano bursts into music without a player in sight. A strong sense of foreboding lodges in every shadow and mysterious noise. What caused the original servants to vanish so abruptly? What happened to Mom when she went "crazy" a few months ago? And why do the new servants, who claim to have worked at the house years before, exchange oblique references to impending "changes?"<p>Kidman, coifed and groomed so as to remind you somewhat of Grace Kelly, rules this nightmare with a steely determination to ward off any evil that might threaten her children. But her nerves are quietly going to pieces. Equally as formidable is Fionnula Flanagan's nanny, a strong, no-nonsense presence who also wishes to shelter the children from these intruders.<p>The youngsters are marvelous. Alakina Mann possesses a combination of curiosity and stubborn pride that makes her a constant thorn in her mother's side. James Bentley has large, bewildered eyes that swim in a pasty-white face, a perfect mirror of the audience's increasing anxiety at the super-natural incidents.<p>Elaine Cassidy's (her perormance being one of the few aspects of FELICIA's JOURNEY I actually enjoyed) mute servant girl and Eric Sykes' stolid gardener give the staff a commonplace touch at odds with their often strange demeanor.<p>Directing his own meticulously crafted screenplay, Amenabar manages to craft an intelligent and suspenseful psychological thriller, a rarity these days...</p></br></body></html>

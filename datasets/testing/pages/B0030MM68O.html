A "feel-good" movie made on a $15 million budget with no-name actors, it came out of nowhere and blindsided many viewers and Academy voters. Pleasantly surprised, I flipped on the Oscars this year (2010) and watched the who's who for films in 2009.<br /><br />I'm not going to take any large swings as THE HURT LOCKER because it was a good movie. I enjoyed the action, the tension, the acting. It was all nicely pulled together. But, out of the ten Best Picture nominees this year, was it really the stand-out? I felt that the Academy was slipping, once again, into the realm of trying to be "significant" and "modern" by voting for something that's on everyone's mind (the war in Iraq). Again, the movie was okay. Good. Adequate. But head-and-shoulders above such films as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2L0">Inglourious Basterds</a>? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a>? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00337KMAA">Up in the Air</a>? I humbly disagree that it was. And there was nothing in it that we haven't seen before: a war movie with internal angst and a man lost amidst society when he returns home. Jeremy Renner (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDWEM">28 Weeks Later</a>) did a fine job as the risk-taking Sergeant James but, again, he was channeling every other warrior brought into a tough situation that we've seen on celluloid a gazillion times.<br /><br />From reading what you've read of my review so far, you might think that I'm being more critical of the Academy than the film. That's partially correct. But when so much attention is heaped upon one film (including Best Director ...which we'll cover in a moment) and so many people think that this is "the film to watch" and not the other nominees that won little or nothing, I believe of informing those who might choose to read this of their folly should they not see something like District 9 or -- one that didn't even get mentioned -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2ME">Moon</a>.<br /><br />Let's hit on the Best Director item...<br /><br />No female director has ever won an Oscar before Kathryn Bigelow did for The Hurt Locker. So what! We never elected a black President before Obama. Does that mean we should give him every break just because no other black man has ever sat in the White House? No! You win because you deserve to win, not because it's never happened to someone of your kind before. Was the directing of The Hurt Locker better than Inglorious Basterds? Was it? Sorry, but I completely disagree if you think it was.<br /><br />I will say that I'm glad AVATAR didn't win Best Picture or Best Director. But to completely blank out such phenomenal films as DISTRICT 9 and other worthy competitors is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />I think it's important for me to say here that I completely support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; they risk their lives daily so that I can live the life I do over here in the U.S. They risk they're lives so that I can write something like this about a film they may care deeply about. But caring deeply about a subject like The Hurt Locker and elevating it above other films does a disservice to the art of film-making and film-makers when you over-rate a movie based on it's significance in the world today and not on its art.<br /><br />For me, the top films of 2009 were DISTRICT 9, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and MOON. Two got a smidgin of notice and one never saw the light of the Oscar ballots. Check those films out before deciding where the awards should've landed for movies made in 2009.

Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are the defining characteristic of the Iraq War, and that was during their peak, when EOD units saw a lot of action. Director Kathryn Bigelow asked Boal to write a fictional script based on his observations. "The Hurt Locker" follows a three-man EOD unit called Bravo Company for the last five weeks of its rotation in Iraq. The team's leader is the new guy, a brazen but highly skilled adrenaline junkie, SSG Will James (Jeremy Renner). He clashes with the professional, even-tempered Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), while the younger Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) has a hard time coping with the death around him.<br /><br />"The Hurt Locker" was shot in a documentary style, always using four cameras with different views on the action, so the 44-day shoot in Jordan produced a million feet of film. Don't worry. It's all edited down quite nicely. The downside is that there is camera shake, a style that seems to have taken over contemporary cinema. The advantage is that Barry Ackroyd's cinematography and Kathryn Bigelow's direction bring out the drama inherent in the high-stress, do-or-die situations without seeming to try. Their approach to the material is almost prosaic. This is a day in the life of the bomb squad. And then another day, etc. It is always suspenseful, because diffusing bombs is inherently suspenseful. It is always dramatic, because these men must cope with extreme circumstances, and they do so differently, which can make them uneasy with one another.<br /><br />Bigelow cast the lead roles with actors who would not be immediately recognizable. We don't have any particular expectations of them, which augments the film's sense of immediacy. We don't' know ahead of time how anyone is going to react to the constantly shifting emotional landscape. But we get a few surprises when more recognizable actors show up in smaller roles. It's a nice touch. And the cast is terrific. Though there is plenty of action (and realistic explosions, not the kind that make pretty orange plumes), "The Hurt Locker" is very much a character drama. Three people react to war as they see it and to each other. It's not a political film. It doesn't comment on the wisdom, or not, of the Iraq War. It doesn't tell the audience who to see as hero, villain, or victim. But "The Hurt Locker" does give the impression that this is the reality of 21st century warfare.<br /><br />The DVD (Summit 2010): Bonus features are a making-of documentary, image gallery with audio, and a feature commentary. "The Hurt Locker: Behind the Scenes" (12 min) interviews Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, cast, and some creative crew about the films genesis, characters, the director's style, and the cinematography. The "Image Gallery" is a slideshow of behind-the-scenes photos with audio from a Q&A with Bigelow and Boal at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. So it gives us something to look at while we listen to the Q&A. The audio commentary, again with director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal, is informative and constant. They discuss the locations, cast, filming in Jordan, the explosions, and Boal contributes some observations from his time in Iraq. Subtitles available for the film in English SDH and Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Not since 'Platoon' has another war picture put the viewer inside a soldiers head and in the heart of the action. 'The Hurt Locker' is more about the man inside the uniform than just another patriotic war piece. Jeremy Renner who I have only seen in a few films does a fantastic job as an adrenaline junkie bomb disarmer who's taste for deadly excitement has more than one of his squad a little nervous. This could have been a ridiculous "Hollywood" film, but instead becomes a psychological study of what it takes to do this kind of thing on a daily basis.<br /><br />This is one of the best war films I've seen in a long time and is well worth your time. 'The Hurt Locker' delivers in spades!</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Kathryn Bigelow has fashioned an amazingly gripping and tense film as she takes us inside a bomb disposal team working the mean streets of Baghdad.  It is a wonder how fine film making can still cause a skeptical viewer to suspend disbelief and catch a tangible emotional and physical sense of the unbearable tension and palm-sweating fear of being centerstage amid barely supressed hostility from a local population made up of the friendly, the indifferent and the murderous.  In short, she has created a chair-gripping intensity and her close-in camera work puts us right in the middle of the tension.<br /><br />Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, who imbedded with an actual Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, waste no time getting us into the midst of the tension and action that is an everyday commonplace for these exceptional individuals.  Two surviving members of a team that has lost its leader get a hairy and wary introduction to the style and methods of their new team leader, Sgt. James (Jeremy Renner).  A gifted bomb disposer with a seemingly fearless daring, his teammates Sgt. Sanborn and Spc.Eldridge are more concerned that he is a "cowboy" that may increase the danger to themselves, which is already considerable.  They are operating in pure survival mode, while their new boss seems to be in a different, potentially dangerous, mental and emotional zone.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner's Sgt. James is not an easy read either.  Is his daring approach really recklessness or does he have a more realistic assessment of the danger and the odds?  Is he simply an adrenaline junky that gets off on the fear and pressure, or is he an accomplished professional that has found his calling and his talent and simply realizes that death is always present, and that error is fatal no matter what precautions are taken?  As has been noted by nearly every reviewer, Renner's portrait of this man is subtle and nuanced and brilliantly achieved.  He is nicely complimented by the work of Anthony Mackie (Sanborn) and Brian Geraghty (Eldridge).<br /><br />Likewise, these three young leads are ably supported by Bigelow and Boal, who have created an unsentimental script that wastes no time in preaching or in sidetrips or extraneous scenes that do nothing to illuminate these men and the situation they find themselves in.  With a, thank God, absence of pontificating, moral pronouncements, and political bias, they let the sweaty terror of where these men have to work and what they have to do speak volumes about the ambiguity of this war and any other.  This is nasty business, and the tangible hostility of death arriving from any balcony, around any corner, or in any trap is always readily present and felt.<br /><br />This is brilliant film making, up close and personal in its execution and allowing a terrific showcase for the young talented actors involved.  Yes, there are cameos by David Morse, Guy Pearce, Ralph Feinnes and Evangeline Lily, but they are just that, cameos.  The bulk of this film rests on the shoulders of Renner, Mackie and Geraghty and they are superb.  I've been a longtime fan of Kathryn Bigelow from her Near Dark debut, through her hits and misses, although even the latter have often demonstrated her energy and chops as an action director.  Here she has married that talent to a fine script written by someone who knows what he's writing about, and the result is a fine film with a subtle subtext and arguably one of the best pictures to emerge from the Iraq war.  It should be seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>One of the year's best films, this follows a team of GIs in Iraq whose job is to defuse and/or detonate potential bombs. Incredibly taut and scary, particularly when you think about the fact that there are hundreds of soldiers still doing this same job right now.<br /><br />As a side note - I was on a whale watch this week and started talking with the volunteer naturalist, Jason. He had just come back from two tours in Iraq, doing this exact job. He said that of 198 men in his outfit, 196 had been wounded. (Including himself - 90% deaf in one ear from an IED blast.) He also said that the outfit was now being re-deployed to Afghanistan. I asked him if he has seen 'The Hurt Locker' yet, and he hadn't; but a lot of his comrades had, and they all raved about it. That alone should be enough of an endorsement - see this movie!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE HURT LOCKER is not an easy film to watch, especially for veterans.  It may be about the Iraq War circa 2004, but it is essentially about WAR in general and the devastation created by this most foolish of human games not only on the countrymen of the site of the killing but also on the soldiers from all countries who bond to fight the 'enemy': as Pogo said in a long ago war 'We have met the enemy and he is us'.  Kathryn Bigelow has accomplished the unthinkable - she has created a small, tense, breathless re-enactment of a group of men (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) whose sense of mission and sense of family and disillusion are as fragile as the homemade human and other bombs they render safe. In a minimal but terse script by Mark Boal the words are less important than the expressions on the actors faces, and with a cast as fine as this, those statements are more powerful  than words.<br /><br />The scene is Baghdad in 2004 and we watch as an EOD specialist Thompson (Guy Pierce), a man for whom the group - namely Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) - has profound respect and love, is blown up in the first minutes of the film.  Thompson is replaced by an obsessed EOD specialist with a record of over 800 bombs rendered safe, one William James (Jeremy Renner) who keeps his mementos of wasted bombs in his 'hurt locker' under his bed.  The film deals with the gradual adjustment of the men to this new, obsessed EOD man as the group faces horrendous encounters with the Iraqis, both adults and children.  There are surprise cameos by David Morse and by Ralph Fiennes, but they don't last long as characters.  What lasts is the interdependency among the men locked into a mission more terrifying than can be imagined.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner delivers a finely nuanced performance of a man whose adrenaline rush with his job makes him a unique sort of being, yet a man who is capable of the most tender of responses.  Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are also superb in roles that in other actors' hands may have become trite.  This is an important film for all of us to see - especially now, as war escalates over the globe.  Kathryn Bigelow deserves the Oscar for bringing this stunning event to the screen.

(-:<br /><br />Now I think that Jeremy Renner deserved his nomination and I hope to see him<br />in some other, better written and put together films with actors who<br />are more of his caliber to play against.  That should be good.</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>It's an okay movie. the action scenes were very suspenseful and the main character's story arc is okay. he goes on his mission of indignation when he finds out his little kid friend is killed only to see that he was still alive and that he really is what his team mates say; an adrenaline seeking fool. this would have worked better for me if the ending wasn't him going back to serve for 365 more days! what exactly did this guy learn about himself?!! also all the sub plots were weak, the african american character who wants to be a father, (why?! where are these emotions coming from? yes you risk death everyday but why fatherhhood? WHY?), the white guy whose afraid of dying seemed forced. these themes are thrown at us instead of unraveled like a good screenplay should be! i can't believe this won best screenplay! the military doctor getting killed was too predictable! it's an okay movie with great suspenseful action but as a war movie about the soldiers it sort of fails. i have a feeling this movie winning was purely political. shouldn't have even been nominated.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>...I'm trying to unpack why, to look at what it means to be a hero in the context of 21st-century combat." Kathryn Bigelow, director/producer<br /><br />The Hurt Locker (2008) is one of the best movies from last year and for me, it is the most deserving nominee  for  Best Picture of the year of five that I have seen so far. The director, Kathryn Bigelow who is known for making the dazzling, dynamic, intelligent and intense action movies, feels at home in the very manly world of directing war film. The Hurt Locker that has been universally praised by the critics and the audiences since it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2008 may make a history if Bigelow wins the Best Directing Oscar coming March 7th but even if it won't happen, The Hurt Locker has already found its place in history as the remarkable and to the date the best film of the war in Iraq.  It does not explore why we are there and who is responsible for the war. It just places us "inside", along with three main characters, the members of a bomb squad as they go about their daily business, doing their most dangerous and unforgiving job in the world, trying to survive the last 39 days of their rotation. The effect of the total immersion was achieved by Bigelow and Barry Ackroyd, the cinematographer (United 93) by using multiple S16mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the war in Iraq where he would go with the members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks very closely. Based on his experiences, his screen play is the fictional retelling of the  real events.  He said of the film's goal that the creators wanted to show the experiences of the soldiers that we'd never see on the daily news. I believe that director and screenwriter, as well as everyone involved in the making of The Hurt Locker have achieved their goals. The result is an unforgettable film<br /><br />It is remarkable that the film's more famous actors (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse) only show up for a short cameo leaving Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty to carry movie on their own.  All three do an amazing job. Jeremy Renner, relatively un-known becomes a real center of the film and turns a star making performance.  With the face far from a typical cinema hero, he becomes a true hero of the film, the guy who by the words of his younger comrade is not good with people but a great warrior, confident, cool, good at his deadly job, always having it done. It is about him, the epigraph to the film says, war is drug for he is addicted to the rush that only combat can give him.<br /><br />I found the film absolutely riveting, gripping, and intense. It is amazingly shot, the  pace is perfect, and the action scenes executed masterfully. It also works as the characters study of the men at war and how the war affects them.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>While set in Iraq, this is not a political film, it examines the psychology of men in  danger, and how some<br />men become addicted to it.<br /><br />Mostly critically lionized, but attacked by many, especially soldiers for being inaccurate.<br /><br />I didn't take the film that literally, or think of it as documentary realism, but more a stylized almost poetic<br />look at the insanity of wars and what can happen to those caught up in them, much like `Full Metal Jacket'.<br />This felt real on a meta level, not a literal one.<br /><br />There were a few logic lapses that bugged me, and the impact emotionally is (by choice I felt) muted.  It's<br />more a disturbing picture than a moving one.<br /><br />But it made me think and made my heart race, and images and moments have stayed with me for a long time</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The Hurt Locker is what I consider a step in a different direction compared to most war flicks.  First of all it's nice to see a movie set in a desert environment instead of the jungle lands of Vietnam (a war that's been well documented by this point).  That in itself is a nice refreshing change, and I believe we will continue to see more desert-themed war films in the future thanks to both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars of the last several years.<br /><br />No doubt in my mind the reason a (supposed) realistic storyline pertaining to the war in Iraq was created in the first place resulting in the Hurt Locker being released is because of all the Americans and British who sit here day in and day out wondering exactly what's going on over there.  I find out through reading some reviews here on amazon that the film isn't really that realistic though which is unfortunate.<br /><br />What's most appealing about the Hurt Locker is the way it continuously keeps the audience guessing exactly when the explosions and gun bursts from the sneaky Iraqi enemies will occur.  They almost never happen during the times you THINK they will, and that alone is quite surprising.  The one exception is the man who had bombs wrapped around his chest and waist.  Yeah, you just knew he didn't have a lot of time left.<br /><br />As far as the acting goes, well truth be told I've seen better.  It mainly sticks to a few select soldiers who are not necessarily buddies, but they gradually win over each others respect by frequently putting themselves in harms way and setting a mood filled with tension and fear.  They always look out for each other and live dangerously, that's for sure.  Respect is certainly earned as a result.<br /><br />Overall, yeah, perhaps it could have been shortered by about 30-45 minutes, but I honestly wasn't bored at all.  A great film.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>As a fan of war-esque cinema, I have seen the greats: Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, First Blood, etc.  Recently, however, after watching such films as Jarhead and Brothers, I have begun to notice a phenomena in modern-day war films (primarily about the Middle East, accordingly) in which, while the action may be tremendous, the plot is very sparse and understated.  I was hoping for something different in "Hurt Locker", but was once again disappointed.<br /><br />For a quick plot summary, the events of "Hurt Locker" take place in Iraq and center on an elite bomb-defusing squad.  Time and time again the unit (led by an enigmatic Sergeant played by Jeremy Renner) shows up on the scene of pressure-packed situations and must work fast in order to minimize casualties and general destruction.  The effects of that constant tension are also touched on in scenes during the rare "down time" of the unit.<br /><br />Disregarding the overall message of the film for a moment, the movie created great tension and wartime experiences that I had not yet seen on screen.  You will literally feel your pulse rising and may have to remind yourself to breathe as "Renner's" unit goes about their pressure-cooker situations.  This is an aspect of war so crucial to the Middle East conflict that it was about time it got its "due" on the big screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the entire message of the film didn't come anywhere near to living up to that battlefield suspense.  Instead of presenting any riveting emotional dilemmas or character studies, director Kathryn Bigelow paints Renner (easily who was supposed to be the emotional background of the film) as such a stark portrait that it was difficult for me to feel anything towards him, whether good or bad.  Now, this isn't to say that the film is stark for any sort of lack of effort, as I truly believe that Bigelow believed she was creating high drama with Renner's character.  However, in trying to create what she believed to be an accurate portrayal of an Iraq War soldier, she didn't manufacture enough drama to really allow me to identify with the lead character.<br /><br />Thus, your ranking of this film will likely be determined by your feelings about the amount of "contrived" drama that needs to be concocted in war films.  If you like to stick with the very basics, "The Hurt Locker" will be right up your alley.  If however, like me, you need a little external character drama to jump-start your emotions, than you may feel a bit wanting when the end credits roll.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>first off to the low reviews they all seem to say its not realilistic and that bombs are not disarmed like that---- well if a terrorist watches this then they have no idea!!! like the army wants to show their top secrets to disarm bombs over seas HELLO are u stupid,,, now this movie was excelent worth all my money just go out and buy it on blu ray, loved the sniper scene it was great!!!!  5*****</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>OK, first let me say that I am not going to judge how accurate this film may or may not be as I've never been to Iraq or been around a real E.O.D. team. This is a movie, people, not a documentary. So going off that I will say that I really enjoyed this, it is very entertaining. I liked its gritty, sweaty, realistic style. Top notch cinematography, especially in the way the slow-mo's show dirt leaping off the ground or top of a car as the I.E.D.'s detonate and also when shell casings bounce off the ground. Good directing, good acting, just an all around good movie in my opinion. I saw it on DVD but I'm sure it looks even better on BD. 5 stars, Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>3.5 stars<br /><br />The Hurt Locker might be a masterpiece for some, and seem realistic (if not to those who actually did this job in Iraq: see the low-starred reviews here). But it felt way too slow for me, and disconcertingly unwilling to address anything beyond the minutiae of each defusing event. I never really got much chance to care for any of the characters, though there was some nice ironic humor. Mostly I wanted to be involved beyond the obvious will-it-blow-up tension, yet rarely was.<br /><br />I sure couldn't wait to see it, and rented the blu-ray the day it came out. It looks good, and Bigelow has a nice eye. But somehow it all felt oddly prosaic. No doubt this is a brutal job, and it's an interesting topic for a film, yet I never felt like I had a chance to get to know anyone here enough to care much about them. Perhaps that's the point?<br /><br />I was interested by the comments on the one and two star reviews here, and on other boards. Apparently a lot of EOD experts find this film annoyingly innaccurate, while many film fans point to that as unimportant; "film can take any liberty needed to tell its story". Agreed, but this sort of film seems married to technical accuracy, indeed prides itself on it, and it felt strange to see so many lives risked, American and Iraqi, by hotshot tactics based on the need for a thrill. Is this what it's really like? Army guys risk each other's lives all the time just to cop a rush? The little speech about that was one of the few times this film really gripped me, much more than the many isn't-this-a-tense-moment scenes, which wore on far too long. They felt overdone and trite, in fact.<br /><br />One thing that others liked, THL's apparently opjective tone, felt off to me. Yes, this is how these guys do this job (or is it? The EOD reviewers giving this low stars say it ain't, and they might know best). But this job only occurs when we decide to send our troops to other countries, and some of the people there don't want us around. Examining the details of defusing bombs while ignoring the reasons for those bombs being made seems somehow dishonest in a way. You can't separate those details any more than you can separate a cow's role in a hamburger, and completely ignoring why we're in Iraq felt forced and fake in spite of all the attempts to make this seem real.<br /><br />Maybe that's why this movie is so beloved; it absolves the viewer from thinking about the subtle issues in Iraq, and focuses on the life or death moments, stripped of the entire context for their coming into being. It's much easier for us to see Iraq as a job for our soldiers than ask ourselves: if we really love these soldiers, why are we putting them in the line of death every day, and what have we gained from their sacrifices? Instead we get a film that makes all that seem extraneous.<br /><br />You're telling me these disposal guys never discuss the reasons for their being there? I don't buy that. I felt more for the innocent Iraqi strapped with a bomb than I did for the guys trying to defuse it. They volunteered for this, and are getting paid for their service; no one made them enlist---the draft is long gone. Whereas the Iraqi is just dying for no reason at all. So who's the hero? One of the basic points of a good war film is that it's not whose side you're on that makes you a good guy; it's whether you are a good person, apart from your country's motives. This was touched on to some degree here, but ignoring all the War On Terror context didn't make sense to me, and made this film feel contrived in many ways.<br /><br />The low-starred reviews here tend to be from military personnel, and their thoughts are very interesting to read.<br /><br />Perhaps I need to watch Hurt Locker again. But on first viewing it just didn't grip me the way it did most everyone else. I wish it had! Apocalypse Now and a number of other war films are among my favorite movies, and I was hoping this one would be too. But there's not one character here that I really cared about, one way or the other, compared to my feelings about those films. I appreciated Bigelow's craft, but it didn't move me as it did others. Doesn't mean it ain't a great movie, just that it ain't my idea of a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>You can't fault this film's tense, unpredictable atmosphere and the simple, but powerful plot. Nor is there anything wrong with the acting, direction, cinematography or length. But there was one aspect that stuck out like a sore thumb, for me anyway, and that was the portrayal of the main character, played by Jeremy Renner. While he is a fantastic actor and did a great job in this film, I felt his character was one huge clich&eacute;. I mean, how typical was his persona? Have we not seen this type of hot-shot character before? The macho, I'm-so-brave-and-unconcerned-and-I'm-going-to-ignore-all-the-rules-and commands.... His whole act felt very typical and unrealistic. Clearly, he loved doing what he did, and he knew he was good at it, but again, I couldn't help but feel like I've seen his character a million times before.<br /><br />I'm usually not a fan of war films, but The Hurt Locker felt different, I think because it concentrated on a certain aspect of the Iraq war, or at least a certain division of it, which it made is slightly more interesting than other war films I've seen. There is not much fighting or battles, just those few tense scenes that have you on the edge of your seat, but it seems enough. For me this movie was more about the character than the Iraq war, and again, that's where my major gripe comes into play. All in all though, I would recommend this film just for its intensity and unpredictability.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Let's see...first you take a few character actors and put them in lead roles. Then you take <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q8GKLM">Lord Voldemort</a> and put him in a character actor's role. Put the last director that you'd ever think of in charge. And what do you get? In my opinion? You get The Hurt Locker. You get the movie that deserves the Best Picture nod in 2010.<br /><br />Was Director Kathryn Bigalow in Iraq? I have no idea. But she made me believe that I was looking into Iraq at the daily routines of a squad charged with the task of investigating and disarming IEDs (improvised explosive devices).<br /><br />I've heard that the movie has been criticized by war veterans and others actually in Iraq for inaccurately portraying wartime conditions, but this all seemed very real to me. Sure, it seemed like the cast was under fire and constantly dealing with some IED threat, and maybe that's what the critics are referring to. But it's a movie. Liberties were taken to consolidate a term in Iraq into 2 hours.<br /><br />I have to say that I was captivated and on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Action. Camaraderie. Emotion. Excellent story. Great script. Great acting. All from an improbable director whose last memorable movie--albeit another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MOWP0">classic</a>--was almost 20 years ago.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is certainly one of the best movies that I've seen in the past year.

He is a replacement for Staff Sergeant Thompson (Guy Pearce), who died from an IED in Baghdad. The other two member sof the team are James' guards who act as lookouts to prevent a follow-up ambush during bomb disposal, Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This is the story of an elite specialist, not a grunt who took on military service because he was looking to prove himself.  The Hurt Locker asks: what kind of person becomes an expert at the most dangerous job in the world?<br /><br />Sanborn and Eldridge count the days before their time is up - when they return home to their families, or when a sniper's bullet finally kills them.  Eldridge is nervous, jumpy, and on a slippery slope.  Sanborn is the consummate professional who goes by the book, but in a war torn land where few rules apply, James' flagrant disregard for safety rattles him.  Both men are convinced that James will be the death of them.<br /><br />And they're right.  James is good at what he does because he defines his universe from within.  James decides to befriend a young boy he nicknames Beckham (Christopher Sayegh) because he reminds James of his son. When James discovers a child victim of terror, James decides - with no evidence whatsoever - that it's Beckham.  It doesn't matter if the child is actually alive or dead.  James' boundaries are constructed in his own mind, because the forces he work with are entirely unpredictable.  Calmly detached from his own reality, James decides the bombs won't go off because they haven't yet, that he will live because he's survived so far. In a fickle, cruel world, James' self-centeredness borders on sociopathy, but it's exactly the kind of mindset he needs to be so good at facing down death every day.<br /><br />The problem is that supreme selfishness is not a trait that the military values.  What makes James an excellent bomb disposal expert makes him a terrible soldier in the field, and he nearly gets his team members killed in a misguided mission of revenge.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker culminates in a standoff over a Iraqi civilian with a bomb strapped to his chest. The experience convinces Sanborn to return home and settle down, but it never penetrates the inward-looking sphere that is James' ego.<br /><br />What makes the Hurt Locker so good is how it tells a story inward-out instead of outward-in. This is James' story first and foremost; everyone else, from his teammates to civilians to his own family, are just characters in his orbit.  And yet all those characters feel real. The Hurt Locker may be James' story, but it tells the plight of soldiers everywhere through sand, tears, sweat, and blood.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>This is an independent film, and as such it has a unique flavor to it that you're not bound to find in anything coming out of mainstream Hollywood.  To me, that's a good thing!  The story is about one of the most unconventional of soldiers:  the EOD expert (better known in the civilian world as the "bomb squad guy").<br /><br />The movie has more of a feel of a documentary than it does a movie that has a linear plot.  The main character is an amazingly competent diffuser of bombs, but is also a person who lacks common sense and social skills.  He is so adept at deactivating bombs, and yet he is clueless about relations with his girlfriend, and something as banal as shopping for cereal @ the grocery store makes him very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Some may be surprised that this doesn't come off as an anti-war movie like, say,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AUJQ">Platoon (Special Edition)</a>.  The veracity of the this film has been criticized by people who are far more qualified to challenge its realism than I am.  That said, I would STILL say that the movie brings the viewer closer to what it feels like to be a soldier in a combat zone than most films.<br /><br />As in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8QG22">Good Morning, Vietnam (Special Edition)</a>, the main character befriends a young boy who is a native of the foreign country.  Some have said this is unrealistic.  I would disagree.  No matter whether the soldiers are EOD specialists, Rangers, Delta Force or whatever, there's a good chance they have strong parental insticts.  As a matter of fact, I would argue that it's many times strong parental instincts are one of the things that drive them to become soldiers in the FIRST place.  They want to leave a better, safer world behind for their family / children.  So, I would contend that the criticisms of this aspect of the movie are unwarranted.<br /><br />If you enjoy this movie & would like to experience more Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), then I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470444304">Rage Company: A Marine's Baptism By Fire</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DN5WUW">Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories DVD</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>There many movies that have depicted the world of war. The past has given us a very glorified, Hollywood picture. Movies from 'All Quiet on the Western Front' to 'Inglorious Basterds' have show us good vs. evil, fancy dialogue etc. War is always taken out of context in cinema, but there are very few that give us something real.<br /><br />'The Hurt Locker', now known as the best picture of 2009 is one of those movies that is not bent on giving us a glorious picture, rather they strip war down to its true, gritty roots and in this movie we see the mental anguish that soldiers go through in modern day war. This movie takes us into the lives of a battalion that has been sent into Iraq to patrol the streets in search of terrorists and suicide bombers. In the middle of their rotation they are given a new squad leader that is a bit off color when it comes to the seriousness of their cause. He is unruly and at times treats it like a game. While some would consider characteristics such as this offensive because of the real people out there today fighting this war, there is some realism to those actions. There are people that have gotten so wrapped up in this war they try to turn into something else just to keep going as they battle the enemy. The film is very tense and at times not for the faint hearted. Still, it is not suppose to be war is real and war can make you feel all sorts of emotions you never thought you had inside you. One of the things that I appreciated about 'The Hurt Locker', was the fact that not all Arab people are depicted as bad, and that those who happen to be good in nature are thrown into terrorist acts against their will and sometimes they lose their own lives.<br /><br />'The Hurt Locker', is not meant to be a cinematic legend in its field, nor was it made to be one of the greatest films of all time. I feel this movie was created to send a very important message about the war we are currently fighting and war in general. We have brave men and women who fight for freedom and a movie such as this one is here to show us, maybe not accurately, how they go about their daily lives on the battlefield. More importantly, it shows how all that these souls want to make sure that in the end they are able to go home.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>2009's Oscar winner for Best Picture was a bit of a bust. The film follows the work of a bomb-disposal unit in Iraq. There's plenty of boom-boom, and the film provides a sense of Iraq that is dreary, desolate and dangerous. But like many recent war movies -- "Jar Heads" being one -- it fails to deliver on the inner lives of its characters. We see comrades fighting brutally among themselves and taking insane risks, but get no insight into what drives them. Even the "hurt locker" of the title barely gets its due. Some might call this respecting the audience's intelligence, but I call it lazy and shallow.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the film has little to say about Iraq, and less to say about modern warfare or the life of a soldier. Other than "war is fun for some people."</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Hurt Locker" is a modern version of a movie that's been made dozens of times before for the plethora of conflicts in which the Federal Government has engaged.  The performances are great, and there is a lot of tension when it comes to defusing the bombs.  In a way, this is the old British WWII series "Danger UXB" (which is worth seeking out) tarted up with a big budget for the Second Iraq War.<br /><br />However, I didn't find this movie to be anything special.  When you get a title card that tells you how many days Bravo company has left on its tour, you know for a fact exactly what is going to happen to which member of the team, if you've ever seen a movie.  When somebody gets short, and they're in a cop or military movie, there's only one thing that can happen.  Sadly, that same cliche happens here.  The pace of the movie is overly slow.  I know they're trying to establish tension, but after 30 minutes there's no real story or plot and the audience is left wondering what exactly is going on.  We don't really get what the bomb guys are doing to defuse the bombs; they don't talk us through it or give any explanation, so you're also left wondering about the tension and when it's supposed to stop.  Hey, there's also the cliche "wildman" who breaks all the rules to do the job.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't hate this movie.  But, it's best watched with one finger on the fast forward.  I don't understand how this made "Best Picture."  I would recommend renting this before you buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>... until the POV turned to the insurgents.<br /><br />There is no way in h*ll that you could embed an camera crew on the bad guys' side.<br /><br />Really empathetic entertaining movie<br /><br />bows to the crew ...<br /><br />Great Job!!<br />:)</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>The Oscars are on Sunday, and "The Hurt Locker" seems to be the front runner. I'm not sure about that, but if it wins, I wouldn't complain. Katherine Bigelow's anti-war Iraq epic is loaded with suspense, fine acting, editing, script,  cinematography and all the stuff that makes an Oscar winner. It's never boring, and the characters each have an agenda. Interesting. Also interesting is that it made the rounds of indie film festivals in 2008. The 2008 Indie Spirits nominated it for 2 awards: Jeremy Renner as Best Actor, and Anthony Mackie as Best Supp Actor. No mention of Ms. Bigelow, or Best Picture. I'm going out on a limb here, but I think Ms Bigelow will win the Oscar for Director, but her ex-husband's film will win Best Picture (Avatar). The DVD has lots of extras, and Ms Bigelow has a tremendous amount of personal "touch" that I think is solely responsible for its power. Jeremy Renner is certainly capable, but it's Jeff Bridges' turn to win...and, in this case, it's not just Oscar politics. Enuff...only my opinion.  UPDATE: I think the Oscars got it right. Maybe there should be a new category of Best CGI film. I DO enjoy when small Indie films beat out the studio big-shots.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>I was thoroughly enthralled by "The Hurt Locker".  It's a war film without the absurd bravado and fake special effects.  Heroes like Sylvester Stallone and, in an earlier time, Ronald Reagan, are also completely absent.  If it's possible, it's an art house war film.<br /><br />The essence of the story revolves around the lives of a three man Explosive Ordinance Disposal team in Iraq.  Each of the men is very different. The team's leader, Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) is a war junkie.  He seems to love the adrenaline of the moment.  Unfortunately, this leaves him prone to rash and foolhardy decisions.  His two juniors, Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge, are not happy with his approach; they are just counting down the days to when they can leave Iraq.  As the days count down, the team has many close shaves.  It is these close shaves that keep the viewer on edge.  Defusing ordinance requires great courage and a cool nerve.  The viewer feels the emotion by the bucket load.<br /><br />The essence of James' character is seen briefly near the conclusion of the film.  He has trouble adapting to civilian life.  He wants more of the adrenaline.  It is his lust for excitement that drives the movie.  It is a white knuckle ride at times.<br /><br />"The Hurt Locker" deserves an Oscar.  It is a modern war classic.  It also deserves a wider audience.  Perhaps a nod from the Academy will help it extend its reach?</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>The Hurt Locker is an almost docudrama about a bomb squad in Iraq; but specifically one soldier named SFC William James (Jeremy Renner), and his delusional take on life and his job. Slanted, anti-war and almost anti-military, I felt this film by director Kathryn Bigelow was almost an insult to our men and women in uniform. It is fascinating for the first hour as you watch these men do their very dangerous work in a very hostile environment; but then it becomes tedious and almost boring as they get drunk and beat the hell out of each other on their time off. Rated R for violence and language.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Director Kathryn Bigelow (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GUJZ4G">Point Break</a>) has an uncanny ability to capture the adrenaline in an unbearably tense situation, and she displays this unique skill throughout this propulsive 2009 battlefield drama. In fact, Mark Boal's blunt, economic screenplay (based on his own experiences embedded in a bomb squad) largely eschews the politics around the Iraqi conflict in favor of the escalating madness infiltrating an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their unenviable job is to dispose of undetonated bombs in the war-torn streets of Baghdad during the post-invasion period in 2004. The story's focus is on the new team leader, Sergeant First Class William James, who depends on the support of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge who are assigned to communicate with James via a radio inside his bomb-suit and provide him with rifle cover while he examines improvised explosive devices (IEDs).<br /><br />Sanborn and Eldridge are still reeling from the sudden death of their previous leader, Staff Sergeant Thompson, when the far more reckless James upsets their established procedures with his extraordinary resolve. James turns out to be a more complex figure than his original bravado indicates, and Sanborn and Eldridge respond by questioning their own perspective on risk versus responsibility. A key factor in understanding James' psyche is his relationship with a local boy who calls himself Beckham because of his love of soccer. This leads James to acts that endanger his team and stretch them beyond wartime bravery and into James' obsessive mission. With visual flair and kinetic editing, Bigelow seems far less concerned with sustaining a narrative, although in this case, her own singular sense of filmmaking bravado overshadows the more conventional plot directions she introduces later in the story. Jeremy Renner is a terrific find as James because he manages to deepen the character's cocksure attitude with every traumatizing episode and without the need for sentiment.<br /><br />That's because he conveys both the uncompromising concentration and the resulting adrenaline rush James feels within the desperation of a free-for-all combat zone. Illustrating their characters' inner conflict in different ways, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty play Eldridge and Sanborn skillfully. Mackie accurately shows Eldridge struggling to be the professional soldier, while Geraghty reflects a more humanistic perspective, the one to which we civilian viewers can probably most relate, and he is especially affecting in his climactic confessional scene. Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes show up for brief but surprisingly effective cameos. Barry Ackroyd (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GH3CR0">United 93</a>) is responsible for the vivid, burnished cinematography. The extras on the 2010 DVD are sparse but quite good. The most informative feature is the commentary track from Bigelow and Boal, who both discuss production details and historical context to allow for a greater appreciation of the story being told. There is also a twelve-minute making-of featurette, which is pretty standard as these extras go. Lastly, an image gallery accompanies a 23-minute Q&A session with Boal and Bigelow recorded at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>'The Hurt Locker'- a place to store your pain.<br />Urban Dictionary<br /><br />I can finally start to breathe and to loosen my fingers that were curled from the stress. Coming out of viewing the film 'The Hurt Locker' is an experience in itself. You feel exhilarated and drained, and you feel the film for hours. This is the best film about war I have ever seen. The New York Times has said "The movie is a viscerally exciting, adrenaline-soaked tour de force of suspense and surprise, full of explosions and hectic scenes of combat, but it blows a hole in the condescending assumption that such effects are just empty spectacle or mindless noise."<br /><br />The focus of this film is the Delta Company, an Army unit whose job is to carefully detonate, if all else fails -- the I.E.D.'s that seem to occupy Iraq. Three men are the make-up this unit, Jeremy Renner, who plays Staff Sgt James, one of the more magnificent acting experiences I have seen this year. Sgt. J. T. Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie, a careful man who does everything by the book. Specialist Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty, is a man of mixed emotions, young in nature and emotions, he is having difficulty dealing with the danger, fear and death all around him. He, shows us the Hurt Locker-a place where pain is stored; we come away with a full supply of it.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow has invited us to become the fourth member of this squad. Through her vision we come up close and personal with the unit. The cameras were placed 360 degrees around each scene, so that every motion and action could be viewed at once. It is a surreal feeling and gives this film the extraordinary view that makes us rock. The fear and the danger are palpable. The acting is the best I have seen. I was gripping my chair, shielding my eyes at times, but opening them because I had to see,just had to.<br />.<br />The dirt, grime, heat, fear are all here. The war has come to America, people. Now stand up straight and tall and take a look. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Highly Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-18-10<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JSJC">Strange Days</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304481101">Born in Flames [VHS</a>]</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>I can't really point to any glaring flaws in the movie.

Here is a war movie that takes no real position on war, and especially no position on the Iraq War, and simply shows the mental and physical brutality and beauty of conflict.<br /><br />You know the story by now. It centers around a bomb disposal and disarmament team in Iraq who throw themselves into harm's way on a regular basis in order to make life safer for their fellow soldiers and civilians. The team receives a new member, played by the fantastic Jeremy Renner, who is something of a wild card. Soon he and everyone else are pulled into his own personal brand of insanity as he comes to realize that without the war, he's nothing.<br /><br />It's a simple concept and wonderfully executed by Kathryn Bigelow and her team. It was filmed on location in the Middle East and you really get a sense of what life is like that part of the world for our soldiers and the civilians who live there. You bear witness to some of the day-to-day tragedies that happen (admittedly not as much now as they did in 2004 when this movie is apparently set), like a man forced into a suicide bombing. It's a harrowing look at an unpleasant reality.<br /><br />I mention in the title of the review that it's an action movie where you dread the action. This is entirely true. You really start to become quite fond of the three bomb techs, and when the bullets start flying and things start exploding, you worry about them. You want nothing more than for them to go back to their base, nice and safe, and not venture out into the dangerous world. It's something I've not come across in an action-type film, and I'm glad to see it here.<br /><br />Was this actually the best movie of 2009? Well, yes. It won't have the long-term influence of "Avatar", but it is overall better than that film. I'm glad it won and I'm glad I've seen it.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>The Hurt Locker is not your normal "this is war" movie. It shows you an aspect of war you hear a lot about but you do not see that much of - bombs that get left by the wayside and the people that have to deal with them. In it, you get to look at three people and see a lot of the motivation that pushes them forward (and a 4th character briefly - although you don't really get to know him that much). This introduces you to the adrinaline ride some people have, the fear that fuels some of the motions, and the respect that soldiers seemed to have for these people. That was something I liked about this the most - the respect portion, and the part that shows you just how much these people have to watch out for.<br /><br />When we start our ride we are introduced to some of the mechanics that are used in this type of war, and we also see what the bombmakers work with. A robot pulling a small cart versus a 9 volt battery hitched to artillery shells. That says a lot about the powers that are out there fighting, and the things they have at their disposal. It also says something when you see that both sides have an element in common - one that stands and that thinks and that tries to outwit the other - and you even see respect shown for each side. In one instance we see what a man that has disarmed 800 plus bombs keeps under his bed, and these things said a lot a well.<br />I really thought the movie was thought out quite a bit in the character side of the conflicts, not to mention the things we saw happening in the other portions of the fighting.<br /><br />There are moving parts in the movie as well - I really thought that some of it was horrible because of the way some of the bombing was set up. The bio-bomb that we see in the movie, for example, isn't just a person wearing a belt. There is a person wearing one in part of the movie but that is just a small part of the topic. The kid thing - that was something else.<br /><br />You might like this if you like movies about war seen from a different angle, although the conflict portion might not be what you expect. There are bombs, people hurt, and some interesting things exposed here. But the thing that really powers this is the human element, and the ways that different people survive (and perhaps thrive) in a conflict zone. I personally liked the movie because I had read oceans of headlines about roadside bombings and I had seen stockpiles of shells being destroyed in the sands, but I had never seen things from this angle.<br />If you expect killing on all sides you get snippets of that in some places but this is more of a mindgame being played out. Thrill ride? Yeah, i might even say that but not in the atypical sense.<br /><br />It is at least worth checking into.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Unlike many of the earlier films on the same subject, "The Hurt Locker" starts off by accepting the Iraq war as a given.  That is to say it doesn't try to place the issue in any kind of larger sociopolitical context or to explain why the Americans felt compelled to wage the conflict in the first place.  Instead, it focuses on the everyday activities of a three-man Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit (EOD) whose job it is to dismantle, as safely as possible, the literally hundreds of still-to-be-detonated IEDs strewn across the streets of Baghdad.  The leader of the trio has just been killed in the line of duty and has now been replaced by a newcomer whose seeming recklessness and flagrant disregard for protocol doesn't sit well with the other members of the team, who feel that their own survival is being needlessly threatened by his carelessness - especially now that there is less than a month-and-a-half left to go before the team is to be taken out of rotation.<br /><br />Before getting to the more "literary" aspects of the film, let's just say right up front that, on a strictly "cinematic" level, "The Hurt Locker" is an astonishing accomplishment in every sense of the term.  Director Kathryn Bigelow employs hand-held cameras, razor-sharp editing and an abundance of point-of-view shots to create a film of palpable, nail-biting  immediacy that plunges the audience directly into the heart of the action.  Yet, she punctuates that with the nonstop sound of jet fighters roaring overhead just to remind us that, hard as it may be to imagine at times, there is an even larger war taking place somewhere beyond the reaches of the one we see here.  This story is clearly just one of many.<br /><br />On a thematic level, the movie explores the various ways these three men cope with the inconceivable stress of life on the battlefield.  Staff Sergeant William James finds an adrenaline-pumping thrill in living life on the edge, of always being just a hair-trigger away from possible death.  Specialist Owen Eldridge, on the other hand, has become so obsessed with death that he fears he will freeze up right at the moment when he needs to be most clear-headed, steady-handed and steely-nerved.  And Sergeant T.J. Sanborn occupies a kind of pragmatic, middle ground between the two, willing to put his life on the line to get the job done but not to willy-nilly just tempt fate for the sake of doing so.  Yet, thanks to Marc Boal`s perceptive screenplay, each man emerges as a complex individual in his own right, never a "type."  James, for instance, may be wild and reckless, but he also has a caring, compassionate side that he reveals in off-handed and unexpected moments of tenderness towards others and loyalty towards his men.  And there's a stunning coda that forces us, perhaps reluctantly, to see James in an entirely different light from how we've been viewing him up to that point.<br /><br />Relative unknowns Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are heartbreakingly effective as James, Sanborn and Eldridge, respectively, managing to create fully realized, empathetic characters amidst all the pyrotechnic war-movie effects.  And even a few familiar faces - Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes and Evangeline Lilly from "Lost" - show up at various points in the film (in a way, this use of "stars" - though obviously done for purposes of procuring financing - could easily have compromised the integrity of the picture, but the unusual way Bigelow uses them helps to mitigate that effect).<br /><br />The real key to "The Hurt Locker"'s success is that it never sacrifices intimacy for the grander picture, never allows the war movie setting to supercede the characters and their stories.  It is first, last and always a movie about  ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  It's also unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>This is a genre film: war is hell. They made these by the dozens in WW2. Here, we go to Iraq for a few days in the lives of some bomb defusers. This is not a subtle movie. You will wonder why the US ever bothered to send people to such an absurd place. Tension builds throughout as we expect most of the soldiers to die grisly deaths. Some do. Some don't. In the end, we are told, some prefer this way of life over civilian life. HHmmmm....where have we seen that theme before in a story about battle-scarred soldiers? You won't learn anything watching this. I can't quite pronounce it entertainment, either.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>Quite frankly, one of the best war movies I've ever seen. "The Hurt Locker" focuses on what it is to actually be addicted to war and the repercussions on those who not only crave it (through the character portrayed by Jeremy Renner), but those who are scared of it (Geraghty) and those who don't understand it (Mackie). Renner, who I've always thought to be a great actor starting with 2002's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2X3MU">Dahmer</a> and 2003's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008EYA5">S.W.A.T. (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>, takes the lead in this drama as a rebel bomb squad technician who lives on the edge with every bomb he diffuses. An equally impressive Anthony Mackie (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPBO">We Are Marshall (Widescreen Edition)</a>) plays the spotter on his team, with Geraghty playing the assistant specialist.<br /><br />Most might brush this film off as just another war movie made by the liberal media. However, I believe it's anything but just that. What makes this one of the best war films I've seen is that it doesn't so much as focus on just the action as it does on the humanity itself as well as the psychological toll that comes with fighting a war in a country where anyone can -- and most likely will -- kill you. Add the constant unease of being in a job that is as dangerous as bomb diffusion (where every move might be your last) and it's no surprise to see the mental toll it takes on the three central characters. Each moment these guys go into the field, director Kathryn Bigelow easily conveys (with the help of Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' on-edge score) the tense moments that fill any soldier's life during war.<br /><br />Bigelow deserved the Directors Guild Of America award for Best Director and the Oscar. The way this film was shot mostly had the feel of a documentary more than a major Hollywood motion picture. And that (along with using mostly slightly unknown actors) helped the believability of the story. I especially liked that the well-known actors used in the film were more like cameos and were not followed throughout the story (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Evangeline Lilly).<br /><br />For those who don't mind seeing films about war, this should be a must. For those who don't even like war films, you should still give it a try as I find it an essential viewing -- not just in cinema, but also for any film that truly encapsulates a post-9/11 world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>This suspenseful movie shows a side of the Iraq war that many of us haven't seen before. It thrillingly gives you a glimpse into a group of EOD soldiers (Explosive ordinance disposal) as they tackle one unforgiving situation after the other.<br /><br />I was always at the edge of my seat in anticipation of the dangers that lurk around every corner. It's a terrible feeling at its worst because this movie portrays how some EOD soldiers actually work in Iraq. After seeing this film, my father remarked how hard, and terrible it is for them to do their life-threatening jobs. Forget politics or whatever you may hear about this movie and see it for yourself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this award winning film. It is outstanding in many important aspects, the most impressive in acting. The script has a documentary and also classic story line feel to it. Again, I think highly of this film, and it MAY be one of the best movies of the year for last year (2009).</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>Hey don't fret, potential enlistee! Hard as it is to discount the evidence of your senses when bombarded with skillful and costly cinematography, the 'gritty realism' of this film is totally unrealistic, full-bore Hollywood. Yeah, there may be scenes of mayhem similar to the scenes in the film at times, but not with such convenient regularity, not even in Baghdad in 2004. And there were innumerable other implausible or outright false details; just look at the one-star reviews here and not how many are written by military veterans.<br /><br />So, is "the Hurt Locker" an anti-military film? Hmm. It didn't strike me that way. Is it an anti-war film? Well, it doesn't glorify war, that's obvious, but it doesn't precisely get tough and analytical about the futility of war either. We all know , whether first hand or not, that war is dangerous to living things, soldiers or kids or old ladies at market. The Hurt Locker DOES depict the absolute futility of America's military occupation of Iraq, but that analysis seems almost tangential to the core of the film, which is the portrayal of Sgt. James, the genuine "wild man" who defuses bombs with his bare hands and whose maverick heroism gets several of his comrades gravely wounded, probably unnecessarily. Are we supposed to admire the maverick, or at least to empathize with him? That has to be what the film is asking of us. But the man is an ACTOR, friends! He's good-looking, witty, and he gets soft-hearted about an Iraqi boy with a big smile. The real Sgt James (who wouldn't be allowed such maverick-space in the real army) would not be so appealing. He's a pathological dude, amigos! He's a runaway train you wouldn't want on your tracks. I'm not sure you'd want him coming home to your community, either, even with combat ribbons. The real Sgt Jameses, and there are a few, bring home more trouble than the whole army protected you from. The psych clinics and emergency rooms of America are familiar with Sgt James and his battered wife.<br /><br />Apparently lots of people were impressed with Jeremy Renner's performance as Sgt James. Me, I thought it was shallow. Anthony Mackie, as the second man on the bomb squad, delivered a more convincing characterization. Can a film this bloody and ugly be bland? It was for me. I sat through it without any emotional or intellectual engagement whatsoever.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>The Hurt Locker opens with a quote; "the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug." Kathryn Bigelow's film is probably the most acclaimed film of the year, ending up on many critics' top 10 lists, with Roger Ebert going so far as to call it the 2nd best film of the decade. When a film receives such monumental acclaim, it's hard to imagine it living up to expectations and you will find those who have already called The Hurt Locker overrated and disappointing...I was skeptical, I'll admit, but The Hurt Locker delivers.<br /><br />Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are part of a bomb-defusing squad in Baghdad. In the beautifully filmed, poetic opening scene their sergeant (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb goes off. SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is brought in to replace him. Sanborn and Eldridge notice immediately that James is more reckless than their previous technician and he has no reservations about it. He's not cocky, but he knows he's good at his job...Even when he's putting both himself and his team in more danger than necessary.<br /><br />Some familiar faces pop up for brief appearances, actors like David Morse and Ralph Fiennes but the film is owned by Renner and Mackie. The acting in this film has been raved about, but this acclaim has been muffled with more focus being cast on the film as a whole and its female director. This is unfair because both Renner and Mackie carry the film and they both give terrific performances. The acting here is subtle; these are not powerhouse, fishing for an Oscar-type performances. It's the subtlety of the performances, the tapping into real people rather than characters that make these performances great. Renner, especially, nails his role as the adrenaline junkie. Here's an actor that once made Jeffrey Dahmer a sympathetic character and here he really brings you into the mind of James, showing how he thrives on his job rather than just presenting this to you. Both actors breathe so much life into their characters, they rarely let you in on the fact that they are acting...Their performances seem real.<br /><br />In the film industry, the most celebrated directors are almost unanimously male. Kathryn Bigelow has now made her presence known amongst her male colleagues (notably her ex-husband James Cameron, who has also been celebrating the critical and financial success of a "small" film he made), showing that a woman can handle challenging, powerful material that is typically left to male directors. If she were to win the Best Director Academy Award that she will inevitably be nominated for, she will definitely deserve it.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker works as an action/suspense film and a character study/human drama simultaneously. It's remarkable that Bigelow has managed to balance it out so well, making a film that will appeal to different people for different reasons. Aside from getting into the mind of its main character, it has some intense scenes of heart-racing action; made even more effective by the very real setting...The film was shot in Jordan, at times only three miles from the Iraqi border. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd deserves his share of credit, using frenetic, yet coherent filming techniques that adds to the realism without making the film hard to follow. Not being a Hollywood production, The Hurt Locker benefits even further by not being afraid to enter darker places that would have been ignored and/or glossed-over to conform to Hollywood standards.<br /><br />I've never been big on war movies, but The Hurt Locker completely exceeded my expectations. It's a great film, easily one of the best of 2009 and it's hard to imagine another film about the Iraq war topping this in scope, entertainment value, or relevance. This film is not just a flash in the pan either and I think that it will continue to gather more acclaim as the years pass. It's a true masterpiece; poetic, exciting, and memorable.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>The Hurt Locker is a very well executed film about an aspect of the war in Iraq we don't think of often: the experiences of the troops assigned to deactivate bombs so that they cannot ever cause damage. The acting is easily some of the best I've ever seen; and along with that hand-held camera style of photography I genuinely felt as if I were watching a documentary about real people instead of a film with Hollywood actors in it. In addition, the choreography works wonders for the film; the script was well written and the casting was superbly done.<br /><br />It isn't long before we meet three soldiers who take on the task of deactivating bombs: Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), who gets a drug-like thrill from being the one to go in and deactivate bombs even when he doesn't have to and his two backup men Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and the somewhat troubled Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) who talks to the company shrink but doesn't ever get comfortable with the war the way William James does.<br /><br />I could say so much about this movie, including what James' "hurt locker" represents but then I would be giving too much away. Suffice it to say that the movie is essentially a series of sequences that show the difficulties and the life-or-death stakes the troops face as portrayed by the characters James, Sanborn and Eldridge. There's plenty of action, tension and thriller aspects that add to the overall quality of the film; and the cameos we get from greats like Ralph Fiennes are wonderful. Look also for well done cameos by Evangeline Lilly as Connie James and Guy Pearce as Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson. Christopher Sayegh does an excellent job of playing the role of Beckham, a young boy who gets caught up with William James as the film progresses.<br /><br />If the film has any flaw, I would say that they could have edited down just a bit of the war footage and added just a few minutes more to the scenes in which Williams James is a civilian.<br /><br />In addition, the DVD comes with a "behind the scenes" featurette and an optional running commentary.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker will forever be one of the great movies about the modern day war in Iraq. I highly recommend this film for people interested in this subject; and people who enjoy thrillers, action movies and even dramas would do well to add this to their collections.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>I have picked this movie after learning about it during 2009 Oscar selection.  I was happy for the first woman director, Kathryn Bigelow, who has received and Oscar for her film.  In spite of the fact that there are no big name actors in this movie (except for one), it is the story of the film and the art of making it that sears into the nerve about the war, soldiering and brotherhood in combat.<br /><br />It has been a while since I have seen a good war film.  And this one goes hand in hand with the best ones. It is insightful anf it attacks all aspects of what it means to be a professional soldier.  Main character is complicated - if not reckless, then he is totally oblivious about the effect he has on people working with him.  Is it the need for rush that keep him going or is it something else?  I will let you watch the movie in order to be a judge of that.<br /><br />The absolute credit goes to director Bigelow and the screenwriter of the film.  This is a smart film that will not take sides, judge people and their actions - it acts as observe of the reality taht at times seems mesmerizing and tantalizing at the same time.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>"The Hurt Locker" currently stands as the most critically acclaimed film of 2009 and after seeing it just this week I'm inclined to agree this acclamation wholeheartedly. This really is a work of art from start to finish and has now been moved to the top of my list of movies to own and cherish forever. Since its release it has won numerous awards and has 9 Academy award nominations which they will undoubtedly win come the ceremony in March. The cast comprises of unknowns, but are ones with very familiar faces as, after doing a bit of research, a few of the actors have had very minor roles in other TV shows and movies so if this will be their leap to the big time, then it's well deserved.<br /><br />During the early stages of the Iraq war in 2004, this film follows a 3 member EOD (Explosives Ordinance Disposal) unit as they go about their missions in providing cover for one member, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) while he disarms IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices. James' behaviour in rushing into the blast radius without sending in the bomb disposal robot first leads to him being labelled reckless by his fellow officers, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This image of a reckless officer has a negative effect on the team dynamic and as the film progresses you become more and more aware of the individual reasons why each character is the way he is.<br /><br />This film doesn't really follow a plot in the sense of that the team must solve some form of deep seeded puzzle, or there is a mastermind behind the bombs that this unit specifically dealt with. It simply follows a trio of officers as they do the same job which is being done for real in Iraq and touches upon how those officers deal with the situations in which they find themselves. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, wanted the film to immerse the viewer into something that was "Raw, immediate and Visceral". That it certainly achieved perfectly as although some of the scenes may seem slow, they're slow for a purpose. It wants you to be aware that anything can change at any time and although there may be a slight stint of calm and silence, that can change in an instant and it was brilliantly done.<br /><br />Although some of the actors may be better known than others, I'm happy in a way that it isn't a cast of megastars playing these roles. In a movie like this, if you had a cast that consisted of the likes of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon or Tom Cruise, for example, then the film simply wouldn't have the same impact. You would watch it for another purpose, rather than simply watching it for the story and that is why there appears to be this revolution of sorts with more and more of the most critically successful films containing unknown or little known actors rather than the big names. The film was shot in both Jordan and Kuwait and had a really authentic look and feel to it and the film is overall well deserving of any praise which it receives.<br /><br />However, there is one gripe I have about this film and it is one which was touched upon by other reviewers who unfairly gave it 1 star just due to this point alone. The way in which British servicemen were portrayed around the middle of the film was terribly offensive and overly typical to the point I had expected it to happen at some point during the film before even switching it on. There have been mountains of films that have done this and this will not be the last to make such a mistake, on the other side of the argument though, you would almost expect an English film to do the same thing to the Americans regardless of how serious the film is supposed to be. Although I did find this slightly offensive, I didn't let this damage my view of the film as a whole which I still support as being sublime.<br /><br />Shockingly brilliant and although it let me down in one particular scene, the film overall was superb. On Blu-Ray this film is especially done justice as the detail and resolution just makes it visually superb in its own right. Buy it, rent it or watch it at a friend's house. This is definitely a film to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>A frontrunner for the Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards, The Hurt Locker deals with a bomb defusing squad on the field in Iraq. When SSG Thompson (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb he is trying to defuse is set off, he is replaced as team leader by SFC James (Jeremy Renner). Things don't quite work out the way the other members of the squad, Sgt Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), would like as James is an adrenaline junkie who's prone to not listen to anyone around him. As time goes on he detaches himself further from them, and leads them increasingly into more dangerous situations.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow, ex-wife of James "King of the World" Cameron, is a woman who has never rested on her laurels. Each time she steps up to a plate to make a movie she makes something completely different. With Near Dark she hit up horror, with Blue Steel she played with the thriller genre, Point Break took on the action genre, and Strange Days took on sci-fi. Having not made a movie since 2002's K-19: The Widowmaker, Bigelow was looking for a new project. She was trying to determine what movie to make when she sent this script to James Cameron who told her to make this movie. Now Bigelow sits as the front runner for Best Director, only the fourth woman in the history of the Academy to receive a nomination, and may possibly even best her ex-husband for the statuette.<br /><br />One of the things that stands out about this film, is that it's a war film that doesn't focus on the idea of whether war is right or wrong, whether or not we should be in Iraq, or if our soldiers are doing good things over there. With a job like bomb defusing, one of the great things, is that you're trying to make a safer environment for both your soldiers as well as the inhabitants that reside in the country you're fighting in. Picking this type of job is a masterful stroke, it allows Bigelow to stay out of politics and focus on the true message of the movie: War is a drug. The main character is a junkie, an adrenaline junkie. More and more he refuses to listen to those around him, and seeks bigger and bigger highs.<br /><br />Really, The Hurt Locker is an excellent character study of how war affects people differently, like drugs, and this war as a drug metaphor is one of the most brilliant things to come from movies based on wars in the past decade or more. On top of that, for an action movie made from only $15 million (that's half the budget of District 9) this movie still looks better than action movies made for over $100 million, with much more to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, filmed in a style reminiscent of a documentary the film has a certain real life feel to it, like rather than directing actors Bigelow directed a film crew tagging along with soldiers. Unlike many filmmakers these days, Bigelow really knows how to work suspense. Large portions of scenes are waiting for something bad to happen, and you really feel at any moment anyone could die. In a sniper face off, you sit with James and Sanborn on a ridge watching a building kilometers away, worried for your protagonists and hoping that they'll pull of the right shot. The movie doesn't include as much action as you'd expect, but because of the high suspense of the film you feel there's much more action in the film than there really is.<br /><br />The acting in this film is superb, as can be noted by Jeremy Renner's Oscar nomination. But, in reality, this cast deserved the SAG ensemble nomination they didn't get. While Renner's role doesn't stand out as the "addict" really everyone does such a great job that you honestly feel this could be a documentary where each of these actors aren't actors, but actual soldiers in the field. Of all the things that stand out, there's a great scene that comes later on in the movie, where Renner's SFC James has to diffuse a bomb strapped to a man who's pleading for his life. It's an extremely suspenseful scene that is also touching as James tries to come up with anything he can to free the man from his burden, and the acting in a scene like that is what makes it so suspenseful as you care for these individuals because of their actions and the way that they carry themselves.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Hurt Locker, definitely one of the best movies of 2009, and one that definitely landed on my top 5 list for that year. If you like war films, suspense, action, drama, and/or a good character study this is definitely one to check out. I know I'll be owning it!<br /><br />5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>This is another proof (if one was still needed) tha Oscar is like politcs, but worse. This insane amount of awards for such a pedestrian war movie? Heck, "PLATOON" blows this out of the water anytime, even watching it today. Saving Private Ryan, same thing. I could mention a lot of others (Black Hawk Down; Cross of Iron).<br /><br />Direction is sloppy; acting is average. Photography is so-and-so. A lot of war movies managed to show the conflict, tensions, pscilogical doubts AND the action much better.<br /><br />Maybe they simply did not want AVATAR to gather all the awards (I'm not saying it did deserve it or not; I'm just guessing); maybe they wanted a female director to get it (no prejudice here-just analysing the statistics).<br /><br />Highly disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>I've grown accustomed to being disappointed in the wins for best picture at the Oscars over the last few years. It seems those who make the decisions are so dead set on being taken seriously as artists that they fail to choose films that are popular as well as artistic, going for the dramatic punch that they feel shows how serious they are. When you discount one aspect of a film in an attempt to look at another, you lose perspective of the whole meaning of the award. I always looked at the Oscar as rewarding the best and the brightest. It seems that stopped a few years back and continues to do so this year with THE HURT LOCKER.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. The movie is a good look at the world our military goes through on a day to day basis in war torn countries, this one being Iraq. But with all the movies I saw this past year, this was not the one that I though came near being the best. And Kathryn Bigelow has long deserved notice in Hollywood. Her work in the past was ignored and the making of this film wasn't done by a major Hollywood studio. That shows how much they truly respect her. The nicest thing about it is that she will now have enough clout to get more of her movies off the ground.<br /><br />So the story. The film opens with a group of soldiers in an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their job is to dismantle, disarm or explode any bombs that are found in the area they are stationed in. The weapons of choice they most often come into contact with are Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and they have one here. As they attempt to prevent the bomb from exploding, an insurgent with a cell phone explodes it, killing the group's leader.<br /><br />The film moves on to the new leader of the group, the new bomb expert Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner). Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), one of the remaining soldiers, welcomes James to Camp Victory which was Camp Liberty but they decided this sounded better. In his quarters, James has taken off the boards covering the windows to let light in. When Sanborn points out they were installed to keep mortar fire from coming through, James points out that the mortars could easily come in through the roof and he prefers the light. As the film progresses, this becomes a telling moment into the psychological state of mind of James.<br /><br />With only 38 days left of service, the team is sent out to do their job in the city. Completing the group is Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), also witness to the first death. As they arrive at locations throughout the film to disarm bombs, the cautious Sanborn and Eldridge are perplexed by James willingness to confront danger head on. His unwillingness to follow protocol or to listen to Sanborn leads to a confrontation as well as several hair raising sequences where they set out to save lives by taking the bombs out.<br /><br />The differences in these men are what make up the meat of the film. Sanborn wants to follow orders and wants to survive, yet he doesn't see that in James. Eldridge is the most apparently mentally disturbed of the trio, talking with the camp psychiatrist as he deals with the death that surrounds him. But it is James that is the most frightening of the group, living without fear of death, taking apart bombs as if there's nothing more thrilling to do, trying to find solutions to each one he comes across.<br /><br />James character is so in tune with his love of danger that he keeps a box of bomb parts and detonators under his bed. It is James' story that is the focus of the film. He has become so involved in his position that he seeks out danger, that adrenaline rush that comes with it. The problem is that at the same time he puts his men in harm's way as well.<br /><br />While the trio evolve into a sense of camaraderie, they also begin to come apart in thanks to James' need for the rush. With days counting down as the story moves forward, the tensions mount.<br /><br />Sound like a good movie? Well, it sort of is. But at the same time the tenseness of the situations these men find themselves in is played out in a semi-real time mode. The viewer is required to sit and painstakingly wait as the clock ticks by while bombs are taken out.<br /><br />While each actor and character are played well, the main focus on James by Renner is exceptional. A young actor just getting notice, Renner portrays a complex series of emotions in James, from the thrill junkie to the tender hearted man who weeps at the sight of a young boy he got to know who appears to be murdered with a bomb planted inside of him later on.<br /><br />The film confronts some tough issues concerning war and the world we face in Iraq. But the best thing that it does is not take a major stand on the issues. It doesn't go right or left politically but tells the tale of the men in uniform straight on.<br /><br />So why didn't I think it deserved the Oscar for best picture? Because it was long and drawn out, it moved at a snails pace and it didn't entertain me. Yes, it was well made (with the exception of the hand held jostling camera that seems to have become a favorite lately) and yes it told a compelling story. But I never felt involved, never invested in the characters enough to get into the film.<br /><br />I know, many people will take exception with my views as to this not being deserving of the award. But when did we decide that gritty, hard tempered films were the only ones deserving? When did films that contained hope become the black sheep? When did movies that made us laugh or sing suddenly become unworthy?<br /><br />I am a firm believer that most people go to movies to escape the world they live in, to get away from the moments of pain, poverty, anger and down right meanness they are exposed to daily. Those are the movies that inspire and give hope. They deserve to be rewarded. And yet Hollywood continues to choose message films instead. It is because of this that I can't say this movie deserves the award.<br /><br />As for a viewing, I'm not even sure I can recommend it for that either. It is tedious at worst and contains fine performances at best. The only way to choose viewing this is making the choice on your own, knowing inside what it is you expect from a film, what you want from one. I know I couldn't sit through this one again, not due to the content but due to the slowness of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The Hurt Locker, 2008 film<br /><br />The film starts in "Bagdad 2004".

A man with bombs strapped to his body walks towards the American lines. Is it a trap? Can the harness be removed in time? "I hate this place." The year is over. Back home he visits a supermarket. Is this what he was fighting for? "The older you get the fewer things you really love." [Is that true?] Will he return for another tour of duty?<br /><br />This film is a pseudo-documentary with little drama in it. Does it have a lesson? Was it designed to straddle the line between pro-war and anti-war so an audience could read their own feelings into it? "War is a drug" is just nonsense. Wars are fought to exploit property and people. Whenever you read about conflict over some barren desert you can be sure there is mineral wealth involved. Those who are involved in combat (or other sports) can get an adrenaline high, but that is hardly a "drug".</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1.  As in most cases, the intellectual elite, the critics et al just don't get it.  This is no better exemplified with all the hoopla that surrounded this movie.  I'm not a combat vet from the Iraq war, but I've spent my time in the military and this is just another one of those... pseudo documentary military movies with a definite left-leaning perspective on things that basically is based more on the fantasy of those so called sophisticated folks who write / create these movies than "reality."  With that being said, I would be ok with it if the movie just wasn't... so boring.  I mean, where's the "story",  where's the character development.  I'm probably expecting a little too much from movies these days... such as being semi-entertained and enlightened .  With this movie, you'll get neither... for the most part.<br /><br />2.  In summary, save your precious bucks and buy... a decent burger or something.  You'll get more enjoyment and enlightenment out of that compared to watching this dud.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"The Hurt Locker," this year's Oscar winner, is a very intense Iraq combat film in which Staff Sergeant James (played by Jeremy Renner) is extremely fearless and very adept at defusing planted bombs, but very inept at protecting from harm the men he works closest with. He's a risk-taker, a reckless soldier, who is baffled by civilian life but thrives on the danger of his mission. As a civilian, a fish out of water, an endless line of cereal products in a supermarket flummoxes him, and is a mine field, but yet in a real mine field, he thrives on danger and facing death every day.<br /> He's a complex person who walks fearlessly into an area planted with bombs, but he's not a person to be envied, admired or emulated.<br /> Ironically he has probably saved hundreds of lives by his bomb defusing skills, but saving lives isn't really what motivates him. It is his own personal adrenaline rush, his egotism, and self-absorption which keeps him going. He's not a war lover per se who goes out and slaughters the enemy indiscriminately, but he has the perfect job for his personality because it gives him a chance to play a kind of Russian roulette with his life.<br />The movie shows him in off-duty situations. He's a heavy drinker, heavy-smoker, and a person who enjoys violent interplay with his mates. They don't like him; they hate him and fear him even though at times he briefly shows compassion towards them. He's a man's man in his own mind, a cowboy, but basically a loner.<br />Though filmed in Jordan, you get the feeling that you really are in the mean streets of Iraq. The movie won't bore you; it's violent and bloody, but it's the character of Sergeant James that will stay with you. Is he the kind of man who is going to save the world, or is he part of the problem?</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Hurt locker is a weird film. It's focused around the role of  many times forgotten personage in the war, this expert in deactivating deadly, mortal and  sophisticated weapons.<br /><br />Irak, 2004. In the first third of the film we will assist to a sort of documental account. First dealing with the deactivation of two weapons, then the massacre in the desert and finally realizing that nothing can make it to save the life of a n innocent. During the adagio of the film we will watch how these guys spent their free time, and we'll witness how the fraternity of this antihero with a sympathetic child will become an act of personal justice when this boy be murdered by the enemy.<br /><br />The spontaneity of the script is probably its main strength. One can feel that the hazardous and tensional moments are by themselves the dramatic core of the film. Dislike Platoon, for instance, there're not philosophical gestures or the well accustomed dichotomy between the good guys and the bad guys.<br /><br />In Vietnam, you could see your enemy through the eyes of the jungle, but under the inclement heat of the desert, the enemy is invisible. You have not a direct contact with it and so, we have a kind of technological conflagration. You fight against the mortal device not with the enemy, and if case you deal with it the nocturnal sequences demand from you other tactics and procedures.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow made an admirable and nervous camera handle, remarking (as Petersen did in Das boot) the anguishing frenzy of being dead or alive in question of seconds where a false movement is just the difference.<br /><br />The film simply doesn't pretend to become a denounce film. It presents us without anesthesia (and in this sense it reminds us to Black hawk) the real situation on the battlefield where the enemy is always behind innocent people used as shield in the most of cases.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Action film meets character study in Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER.  The film follows three members of an Army bomb squad (Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty, all excellent) as they bond and diffuse bombs.<br /><br />If the film has one main flaw, it's that there's no real plot; this will obviously be a deterrent to more mainstream war movie fans, who like bombs and bullets and blood, and not necessarily any sense or heart.  It will also be a disappointment to those who want a film that glorifies the war in Iraq, or those who want a film that demonizes it.<br /><br />And yet, it is these three main points that make THE HURT LOCKER such a treasure.  It isn't just bombs and bullets; yes, there are those, but this is a movie with heart.  Likewise, it isn't a "war" film per say; it is a human film, about the people who fight the war.  It actually manages not to take a political stance, which is a move so tedious I previously thought it impossible.  The film is about the characters (specifically Renner's Staff Sergeant James) and how they cope with their environment, and why they do what they do.  In fact, when something resembling a plot pokes its polished head in the second half, the film actually falters; but we quickly get back to the characters themselves, and everything ends on a high note.<br /><br />Needless to say, Bigelow's come up in the world.  We're talking about the director responsible for POINT BREAK, one of those action films (many of which star Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, or Gary Busey, come to think of it) that's only good because of how bad it is.  However, the directing behind LOCKER is spot-on; it feels real, it puts you on location.  The script by Mark Boal (the scribe behind the slightly more political, but still excellent, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH) is likewise solid, and the special effects are so real they're frightening.  Of course, a film couldn't be good without solid performances, and we get those here from everyone involved, from the three leads to cameo roles by Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Guy Pearce, and others.  THE HURT LOCKER winds up being one of those rare movies that is both vividly entertaining and emotionally powerful; it has genuine staying power.  If you want to watch an unbiased look at war, you could do a lot worse than this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>This film avoids the trap of making glib political statements about the Iraq war (it is surely too recent history to know its full significance yet). Instead it focuses on the daily lives of a taught squadron of bomb disposal experts who patrol the dusty Baghdad streets and dry desert scapes searching for and diffusing the ramshackle bombs put in place by insurgents trying to sabbotage the US reconstruction efforts.<br /><br />The drama weaves closely into the lives of the men, dominated by Sargeant William James, a curiously eager soldier who recklessly seeks out dangerous bomb situations, often failing to heed the warnings of his colleagues.<br /><br />The plot is taught, not in a synthetic Hollywood way with tension artificially built in leading to some carefully contrived denoument, but in a realistic, frustrating flatlining way. The days tick down to the end of the bomb squad's tour of duty, and the heat, relentless opposition from guerilla insurgents and cruelty (in one memorable scene, insurgents use the corpse of a small boy to conceal explosives) all take their toll on the men. They quarrel, gossip, banter and fight. The narrative in a way flatlines, replicating the true situation in Iraq where it was (still is) very difficult to tell what sort of impact and progress is being made.<br /><br />But the comradeship between the men is real, and this is developed in the film through touching scenes, such as James supplying an exhausted colleague (and rival) with water after he has been staring out at insurgents in the desert heat for hours.<br /><br />Realistic cinematography, with a good mix of panoramic shots and action close ups. It is a skilled, intelligent and moving film. well deserving of its accolades. The final twist is not gimmicky, but rather reflects the addictive effect that war has on some people, providing a tension and purpose that far suppasses anything in ordinary suburban life.<br /><br />Well done to everyone involved in the making of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Hard to fault this movie as it provides a very compelling portrait of the troops in Iraq, and with the use of hand-held 16 mm cameras certainly gives you the feeling of being there.  However, I found myself wondering why Bigelow chose to make this so exclusively a "boys' movie," with no significant women characters and little feeling for the Iraqis except for the empathy Sgt. Will James felt for young "Beckham."<br /><br />Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00096S45I">Gunner Palace</a>, The Hurt Locker is one for the soldiers serving in combat.  She takes you into their world, and makes you see Iraq through their eyes.  In this case, we follow a "bomb squad" as they defuse land mines around Baghdad and in one compelling scene venture into the desert where they come across some private contractors and soon find themselves under fire by insurgents.<br /><br />If you are looking for more in this "war movie" you will probably be disappointed as Bigelow chose to make this movie politically non-partisan, based more or less on Mark Boal's "embedded" stories from 2004, when he was a journalist in Iraq.  The movie lacks the inner struggle that is found in Chris Hedges' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400034639">War Is a Force that Gives Us Meaning</a> which she references at the start of her movie with the phrase, "war is a drug."</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>I know people are going to leave immature comments of like how dare you (insert here) boo hoo boo hoo boo hoo boo hoo wan wan. But I felt it was overrated & when I say overrated it doesn't mean it was bad. It had good characters it wasn't to cliche it had really strong scenes the movie does make you use your head I felt the adrenaline pump during the bomb defuseal scenes I really was like oh these guys are f****d during 1 of the shoot out scenes. There aren't a lot of female directors out there but it's nice to see a female director get her props I was entertained sure I was I just felt it was overrated to the max & it wasn't God awful like Halloween 2 I just saw it's just ok. IMO it's worth a rental nothing I'll go & buy right now maybe $5 in a bargain bin. If you just thought it was just the greatest movie ever it's fine I got some enjoyment out of it but it was over hyped it's my opinion. So to each there own.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>This is a great film and superbly directly.

This time around, Bigelow gives the viewer an inside view of the Iraq war with The Hurt Locker, which details the inner-workings of an Army bomb squad EOD unit, led by the newly transfered Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner) and rounded out by Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).  What could easily fall under the category of being "another war movie" is something that The Hurt Locker is certainly not, as Bigelow puts to use so many great moments of action, suspense, tension, and jaw dropping moments that you cannot help but admire the total package that the film winds up becoming.  Added to that are the performances from all the actors involved, with Renner in particular as the reckless, daredevil, freewheeling adrenaline-junkie soldier whose humanity manages to shine through; this is truly a star-making performance for the actor indeed.  There's cameo roles from Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, Evangeline Lilly, and David Morse as well; rounding out a surprisingly solid cast, but it's Mackie and definitely Renner that steal the show.  All in all, The Hurt Locker is by and far the finest war-related film to see the light of day in some time, and regardless of how you may feel about this particular film genre, missing this film is truly missing out on something special.  Maybe now Kathryn Bigelow will receive the credit and recognition that she has been deserving of all this time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, one of a scant few women directors in Hollywood, "The Hurt Locker" is the best film I've seen so far about the Iraq conflict. Categorized as a "war thriller", it centers on an elite US Army EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit and the dangers they encounter as they complete the final weeks of their year-long tour of duty. The film starts with a "cold open" (no credits or title card), throwing you right into middle of an IED defusal. We see three men engaging in playful banter while guiding a bomb disposal robot before a snag forces Thompson, the bomb tech (Guy Pearce), to attempt a manually defusal. The situation quickly escalates when Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) spots an insurgent holding a cellphone. Ordered by Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) to "burn him", Owen is paralyzed by fear and unable to pull the trigger, resulting in a detonation that kills Thompson.<br /><br />Top-flight bomb disposal expert Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is sent in as a replacement. Right away on their first mission, the team finds out that he is a reckless and impulsive loose cannon whose blatant disregard for operating procedures puts everyone's lives in danger. Over the course of the film, we see personality clashes develop, sometimes becoming violent, as J.T. and Owen accuse Will of endangering their lives for a high. Over time, however, J.T. comes to respect Will and the work he does. We see Will's intense dedication to his job and self-sacrifice in the face of overwhelming bodily peril.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes makes a brief appearance as the leader of a small group of British PMC's, as does a mustachioed David Morse, who is here for a short couple of minute as a loud and boisterous Colonel, mostly for comic effect.<br /><br />The Hurt locker is a gritty, muscular, and visceral viewing experience. Filmed in a jittery cinema veritee style, we get a sense of immediacy and closeness that few other films employing this technique have been able to match. Where it was nauseating in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCXGY">Cloverfield</a> or devoid of warmth in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QEHPR4">Public Enemies</a>, it is tastefully and masterfully done here. I was never distracted or taken out of a scene to remark on the camerawork. The style really works here and enhanced the immersion I felt, heightening the tension level and perception of realism. I felt my heart racing in many of the high-tension scenes not knowing what would happen next, not an easy task given how jaded I've become as a result of Hollywood movie-making. Without a doubt, "The Hurt Locker" is one of the most thrilling and suspenseful military dramas I've seen in a long time. I must also remark on the sound design and music. All of it came together and felt very natural, further adding to the production value and enjoyability of this film. Last, I must warn of some extreme gore, particularly one scene towards the end.<br /><br />Highly enjoyable and worth watching, especially if you enjoyed urban conflict films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G0O5N2">Black Hawk Down</a>. A must-own if you are a war film fan.<br /><br />About the Blu-ray disc itself:<br />The Hurt Locker is a 50GB Region A disc sporting an excellent transfer, but the extras are thin, with only a director's commentary, a 12 minute making-of documentary, and a 23 minute narrated slideshow. Subtitles are English (SDH) and Spanish only, with an additional Spanish audio track. Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is an action packed film that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The characters are propelled from one risky situation to the next without much of a break between. The film is about a bomb removal or disposal unit who must deal with the vast proliferation of IEDs set by the insurgents for our young soldiers. The fact that these IEDs are produced using diverted military supplies is beyond tragic incompetence.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner is superb as Sergeant James, a fascinating character who seems driven for many reasons to take outrageous risks when dismantling IEDs. He is contrasted with Sergeant Sanborn, the voice of reason and experience, which is highly annoyed by excessive risk taking. Most viewers would identify with Sergeant Sanborn's common sense in the face of ever changing risks. A third fellow, Specialist Eldridge, is also a character with whom many may identify, for he knows that war in Iraq had become insane and he struggles to mentally hold himself together under the stress.<br /><br />I found this film to be highly entertaining with a compelling story and realistic characters in challenging situations. I loved Black Hawk Down and found this film to be as good a film. A year in the life of a bomb disposal unit would be a terrible year for each day presented new life threatening situations, often ambiguous signals, and ever changing risks. When I read the other reviews, particularly those folks who gave the film low marks, I found that most of the complaints were highly technical and detail oriented. In other words, for the film to get it right, every detail about military operations must be exactly portrayed. I am not sure I agree with this since the essence of the film, the messages conveyed, seemed authentic and fair. The American soldiers were portrayed with a sense of fair play and balance. I actually found some of the negative reviews to be educational, particularly those reviewers who have served in Iraq and who had detailed criticism of various aspects of the film. But these same reviewers rarely concerned themselves with the underlying character development and sequence of events that came together in this portrayal of one slice of the war in Iraq.<br /><br />The film does an excellent job of conveying the almost impossible task our soldiers faced in a country undergoing a civil war and filled with insurgency. In civil war horrors are inflicted on citizens by citizens, as gruesomely conveyed in scenes in this film. When dealing with insurgency, it is impossible to tell if the man smiling at you is about to kill you, again as this film perfectly portrayed. The film also stays away from politics and political statements and it does this by focusing on the Iraqi people and settings and the American soldiers and their predicaments. In actuality, this made more of a moral and ethical statement than any political statement could make.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like this movie. And I did.  The performances were strong, the direction was decent, the script had some kinks but overall it worked for me.<br /><br />Now there will be a lot of Vets who will destroy this movie over technical stuff or just unbelievable plot turns.  I could even add my own: you don't key a radio next to a bomb.  Never.  When the bomb tech holds his radio up to the unfortunate Iraqi forced to wear a suicide vest, I cringed.  You don't do that.  No cell phones or radios.  Ever.  "You're 10-2."  Ka Boom.<br /><br />But it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me.  And any movie that tries to show what our soldiers are going through is always a good thing (unless, of course, it's JARHEAD, which I didn't see but read the blistering review in the New York Post by a furious Iraqi Veteran).<br /><br />It takes a while but the characters start to emerge and you like the three guys the film focuses on.  Especially the "wild man" who discovers the one thing in life he loves.  Excellent actors like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce make appearances.  And some sequences are very well edited for maximum suspense.<br /><br />Another thing that hurt this film: Hollywood politics.  Kathryn Bigelow, the director, beat her ex-husband James Cameron (AVATAR) for Best Director. I knew that was going to happen.  In a business where powerful men (like Cameron) who dump wives for younger women (like Cameron) deserve to have their comeuppance, Hollywood-style.  That dynamic, I believe, diminishes Bigelow's win.  Sadly.  Yes, it was about time a woman was honored for Best Director, but Hollywood's zeal for drama and their taste for revenge sullied her win.  It will always be there.<br />I'm not saying she didn't deserve it...I just wish it had been under different circumstances.<br /><br />So I liked the cast, loved some sequences.  I will appreciate any film where our boys are heroes.  So check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>When it comes to war movies, alot of the good ones are about WWII and Vietnam.

Also, you don't have to be a huge war movie fan to enjoy this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>This is not my favorite movie genre, but I will say it is a well-made movie.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker was directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) and written by Mark Boal. It stars Jeremy Renner as Sgt. William James, a team leader for a bomb squad stationed in Iraq. The other members of his team are Sgt. JT Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie and Spc. Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty. The story takes place over a 39 day period where Bravo company is waiting to be relieved so they can go home.<br /><br />This movie's directing is fantastic. The terrifying suspense that builds over time with each bomb wondering if it will be someone's last bomb to attempt to defuse. The terrain, heat, and dust were so well captured, they were making ME thirsty! Emotionally, the life and death situation these soldiers were put into everyday really messed with their psyche and perception of their mortality. James is a wildman, fearless to just jump into any situation recklessly, Sanborn tries his best to keep everyone safe but is afraid of commitment and getting too close to a woman back home, and Eldridge is getting therapy from a Colonel because he so intensely feels the strain that every day he might die.<br /><br />The actors very clearly defined their characters. All were well developed with layers in their performance, not all bravado or all fear. They just worked amazingly well as a unit. I have a hard time even singling out any of the three because as soon as I attribute something to one in my head, I remember something else one of the others did. Let's just say they handled the heavy burden of this movie incredibly well and I hope to see more from them in the future.<br /><br />One last note, turns out James' wife back home is Evangeline Lilly, Kate from LOST. My husband and James have something in common, if that was what they had to come home to, they'd be bored too, haha. We're not Kate or Jack fans. We are fans of Locke and Ben and Hurley!</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>The Hurt Locker<br />Each year there is a movie that becomes the favorite of the critics and Hurt Lockers is this year's critical darling.<br />The movie is about the Explosive Ordinance Disposal squad and their routine in Iraq as they go about dismantling IEDS and defusing bombs from potential suicide bombers. This movie follows the three main characters around Iraq and the difficulties of performing well in an environment when one does not know who are the enemy and a friend; the movie was actually shot in Jordan and their daily life. Some are dying to get out of here but the main character Sgt James is absolutely devoted to his job. Note the scene towards the end when he is absolutely clueless in his civilian life while he struggles in the cereal aisle or his conversation with his son and his wife. The movie tries to offer us more glimpses in the life of the two other soldiers but only offers glimpses. Although their job is to keep others same, Sgt James in his zeal and bravado sometimes jeopardizes the life of his companions. Hurt Locker refers to the box kept by Sgt. James which has all the trigger mechanisms of the bombs he has defused.<br /><br />At times or rather the entire movie has the feel of a documentary but without a doubt the action scenes especially the fire fight and the several bomb defusing scenes have been shot extremely well. Congrats to the camera man and his assistants. The tension is nail biting and translated well to the screen. It shows us the service the men of the Army are doing for us and a standing ovation to these brave men. The movie deserves a look because it is probably one of the first movies that I have seen that does not politicize the movie; the other one was Taking Chance (read my review) There is a lot to recommend about the movie but characters have been half baked and the story line thin. A lot of big name stars are in this film Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pierce and Evangaline Lilly but blink and you miss them.<br />This year it is a classic battle of the exes i.e. James Cameroon and Kathyrn Bigelow, I place my bets on Avataar. I gave it three stars. 02/05/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is a decent film with a persuasive performance by Jeremy Renner in the lead, but long after it has convinced us of its central premise ("war is a drug") it keeps pounding the point home, leading to a running length that feels padded and several moments in which the pace slows to a crawl; I *wanted* to like this movie as much as everyone else but aside from the opening and closing action sequences it lacks tension and is certainly not the best film of 2009.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>wow.just finished watching this film about an hour ago,and i'm still trying to put it into words.it's basically about an elite military bomb squad unit in Iraq,whose job is made tougher because they are still very much in a combat situation.this a very powerful moving experience.riveting right to the last frame.nail biting suspense.great acting.sometimes the quite moments speak louder and more clearly than any words can.the movie is very well constructed.its all so eloquent,like a poem,a ballet.the running time may just be shy of one hundred and thirty minutes,but it sure doesn't feel that long.i could watch this film again without hesitation.war themed movies are not everyone's cup of tea obviously,but if you are a fan of the genre,you owe it to yourself to check this film out.i haven't seen a film this good in a long time.for me,The Hurt Locker is a 5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Every year there comes a little film that blows audience and critic alike out of their seat.  These movies are often unheard of until a viewer sees the first theatrical trailer, or is told by a friend that they should give it a try.<br /><br />For 2009 that little film was the Iraq set military drama entitled `The Hurt Locker' directed by Kathryn Bigelow (ex-spouse of the infamously hard-headed, yet incredibly profitable special effects director, James Cameron who this same year broke his own record set by Titanic in 1997 with his 3D eye candy Avatar).  This film about a SSG William James (marvelously portrayed by Jeremy Renner) is a war film unlike any to be made before it.<br /><br />Sergeant First Class William James is out of place in Iraq.  He is a rebel in a system that requires precision as well as cooperation.  Perceived as a lone wolf with a death wish James suits up each day and constantly berates the advice and orders of those around him.  For William James this isn't a job: it's his life.  He doesn't fear dying in a ball of flame because that's what gets him off.  James has developed a truly unique addiction as his squad mates soon discover.<br /><br />William James is addicted to adrenaline; the thrill of knowing that at any moment he could be scattered in a thousand different places.<br /><br />Naturally this film contains multiple teeth chattering moments involving bomb diffusion, but I'm actually hesitant to call this masterpiece a "war film" because war surprisingly has little to do with the plot of the film.  Never once does this film decide to preach about moral of troops, brotherhood amongst soldiers, or even the politics behind the controversial war in Iraq.  `The Hurt Locker' is 100% self-contained and finely focused on its protagonist with Iraq being treated as the backdrop; no more, no less.  In my opinion a "war film" will focus on those issues, but The Hurt Locker doesn't even seem to acknowledge those archetypes.<br /><br />Bigelow directs the film in a manner that only a woman could possibly manage.  Gritty and dark, yet on the same time lapsing into what is clearly fiction The Hurt Locker is a delicate ballet of a constantly changing perspective.  While at times it strives for realism at others it will lapse into action movie style themes...but this is in no way a flaw with this movie.  The way I see this is that William James is an addict to adrenaline and the army is his dealer.  What the audience sees is war from the addict's point of view which of course makes war out almost as if it were a fantasy for James...except for the occasionally lapses in his addiction when he is forced to face the reality of his situation.<br /><br />Needless to say, this talented woman has come a LONG way since working with Keeanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break.<br /><br />The pacing of The Hurt Locker is almost like the beating of a heart, which meshes well with the nerve rattling subject matter.  Bigelow pulls every string to make the style of this film mix with its subject material while at the same time allowing it to become an enjoyable action peace with some of the most suspenseful scenes in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Already many people are complaining about the realism of this movie; choosing to compare it to films such as `Black Hawk Down', `Saving Private Ryan', and even `Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket'.  Not surprisingly the people who try comparing The Hurt Locker to these Grade-A war films is like comparing apples to...watermelons.  It is absurd to compare The Hurt Locker to actual war films because The Hurt Locker belongs in an entirely separate genre.<br /><br />While those films are directly relating to war (politics, whether war is good or bad, brotherhood of soldiers, etc...) The Hurt Locker is a character study solely focused on a single individual who suffers from an addiction.  The fact that he's a U.S. Soldier serving in Iraq is irrelevant to the heart of this film.<br /><br />Face it folks, we won't see a war film that analyzes the nature of the Iraq war until U.S. troops have entirely pulled out because until then it's too hard to look over all the facts because things are still happening.  Don't come in looking for the `Apocalypse Now' of Iraq films because you'll not find anything like it until the conflict has been resolved and we've had a few years to recollect on its events.<br /><br />As it stands, The Hurt Locker is without a doubt the best film of 2009 with an amazing performance from Jeremy Renner and expert direction by Kathryn Bigelow.  I feel that people may not understand it now, but much like Apocalypse Now, or any of Stanley Kubrick's films I believe that this will be a film that the public shall look back on as being something unforgettable.<br /><br />Thankfully the Academy managed to see The Hurt Locker's value upon release instead of making a decision they would have regretted ten years from now.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>The thing I thought was really excellent about this was the editing.  Notice how as things are getting tenser, the cuts become quicker?<br /><br />Seems to capture what I imagine to be a characteristic of life in an EOD team, and in war generally:  nail-biting tension as you think something's going to happen, then nothing happens.  Then, no tension, then something unexpected happens.  Rarely do expectation and reality seem to converge.<br /><br />After watching this, danged if you don't feel like you were embedded in a sapper group in Iraq for a couple of weeks!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was stunned last night to see this movie receive at least two major Oscars:  directing and picture.  Holy cow!  What a shame:  though no big fan of the anti-American "Avatar," that film was a lot better than this.  This one had forgettable characters and what little plot there was was confusing.  It was an underdog at the Oscars.  But the thing often forgotten about underdogs is that they're underdogs for a reason:  they're usually correctly perceived as inferior.  This is a movie I would never dream of seeing again, yet it won those Oscars!?  Reminds me a bit of 1977:  "Annie Hall" won for Best Picture, but that movie is forgotten now.  "Star Wars," like "Avatar," went home with only a couple of technical Oscars.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>WELL, here we are in affluent suburbia 2 1/2 kids a wife with implants and mortgaged up to our whazzis ....and then THIS comes along .................total exploitation - nowhere near the real thing, and being politically correct [wince] UGH - best picture of the year.<br /><br />YES, we have read incessantly HOW the poor [spoiled on Evian] crew toiled to make this "statement"<br /><br />Get over it ....the rest is downhill - besides who will care by 2026?<br /><br />UPDATE ~ Now we find out that this is a highly fictionizised vrsion of what the men really go through to protect their kin ~ typical Hollywood mogul greed - exploitation.... remember GREEN BERET with Duke?

There is nothing glamorous about being an EOD but 'Hurt Locker' is determined to give these soldiers the Hollywood treatment. Hence, one might come to the conclusion that there IS something exciting and glamorous about being a member of an EOD squad.<br /><br />SSgt. William James is more like a Mel Gibson loose cannon character from the Lethal Weapon series than a disciplined professional performing a difficult but routine job. Hollywood loves these loose cannon types but such a type does not really fit as a member of an EOD squad. Common sense will tell you that no EOD squad member would try and disarm an IED by going right up to it and cutting the wires with a plier. The bombs are always disposed of from a distance (as shown in the first scene with a robot--before it breaks down) so as not to endanger any soldiers or civilians in the vicinity.<br /><br />Quite a number of people who liked this movie felt there were too many 'quibblers'--that movies are not supposed to be 100% accurate. That's true but there should be a modicum stab at realism, especially when attempting to depict the gritty reality of the Iraq War. When an insurgent attempts to blow up a car loaded with bombs (without also trying to take out the soldiers at the scene) that seems a bit far-fetched. But to make matters worse, the car doesn't blow up even though it's totally on fire. But instead of letting the car burn (which might lead to an eventual explosion), SSgt. James puts the fire out and then disarms the bomb himself, wasting precious time and putting himself and his comrades in harms way.<br /><br />The EOD Squad seems to go everywhere outside their base without an escort. That would never happen in the real Army. What's more, most Army movies have interesting superior officers but not here. There's one good scene where a gung ho Colonel congratulates James for his loose cannon exploits but he's only on for a minute. There is also the Shrink who wants to see what's in like out in the field. Again, without an escort, he ends up the easy victim of an IED.<br /><br />The point is made that James becomes more and more unhinged as he is on the verge of completing his tour of duty. After he finds a boy dead after being tortured in a bomb factory, he mistakes him for another boy who sold DVD's to him in a marketplace. Wholly inappropriately, he kidnaps a merchant from the marketplace who he suspects of tipping off insurgents. Without regard to the consequences, he forces the merchant to drive into town and give him the name of someone who might have given the boy up. He even tells the merchant to wait for him while he goes into the house of an innocent Iraqi family but of course the merchant drives off. The whole pointless enterprise is resolved when the man's wife hits him and he runs out with a huge welt on his forehead. What's more, no one reports James when he returns, even though he's stopped and searched by sentries at the entrance to the base.<br /><br />Things get even more bizarre when James and his fellow EOD squad members are ordered to investigate a tanker explosion in the 'Green Zone' (how a tanker could get into the Green Zone, the most heavily protected area of Baghdad, I have no idea). Anyway, James gets the idea that this was not the work of a suicide bomber but a remote detonation near the scene of the explosion. Without a clue as to who might have been behind the crime, James orders the squad into an adjoining neighborhood where they (implausibly) split up and search for the faceless perpetrators. One of his guys is almost kidnapped but is saved only after James kills the bad guys but ends up shooting his EOD buddy in the leg. Again, James never gets into trouble for his antics and the whole incident never seems to be reported to his superiors.<br /><br />Despite the implausibility of many of the scenes, Hurt Locker still has enough action scenes to keep your interest. The depiction of the different kinds of explosive devices the insurgents keep coming up with seems pretty convincing (they even go as far as booby trapping the body of a boy they recently tortured and killed). While pure Hollywood hokum, the denouement, where James attempts to save an Iraqi man who has changed his mind about being a suicide bomber, is pretty exciting (again, no EOD squad member would be allowed to try and save a man in that position since such actions could jeopardize everyone's lives at the scene).<br /><br />While it appears that the film's scenarist did a modicum of homework finding out what's it like to be an EOD member in Iraq, he had little success in developing his characters. The interplay between James and Sgt. Sanborn was clich&eacute;d at the beginning, with the conservative Sanborn attempting to keep the wild James in check. Later the conflict dissipates and the relationship devolves into a flaccid buddy flick where the characters are reduced to enjoying themselves by punching each other in the stomach. The shaky hand-held camera technique gives the picture a documentary feel and the dialogue at times seems amateurishly improvised.<br /><br />Although Hurt Locker has been classified as an 'indie' film, it's really a traditional Hollywood picture. While HL doesn't shrink from showing the horrors of war, the protagonist, James, is the typical gung ho American hero that John Wayne would have probably loved. I am willing to forgive Hurt Locker for its implausible moments but sadly there isn't enough conflict generated between the principals to qualify as true art house fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`The Hurt Locker' looks at a bomb disposal squad during the Iraq war as they go about diffusing various roadside bombs and evade various traps and battles. It has plenty of tension throughout and the use of slow motion cinematography heightens the impact of some of the scenes, as bombs kick up dust, debris and spent gun cartridges cartwheel end over end. By the end this tension has made you see the war from the soldiers perspective a little more and you start to understand their outlook on danger and fighting, even if it makes you further question the involvement in Iraq. The typically gung ho American persona grates initially, but this soon fades as you become more involved in the film. You can see why this won the Oscar and the direction is very impressive and this ranks highly in films made so far about the Iraq war. If the Iraq war is going to spawn as many films as Vietnam did, then this is a decent enough addition to the genre. To be honest this isn't as good as I'd hoped, especially after all the hype (although it is a fairly decent film), and I can understand some of the apathy towards it, but as far as war films go this is very good and worth a viewing at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>It's hard when you wind up sweeping all film awards in a particular year.  It is almost guarantied that you are going to experience major backlash.  It seems that that has happened for the surprise juggernaut that was `The Hurt Locker' (seriously, who the heck saw that coming).  The film is not experiencing the same criticisms that so many other `Best Picture' winners have received in the past (just look at the films average rating on this very site).<br /><br />No, `The Hurt Locker' is not perfect.  In fact, I don't think it should have won the Oscar, even considering the Academy's underwhelming lineup (the film, while VERY good, is not better than Tarantino's masterpiece).  That said; this film is deserving of the praise and certainly undeserving of the backlash.<br /><br />The film centers around a bomb diffuser named William James.  James is a wild one.  He needs to feel the adrenaline rush of near death that so many in his company want to avoid.  He is not afraid of danger.  William gets moved into a new squad when their former leader is killed in the line of duty.  William is unlike anything this squad has seen before, and he almost instantly gets under their skin (but not in a good way).  They have just barely over a month together, but in that month the three main characters (Will, Sanborn and Specialist) undergo many emotional changes.<br /><br />Like most have already noted, this is not a war movie.  It reminds me in a way of Sam Mendes' underappreciated `Jarhead' in that it's main focus is on the men serving and not the service they perform.<br /><br />So, I have a few squabbles with the film.  For me, war movies run a very sharp risk of becoming one note and redundant.  `The Hurt Locker' falls into that department at times.  It becomes almost repetitive in the situations these men find themselves.  Yes, there are differences, but they can run themselves together.  It isn't as present a problem as in some other films, but it is there (for me at least).  I also had some issues with the films handling of the `Beckham' (when you see the film you'll know what I mean).  When Will goes out of his way to find the men `responsible' for what he fears has happened it adds depth to his character but it kind of takes you out of the film a bit.  It just appears far too unrealistic for me.  The final scenes also have that feeling (would three soldiers really do that?) but they fare better because of the emotional turmoil and ending revelations they stir up (that clothed shower scene is FLAWLESS).<br /><br />The films actual ending also felt a little `obvious', which I didn't care for.<br /><br />I know it seems like I'm picking on this film a lot, but really, when taken in perspective these issues are small.  The film is gritty and earnest.  Sure, it has moments where the honesty seems stretched a tad thin, but the character never feel anything short of sincere and real.  The film is visually stunning and completely tuned into the adrenaline rush running through Will's body.  The relationship that builds between the three main characters is engaging and it breathes reality.  While I found some moments to feel a tad `preachy' (I wasn't fond of the repartee between Specialist and his counselor) I also appreciated that the film took an obvious step `away' from being a `message' film.  It just let you dwell in that world and decide for yourself what your really think.<br /><br />Let's talk about Jeremy Renner.  What a brilliant performance.  Yes, he made it seem really easy (so it wasn't `wow look at me act' kind of brilliant) but that's what made it so brilliant.  It was honest.  Every smirk or hand gesture or sideways glance was completely lived in and real.  You never once doubted him and his commitment and his needs and his motives.  He wore everything on his sleeve, but not in the `obvious' way in which some actors approach a character.  He felt like you and me and everyone you know.  Anthony Mackie delivers his best performance to date.  I have an issue with him as an actor because he seems to play a variation of the same character in every film (or he at least brings the same facial expressions to every performance) but he actually develops Sanborn in a way that feels sincere.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the slew of cameos from greats like Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes were highly appreciated.<br /><br />In the end this film is well worth your time.  It really works on many levels.  Sure, it isn't perfect (and `near-perfect' is even a stretch really) but it is forgivably flawed thanks to many elements (not the least of which was Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic direction...so much developed tension) that work just right.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The Hurt Locker presents the conflict in the Middle East from the perspective of those who witnessed the fighting firsthand the soldiers. As an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team tactfully navigates the streets of present-day Iraq, they face the constant threat of death from incoming bombs and sharp-shooting snipers. In Baghdad, roadside bombs are a common danger. I have a friend that is EOD, and he and I watched this movie, he said that while this movie is a bit of a far cry as to how they really operate, it's still a really entertaining movie. He said military guys know, you can't exactly go rogue too many times, because the hammer of authority will come down upon you. The constant threat of dying, hot and heavy bomb suits, the robots, the tempermental personalities in conflict with one another, strained lives back home, and silly officers who filter into a situation with the idea of taking charge yet have no idea what's going on, now that is entirely true to life. But it makes for a good story. The acting is really quite good and the directing is awesome. For those who like military movies or just action movies, this one is a good.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Set in the Iraq War, the movie is based on first hand observations of Mark Boal, who was embedded with a special bomb unit in Iraq.<br /><br />The story focuses on Staff Sergeant James, (Jeremy Remer) head of an elite squad of soldiers with a mission to protect and save by disarming bombs of all kinds.  It is not easy and the war zone is full of terrorists, assassins, suicide bombers homemade/improvised bombs.<br /><br />In 2004, Staff Sergent James takes over the squad after they lost their team leader on a mission.  When James takes over he does not follow the military rules and protocol.  He gets the job done and is recognized as "wild" by a superior who asks how many bombs he has disarmed.  The only part of the movie that did not ring true was when he said "843 bombs disarmed"  - that did not seem realistic, when the margin of error is zero and the variety of bombs.  The bomb team has only 38 days left in their tour of Iraq and the count-down of days on the screen show situation after ungodly situation where their lives are a hair breath away from death.  The movie holds your attention with deep emotional intensity and action packed scene after scene.  We finally come to understand why Jeremy flirts with death - to feel alive.  A regular life is boring and unmeaning to him.<br /><br />The filming is realistic and it clearly shows the hot, dry, dreary, primitive conditions the soldiers deal with.  The rigors of fighting a half world away, far from the luxuries of home are clearly defined.  After watching you respect even more the psychological, physical and human sacrifice American soldiers face.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>THE HURT LOCKER won best picture for 2009, after my six art house friends and I saw it. There is nothing extraordinary about THE HURT LOCKER, which is the least-viewed "Best Picture" in history, a kind of reminder that "Best Pictures" don't equate to "Most Popular Pictures."<br /><br />It's the story of a US Army bomb-defusing specialist in Iraq, and the various horrors he faces unflinchingly throughout the day. As such, its a grand endorsement of our troops and a grand indictment of our war.<br /><br />Still, I have no idea why THE HURT LOCKER won, other than it wasn't the bloated AVATAR. From what I've read it isn't particularly accurate, and it has a pace slower than that of its hero in his blast suit. It's worth seeing (once), but its not at all memorable.

That aside, the film sold itself on stress, which I'm sure I can't imagine what wartime is really like, but I do know it takes more than stress to convey a compelling story.  While the technical aspects and direction of the film were impressive, the acting wasn't anything to write home about.  It's clear that this film got a lot of attention due to its timeliness and controversy.  It's not because it was that great.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>HURT LOCKER, THE<br /><br />STARRING: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Mark Boal<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Kathryn Bigelow<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 26 June 2009<br /><br />It pains me to say that I missed The Hurt Locker in theaters. On my first viewing of the film, I remember enjoying it but thinking it was not worthy of the Oscar for best picture over Up in the Air, Avatar or Inglourious Basterds. Having seen it recently for a second time that feeling remains intact; but now I can proudly consider it worthy of its place among the top five best films of 2009. If you haven't yet seen it, you seriously need to.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker holds a place dear to me on a few personal levels. The first being that it is an independent film (a world that I myself am entering into); and the second is that its story centers on soldiers fighting in the Middle East (something of which I have experience in).<br /><br />Jeremy Renner earns his first of two Oscar nominations as Sergeant James; an EOD bomb tech who is a little too proud of his work ethic for the comfort of his comrades. And for those of you who aren't familiar with the term EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), they are an elite group of soldiers whose sole mission is to find and disarm bombs. And I'll give you another one up front: an IED is an improvised explosive device. The story takes place back in a 2004 Baghdad, Iraq.<br /><br />After their bomb tech is killed in an explosion, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are awarded with a new one: Sergeant James. Eldridge and Sanborn had a good thing going, they work by the book, and they're but a few weeks shy of going home.<br /><br />So when James comes into the picture with his carefree tactics and cocky attitude; they are a little on edge. That James is efficiently skilled and gifted at what he does only makes matters worse for all three of them; because James is very aware that he posses these skills, and takes great joy in the adrenaline rush they reward him with.<br /><br />Sanborn and James butt heads from the get-go and Sanborn quickly realizes his last few weeks are going to be among his longest. Imagine working with someone who is very good at what they do, but their cockiness is sure to get you and them fired, and they don't seem to be the least bit concerned. Now amp up the volume on that little scenario by replacing the word fired with the word killed.<br /><br />James smokes frequently (even when handling dangerous explosive materials), he's all too eager to get his hands dirty when the situation doesn't necessarily call for it, and he doesn't seem to have much to live for other than the thrill of the job. And he likes to take his time when defusing these bombs, regardless of the fact that his team, himself included, are completely in the open and could be killed at any moment. The sheer fact that they are there to begin with, alerts massive suspicion to the townspeople.<br /><br />As nuts as this may seem, ask yourself if you were holding security for someone defusing a bomb; if you'd like that person to be as comfortable as possible when doing so. This is James' take on his work ethic, and it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />One thing you have to understand about the conflicts in the Middle East, whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan; the battlefield is everywhere. There is no safe point or zone; some are safer than others, sure. There is no one outside the wire you can fully trust: the enemy could be anyone, anywhere at any time, and they don't play by the rules. Harmless seeming objects such as cell phones, video cameras, and even kites, all have the potential of being tools of deadly destruction over there.<br /><br />The film rides on suspense driven scenes of: A. a guy defusing a bomb; and B. his security team surrounded by people who may want to kill them, may have the means to do so, and may be directly responsible and capable of detonating that very bomb. If that doesn't make for a good thriller, then I don't know what would.<br /><br />The Academy Award winning screenwriter (Mark Boal) spent time in Baghdad with a real EOD team and the film proves it. He nailed every detail from the soldier favorite juice boxes, to the Military jargon, to the shocking realization of just how far these people are willing to go to hide their IEDs in innovative ways.<br /><br />His goal here was not to make a big Hollywood action movie, but to tell a good story, and to stay true to the men and women who serve by keeping the film believable. There are a few Hollywood moments in the film for sure, but every single thing that happens could realistically happen in real life; maybe not to the same three guys, but hey.<br /><br />Mark's efforts are only matched perfectly by director Kathryn Bigelow who also won the Oscar for directing. They could have taken this project to a major studio who would have given them millions of dollars to film it in Arizona or Nevada. But instead they sought out investors overseas and filmed the movie independently and properly in the Middle East; and their hard work and commitment has paid off. There are six little shiny gold men resting on glamorous shelves somewhere, to prove it.</p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>When I pushed PLAY, I expected to be as spellbound as others who had seen this movie and reported the drama here on Amazon. With such high expectations, the only way to go is usually south, and that's what it did.<br /><br />The acting of Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie make them first-class Thespians. They play the part of non-commissioned officers who are in the Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal, or EOD. It is evident that SSG James finds the adrenaline rush of outsmarting bomb makers and defusing their work. He tempts fate like the matador who moves ever closer to the horns of the bull. He removes his helmet and other life-saving equipment meant to protect him in case of a bomb blast. It looks like he is about to lose his sanity when we are exposed to a scene revealing his humanity, which I will not expound upon. It would be giving away too much of the story.<br /><br />The most effective part of the movie is his return to family life and the mundane chores expected of a husband and family man. There is no excitement in removing the leaves that are blocking the drainage trough at the roof. As an EOD expert, he had to make split-second decisions that could have cost him his life or that of his comrades, yet he looks utterly confounded by the cereals in the aisle when his wife asks him to get one. This is one thing that is not talked about when it comes to veterans returning home. Many will have experienced awesome levels of responsibility for men and materiel that cannot be duplicated in civilian life, and it can be a sudden and tremendous letdown for the ego.  How SSG James deals with this dilemma becomes obvious by the end of the film.<br /><br />If a film spends so much time trying to get into the heads of soldiers under the constant strain of combat, the rest of the surroundings should be equally realistic. This was sloppily addressed with the wrong uniforms, insignia, improper military courtesy, and lack of vehicle markings.  Leaving their posts to chase insurgents with flashlights was appallingly stupid. But what I wondered most about was this "autonomous team."  They seemed to be more rogue than Sarah Palin, and I began to wonder if they reported to anyone or selected their missions by themselves. If I had been stationed there as an EOD and had my choices, I would have spent my whole tour at the compound's Subway, Baskin-Robbins, or the movie theater.<br /><br />I would like to say this film was a real blast, but it was much closer to a dud. The movie just didn't go off for me.<br /><br />I have now seen it, and that is enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>This is what Hollyweird thinks of as authentic.

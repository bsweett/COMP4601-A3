It made me laugh more than most contemporary comedies, but it always felt completely disposable.  After the "The Spy Who Shagged Me", I felt annoyed that so many of the same jokes had been recycled.  Now, you've gone and done it again with "Goldmember".  Here, jokes that proved popular in the first two movies are given a third turn through the ringer, and the results, for the most part, are uncomfortable and undignified.  To your credit, you recognize that the same turf is being covered, but the references you make to this self-awareness come across more like excuses than meta-humour.  Example: The third entry into the Zip-it/Pshhh canon was totally incomprehensible.  What exactly was this little scene about?  Scott's realization that he's about to go down the same path for the third time -- along with his resulting ennui -- doesn't quite save the scene like you'd like it; rather, it should have served as a warning call to you, the screenwriter, that the joke is tired and maybe you should just let it sleep.  Or, better yet, pull the plug.  The second moment of self-awareness, which contains one of the film's many celebrity cameos, felt tacked on and pointless.  Thankfully, as the story gets revved up, and the demand on your audience's attention is at a premium, you give up this practice.<p>Which is not to say that the story was at all comprehensible, even with an attentive audience.  One scene followed another without any notion of coherence.  From what I can tell, the story revolved around Austin having to save his father from an evil villain from the 1970's who was brought back to the year 2002 by another evil villain whose evil scheme is foiled and is sent to jail where he hatches an escape plan to... ugh!  I'm getting a headache.  If it were at all worthwhile trying to extract some logic from this tangled mess, then I'd give it the college try.  But I suspect that would be an exercise in futility.<p>I still haven't talked about your performance in the film, Mike.  Or, should I say, performances.  This whole multiple-role-playing schizophrenic acting style you've latched on to is just fine.  Alec Guinness did it.  Peter Sellers (one of your idols, I know) did it.  Even fellow SNL-alum Eddie Murphy has done it.  All with unquestioned success.  Mike, you have as much talent for characterization as any of these men, and I'm glad that you've found a vehicle for your talents.  The problem here is that what started as just two characters, and then three, has now become four.  You're spreading yourself way too thin, Mike.  You've left no room for the rest of your cast to shine.  I can't imagine why Robert Wagner or Mindy Sterling or Michael York bothered to show up for this film.  Besides loyalty, that is.  You give them nothing to do!  And what do you replace their screen time with?  The inane and idiotic title character.  Goldmember the man -- like "Goldmember" the movie -- has precious few funny moments.  The rest of his time on screen is humiliating: to the performers who must share the screen with him, to the audience who paid to watch this drivel, and to you, Mike, for debasing yourself.  When it comes to Austin himself -- who I always felt was one of the weaker characters in the series -- I ask you, Mike, please: TONE IT DOWN A SHADE!  Not every line reading needs to be punctuated with a purr or a "Yeah, baby!"  You're too smart to be this obnoxious.<p>(Here's where I throw in a compliment: Dr. Evil is, as always, a hilarious creation.  Too bad he's almost non-existent here.  There.  Palette cleansed.  Now, back to the vitriol.)<p>Despite all evidence to the contrary, there are other people in "Goldmember"s cast besides you, Mike.  Let's talk about them for a while.<p>The usual suspects (Wagner, York, Sterling, Troyer, Seth Green) are, as usual, quite suspect.  Green, to his credit, does not embarrass himself.  Which I can't say about the two top-billed newcomers.<p>Michael Caine is the perfect choice to play Austin's father.  Here he's like Alfie after an espresso binge, all manic motion and wild shenanigans.  But Caine doesn't emerge unscathed from this mess.  He's a man who has two Oscars and once shared equal billing with Sir Laurence Olivier... but you make him act a particularly humiliating scene with Verne Troyer!  Is this his karmic retribution for having appeared in "Jaws: The Revenge"?  Didn't the Steven Seagal movie he made take care of that?<p>Beyonce Knowles was in this movie.  I think.  She says "Shazam" a couple of times.  And she kept asking, "What's happening?"  And I think at one point she even said, "Shut your mouth".  Other than that, it was a totally unmemorable performance.  I thought the blandness that Heather Graham showed in "The Spy Who Shagged Me" could not be topped (or, bottomed), but Beyonce found a new low.  Still, she looks good in a cut off shirt, so that's at least one point in her favour.<p>In closing, let me just say this, Mike: You've made the most cynical movie of the year.  It pains me to say this, because in interviews you come across as an intelligent, creative, dignified man, with a lust for comedy and a yearning to create something new and different.  Time to put the old International Man of Mystery back in deep freeze, get back to the drawing board, and think up something new.<p>A once and future fan,<p>Mike</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>If you've seen the first two Austin Powers movies, then you can expect a similar brand of humor in this movie, whose title parodies 'Goldfinger'. The main female character in this movie replaces Felicity Shagwell in the previous film, and Mike Myers continues to play the triad of roles of Austin Powers, Doctor Evil, and Fat B------. This film isn't quite as tight as the first one, but it is still entertaining and worth watching if you like Austin Powers.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>After watching this third installment of the Austin Powers film series, one can't help but wonder how director Jay Roach can get by with using the same type of humor for three go-'rounds.  Well, the answer is simple: The characters are just too darn funny to get old!<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Goldmember" sees Austin Powers (Mike Myers) once again battling Dr. Evil (Myers), this time with 1970s "supervillain" Goldmember (Myers), a spoof of the classic James Bond villain Goldfinger, thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Once again, the same basic jokes and tone of humor is used in this effort, but it just never seems to get old in the least.  Plus, more of an actual storyline (dealing with "daddy issues") is present in this one than in its two predecessors.  New characters Nigel Powers (Michael Caine) & Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonce) also add a bit of spice to the cast.<br /><br />Overall, this film simply keeps the Austin Powers comedy ball rolling.  It may have slipped a tiny bit from "The Spy Who Shagged Me", but nowhere near enough to drop it a star ranking.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>I shouldn't find it as funny as I do, but I can't help but laugh so hard my sides ache every time I watch this film. The characters are so hilarious and there are so many of them that you find yourself laughing virtually non stop. Myers is so funny to watch and so original and ahead of the game in all he does. So many catchphrases have come from this movie it just shows how funny and in tune with viewers it is. Buy it, watch it and laugh so hard you'll cry!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>First two austin powers movies will go down in history and some of the funniest spoofs ever. But this one seems to have fallen inwith the other modern spoofs...theyre terrible. Avoid this and all the movies related to meet the spartans.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Dr. Evil and Mini-Me have somehow escaped from a maximum security prison and the duo team up with Goldmember. Together they formulate a plan for world domination. And this particular scheme requires a large amount of time-travel, and kidnapping Austin Powers' father, England's master spy, Nigel Powers. As Austin chases Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Goldmember through time, he stops in 1975 to "connect" with an old girlfriend, detective Foxxy Cleopatra, and requests her help to track the villains and save his father. I recommend you see this one. I found this movie hilarious and outrageous, with a lot of crude humor. Watch this movie if you love Austin Powers as there is plenty of energy.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery- I think this is a very funny movie. Mike Myers does an awesome job. Austin Powers is a 'sex symbol' of the 1960's and has himself frozen for 30 years, until his enemy Dr. Evil returns. He teams up with Vanessa Kensington, the daughter of his 1960s sidekick Mrs. Kensington. Can Austin defeat Dr. Evil again? I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY!!!<br /><br />Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me- This is an extremely funny sequel with plenty of gags and hilarious toilet humor! This time, Dr. Evil travels back in time when Austin was frozen, and steals his Mojo. Austin also travels back to 1969 to stop Dr. Evil from destroying the world, along the way he meets an incredibly beautiful spy named Felicity Shagwell, stops a miniature clone of Dr. Evil named Mini Me and much more. I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME!!!<br /><br />Austin Powers in Goldmember- This is a very funny sequel that brings closure to the trilogy! It has hilarious gags, and more awesome toilet humor! Austin's father, Nigel has been kidnapped, and Austin needs Dr. Evil's help to find him. He is told that a man named Goldmember has Nigel in the year 1975. When everthing goes smooth in the 70's, Goldmember comes back to our time and teams up with Dr. Evil to destroy the world. I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>If you liked Austin Powers, then you will like this movie.  But, it has some bad parts.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie was really good and funny. it's not as funny as the first one but still good</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Austin Powers in Goldmember is another great film in the shagadelic series. From the opening spoof AustinPussy one knows it's gonna be a great film. The jokes are on taregt , the script is witty and the cameos are great.Beyonce does a good acting job, despite what the critics said as her performances really just requires her to be eye candy. All in all a fun film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>This triple pack of Austin Powers includes all three movies and boy it's definitely worth the price. My favorite of the trilogy is the last one, Goldmember, that one is hilarious and has the most outlandish jokes. This is a great gift idea, a must-have. Buy it today!</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>What a shame,<br /><br />People embraced this franchise so much that we just had to love it to death.  The funniest moments in this movie are the cameo appearances of Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Spielberg and others...after that runs its course, not much is left.<br /><br />Someone else here says the outtakes are funnier than the movie itself, since they feature Mike Myers improvising.  I'm fulloy prepared to believe that.  Iron-poor blood otherwise dominates this effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>My daughter and her boyfriend invited me to watch this movie with them. I did so, somewhat reluctantly, as it was not the film I would have chosen, even though I had previously seen the two other Austin Powers films and enjoyed them. Well, am I ever glad that I did! It was, without a doubt, the funniest Austin Powers film to date.<br /><br />From the great opening scene to the surprise ending, replete with cameos by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito, the Ozzie Osbourne Family, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears, Burt Bacharach, Quincy Jones, Nathan Lane, Katie Couric, and John Travolta, the film is a laugh riot. Austin Powers (Mike Myers) still has his mojo amd, together with his gorgeous female sidekick de jour, Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), sets out to rescue his father, Nigel (Michael Caine), from the evil clutches of the notorious Dutchman, Goldmember (Mike Meyers). To do so, they must go back in time to 1975, the era of disco fever.<br /><br />Fans of Dr. Evil (Mike Myers), Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), Number Two (Robert Wagner), Scot Evil (Seth Green), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Basil (Michael York), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) will be happy to know that they are all back in this film. Mini-Me very nearly steals the show, and he does this without ever uttering a single word. Fred Savage joins the party as Number Three/The Mole and becomes a running sight gag throughout the film for reasons that will be obvious to the viewer.<br /><br />The only problem in the film is with the character of Goldmember. He is the weak link, as he is simply gross and not particularly funny. What was Mike Myers thinking? Notwithstanding the fact that the title character is pretty much of a zero, however, the film is still hilarious, overall. The plot, what little there is, primarily exists to set up a lot of sight gags, send ups, and a number of very funny scenes. If, however, scatological humor offends your sensibilities, this is definitely not the film for you. If you are not easily offended by the crude and the lewd, then this film will make you laugh up a storm.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I saw this in the theatre on opening day. Yet I din't understand it as much as i understood he first 2, but then again, I enjoyed it. Then i got it for Xmas the same year and I just watched it a couple days ago. This, I think, is the best outta all of them.<br /><br />STORY: In 2002, Austin is still shagadelic. He one time stops Dr. Evil's plan he had and is knighted by the queen of England... only to find his dad did not attend. Dissapointed by his fazha's(as GM says)failure to attend, He then stops by Dr. Evil's prison and is informed to go back to 1975 and rescue him. but then, a Dutch henchman named Goldmember kidnaps him, takes him back to 2002, and then Austin, and a chick named Foxxy Cleopatra meanwhile Dr. Evil escapes with Mini Me from prison, and start fresh on a sub going into Japan.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: Awesome! I liked how Fat Bastard has T**ts in this one. And HARD KNOCK LIFE from "Annie", thats hilarious!<br /><br />You should own all AP movies! Especially this!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>It's apparent from this film that Mike Myers is growing tired of the Austin Powers character.  However, there is still plenty of gas left in Dr. Evil's tank.  The partnership between Dr. Evil and Mini-Me(Vern Troyer) is still a laugh riot.  The film introduces neglectful daddy issues i.e. Austin's daddy (Michael Caine) always ignored him and Scott(Seth Green) is still trying to impress Dr. Evil.  Caine is reasonably funny here.  Beyonce Knowles is charming as Foxxy Cleopatra.  The opening scene of the film is classic with surprise cameos.  To the film's detriment the Goldmember character is just gross.  And more than the other films, Myers relies on too much toilet humor.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>The third and possibly last installment of the Austin Powers series pits England's favorite international man of mystery against his old nemesis Dr. Evil and his brand new partner Goldmember. The original Austin Powers grossed only $53 million but the movie became a cult favorite on video. New Line, the studio that produced the original, opted for a sequel. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, released in 1999, grossed $205 million by the end of its run. With that success, New Line was more then willing to pay Mike Myers $25 million to come up with another sequel to the hit comedy series. Will the third installment continue the tradition of being better then the last or will it follow the path of most sequels this year and be a piece of trash?<p>The story goes that Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, has finally captured his archenemy, Dr. Evil. But while Dr. Evil is in jail,?Nigel Powers, Austin's father, is kidnapped by Goldmember. Goldmember is an evil Dutch scientist from the 1970's who has a huge obsession with gold. The obsession is so big that he even had his privates turned into gold after an unfortunate smelting accident. When Dr. Evil escapes and plans the destruction of the world, Austin must team up with old flame Foxxy Cleopatra and save the world and his father.  The story for Austin Powers in Goldmember is well paced but much less so then Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. The film has tons of great moments within the course of the film but in between those moments the story slows greatly and for extended periods of time. It also gets a little confusing in the end with the involvement of Austin's family, which will not be revealed in this review, but it seems to work out. Some fans of the comedy series may be disappointed though by the revelations.<p>Mike Myers plays four characters this time in the new installment of the series. He portrays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastuard, and the title character, Goldmember. Myers seems to pay off with each of these characters except Goldmember. Goldmember seems to?be a pointless character and just plain?disguisting especially when he eats his own peeling skin. The character doesn't sound very Dutch and the Dutch jokes seem to be non-stop and annoying after some time. Some of the jokes may be a little offense to those that are Dutch but obviously this film was not intended to appeal to that kind of audience. Beyonce Knowles is one of the worst parts in Austin Powers in Goldmember. She is very attractive but the fact is that she is feels very out of place within the film. It's not her fault that her character isn't given many funny lines. Seth Green is even funnier as Dr. Evil's son especially when he decides to take over the family business. The baldness is scary but in a funny sort of way. Verne Troyer reprises his role as Mini-Me, the 1/8 sized clone of Dr. Evil, with many funny moments in the sequel. Most of the cameos in the film pay off greatly and are in perfect tune.<p>Overall, Austin Powers in Goldmember is better then the original but still not as funny as the first sequel. There were many things to pick at including the running time which seemed too short at only an hour and thirty-four minutes in length. Second, Beyonce Knowles is?neither great nor is she bad in this film but definitely feels out of place. Her '70's one liners begin to get tiresome?near the end of the film. Third, the film slows down for extended periods of time?before picking up again. This becomes annoying at keeping the audience interested. Most of the cameos worked very well but not all them. The Britney Spears cameo seemed very pointless. Though it suspected that she would end up being a Fembot, it just seemed like a cheap way for her to get into the film and be part of the soundtack for the film. The other cameos, though, are hilarious coming from Tom Cruise,?Steven Spielberg, Kevin Spacey, and Danny Devito especially in the opening ten minutes which are probably the best part in the entire film. Though the film isn't perfect, the entire experience is totally?unforgettable. This film may not appeal to?everyone since there is a huge amount of potty humor but most people will find something to giggle at. Not the best comedy of the year but still a funny diversion for the summer time blues.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>The Austin Powers series may go down as profitable but it will not reach the heights of the great comic films of all time.  There is so much one can do with phallic and other genitalia humor.  Also, flatulence jokes can only permeate the air for so long. References to the female's mammary glands can get &quot;dry&quot; after a while.<p>Maybe, for 14-year-old boys &quot;Goldmember&quot; is great art.  But, for the rest of us, it's a joke that wore out its welcome two films ago.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>I have always liked the Austin Powers movies, but this one, while still very funny, just did not leave me clutching my stomach from laughter pains. Don't get me wrong, this film is very funny at times and Mike Myers did an excellent job, but the addition of Beyonce Knowles and the gratuitous cameos made me think, &quot;Why are they doing that?&quot; <p>I still think that people should check out this film and judge it for themselves. It has it's moments where you're doubled over with laughter, but unfortunately those moments aren't as often as they have been in the past.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>"Austin Powers in Goldmember" is the third (and hopefully final) installment of the popular James Bond spoof series. The reason I say final is not because the movie is bad, but because it's so entertaining and works so hard to tie up all loose ends that a fourth movie would have little chance of topping it. This time around, Austin must stop Dr. Evil from melting the polar ice caps with a device known as "Preparation H." Along the way, he must travel through time, reconnect with an old girlfriend, reconcile with his father, and battle the insane Goldmember. <p>Part of what makes "Goldmember" work is that there is some semblance of a plot this time around. While the plot is still just an excuse to string together gags, it manages to reference events from the other movies, the Austin Powers mythos, and even toss is a few twists in the ending. Yes, the emotional revelations are played for laughs, but they resonate just enough to give a sense of purpose to the adventure, something that was missing from "The Spy Who Shagged Me." The acting is top notch. Mike Myer's ability to play four distinct characters is impressive, and Goldmember is highly memorable. Beyonce Knowles gives energy and personality to Foxxy Cleopatra, and Seth Green and Verne Troyer continue to develop their characters. Michael Caine, in his limited screentime, is hilarious as Austin's father. <p>Of course, the series depends on its gags, and while not everything is funny, enough of it is that the ... bits don't matter. Thankfully, the screentime of a certain obese character has been toned down, along with most of the jokes involving body fluids. What we have left are clever perspective tricks, musical numbers, shadow play, a funny subtitles joke, parodies within parodies, and lots of celebrity cameos. All in all, while "Goldmember" doesn't have the originality of the first film, it comes in a very close second.<p>While the audio and video for the disc are both top-notch, I have to say the supplements disappointed me. New Line's infinifilm concept does nothing for me - it's a glorified version of the "follow the white rabbit", "007 logo", and countless other extended branching play options on other DVDs. What's worse is that it forces the extras to broken down into several little tidbits that aren't as long as they should be. Goldmember definitely had enough extras for a 2-disc treatment, and use of Infinifilm meant stuff was left out (including the Liz Hurley/Heather Graham deleted scenes). Other than that, this DVD is still highly entertaining and worth picking up for Austin Powers fans.</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>Mike Myers is a comic genius.  This movie lives on the experience of Austin Powers. His new character is great. If you like the other two movies then you will love this one.  Watch it with some other people and watch it more than once.  After a couple of times you will pick up on jokes.  Many people hated this movie because they never caught the jokes.  Mike Myers comedy is a mixture of Mel Brooks, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray.  His movies won't even make any top 100 AFI lists but they make you laugh. Now the DVD is great.  The picture is bright and clear.  The sound is also very good.

Austin Powers is back, and as funny as ever.  This movie features non-stop laughs that will have you rolling on the floor.  I swear, what they said is right about how it has more laughs in one minute than some whole films (Zoolander!).  Okay, I'll admit that the story is pretty nonexistant (there is some nonsense about a satellite and a meteor), but we don't go to Austin Powers movies for the plot, we go for the jokes, and this one has some killers.  I especially enjoyed the opening credits scene with all the celebrity cameos.  Dr. Evil (my hero) is funnier than ever, though its Mini-Me who really steals the show.  Fat Bastard, while crude and gross, has his share of laughs.  But we can't forget Austin himself, now with his father Nigel.

There are even a couple of twists in the plot to keep it interesting.<p>I really liked this movie, but there are two objections I had to it.  First, I don't like the character of Foxxy Cleopatra.  There just wasn't any chemistry there.  Second, I think some of the jokes are getting a little bit old (like Dr. Evil asking for ransom money and telling Scott to shut up).

I was so sick and tired of hearing that strongly annoying voice on the radio and people shoving that DC krap in my face. <p>However my expectations were completely blown away and Goldmember turned out to be my favorite of the Austin Powers saga. <p>The jokes that dominated the first two flicks are continued in the third installment of the bunch. Austin Powers is one a mission to stop a crazed man from using a magnetic beam to cause an giant asteroid to collide with earth. Plus Austin has to rescue his long lost father by the name of Nigel Powers. <p>My favorite part was where Austin Powers met Britney Spears in the awful Boyz video when it turns out that the Britney in the movie was actually a fembot. I literally laughed when I saw the fembot blow up. <p>While the female charachter Foxy Cleopatra did get on my nerves at the beginning I must say she turned out much better than I thought. While I don't have much respect for Beyonce Knowles in terms of music she could gain my respect in terms of being an actress. <p>So far one of the best theatrical releases of 2002! I'm looking forward to the fourth installment whenever that comes out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>As both an afficiando of 60's and 70's nostagia, and a modern day woman, I wound up liking Beyonce's Foxy Cleopatra much more than I intially anticipated. <p>The inital annoucement of her casting caused some concern, but early previews indicate she may be Austin's most intriguing partner yet. Unlike Hurley and Grahmm, whose spy role belied an unconvincing innocence, Cleopatra is a street smart sister in the traddition of Foxy Brown and Cleopatra Jones (her name is a fusion of the two blaxploitation characters).</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>The Austin Powers series in a lot of ways is like the Waynes World films in that it defines a generation by pointing out its biggest personality traits and making fun of them. Waynes World pointed out the camp, moronic nature of many hardcore old school rock fans and their dedication for the genre. Austin Powers is a character that defines the campness of the groovy 60s, not necessarily hippie fashion, but more fun loving groovy cats who just wanted to have a good time.<br /><br />The character is broadly based around James bond and the velvet suit with Beatle Boots was actually worn by a George Lazenby incarnation of Bond. Mike Myers took his humour and expressed it in a character that worked on so many levels and took him to the sky in relation to recognition, and arguably the success of this particular will never be matched. With Austin Powers, Myers has now run the risk of the character becoming bigger than the actor and the humour itself. The catchphrases and groovy look are great and present a fun atmosphere, but this now runs the risk of the catchphrases overtaking any form of introduction of new humour.<br /><br />The character is no bad thing and the silly wit from the mind of Myers only helps the movies, but unless it was Myers intention, the character has now become bigger than its creator and it is obvious in this film. The story focuses around Austin who faces a new foe who teams up with Dr. Evil. The new foes name I hear you ask? Goldmember, and his criminal calling card is turning his victims members gold. Goldmember and Dr. Evil team up to build a tractor beam that will pull a meteor into the earth and melt the ice caps. Austin, with the help of a new companion by the name of Foxxy Cleopatra, has to travel back to 1975 to save his father and stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember.<br /><br />The plot's simple enough don't you think? I suppose what Myers sought to achieve with this was character progression more than anything as we see Dr. Evils son, Scott become evil. The new character of Goldmember is something not too appealing in the film, as it seems he's there to simply promote some form of "look how the foreigner talks funny" vibe, and the joke gets really old quite quickly. After about the first 5 minutes of being familiar with Goldmember, I think even Myers realised this character couldn't achieve anything better and after his original "comic" entrance he just ended up sitting in silence a lot.<br /><br />The real introductory gems of the entire film are Foxxy Cleopatra played by the devinely beautiful Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, and Nigel Powers played by the legendary Michael Caine who looks surprisingly young. Foxxy Cleopatra is the breath of fresh air in what generally is a redoing of all the old gags. She's a woman with talent and attitude and is like many women before her, after Austins heart. Michael Caine seems very much at home playing Nigel Powers as it seems a character very close to his own personality. The cheeky cockney geezer always up for a good time with the ladies is something very befitting of Caine.<br /><br />The setting is great and the comedy is just fantastic (the new stuff anyway) but I felt the movie fell short. Apart from the genuinely amazing intro and the odd bit here and there, the film just felt a lot like the previous two with a lot of the old gags done once again. Once is fantastic, twice is okay, but the same joke for the third time becomes a bit tiresome. I have to wonder that with a fourth installment in the works, just how soon will it be before Myers decides to drop the old boring jokes and create some new ones.</p></br><a href="../users/AD9WTAOAFUZA4.html">AD9WTAOAFUZA4</a><br/><p>Yes, the title sequence at the beginning of &quot;Goldmember&quot; is al all star classic, with cameos by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Steven Speilberg, Danny DiVito and many others offering a laugh-out-loud 10 minutes.  But after that, &quot;Goldmember&quot; is a hodge-podge of uninspired and been-there-done-that dialogue from the great Mike Meyers.  I'd really hoped for a more lively episode, along the lines of the first two movies, and was clearly disappointed.  Beyonce Knowles - GORGEOUS HERE - is solid as Foxy Cleopatra, but the rest of the cast seems like they are just going through the motions.  Even Meyers himself seems to be channeling SNL characters rather than focusing on making this funny.  Let's hope the next Austin Powers movie finds him back in real fine shape, bay-bee.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KB14WCZ1DVE3.html">A2KB14WCZ1DVE3</a><br/><p>What makes this movie frustrating is that a lot of work obviously went into it.  This was a big-budget movie, and it looks like they used mega-millions for it's "look".  Also, different types of gags took a lot of care to construct.  One of the very few gags that works is a cameo appearance by Nathan Lane, looking very comfortable in drag, mouthing the dialog of the chick from Destiny's Child, while said chick is sitting right behind him.  <p>But disappointingly, there is almost nothing else in this film that was watch able to me, and I thought this one would be enjoyable, which the first one was.  The second had it's moments, but was already getting very repetitive.  This one's totally forgettable.  <p>Going back to the careful construction of gags is partially my point.  It was humorous and creative in the first movie when Powers and his lady friend carefully avoided showing genitalia by all sorts of clever tricks.  Well, they kind of rehash that in reverse with dialog here, showing parts of phrases, which start out as potty humor, but are revealed to be different messages entirely.<p>Which is the biggest complaint, which is the writing.  The first movie threw a lot of sexual innuendo into the horny Austin Powers character, who not only came from a more promiscuous time, but had a lot of adjustments to make for modern society.  May of these were clever, but there's none of that freshness now. It's now all been replaced by bad pun after assembly-line bad pun, and it wears thin very quickly.  <p>Finally, the title character villain is as uninteresting a character as one can imagine.  Dr. Evil was a pretty good imitation of James Bond Blofeld character, but for whatever reason, they decide to make Goldmember Dutch.  This leaves room for golden wooden shoes as part of the costume, which is only mildly amusing, but then it takes the character absolutely nowhere.  <p>Like the now-defunct Batman series, this one decided to go the route of expensive sets and high-class choreography.  What destroyed both series was the virtual desertion of any kind of original plot whatsoever.  My biggest disappointment is that while Batman died the death it deserved, this one might be around for a few more installments.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>Goldmember was better then the previous two! Really. Mike Meyers did an incredible job writing and producing this film and Jay Roach is back directing. This movie lets nothing be untouched by sarcasm and humor. All the old gags are back and all the old expectation of Dr. Evil and his plots and Austin Powers and his Mojo - have all returned. What's so cool about a fun movie like this is that you come out of the theatre imitating all the characters and quoting the dialogue. That's the sign of good movie - and it makes you laugh!<p>The full cast is back Michael York is the incredibly nieve Basil. Seth Green the notoriously jealous son of Dr. Evil. Robert Wagner as the incredible #2 and even the fabulous Frau is back too! Oh, and Mini Me goes through some surprising and hysterical changes<p>The story is silly and the plot predictable but the way they go through the story and all the sight gags There is visual humor, sight gags, puns and even quips and quibbles that I know I missed because I was laughing so hard. The new twist is that Austin Powers now has another plot to foil by Dr. Evil except this time it is complicated by his father, Nigel. This role was amazingly performed by the genius of Mr. Michael Caine.<br />Also Mike Meyers is now playing four roles in this movie - Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat B. and now Goldmember.<p>Now lets talk about Guest appearances - Gwenyth Paltrow, Danny Devito, Kevin Spacey, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears and Tom Cruise. How's that for a starter...and that's in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Also John Travolta came along for the ride. Mike Meyers did an incredible job getting everyone together and I pleased to see all these Hollywood biggies also have a sense of humor about themselves.<p>The music is always classic the opening titles are amazing, the cars and costumes are brilliant and the movie is just as fun as it gets. I can't wait for the DVD on this one! 7-30-02</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Austin Powers movies seem to divide people into two camps: You either hate 'em (Or won't even lower yourself by seeing them) or love 'em. I love 'em, so remember that as you read this review...<p>  The movie is worth seeing just for the cameos in the first scene. I won't spoil the surprise, and I hope no one else does. Really inspired casting choices....The rest of the film delivers the usual Austin formula- A ridiculous plot that is just a framework to hang the jokes on. This time, Austin needs to rescue his father, played by Michael Caine, from the clutches of Dr. Evil and the underutilized Goldmember (Both played by Mike Myers, who also plays Powers and Fat Bastard), a skin-flake eating euro-swinger who enjoys painting peoples "Wedding-Tackle" gold. (Considering all of the legal hoopla that went on regarding the use of the name Goldmember, he really has very little screen time, and contributes nothing to the film, aside from the strange plot to use a tractor beam ("Preparation H") to pull a meteor into the Earth, thereby flooding it, while the bad guys are safely in their Dr. Evil-shaped Submarine.<p>  The film suffers from the same problems most other film series do- Too many characters competing for screen time. We've got the returning Austin, Basil Exposition, Fat Bastard, Dr. Evil, Frau, Scott, Mini-Me, Number Two (No Mr. Bigglesworth this time, except for a brief flashback), and then there are the new characters, such as Foxxy Cleopatra and Nigel powers....It's a very crowded movie, and it felt a little too long. Caine and Beyonce Knowles are welcome additions to the cast, though, especially Knowles- She does a great job as Foxxy, and she sure is easy on the eyes. I'd like to see her return in the next Powers flick. <p>  There are some BIG laughs, especially the scene where a bewildered seaman watches Austin and Mini-Me's shadows on a curtain. I laughed so hard I actually cried, and wound up missing some of the scene while I wiped my eyes. If that ain't a good reason to see a comedy, I don't know what is.....</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>The first one was good, the second one was the best, by part three, it just got old.<br /><br />Austin Powers returns for his third movie, this time going after Goldmember, rescuing his father, hooking up with Foxy Cleopatra, and ends with a huge family reunion that hasn't been done since Star Wars' Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />This movie had a few laughs, but seriously this was just getting repetetive. Plus Goldmember was an absolutly terrible character. The skin eating was just stupid. Dr. Evil does a cool rap in the prison with Mini-me, but the song he did in part two was way better. It seems everything in part two was better. Fat Bastard, Mini-me, and even Austin himself. I know this was a great proiject for Mike Myers, but even he should know that after this trilogy it's time to hang up the ruffles for good.<br /><br />If you have one and two, of course you;ll get this to complete the set, but I think it is the worst of the three. It depended too much on cameos it seems to get the big belly laughs. Of course I'll admit that watching Britney Spears explode may be the best scene in all three movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>I watched this film with some reluctance, as it was not the film I would have chosen, even though I had previously seen the two other Austin Powers films and enjoyed them. Well, am I ever glad that I did! It was, without a doubt, the funniest Austin Powers film to date.<br /><br />From the great opening scene to the surprise ending, replete with cameos by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito, the Ozzie Osbourne Family, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears, Burt Bacharach, Quincy Jones, Nathan Lane, Katie Couric, and John Travolta, the film is a laugh riot. Austin Powers (Mike Myers) still has his mojo amd, together with his gorgeous female sidekick de jour, Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles), sets out to rescue his father, Nigel (Michael Caine), from the evil clutches of the notorious Dutchman, Goldmember (Mike Meyers). To do so, they must go back in time to 1975, the era of disco fever.<br /><br />Fans of Dr. Evil (Mike Myers), Fat Bastard (Mike Myers), Number Two (Robert Wagner), Scot Evil (Seth Green), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Basil (Michael York), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) will be happy to know that they are all back in this film. Mini-Me very nearly steals the show, and he does this without ever uttering a single word. Fred Savage joins the party as Number Three/The Mole and becomes a running sight gag throughout the film for reasons that will be obvious to the viewer.<br /><br />The only problem in the film is with the character of Goldmember. He is the weak link, as he is simply gross and not particularly funny. What was Mike Myers thinking? Notwithstanding the fact that the title character is pretty much of a zero, however, the film is still hilarious, overall. The plot, what little there is, primarily exists to set up a lot of sight gags, send ups, and a number of very funny scenes. If, however, scatological humor offends your sensibilities, this is definitely not the film for you. If you are not easily offended by the crude and the lewd, then this film will make you laugh up a storm.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This trilogy is worth your money and will give you one hell of a good time. There isn't really much for me to say about them though. The plots are very simple and pointless but the movies are absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />Mike Myers is genius and makes the movies funny because he plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bast***. That's lots of talent!<br /><br />Beware because if you didn't know, these movies are very silly and dumb but will definitely make you laugh your head off.<br /><br />This is how I rate the three:<br /><br />Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery- 4 stars<br /><br />Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me- 4 and 1/2 stars<br /><br />Austin Powers: Goldmember- 3 and 1/2 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>Finally, the law of diminishing return has caught up with Austen's latest offering.  This movie is rather short compared with the earlier two movies.  It concluded at a mere 1 hour 24 minutes.  The tirade old jokes seemed to be running out of puff.  Whereas in the earlier offerings, we would be laughing our heads' off, in this instance, we might chuckle here & there.  There were many unexpected delightful cameo appearances & you could have mistaken the opening sequence to a John Woo's action movie.  I guess it's the charisma of Mike Myers that carried the whole movie.  The supporting cast was stunning particularly Michael Caine who showed his depth & versatility in acting.  I always fancied Roach's direction as his light-hearted & casual approach seemed to motivate the cast to improvise in their actings.  We have seen all the jokes & gags before.  Otherwise, this movie would be a blast.  I'm not surprised that this is the grand finale of this trilogy.  This DVD package is great as it offered many deleted scenes (on the hindsight, those scenes really don't add anything to the movie), documentaries about the production team, cast, choreography team, stunt team, vehicles sourcing team, special effects team, commentaries from Mike Myers, Director, Producer.  Even though this movie is mediocre, it's still a worthwhile movie to watch for a laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>This third outing is much better than the THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME.

By his side is sexy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) - of course, all of the original gang is back as well.  There's more spoofs and an outrageous opening sequence featuring plenty of big-name cameos; it leaves behind most of it's sex humor, however, to go for potty humor - but there's just as much laughs and entertainment as any other Austin Powers film.

I went to the theater really wanting to love this movie just as much as its predecessors (really I did), but there is a problem with the new movie....it's got nothing new to offer...everything here has been done before, and better in other spy/superhero genre entries....<br />To tell you the truth the beginning of Austin Powers 3 is the best part of the movie.... but it went way down hill after that and the laughs from the audience I was sitting with turned to groans at some of the cheapest and unfunniest sight gags I have seen in ages and disgust as some of the vulgar humor that makes "Scary Movie 2" look like "Mary Poppins" It's tired, Dr. Evil even told a joke that I heard in high school and it wasn't funny back then.<br />MGM should slap New Line Cinema --- Austin Powers rips off, Live and Let Die","The Spy who Loved Me" and numerous moments from other James Bond movies... and the trailers for "Die Another Day" and "The Two Towers" (ie Lord of the Rings 2")<br />Go see it and judge for yourself, but for me this movie gets a thumbs way down....</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>The only reason i saw this was because i was visiting a friend who is a projectionest so i watched it from the booth.  I was glad i wasn't in the audience.  This IS the dumbing down of America at it's best.  It's humor is just plan stupid, the acting is a mockery to the actors guild.  There is no entertainment value except to show the rest of the world what americans think is comedy. No wonder we are hated.  The movie is pointless, doesn't go anywhere, it's stupid and is not very creative. There is no value to this film at all. This film is an insult to real comedy.  It's just white trash at it's very best.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL:<br /><br />The first two films of the Austin Powers series were filled with fresh ideas and silly lampoons of James Bond, Flint, Matt Helm and others. The results were very giggly, silly, vulgar, and irreverant, but mostly sappy humor all in good fun that most viewers enjoyed. Goldmember is different in that it is not as universally enjoyable.<br /><br />WHY GOLDMEMBER IS NOT AS UNIVERSALLY ENJOYABLE - HINTS OF "DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER":<br /><br />"Goldmember" can be seen in the same light as "Diamonds Are Forever", resorting to overused and recycled ideas which yielded flat performances, obvious cliches, and limited enthusiasm from the movie-going public. Like the Austin Powers franchise, the James Bond franchise was incredibly popular and it appeared impossible to go wrong with the same ideas, plots, and, of course, Sean Connery as Bond.<br /><br />WHAT ONCE APPEARED FUNNY NOW SEEMS VULGAR AND AT TIMES PAINFUL TO WATCH:<br /><br />I recall, in 1971, feeling very restless and uncomfortable watching many of the scenes in "Diamonds Are Forever". Jill St. John just did not fit and I wondered why she was so scantily clad throughout the film. Certainly we had seen that before in 007 films! Then, we had those two ridiculous "hit men", "Wint" and "Mr. Kidd". Were they any more ridiculous than "Odd-Job" or "Random Task" or "Fat B******"? Probably not. The dialogue in both films were pretty much standard and the plots had the usual evil, crazy, eccentric-villian-extorts-the-world scenarios.<br /><br />SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF -- WHERE DID IT GO?<br /><br />In both earlier Austin Powers features, as in Connery's earlier 007 flicks, we had very far-fetched plots, gadgets, superhuman abilities, time for female companionship even as the world is about to be destroyed, but most of all the "suspension of our disbelief" was achieved --- SOMEHOW!<br /><br />We bought the idea of a repellent [Miss Kensington's word] Austin Powers sweeping a gaga Vanessa off her feet in the end, bad teeth, nerdy retro-caveman behavior, and goofy clothes notwithstanding. But in "Goldmember" this type of leap of faith just didn't happen on the part of many in the audience.<br /><br />LACKING THE LEAP OF FAITH - GOLDMEMBER SEEMS IN BAD TASTE<br /><br />I found scenes like Goldmember and his skin to be truly disgusting, and had to fight the urge to just turn the movie off. The same thing happened to me while I was watching "Diamonds Are Forever". So, if you were among those who were able to make it over the hurdles and achieve that leap of faith that allows one to believe in the film, then "Goldmember" was a worthy addition to the Austin Power's franchise. If you were like me, and couldn't, then you may find yourself happily viewing the first two Austin Powers' offerings while ignoring "Goldmember". Let's just hope that if they make another, they infuse some fresh ideas into it as was the case for the 007 franchise after "Diamonds Are Forever".</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This latest installment in the Austin powers series is fairly decent at its best. The movie uses a lot of the same jokes from the last Austin Powers movie, and it doesn't even try to be original. The last two films always tried to raise to bar of comedy to new heights, but this one just gets by off the same jokes as before. It's still good for some laughs that'll entertain you, but I wouldn't expect too much out of it. I thought Mike Myers was still very hillarious in this film as the nefarious Dr. Evil, the heroic Austin Powers, the overweight Fat (...), and the new obscene Goldmember. Overall, it's still a good film to watch, but it's too bad it couldn't live up to its potential.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>EXPENSIVE!

After setting the box office on fire with 1999's "The Spy Who Shagged Me," Mike Myers returns in "Goldmember," which is the most confident and flashy of the three films. It also happens to be the weakest. The plot is simple: a flesh-eating Dutch agent of Dr. Evil named Goldmember has kidnapped Austin Powers's dad. So, Austin must travel back to 1975 to rescue him. While the film features impressive performances from Michael Caine as Austin's dad and Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra (an obvious nod to the Pam Grier/Tamara Dobson blaxploitation films of the 1970s), "Goldmember" has a worn-out, "been there, seen that" feel to it. Toilet and anatomy jokes abound, which are fine in moderation, but they wear out their welcome real fast. Plus the Goldmember character (played by Myers) isn't very interesting as a villan. But what does work is the string of cameos (none of which I will reveal), particulary during the first ten minutes. We also get some clever references of films from "The Silence of the Lambs" to "Yentyl." And while I was expecting to trash Beyonce in her silver screen debut, she actually gives her role a welcome dose of sass and spark as Austin's sidekick Foxxy. However, she's not really required to do much more than look fabulous, sport her abs, and recite one-liners from Blaxploitation films. I walked into the theatre with high expectations of "Goldmember," which were sadly not met due to the second-rate quality of the film's material. In my school of cinema, this film gets a C+.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>What happened to the great Austin Powers. The first movie was so funny, so cutting edge, so wonderful, and even the sequel was pretty good, though I imagine Mini-Me was the saving grace there. But this movie was horrible. It's like Mike Myers was trying to mine all the money he could, but without taking the time to create a decent script. Austin is as irritating as always, and his new (ex-singer) sidekick is just a waste. Better to have brought back Heather Graham. The evil was sucked out of Dr. Evil, and not even Mini-Me was as funny as he had been before. Even Fat Bastard (though he got very little screen time) wasn't funny. The new villain, Goldmember, was poorly done, and it just seemed Myers wanted to play another role in the movie. Dr. Evil's henchmen got little screen time, which is a shame because Number 2 and Frau are quite funny. Seth Green reprised his role as Scott Evil, but not nearly as well done in either of the prequels, though his end scene wasn't bad. We got to meet Austin Powers' father (and see clips of Austin and Evil in 'prep' school), who is played by the not so fabulous Micheal Cain. And he was a total bore. Half the trouble with this film is that it was way too crowded. The same mistake the Batman franchise made. And the ending was wrapped up all very nicely, neatly, and way too cheesey. Not spoofing itself, just a poor attempt at scriptwriting. I was really dissapointed in this film. It had so much potential, but just like Myers' Wayne's World, he has tried to milk the cash cow for too much, too fast, and without a decent script. I will admit that it did have a few funny moments, but the last 20 minutes or so aren't worth sitting in your seat.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>This is my first exposure to Mike Myers and his Austin Powers character and while some of the gags just don't work, the movie is a funny one.  Myers is hilarious as the many characters he plays, and although some of his humor is too flatulent oriented, I have to admit I laughed every time.  Beyonce Knowles is throwaway material but she's effective.  Verne Troyer is a hoot as Mini Me and Seth Green is fun as Dr. Evil's son.  Add a cast of celebrity cameos, especially those in the scene's AUSTINPUSSY opening and you can't help but fall into the movie's maniacal thrust.

Michael Meyers (I Married An Axe Murderer, Shrek) is a creative genius with this character and if all he did was make these movies - he would make the world a much better place.<p>This story takes us back in time to the 70's and even farther back to when Austin Powers, Nigel and even Dr. Evil were in High School together. Keep in mind that Mike Meyers plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, Fat Bastard. He does an amazing job and you can't even tell it is him.<p>Directed by Jay Roach (Meet The Parents, Mystery, Alaska) the film tells the tale of 7's undercover agent Foxy Brown played by Beyonce Knowles (know for the pop group Destiny's Child) who helps track the whereabouts of the Evil Dr. Evil and the disgusting dead skin eating Goldmemeber.<p>Everyone is back - including Michael York (Logan's Run, Island Of Dr. Monroe) as Secret Defense Leader Nigel and Seth Green (Rock Star, Rat Race) as Dr. Evil misguided and somewhat confused son.<p>The most amazing thing is all the cameo appearances that are in the movie and how they got everyone to do a minute or two in the film. People like Steven Speilberg, Tom Cruise, Gweneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny Divito and Nathan Lane to name a few.<p>The DVD is phenomenal and besides all the extras, the best part is the revoicing studio where you actually put your own voice over the characters and play as if you were in the movie. The extra's including the commentary are extremely funny.<p>If you have the other two - this is a must have - if you have never seen it - be prepared to laugh hysterically. Get it - you'll love it!

Beyonce absolutely sucks playing Foxxy Cleopatra. they should have used Diana Ross or any other African-American girl that sung in the Seventies. Beyonce was born in 1982. what does she have to do with the 1970's ? I said it before, and i'll say it again: Destiny's Child SUCKS! and I'll say this for the record: Britney Spears SUCKS too!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>I won't hesitate a second longer - 'Goldmember' was terrible. The first sequel,' The Spy Who Shagged Me', was bad enough but this really stretches the franchise way too far and over the top. <p>I would have thought that the writers would have come up with some new material but no, its still the same 'Yeeeah Baby' and 'Very Shagadelic' one liners which bring down this films' credibility even more. It's only saving grace are the vast amount of cameos near the beginning, from then on; its trash. The overused 'mole' joke really gets on your nerves after a while and is just another blatant lack of fresh ideas for this third instalment. Even the appearance of Destiny's Child beauty Beyonce Knowles isn't enough to keep you interested. For real comedy, just stick to the first film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>This latest Austin Powers' film will not win an Academy Awards.  It will also not earn a place on anyone's 100 best movies of all time.  Nonetheless,  I heartedly recommend that you see this somewhat vulgar, scatological, and comedy loaded with never ending sexual double entendres.  The consumer product Preparation H is prominently highlighted.  Do I need to elaborate further? Goldmember will bring at least a smile to your face and has a number of really funny scenes.  Austin Powers must once again save the world from the nefarious Dr. Evil.  The plot doesn't make a bit of sense, but who cares?  No one in their right mind expects<br />Shakespeare or Victor Hugo.  Most viewers have almost certainly seen one or both of the previous Austin Powers' comedic slap stick adventures.  If not, try imagining Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costelo, and the Three Stooges making fun of the James Bond 007 series.<p>It is unfortunate that I mentioned earlier that Goldmember will not garner any major film award nominations.  Mike Myers is brilliant portraying Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard.  Unfortunately, actors specializing in comedy are routinely ignored.  This is not fair, but it is a fact of life.  Goldmember deserves 4 and a half stars.  Both religious conservatives and the politically correct Left will be outraged---but that's their problem.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p><p>I had seen the first two movies in this series and figured Goldmember would be more of the same - and it was. A lot of the classic characters return, along with new babe Foxxy Cleopatra and new villian Goldmember (whose disgusting habit of picking his skin and eating it crossed the gross-out line).<br /><p>In this installment (very basically), Dr. Evil is back on his mission to destroy the Earth and he calls on Goldmember for help with his plan titled 'Preparation H'. To keep Austin Powers occupied, they kidnap his father Nigel. Austin and Foxxy foil Dr Evil's plan and save the planet.<br /><p>My favorite part is all of the pop culture references - the Osbournes make cameos and Fat Bastard goes on the Jared/Subway diet! There are also some crazy, unexpected twists that I do not want to give away, but they leave the door wide open for at least a couple more sequels....</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>This looks to be one of the first in a long line of sequels that are scheduled for this year and the next, with `Charlie's Angels 2', `The Matrix Reloaded', `Sky Kids 2' et al all finding their way into the cinemas soon.  Although inevitably some of these will be hugely anticipated and doubtless very good, there are always a few that will make its audience cringe.  This is one such movie.  The third in the `Austin Powers' trilogy finds Austin (Myers) teaming up with Foxy Cleopatra (Beyonc&eacute;) and father Nigel Powers (Caine) to defeat not only Dr. Evil but also Goldmember, both of whom wish to flood the world.  But to be fair it's not really the plot that's the problem, it's the fact that the same gags that were used in the first two films are here tired and devoid of any life.<p>In taking on four roles, it's a little bit of overkill for Myers, who should have stuck to playing Austin and Dr. Evil rather than taking on any other roles.  Whilst there was admittedly some fun to be had from the first movie, especially for those well acquainted with the James Bond franchise, the constant sexual innuendoes that are thrown out one after the other are increasingly dull.  Very few of the jokes stick, although there is a great line from Caine when he asks one unfortunate man `Do you know how many anonymous henchmen I've knocked out over the years'?  You'd think that with such a fantastic supporting cast - Michael Caine, Seth Green, Vern Troyer and Beyonc&eacute; are all brilliant - that there'd be something noteworthy in this movie, but it's actually incredibly boring.  True, it starts well with a host of cameo appearances - including Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and Britney Spears - that are very funny indeed, but it quickly goes downhill from there.  There's a fine line between affectionate parody and a desperate attempt at pandering to the audience's affection, and `Austin Powers' has crossed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>"I Love Gold"........... Goldmember is the hilarious 3rd installment in the franchise and hopefully not the last, Mike Myers as always Very Funny, Dr.Evil,Scott Evil, Mini-me, and now Michael Caine. "English-English?" "Shat on a Turtle??" very funny movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>While Austin Powers in Goldmember is certainly a funny movie, featuring several of the most classic scenes from the Austin Powers series, it is ultimately something of a disappointment.  We all thought Austin lost his mojo in the second movie, but the series itself ran off and left its mojo behind early on in this third film.  It's hard to explain, but this just doesn't even feel like a movie to me.  I was still waiting for the movie to really kick in to serious gear when the credits began rolling.  There seem to be serious problems with the plot and script; too many things just happen for no apparent reason, giving the impression that the filmmakers were not overly concerned with maintaining the causality of the storyline.  One thing that really bothered me was Austin's appearance out of nowhere early on to arrest a newly-returned Dr. Evil.  The plot required Dr. Evil to go to prison, but, after watching him escape from his nemesis over the course of two movies, seeing Dr. Evil captured so easily seemed a great disservice to such a great character.  The ending is also disappointing; I hope this is not the final Austin Powers movie, but it certainly wraps up in series-ending style; while predictable, such an ending would not have been terribly bad if the filmmakers had put more effort into injecting some life or suspense into it; as it is, things turn out quite silly, with only one character turning away from the sappy denouement and implanting us with hope that we may see Austin return some day.  <p>Goldmember, a new fourth character played by Mike Myers, may well be the worst character in the history of motion pictures.  While he could be slightly amusing on occasion, Goldmember's unnecessary, disgusting, corny role shot big holes into the movie named for him.  The roller skates, the skin-eating, everything about the man turned me off completely.  The Mole, in my opinion, was yet another terrible character.  No one enjoyed Fred Savage's performance in The Wonder Years as much as I did, but both he and his character looked uncomfortably out of place in the presence of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.  I also, to be quite frank, disapproved mightily of the disservice done to Heather Graham's character of Felicity Shagwell from the second film; I wanted an explanation for her absence, but all I got was a new character in the form of Foxxy Cleopatra.  Beonce Knowles did an admirable job in the role, but to me her character just doesn't fit, and Austin's largely absent mojo flexing in the ladies' department made me feel as if I were watching Austin going about his business as an old man.  <p>All criticism aside, there are some classic moments in this film.  The opening is brilliant, producing some of the most memorable cameo appearances to ever hit the big screen.  Even this cannot compare to the scenes featuring the young versions of Austin and Dr. Evil, however.  Josh Zuckerman did a great job aping the mannerisms and inflections of Dr. Evil, but Aaron Himelstein was all over the young Austin Powers role; he had Austin's look, expressions, mannerisms, and voice down pat; it's really one of the most impressive impersonation jobs I've ever seen.  The humor and entertainment, though, are just too few and far between for the movie as a whole.  I think the plot holes could have been plugged effectively by a couple of the deleted scenes included on the DVD, yet a number of those deleted scenes were mercifully cut from the final print before doing even more self-inflicted damage to this disappointing sequel of a sequel.  I think Mike Myers got too caught up in the whole Austin Powers frenzy, placing the characters before the story itself.  The result is, by and large, a second-rate parody of a formerly ingenious parody.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>About 70% of the jokes in the new Austin Powers film are recycled bits. The film is funny but not half as funny as it's predecessor The Spy who Shagged Me or a tenth as funny as the original. Still, Mike Myers is a funny man with great comedic instincts. In addition to his gaggle of demented characters (Dr. Evil ...), Myers adds Goldmember to the list. Goldmember is a dutch hedonist from the '70's who likes roller skating and eating his own peeling skin but loves gold. Myers as always is at his best when running wild as these crazy alter-ego's. Seth Green's Scott Evil character gets less screen time in Goldmember but he is much more effective. If there is another Austin Powers, there is no doubt that Green's role will be expanded. I will say this, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is by far the hottest chick that Myers has used in these films. When she's on the screen you can't take you're eyes off of her. She also does a good job of acting(but really who cares!). Watching Goldmember as a fan of the series and Myers, the laughs are beginning to get strained which is sad because the original was so inspired. Anyway, if you're a fan go see it but don't expect anything more than a re-hash of the first two movies. Recommended for hard-core fans only.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>Let's be honest, the stars of any Austin Powers movie is Dr. Evil & Mini Me.  There is just something about Dr. Evil's nerdy ways and affection for Mini Me that makes every moment they're onscreen great!  Unfortunately, Mike Myers has created so MANY characters for this series that most of them are now basically in walk-on roles!  Goldmember was an unnecessary character to create since he has maybe 15 minutes of honest-to-goodness screen time in the film - the rest of the time he's just an extra.  And he didn't do anything Dr. Evil couldn't have been written to do.  Robert Wagner and Frau whatever have a couple of lines each, but this show mostly belongs to Austin and Foxxy (whatever happened to Felicity Shagwell?  She doesn't even have a cameo in this one).  I read that they had 3 1/2 hours of material to sift through to make this movie, let's hope when the DVD comes out they give us most of that material as extras, because it just seems like there's so much we're missing here.  There are a couple of dead-on actors as the teen Austin and Dr. Evil that make me wish for more time in flashback here (those guys are GOOD!).  This is almost a remake of the last one: Austin goes back in time to fight a villian, Austin finds a sexy new partner and brings her back with him to the present, Dr. Evil and Mini Me do a musical number, there's the adult humor about various body parts throughout, Austin and Mini Me have a battle (though this one is 100 times funnier than the one in the last film), etc.  And with the way this one ends, it's obvious that Mike will have to create another new villian for the next one if the series is to progress (though it makes a fitting end as a trilogy) because the villian we're left with at the end just wouldn't be enough to carry a whole film (though it's a great idea).  And with the movie making so much money already, it's obvious there WILL be another installment at some point in the future.  Let's hope Dr. Evil and Mini Me return because the series won't be the same without them.  Oh, and as an added bonus to the series, in this movie we finally learn what Dr. Evil's first name is!</p></br></body></html>

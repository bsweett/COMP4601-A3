time garnering mixed to poor reviews.But the general public liked what they saw and gave out,much to the delight of its' producers,at the box office.The movie went on to influence other subsequent films(such as the opening of the Fifth Element) and spawned video games(direct and indirecty),along with the ever popular TV series franchise.<br />The film opens with the discovery of a circular device and the fossilized skeleton of a being of some sort,buried in the Egyptian desert in 1928.Fast forward to modern day and a Dr.Jackson(James Spader) who is giving an ill-received lecture on who exactly built the great pyramid in Egypt.Afterwards an elderly woman arrives and invites him to join her at a research facility run by the military in Colorado.<br />There they have in their hands the device found in the sand and want Jackson to decipher the writing.He does and inadvertantly gives the military brass the code to start up a working replica of the device.The project is headed by Col.O'Neil(Kurt Russell) and he leads a military team along with Dr Jackson through,what is now referred to as,the Stargate.The "other side" is light years from earth and is a planet much like the Egyptian desert,complete with their emergence point in a similarly structered building,dwarfed from behind by a huge pyramid.<br />In due time they find a colony of human slaves who are mining the material that composes the Stargate.Dr Jackson slowly but surely learns the language and eventually finds the key that will enable the team to return to Earth.But in the meantime the beings who oversee all this,return and wreak havoc with Col.O'Neil and company.It is learned that the aliens have taken humans as hosts and actually are the ones responsible for creating civilization on Earth thousands of years before.But the alien leader informs them they should never have opened the Stargate and plans to send back a bomb to destroy the Earth.In a race against time,an uprising by the slaves and a ticking bomb that can't be turned off,O'Neil and Jackson narrowly manage to turn the tables on the aliens as they try to escape and thus destroy them.Dr Jackson stays behind while the remaining team members return to earth.The movie ends as O'Neil says to Jackson that he will "see him around".<br />This left the movie up for an obvious sequel but,much to my disappointment,none has ever been forthcoming despite numerous rumours to the contrary.The latest rumour is that once the TV series has finally finished then we will see a sequel;but that remains to be seen.<br />Russells' career at the time had been a mixed one up Stargate having had more hits in the 80s(The Thing,Escape from New York,Used Cars,Big Trouble in Little China)with little of substance/success after,other than a notable supporting role in the hit Backdraft in/91.Spader on the other hand had been a pretty hot property at this time(his most popular time in fact) having had a more consistent string of recent successes(Mannequin,Pretty in Pink,Wall Street,Sex,Lies and Videotapes)than the more established Russell.That is why both share top lead.However while Spader had the lions share of screen time,Russell manages to dominate every scene he is in which says much  about his acting chops.<br />The story generally flows well but the action gets bogged down on sideplots concerning the slaves working for the aliens.All concerned do a wonderful job but it is the (then)unique concept and angle this film gives us that really manages to fascinate and ultimately sell it.It must have made an impression,for while we have yet to see any sequels at the theatres,there has been a wildly successful little screen franchise going on for years.<br />This so called "Directors Cut" is clocked in,on the sleeve at least,as 119 minutes.Well the ACTUAL screen time is just over 123 minutes,with the credits extending it to around 130 minutes!Underselling their product.<br />The sleeve also tells us that this film has been remastered.Well I think someone needs to do some more work on this.The picture can get slightly washed out and grainy at times;not what a "remastered" print should look like.The sound however is very good,available in Dolby 2,5.1 and 6.1 DTS.The "ultimate" features are just an audio commentary by the director and producer and a small 10 minute film on the concept of alien vistors in ancient times and its'conceptual "father" Erich Von Daniken.Not much for an"ultimate edition",so it loses marks there also.The film is in its' original widescreen format.The copy I received of this film is a bit different than the one shown here for sale.The DVD I got is in a case with the same artwork as depicted(brown colour with the ring over the pyramid).However THAT case,in turn,has a nice looking sleeve over IT;a colourful holographic version of the case cover.I hope yours comes this way also.<br />In the end this film still holds up quite nicely after 15 years,both in the acting and concept departments.And while the film does needs a proper tweaking on the remastering,overall I think you will still enjoy what you see.</p></br><a

own merits, "Stargate" is a pretty entertaining blockbuster with some big flaws. It uncomfortably straddles the fence between "shoot-em-up bombs'n'action" and "mythology sci-fi," but provides a solid villain, some sketchy writing, and the foundation for a hit TV show. Well, it's definitely far better than your average sci-fi blockbuster.<br /><br />Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has just lost his job, when a mysterious old lady invites him to become involved in a secret military project. Soon he finds out why -- a massive stone ring found in Giza decades ago, with strange symbols on a central ring. When they use his calculations, the Air Force is able to open a wormhole to a distant galaxy.<br /><br />Obviously a recon team is sent through, led by the grieving Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russell). This new world is a desert planet, inhabited by a race of primitive human slaves who practically worship the strangers. But things turn deadly when a pyramid ship descends on the desert, and a malevolent "god" decides to obliterate Earth -- using a nuclear bomb O'Neil brought along.<br /><br />It's a pretty straightforward action plot -- scientist opens gateway to new planet, bad guy shows up and makes trouble, good guys attack bad guy with the help of plucky natives. "Stargate" doesn't add much to the typical formula, but it does dress it up with gilded robes, giant stone statues, glittering starships and sandswept deserts.<br /><br />In fact, spectacle is what "Stargate" excels at -- it has big armies of invading, big ships, big pyramids, and big battles with Ra's warriors. When it comes to gun battles and explosions, Roland Emmerich does a pretty decent job. However, he gets mesmerized by the gilded interior of Ra's starship and the prettyboy alien slinking around -- the middle part of the movie is very slow-moving.<br /><br />It's more clumsy at the intimate stuff of character development, such as Daniel's serious romance with a chief's daughter, or O'Neil's depression over his son. It just never feels natural or deep. The accompanying dialogue is usually pretty solid, but sometimes gets downright clumsy ("I don't want to die. Your men don't want to die. These people don't want to die. It's a shame you're in such a hurry to").<br /><br />Spade pretty much steals the show as a lovable geek who sticks to his guns, even if it makes him a laughingstock. And the geek gets the girl, not the military grunts -- a nice change. Russell is stuck with a rather stiff, humourless military man, although he loosens up in the last lap. And Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital and Erick Avari all get kudos for making the lovable, deep characters come alive without a word of English.<br /><br />The ultimate edition actually has two different versions of the film: the director's cut and the original theatrical edition, and the transfer is awesome. But the extras are a bit skimpy -- basically you have a handful of featurettes (and one is devoted to aliens and the pyramids!) plus some commentary.<br /><br />"Stargate" is a fun movie for the spectacle and slam-bang action scenes, so long as the weak scripting doesn't hold you up. And it served as a good foundation for one of the best "exploration" sci-fi series in ages.</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>Many science fiction films are fairly predictable in either premise or action. This one is not. It is very original and enjoyable.<br /><br />An ancient Egyptian artifact seems to hold some tantalizing clues to an alien civilization. The pentagon has been trying to unravel these clues for decades but their progress is slow and halting until they enlist the aide of a maverick Egyptologist who quickly deciphers the needed clues. Suddenly, the artifact becomes the stargate, a portal to another planet. A team is sent to investigate and finds a colony of humans serving as slaves to mad Egyptian god. They must fight in order to free the slaves, protect themselves and protect the earth.<br /><br />The effects and costumes in this one really add to the sense of wonder. They are at once modernistic and evocative of ancient Egypt. The "science" is a bit hokey but the story is a good one and it is well told. Kurt Russell comes off well as the veteran colonel who leads the expedition and James Spader does an excellent job as the inept scientist.<br /><br />There is no reason for this film to be top ranked in anything except that it is immensely enjoyable and it sticks in the memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Director Roland Emmerich has been largely been known as being an action-film director rather than an "auteur". In the same camp as Michael Bay, they make films that are not supposed to have big personal investments or even good dialogue, they're for pure entertainment value, nothing more. Before they blew up the White House in Independence Day, ruined Godzilla and froze New York, they did Stargate, an intriguing sci-fi movie which unfortunately doesn't have the greatest transfer.<br /><br />It's 1928 and scientists in Egypt have discovered a big artifact. Flash forward to present day and scientist Daniel Jackson gets hired to decipher the artifact, a big stone tablet with markings. Taking 2 weeks he figures it out, it's a "stargate" which has the power to zip to a point in space. Also uncovered with the tablet is the actual stargate which they then open(in probably my favorite water effect since the Abyss' water tentacle) and step through.<br /><br />On the other side, it's actually very reminiscent of ancient Egypt. They find a tribe of people who are governed by the Sun God Ra, who's looking for immortality(aren't they all?). Things get complicated when the US orders that if there's a threat that they blow up the Stargate. But of course Ra finds the bomb and coupled with the mineral he uses the tribe to mine it has an even bigger destructive power than normal. So it's basically stop Ra, save the tribe, and save Earth. Sheesh, you think aliens would attack some other planet for once.<br /><br />It's interesting that a sci-fi movie is actually very modern looking. Besides the technology, it's very low-key. There's no big spaceships a-la Independence Day, big weaponry like Star Wars or odd creatures like Alien. That's part of its charm: it's sci-fi but it's got a bit of a distinctiveness, even though the plot isn't exactly new. You could replace the galaxy travel with time travel and you're in the same ballpark.<br /><br />If there's one thing that's unfortunate is that the transfer is still not that good. This is the 3rd iteration of Stargate on dvd and there's still problems. For one, on occasion I noticed the image got slightly grainy. Another was there was some specks on the image, like black lines. Overall this is a better transfer than the last 2 but there's still problems.<br /><br />Another is that there's very little features. There's a commentary and there's a featurette. Boom, that's it. Kind of like Terminator 2's DVD, one contains a great transfer but very little features while the previous one contained a boatload of features but not the greatest transfer.<br /><br />Similar to Firefly/Serenity which mixed traditional/modern themes with sci-fi, Stargate is an underrated film that while it does have problems here and there, it's still an enjoyable film and since it's Roland, he's pretty much succeeded. Now if he can step it up a notch...</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>STARGATE - Ultimate Edition is the third version on DVD of this visually striking and sometimes hokey tale about an ancient artifact that can zap explorers to a distant Mars-like world.  It's a little misleading to call this the &quot;Ultimate Edition) as it merely transfers  the director's cut of the film from the previous &quot;Special Edition&quot; (but now in anamorphic and not letterbox widescreen) which includes nine additional minutes cut from the theatrical and subsequent first DVD version. Got that straight?  Cool extras abound, however.  <p>There's a spooky documentary in which Erich Von Daniken discusses his &quot;Chariots of the God's&quot; theory of extra-terrestrial visitations in ancient times. The sound on the feature has been remixed in a thunderous 6.1 DTS ES track. There are commentaries and a nice 23 minute making-of featurette.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>The director/producer team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, who gave us Independance Day and Godzilla [ ] first produced this inventive and exciting Sci Fi flick. I'm not usually a fan of this genre, but this one is actually rather good compared with traditional science fiction. Starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the film is basically a homage (French for "rip-off") of the old Sci Fi stories, but there are some interesting ideas and a series of terrific action set-pieces.  The story consists of an Egyptologist who discovers the secret of an ancient relic called the Stargate. The explorer solves the puzzle and then he and a team of soldiers enter the Stargate and discover a city of people who are descendants of the ancient Egyptians. The people worship gods who are actually an alien culture, and then the trouble begins. Great stuff. Dissapointing DVD extras though, with only production notes. One hopes this will be re-released in a "Special Edition" soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>has anyone noticed that there are two versions of the same film? there is the original and then this Special Edition.) did anyone also notice that the original costs more than this Special Edition yet both have the same extras--NO EXTRAS?!!<p>Does it strike anyone else as this being odd?</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Another one of those I heard about for many years but finally got around to seeing just today. I will attempt to make something resembling sense out of this amazing plot line.<br /><br />In ancient times, something was buried in the sands of Egypt. In the 1920s, an archeologist (with his little daughter along for the adventure) uncovered a huge ring of metal unlike anything else known to man. So in the 1990s, Dr. Daniel Jackson (played by a very cute James Spader), was offered a super-secret job inside a decomissioned missile silo in the Colorado mountains. Actually inside the mountains, apparently. This huge ring has been set up there, and the project to figure out what it is and what it is used for is being headed up by the now elderly daughter of the archeologist that found it all those years ago.<br /><br />Actually, Dr. Jackson is needed as one of the rare few who might be able to decipher the symbols on the ring which are not Egyptian hieroglyphics. There are hieroglyphics on the stone which had covered the ring, and I think on the outer edge of the ring, but the ones on the ring itself are alien. Literally, as it turns out. Jackson is able to translate the hieroglyphics and recognize that what the thing is really is a star gate: a portal into somewhere else altogether.<br /><br />A robot probe is sent through and reports back that the conditions on the other side are fit for humans. A group of soldiers and Dr. Jackson are thus detailed to go through and find out what lies on the other side.<br /><br />What they find, predictably, is a civilization which resembles ancient Egypt in many ways, ruled by an alien who uses human bodies, the most recent one of which greatly resembles my former room-mate who is also a Multiply user. (But her voice was a great deal nicer and her temper was a little less caustic.) I'm pretty sure she has seen this movie and I wonder if she agrees about the resemblance.<br /><br />Anyway, there are many hazards to the soldiers being able to return to the earth, including problems on both sides. To detail them would ruin the story for you. But let me ask you this: what would you get if you crossed a camel with a bison?<br /><br />It's good fun, a rousing adventure, and I recommend it. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is that I kept looking for something rather more profound in the way of denouement. Still, real good fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>I came to this movie rather late and I haven't watched the TV series. However, I do enjoy science fiction when it's well done so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The first part was just fine. It was reminiscent of 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind', from which it clearly borrowed a couple of ideas. The main characters were well-established, the concept was intriguing and the special effects were realistic enough to allow disbelief to be suspended. Once the voyagers got to the other end of the stargate, the world they found was both inhospitable yet somewhat familiar, enough to make the concept of humans being relocated there not altogether implausible.<br /><br />The problem is that from there the movie changed. Suddenly the quality of writing and the plot twists dropped to those of a 1950s B-movie. So many cliches were included- the mysterious woman from another planet with whom the hero falls in love, the young rebel reminding the grieving military father of his dead son, the brave peasants revolting against the infinitely superior weapons of the slave masters. Most of all, the cheesy faux-Egyptian villains, totally unbelievable despite a deliciously creepy performance from Jaye Davidson. The fights were hokey and badly staged and although the climax was well-realized, by that time I'd ceased to care.<br /><br />It's not a bad film overall, but it could have been a lot better. Had the strong writing and concepts of the first part of the movie been kept up, it would have been very good indeed. As it is, it's a three-star movie. Why anyone would give it five stars when movies like 'Close Encounters' and 'Contact' did it so much better, I'm not sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RRBPUGD7UOSP.html">A3RRBPUGD7UOSP</a><br/><p>I'm not sure what makes the ultimate edition much different from the special edition, as both include the director's cut and theatrical version. The ultimate edition does include a 'making of' featurette, as well as a 'Is there a stargate' featurette that isn't included on the special edition. These are both interesting, but nothing to write home about. One big difference is the audio. The ult. ed. includes DTS 6.1 audio, as well as dolby digital 5.1.<p>Good: Being a fan of Stargate SG-1, I wanted to own the original movie as well, and when the ult. ed. was released, knew it was time to buy. I watched the director's cut, and was amazed. There were added scenes, as well as extended existing scenes. These changes really gave me a better understanding of how things in the tv show came to be the way they are, such as the relationship between Jack O'Neill and Daniel Jackson. In the director's cut, we see more interaction between them. We also get more into the head of Jack, and better understand just how messed up he really is after the loss of his son.<p>Bad: The only disappointment I have with the ult. ed. is that there were no 'gag reels' or bloopers, or other deleted scenes included. I enjoy watching these on other DVDs I have, and would have loved to have seen them for Stargate.<p>Overall, I'm glad I added this DVD to my collection. My only wish is that the Stargate SG-1 DVDs included behind the scenes or blooper reels as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>First off, once you get past the idea of a Stargate the rest kind of falls into place.  The government, with the help of Professor Daniel Jackson (James Spader), figures out how to work it.  Pro. Jackson, with an escort of soliders led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) step through it to the other side.<br />They find a desert planet where humans are being made to mine for the same material that the gate was made from.<br />The people are Egyptians who were removed from Earth over 10,000 years ago, by an alien, and even Daniel Jackson can't understand their language because living languages CHANGE.<br />The movie is careful to stay away from many of the cliches of most sci-fi movies but also stays away from having characters which are TOO simple.  Both Daniel and Jack (played by James and Kurt) are real people, not cardboard cut-outs, with all the flaws and merits of our own reality.  The natives are catch between trying to be friendly towards strangers AND not pissing off their Gods.<br />The science and technology used by Ra and his men look very sleek and very real.  From the spaceship to the gliders, everything has a touch of old Egyptian myth mixed with advanced alien know-how.<br />The DVD comes with two versions of the movie, Director's Cut and the theatrical cut, in which the former has audio commentary.  The DVDs also have a great 'Making of Stargate' featurette, a 'Is There a Stargate?' short starring Erich von Daniken himself, trailers, scane access, crew and cast information and production notes.<br />Everything you could want in a DVD set, a mixture of sound science fiction, a touch of great effects and the pinch of old fashion adventure.  This is a great pop corn flick.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>The more I see this film, the more it confirms  how much I like it. As a film, I see it primarily as a romance. In the end, a man out of place in one world, finds his place in another, and one man finds meaning in his own world after a very traumatic event. The central force is the romance that one finds in a place across the Galaxy.<br />Comparing the Film with TV series is not worth it. The TV series is rightly stated as "MacGyver Versus the Stargate", since that is what it is set up to be. The film, however, is a stand-alone masterpiece.<br />Emmerich and Devlin team up, and produce a film that works on many levels. You can enjoy the many extras on the discs, however, the Von Danikan add-ons are just fluff. The heart of this film is an excellent script. The soul of it lies in the performers, and the performances.<br />You will probably notice some Emmerich staples, such as some truly superb performers who have appeared in other films by Emmerich and co.<br />The Sound on the DVD  is excellent, and despite some very minor, but incredibly obvious continuity mistakes, the story works. There has not been an intergalactic romance like this since FORBIDDEN PLANET, and both  STARGATE and FORBIDDEN  PLANET are excellent films, each ahead of their time, and both immensely for any fan of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/AW003H7Z3OCHA.html">AW003H7Z3OCHA</a><br/><p>This review is primarily explaining this Remastered HDTV 16:9 5:1 Dolby digital Ultimate Edition / Directors Cut, 2 DVD Set presentation!!<p>Artisan is notorious for re-releasing their DVD over & over again each time giving us more fluff in its DVD package (not necessarily the picture or sound quality).<p>Case in point "STARGATE - Ulitmate Edition Director's Cut.

Capitalizing on the success of the Star Wars films and The Abyss, and foreshadowing Independence Day, it manages to combine our dreams of instantaneous transmission across galactic space with a whole line of modern myths about the visitations of pyramid building aliens.  Hitting just at the right time, it spawned a successful TV series and lingers in the minds of more than a few avid film geeks.<br /><br />After a quick flashback to an old excavation in Egypt where a gigantic ring like artifact is discovered and then promptly whisked away into secrecy were come to the present and see Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) getting laughed out of an academic conference for insisting that Cheops did not build the great pyramid.  Desolate, Jackson is recruited for a translation job.  Brought to some great subterranean base his challenge is to fine the right set of symbols on that ring, which turns out to be something special - a Stargate.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays Jack O'Neil, a suicidally depressed Special Forces commando who will lead the team (Jackson included) through the Stargate when the combination is finally decoded.  Where they find themselves in a pyramid (no surprise there) on a desert planet where humans labor to mine the metal from which the Stargate was made.  This moment of mutual discovery is interrupted by the arrival of the villains in, sure enough, a giant flying pyramid.  A group of aliens took over human bodies millennia ago and has been living forever ever since.<br /><br />The film is predictable in the extreme - a feel good film with one of those spectacular endings where everything turns out right and the audience yells and whistles with delight.  In other words it's fun, but of the lightweight sort.  Acting is evenly forgettable, but survives having a cast the majority of which talk in an incomprehensible ancient Egyptian dialog.  Jaye Davidson gets a few extra points for making a pretty faced boy look totally evil, but don't look for much in the way of high drama.<br /><br />Still, I liked it then, and I like it now, especially the hokey Egyptian space furniture and animal headed costumes.  It's silliness in a good cause - something to shake a scepter at.  Don't get fooled too much by the 'Ultimate' thing.  You get a feature on Von Daniken, writer of Chariots of the Gods, and a narrative commentary, all easily skippable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Stargate" is one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies and this release is well worth having. The picture quality is not quite as good as hoped, but it is certainly more than acceptable.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me. The story centers around Daniel Jackson (James Spader), an Egyptologist who's "crackpot" ideas have isolated him from his academic peers, and Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), a very troubled Special Forces Colonel, as they unravel the mystery of the Stargate and deal with hostile aliens (later known as the Gould). Interestingly, several of the of the actors who appear in the movie also show up in the SG-1 series, but not Spader or Russell.<br /><br />This is very good Sci-Fi and should be watched if you are planning on seeing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBNHQ">Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection</a> or the spin-off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018SLGG0">Stargate Atlantis Seasons 1-4</a>.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>I saw this film in theaters years ago, and just viewed it on BD. The story includes all of the elements that make an interesting sci-fi flick, and it includes a dash of romance. The storyline of the "passageway" between dimensions is not unique, but since the film was released several years ago, I would need to say that it still stands up today in terms of relevance.<br /><br />It manages to be a sci-fi film, while still focusing on the core concept, which is not really laden with special effects, but rather pulls the watcher in with a mind bending concept. Though many scientific explanations of bending time and space are absent, the story still unfolds in an engaging manner. The film did seem a bit long and drawn out in parts, and in comparison with more recent sci-fi flicks, which seem to rely on non-stop action, as opposed to complex storylines, some may find this one a bit "drawn out". However, if you are more interested in an interesting film, this one may be for you.<br /><br />PQ 3.5/5, sound 4/5.

May 27, 2003<br />Guess I didn't like the bad guy and the fact that he seems to be a Michael Jackson imitation, in the worse sense, and surrounded himself with children. If you can get past that this would get 5 stars from me.  Also, It is a movie I can watch with my 12 year son and my 20 year sons. My 6 and 10 year old daughters didn't like it though and they like anything starring "Jack Burton".<p>The new TV show based on this movie is also worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ.html">A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ</a><br/><p>watched first 1/2 hour - was nice and interesting - but then DVD proved defective and wasted a lot of time - both dvd's were defective.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...and therefore of course highly recommended for those of you who enjoy sci-fi-adventure-movies, and previous and later releases of director Roland Emmerich. The special-effects are rather impressive, costumes and acting as well (Kurt Russell as always delievers with a certain style).<br /><br />There's an Indiana Jones-feel to "Stargate", mostly because of the fabolous music-score of course (very similar to the Indiana-score I think) -but there's also just as much adventure to the movie, perfect for a day you spend indoors because of bad weather or such.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>I have to hand it to science fiction; it is one of the few genres that can have mediocre acting and still be a good movie.  Stargate's story is the reason for its success.  The movie tells the story of a race of aliens that used (notice how I did not say built) an interstellar portal, called a Stargate, in order to bring humans to a new planet for slave labor.  This all happened during the time of ancient Egypt, so there is a disticnt Egyptian flavor throughout the film, which I found very intriguing.  In 1928, archeaologists find the Stargate and are baffled by it.  In the present day, the Stargate is in the hands of the United States Air Force, and they hire an Egyptologist named Daniel Jackson (James Spader) to decipher the markings on the gate.  Jackson is somewhat infamous in his field, because he denies that humans built the pyramids.  He believes that it was done by aliens, but he has no proof to back it up.  The Air Force also brings in an old retired colonel, named Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) in order to "supervise" the project.  Once Jackson gets the Stargate operational, a team, led by O'Neil and including Jackson for scientific purposes, goes through the gate and ends up on a planet in a galaxy far far away (sorry, I couldn't help myself).  On the planet, they encounter other humans who still speak ancient Egyptian as well as a race of humanoid aliens who are keeping the men as slaves.<br />The story is very inventive and it is what finally saved the movie for me.  Spader did okay in his role, but Russell seemed to have two modes: angry and sarcastic.  One thing that I didn't understand was that Russell gets top billing, but the movie is essentially about Spader's Jackson.  Also, I didn't like Ra (Jaye Davidson), the leader of the aliens.  He was a good character, but he was so creepy just because he looks so much like a woman!  I could barely look at him it was so disturbing.  But besides these two things, Stargate is a great movie.  The effects are great, and as I have already stated, the story is amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>If you're like me, you are really - really - getting tired of producers, film compaines, whomever there is to blame re-re-re-releasing the same DVD with different packaging, and calling it the &quot;Ultimate&quot; or &quot;Supreme&quot; or &quot;this time it really is a Limted edition&quot; special releases. The motivation? Raking it in from fans who expect and want more.

Don't expect E.T. type wonder and awe at every alternate pace, the whole extravaganza is fast-paced and compulsively watchable in a way that only a foolhardy scifi movie can be. Highly recommended for people looking for some action.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>This film begins with much promise, establishing the existence of the "stargate", an ancient device discovered in Egypt, which could function as the portal to another world, if only the key to its use can be deciphered.  Scientist and linguist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an eccentric expert in hieroglyphics enlisted into a secret US Government project.  His task, to translate the wring on an ancient stone tablet, the directions how to access the stargate.<br /><br />Spader is perfect as a sniffling, nearsighted, academic type who seems bewildered at times, by the real world.  His natural brilliance provides the means to get the stargate working.  The first humans to attempt to use the stargate, will be an armed military unit, led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell).  They will perform a recon mission at wherever the stargate leads to.  Jackson goes along to make sure they group can return from the other side.  The team heads through the stargate, and pop out through a similar stargate in another world.  They find themselves inside a huge stone pyramid in the middle of a desert.  Jackson can't get the team back to Earth without additional information, so further exploration of the planet becomes necessary, and the party from Earth, eventually discovers a band of less advanced desert dwellers. <p>All this is fine, rather credible and interesting.  The interaction and learning process between the two peoples is naturally awkward.  Where things start to go off track is when the supernatural element is introduced.  "Ra" the ancient Egyptian sun god, is turned into an alien, in order to facilitate a "battle for the planet".  The charm and warmth begins to fade, and the story morphs into something we've seen before.  An interesting and provocative concept just goes to waste, and James Spader's excellent performance is somewhat obscured by his dubious transition from bookworm to fighter.  Stargate misses an opportunity to be something special.  <p>A few other items to mull over.  The story is set in a desert, but the heat must not be very intense, and never really seems to bother anyone, from the soldiers in dark uniforms, to the guys with the gigantic headgear who should be ready to faint.  The Earth soldiers initially found the desert people at work, after Jackson was dragged by a desert beast.  He should have been roasted like a hot dog by the hot sand.  And how about those desert people, toiling in the heat, then travelling across the desert, apparently not even carrying any water.  At one point, Jackson eats a candy bar, and later offers one as a gift, but in neither instance has the chocolate melted in the heat.  The small team from Earth apparently brought enough weapons with them to arm the entire planet.  That's good, because the "primitive" native kids handle firearms like combat veteran commandos.  And why, like so many other movies, do the interior sets look so sterile and fake.  Thousands of years later, and Ra and his band still dress like ancient Egyptians?  Talk about a time warp.  Who or what is flying the craft that attack the desert people?  Robots, or does Ra do pilot training too?  <p>David Arnold's music does a good job of making some of the mundane scenes seem exciting.  If you don't expect too much, Stargate will suffice as an evening's entertainment.  Something to watch, and then immediately dismiss.  You won't however, be able to watch the regular edition DVD, without at least getting up once to flip the disc over to side B. That's right, the disc needs to be flipped over</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>On its face, a movie about aliens enslaving ancient Egyptians could seems more like a failed Sci-Fi Channel idea than a blockbuster hit. Yet, through a mixture of likable characters, exciting action sequences, and strong soundtrack, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000844I8">Stargate</a> is surprisingly good. I hadn't watched it in years, but was pleasantly surprised when I watched it recently that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000844I8">Stargate</a> has held up pretty well all these years. Moreover, I watched the movie with my wife, who is definitely not a fan of sci-fi movies, and she loved it. The movie and plot are pretty accessible to any audience.<br /><br />Some of the special effects look a bit dated. It's not too bad, but I do think it might be worth investing in a special edition and adding better graphics (especially for that desert animal in the beginning). By and large though, the special effects are more than adequate to make the movie work.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>In 1968, a man named Erich von D&auml;niken wrote the book "Chariots of the Gods" in which he proposed the idea that the pyramids of ancient Egypt may have been built by extraterrestrial aliens and not by ancient humans.  Though few Egyptologists gave any credence to Mr. von D&auml;niken's idea, his concept may have inspired Roland Emmerich to direct a very entertaining sci-fi film in 1994 that was entitled "Stargate" that he also co-wrote with Dean Devlin.<br /><br />The film begins in the early part of the twentieth century on the Giza Plateau in Egypt where archeologists uncover a very unusual object: a large circular stone with never-before-seen symbols engraved upon it.  Beneath the circular stone was an even more puzzling object: a circular wheel with the same unknown symbols engraved throughout its circumference.  One of the archeologist's daughters, a teenaged girl named Catherine Langford (Kelly Vint) finds a gold necklace with a pendant that contains an etching of the eye of the Egyptian god Ra, which she keeps.  The film then moves back into the present where a eccentric language expert named Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is attempting to give a presentation to a less-than-receptive audience.  As the members of the audience leave shortly after he begun his presentation, an older woman waits towards the back of the room to speak with him.  The woman is Catherine Langford (played by Viveca Lindfors, 1920-1995), who had earned a Ph.D. of her own, and presents Dr. Jackson with an interesting proposal to make some much-needed money to translate some mysterious symbols.  He accepts the offer and is whisked away by the U.S. military to an underground military base in Colorado.  There, Dr. Jackson quickly impresses everyone by successfully translating a message written in ancient Egyptian that contains the mysterious name "stargate".  He is then presented with the large circular cover stone and given the task of translating the symbols.  At first, he has no idea what the symbols are, but upon seeing some zodiacal star drawings from a newspaper, Dr. Jackson quickly realizes that the mysterious symbols represent star constellations.  Apparently, other Ph.D.'s that include Barbara Shore (Rae Allen) and Gary Meyers (Richard Kind), had already figured out the same thing; but they were missing the translation of one particular symbol and they needed a total of seven.  Since the project was controlled by the U.S. military and required top secret security clearance, Dr. Jackson had no knowledge of the actual stargate's existence, but had already understood from the cornerstone that a total of seven symbols were required to travel: six that identify the destination and one that identifies the point of origin.  The military commander, Col. Jonathan 'Jack' O'Neil (Kurt Russell), then tells the others to show Dr. Jackson the device and he quickly shows them what they had all been waiting for: the seventh symbol.  Upon entering all seven symbols, which the stargate rotates to lock into place, a massive wormhole resembling a sideways whirlpool is created.  Where the wormhole goes to no one knows, but the U.S. military intends to find out.  However, there's just one problem: who would be able to translate the symbols on the presumed stargate on the other side of the wormhole?  Dr. Jackson says that he can.  With that, he, Col. O'Neil and a group of soldiers venture into the wormhole and emerge on the opposite side of the Universe on an alien planet.  There, they will discover things that had been unknown to humanity for many thousands of years; but what they discover may also be very dangerous.  Will activating the stargate threaten Earth?  If so, can Earth be protected and from what?  Will the travelers even be able to return to Earth at all?  You'll just have to watch this truly imaginative film to find out!<br /><br />With a combination of good dialog, an interesting plot, a creative way to expound upon ancient mythologies, mostly engaging characters and good special effects, "Stargate" is a very entertaining film.  Other important characters in the film include Skaara (Alexis Cruz), Sha'uri (Mili Avital), Lieutenant Kawalsky (John Diehl), Anubis (Carlos Lauchu), 'Good Father' Kasuf (Erick Avari), Nabeh (Gianin Loffler) and the leading alien known as Ra (Jaye Davidson), whom ancient humans thought was a god. The film did fairly well in theaters when it was released in 1994, and the Sci-Fi Channel began production of a TV series based upon the film and named "Stargate: SG1" three years later.  In 2004, another TV series based upon the original "Stargate" film and the "Stargate: SG1" TV series was unveiled on the Sci-Fi Channel and named "Stargate: Atlantis".  Both "Stargate: SG1" and "Stargate: Atlantis" have greatly expanded upon the storyline that was created in this original film that I give an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  Other films that Roland Emmerlich directed include "Universal Soldier" (1992) and "Independence Day" (1996, which he also co-wrote again with Dean Devlin).</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"Stargate" is a fun film,for all its wacky cheesiness. Kurt Russell stars as a Marine, Jack, who's mourning his wife's death&is suicidal. James Spader stars as the geeky Egyptologist Daniel. The androgynous Jaye Davidson (from "The Crying Game") is Ra,a tyrannical alien who recalls Michael Jackson with his delicate voice&retinue of boys.<br /><br />"Stargate" has an interesting premise. Daniel finds the stargate&thinks it's from outer space. His fellow academics laugh at him.. but it turns out to be a portal to ancient Egypt. There,Ra is lording his power over humans. Daniel romances a native girl (it's not as kinky as Spader's usual ventures,but may be disturbing to some viewers),finds out Ra's true nature,while Jack raises a revolt. Good triumphs (of course). Ra turns out merely to be an evil parasite,somewhat like the fake gods in Star Trek (think of "Who cries for Adonis?")<br /><br />"Stargate" is good cheesy fun.

Is history as we know it based on wrong assumptions and misinterpretations of the historical record? Or better yet, has the real history of the planet Earth been willfully and purposely hidden from us by those who don't want us to know the truth?<br /><br />Stargate asks you to challenge some of those basic assumptions and simply sit back and enjoy a cosmic adventure transporting a renegade Egyptologist and a band of military personnal across the universe via an alien device known as a 'Stargate.' This small band of explorers instantaneously arrive on a distant planet where they will not only discover a civilization much like what once existed on ancient Earth, but the forgotten origin of man's belief in heavenly powers and those beings of myth and legend that were worshipped as Gods.<br /><br />James Spader is perfect as Daniel Jackson, the brilliant Eygptologist with the cutting edge theories as is Kurt Russell as Colonel Jack O'Neil, the emotionally dead but duty bound commandeer in charge of the expedition. Also great performances from Jay Davidson as the Sun God, Ra and the very attractive Mili Avital as Sha'uri. Everything works in this sci-fi extravaganza; cinematography and special effects are first rate as is the screenplay.<br /><br />Throughly enjoyable from beginning to end and it will leave you with something to think about and maybe explore on your own concerning some of the unorthodox beliefs circulating around today concerning man's past and destiny. It never hurts to think outside of the box.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I love Stargate, and give the movie 5 stars.

The premise is that the ancient Egyptian society that built the pyramids was based on a sophisticated space traveler that needed a host for his failing alien body and found one on Earth. This became the basis for the Egyptian sun god Ra and the reason for the construction of the pyramids.<br /> For reasons that are unexplained, "Ra" left a powerful device in the Egyptian desert that, with a companion device light years away, form a star gate where materials could be transported in a manner of seconds.  Professor Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an expert on ancient Egypt and his theories of alien assistance in building the pyramids are ridiculed.<br /> However, there is one person that takes him seriously and she asks for his assistance, so Daniel goes to a secret Air Force Facility where the Earth side of the star gate resides. Daniel is able to decipher the markings on the device so that it can be used and Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) leads a military team with Daniel through the star gate to another world. Daniel's role is to decipher the symbols at the other location so that the team can return.<br /> Once the team arrives on the other planet, the plot falls apart. The first unweaving is when Daniel admits that he cannot immediately decipher the return-gate. Some of the soldiers in the team push him around and even throw away his suitcase containing his books. Given that Daniel and his knowledge base is their only hope in returning to Earth this was stupid. To have been selected for such a mission, the soldiers would have been the elite forces, selected for their sturdy mental construction and discipline, surely not ones to push their salvation around.<br />  After some exploring of the planet, the team discovers a large group of humans living in primitive conditions and building a pyramid. The plot is further complicated when Ra returns to the planet to exact revenge and wants to send a nuclear bomb back through the star gate to destroy Earth. That bomb has conveniently been provided by the military team. Why a creature with such a powerful space ship would need that tactical nuclear weapon to exact revenge on Earth is one of many foolish plot premises left unexplained.<br /> There is also a love interest between Daniel and a native woman that leads to an ending that screamed "Sequel!" Apparently there were plans to make one but they were unachieved, which is not such a bad thing. This movie is awful, often very simplistic for a story based on powerful and sophisticated space travelers.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>STARGATE SG-1 and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER have one major thing in common:  both are highly successful television series based on far less successful television series.  STARGATE the movie had a fine initial premise for a Sci-Fi film, but it is a premise that actually lends itself more towards a television series.  The central idea is that a series of Stargates established by ancient aliens with a parasitic involvement with the human race, which they have enslaved and use as hosts, points more towards a serial narrative than a stand-alone narrative.  The very existence of a variety of Stargates establishes this.  This is one of those instances where a film has been reborn as a vastly more successful television series.<br /><br />Considered entirely on its own, however, this is not a terribly successful film.  It suffers from multiple problems, though it also has a few successes.  In the plus column goes the overall concept, the excellent performance by James Spader as Daniel Jackson, many of the sets and much of the art design, and the wonderful score.  The negatives are, unfortunately, more numerous.  I like Kurt Russell and have always regretted that he has not been in more major productions, but his incredibly wooden performance here creates a major energy drag on the film.  I understand that he is playing burnt out case, but I don't think the attempt was very successful.  He was a leaden in this one as he was in SOLDIER, where he played a futuristic soldier that had had all his emotions programmed out.  Another serious casting problem was the use of Jaye Davidson in the role of Ra.  Davidson was amazingly effective in THE CRYING GAME as a transsexual, but he simply does not have the screen presence to be an effective film villain.  He is also an extremely tiny person (around 5'3) and his lack of stature necessitated his not being filmed very often in the same frame as the other actors.  He simply did not manage to come across as a sufficiently menacing presence.<br /><br />By far the biggest problem with the film is the narrative.  The film works fine at first in laying out the existence of the Stargate and in showing Daniel Jackson at work in figuring out how it works, but once that is done the plot becomes fairly trite, as if they had come up with a premise but didn't really care what story they hung upon it.  As a result the second half of the film simply isn't very interesting.  To make matters worse, the final hour is poorly paced and directed.  In other words, the second half of the film told an uninteresting story badly.<br /><br />Still, if one plans on watching the television series--and if one enjoys Sci-Fi I strongly encourage it--then seeing this movie is recommended.  It helps to know where the series came from.  It also explains the relationship between Daniel Jackson and Sha're as well as O'Neill and Jackson to Skaara.  But even on its own, while not a good film, it is not an out and out bad one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>Well if this sounds familiar about an ultimate edition that's because it is all to familiar , tip for those who buy DVD's out<br />there if it's not offerd in Dts then there usually will be a huge<br />much more elaborite version as is in the case with Stargate sure<br />im curious as to what this film will sound like in full Dts sound<br />I, mean yeah it's going to be awsome.And is it worth the extra 10<br />dollars yes because nothing can beat Dts as far as home theatre<br />sound but why did they not put this version out , Star Trek has<br />done the same exact thing putting a 2 disk version of there first<br />four films and Lord Of The Rings is going to do it with all three<br />films but are doing it with grace and respectibility thinking of<br />the film and not just a bunch of extra features.<p>  Stargate is a good movie it is exciting and fun to watch the<br />journey into the Stargate and James Spader and Kurt Russell are<br />great as a pairing and the special effects still to this day are<br />mind blowing but movie companys need to learn that what you put<br />in your special or ultimate edition is just as important as the<br />film itself which the only bonus that I, see on this edition is<br />Dts the other options do not look any diffrent from other special<br />editions of this type , so what happens when Warner Brothers is<br />going to bring out The Matrix Reloaded will we have to purchase<br />The Matrix as a 2 disk format this seems to be now only another<br />marketing in the similarity that directors have of selling there<br />film and it does get frustrating if only you could get reimbursed<br />when you bought the new edition of the film, so in actuality with<br />this Stargate version instead of getting a cheesburger as you did<br />before now there giving you a double cheesburger and there hoping<br />you bite into it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>This movie builds up pretty good to the moment when the soldiers cross the wormhole, but it is downhill from there on. The egyptian theme is fine, but the rendition of it is poor and limited. This film feels almost rushed with little care to improve depth and details of the story and characters. Overall: MEDIOCRE.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I just watched this for the first time since I saw it in 1994, and I must say that with the exception of a few scenes, this is a boring forwula-driven film.  While Jaye Davidson is a very interesting RA - "I created your culture, now I will destroy it" - and Spader and Russell are exceptional actors, they cannot make up for the silly themes of oppressed people uprising, the establishment of a "team spirit" among the hapless military who took the trip, etc.  It just doesn't hang together all that well and there is very little originiality.  If you are a fan of hard scifi, don't bother with this one.  It is just barely a cut above junk.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>more cgi effects more money better movie for horror fanatics in all countries.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Before they achieved success with the idiotic Independence Day, director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin spawned this mind numbing sci-fi hit which would inspire a much more intelligent hit cable TV series.  James Spader stars as an Egyptologist who, along with Kurt Russell and his band of troops, are sent to the otherside of the known universe courtesy of an interdimensional transportation device called the Stargate.  Once there, they discover a culture much like that of ancient Egypt which is ruled by Ra (Jaye Davidson) who uses his boyish appearance to cover up his alien form.  When the film was released it was roasted by many a critic, but as the dynamic duo of Emmerich and Devlin later proved with Independence Day, it's the box office receipts that matter.  The special effects still hold up today, and the action scenes are rousing as well despite the hokey and lacking screenplay.  This seems like the umpteenth release of Stargate on DVD; first the Special Edition, now this Ultimate Edition; what's next the Super Extreme Edition?  Anyway, Artisan usually makes good and affordable DVD's (this one is no exception) but for God's sake, quit re-releasing and re-releasing just for the sake of more extras and different packaging.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>The film 'Stargate' is based on an interesting albeit not entirely original premise -- the idea that the ancients have been visited from beings from the stars is as ancient as is humanity; the particular idea for this film probably came from the Erik von Daniken type of UFO conjectures quite in vogue in the 1970s.  In all, it is an intriguing idea, pulling in the mystery of ancient civilisations, the ancient pyramids, the mysticism that underlies all forms of writing, and pictographic/hieroglyphic writing at that, and good old fashioned heroism.<p>The story begins with a discovery during the golden age of Middle Eastern archaeology, in the early twentieth century.  Drawing on ideas that still circulate today in real academic circles that the pyramids and other structures pre-date the actual historically-recorded empires in Egypt, in the story it turns out the discovery was actually an ancient device that served as a passageway for extraterrestrials who needed mining workers for the resources of this and other planets.<p>The key to this 'stargate' is embedded in the inscriptions on the device, and Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is the only one who can decipher them.  Jackson is a down-on-his-luck Egyptologist whose out-of-this-world ideas rendered him unemployed and destitute -- the perfect recruit for a secret government mission.<p>Enter into the scene Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russell), a depressive, mourning military officer pulled out of retirement to take charge of a near-certain-death mission through the stargate.  The clash between the academics/scientists and the military is a classic story development, but the clash is shortlived here as the team going to the distant planet must work together.  <p>Arriving on the distant planet, they find people and environment similar to that of ancient Egypt, and the whole civilisation has the purpose of mining minerals for their 'god', who turns out to be an extraterrestrial with nearly infinite lifespan and manipulative ways of subduing cultures, primarily by keeping them illiterate and technologically backward.  This 'god' presented himself as 'Ra' to the ancient Egyptians (played here by Jaye Davidson, the ambiguous star of the 'The Crying Game', being the only other film he starred in before opting out of acting). <p>The action picks up with 'Ra' arriving for a regular shipment, only to find the Earth team ready to begin revolution and destroy the distant stargate with a smuggled nuclear weapon.<p>The special effects are good if not innovative; the idea of the device and the method of transport is an effective use of special effects technology at hand, and much is carried on the story and the idea of the device rather than the actual computer or miniature effects.  This has proven a boon to the producers, who are able to budget for a weekly series derivative of this film, not something originally planned with the production of this film.<p>The acting is good, occasionally great.  The perhaps the best character is Viveca Lindfors, who plays the daughter of the original archaeologist who discovered the device; now an elderly woman, her dream comes true of activating the device. Lindfors died the year after this film was made, after a career in acting that spanned over six decades.  Watch closely for French Stewart, as a disgruntled soldier, barely recognisable as the same person who plays on 'Third Rock from the Sun', a very different science fiction idea.<p>In all, this is a good story, a fine film and it captures the imagination well.  It is not over the top and doesn't overwork the classic science fiction stereotypes.  The special edition contains interesting commentary from the director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin in director's cut, includes the theatrical trailer, includes both director's cut and theatrical cut, and presents things in a widescreen format.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RRBPUGD7UOSP.html">A3RRBPUGD7UOSP</a><br/><p>Not many films can say that they have spawned a television series. None that I can think of other than Stargate can say they've spawned a series that's lasted as long as Star Trek: The Next Generation. That's a feat in my book!<p>This film takes the viewer to Egypt where an ancient device is unearthed. The device, the Stargate, has the power to hurtle a traveler to distant parts of the universe almost instantly. A team consisting of Col. Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell), his team of soldiers, and Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader), an Egyptologist go through the gate to explore the world on the other side. They find the planet populated, and learn that not all the beings they meet are friendly.<p>The action and special effects in this film are first-rate. The actors are all excellent, and play very believable parts. Spader in particular does a very good job playing the geek. Russell, similar to his role in 'Soldier', plays a stone-cold military robot, only so because of extenuating circumstances you'll see in the film.<p>The special edition DVD is filled with extras such as deleted scenes that have been put back into the film. These scenes add to the overall experience of the film and help the viewer to understand the characters better. I particularly enjoy the 'making of' featurettes.<p>Pick this one up, it's a keeper!</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>Straight up, I love "Stargate", and that is why I gave this a 5 star rating. I have been a big fan of the movie for ages and still consider it to be one of the best movies made ever.<br /><br />In this package, you get both the original theatrical release and the extended version of the movie. I question the use of "Ultimate" in the edition description, as the extended version adds very little to the story. In some cases, I agree with the decision to cut the scene from the theatrical release, such as the first scene of the ancient Egyptian lad running towards the huge pyramid ship. While the extras are great, they do not add all that much to the original movie.<br /><br />The Extra Features, on the other hand, are very interesting and worth a look at. I enjoyed them a lot, almost as much as the movie itself.<br /><br />"Stargate" is still one of the science-fiction greats that successfully blends history and science-fiction in one effective plot. It is a great movie with wide appeal, full of action and adventure. It is a bit predictable in some respects, but these are of small concern overall.<br /><br />This edition is very good for those who have not got a "Stargate" DVD, but for those who have already got one, it will add little to your experience of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H2JJ3GEMJN1.html">A13H2JJ3GEMJN1</a><br/><p>I like this movie. I've liked it ever since I first saw it in theatrical release and I liked it enough to buy this DVD "Ultimate Edition" a few years ago. Despite this, however, I'm finding it hard to explain exactly why.<br /><br />There's nothing profound or particularly clever in STARGATE. It's not outstanding in any way. In fact, as the professional reviews above point out, it's pretty hokey. But, if you like this type of hokey scifi adventure, you'll probably like STARGATE, too. As with INDEPENDENCE DAY, the Indiana Jones movies, or the STAR WARS movies, it's just fun to sit back and watch (not to compare it to those flicks, but it's in the same genre). The good guys win and the bad guys get what they deserve when the dust clears. The plot's pretty predictable, but there's lots of action and a few tense moments. Going through the star gate for the first time, not knowing what's on the other side, gives you a little tingle if you haven't seen the movie before.<br /><br />STARGATE is another fun ride for fans of the scifi/adventure movie genre. If you like this kind of movie, don't miss this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Watching the movie, it's easy to see how this was turned into a TV series, had a spin-off series (Atlantis with another on the way) and a new movie now in the works. The film is very original, that's the best part of the entire thing. You have never seen or heard things that this film is showing and saying.<br /><br />The Stargate itself is a really cool thing to look; very good special effects are all over the movie. From the ships to the wardrobe, this film looks amazing. The story is also very compelling and very interesting. An alien, posed as their god Ra, kidnapping humans from Egypt way in the past and has made them slaves...what's cooler than that? The characters are also people you actually care about. Kurt Russell and Spader do an excellent job in the film. Overall, this film is another that to be seen to be believed. It really is hard to describe and has to be seen!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>My dad and I first saw this around 5 years ago, and it has been a favorite ever since.

Emmerich couples outstanding visual effects with tremendous audio and some interesting special features on the DVD.<p>In the cast, both Spader and Jaye Davidson contribute strong performances.  Spader is the everyman who is a specialist in some sort of obscure intelligentsia who gets confronted with action and involved with people when his science comes alive.  He makes the right choices and has both the audience and the rest of the cast rooting for him as he stumbles into his eventual success.  An interesting actor who can play a naive hero or a driven villain, Spader leads the way in this film.  Jaye Davidson is chilling as the villain.  Without words, his presence on screen can make you feel his lack of remorse and his willingness to do away with everything that comes between him and his final destiny.<p>Soldiers in the cast include the oft-cast Russell as the commander of the mission, in, what is typical for him, a &quot;strong jaw&quot; role.<p>Critics have challenged this movie as absurd and cliche, but after all, what is science fiction trying to accomplish?  Stargate had success at the box office and on video precisely because of its entertainment value and the visual excitement generated by combining technology with a society that rivals the ancient Egyptians.  Although you may rent instead of buy, you will enjoy this entertaining film, and may return to it again and again because it draws you in and keeps you entertained until the very last (and yes, it is a heart-warming finale!)<p>Try it, you'll like it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>It is interesting to watch the 1994 &quot;Stargate&quot; film from the perspective of the spin-off television series, &quot;Stargate SG-1,&quot; which is on its way to becoming the longest running science-fiction series of all-time.  As was the case with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; we have an okay film that becomes a first-rate television series.  <p>Once upon a time, 1928 to be exact, archeologists discovered a strange disc buried in the sand of Egypt.  The next thing we know we are in the present, and Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader), is having his colleagues walk out on him as he explains his radical theory about the ancient Egyptians and their language.  But then a mysterious old woman (Viveca Lindfors) gives him an invitation to travel to a secret military base buried beneath the Rocky Mountains to do translations.  Jackson has nothing else to do, so he shows up, immediately corrects all the mistakes and figures out all the mysteries, and the next thing we know he is being shown the Stargate.  He then joins a military group led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), who has been recalled back to active duty to find out where you go to when you step through the Stargate.  The answer is you go to the other side of the known universe where you discover a desert planet where an alien who was known as Ra (Jaye Davidson) by the ancient Egyptians is lording it over the local humanoids.  <p>This movie is mostly eye candy.  Being shot on a desert planet means that it has lots of scenes shot in bright sunlight, which really is unusual for a science fiction film, where they tend to be dark and murky.  &quot;Stargate&quot; brings back the same sort of ideological tension between scientists and the military that we enjoyed during the 1950s with films like &quot;The Thing From Another World,&quot; as Jackson is all excited to explore a brave new world and O'Neill is looking for an excuse to blow everything up with the nuke in the big suitcase.<p>Truth about this movie is that it the ideas are a lot better than than the execution.  The idea of the Stargate is a nice way of circumventing the laws of physics that scoff at warp drive and other narrative necessities to a good space yarn.  It is not a far leap of logic to get from this one Stargate to the idea that there are others, and there is also the nice corrollary that this system explains why there are so many humans scattered throughout the galaxy where they all live on oxygen breathing planets.  <p>Beyond that the television series picks up on the Jackson-O'Neill dyad, reducing it to the idea that one is an academic and the other is a warrior and never the twain shall meet.  Of course Richard Dean Anderson's O'Neill is even quirkier than Spader's Jackson, while Michael Shanks's Jackson starts off even more humorless than Russell's O'Neill.  But it all works, so why quibble?  The original &quot;Stargate&quot; ends up being more about style than substance, which is why it is so interesting that the television series could find something substantial upon which to build a television series.  <p>If you have yet to see &quot;Stargate&quot; in any version, then you are strongly urged to proceed immediately from this 1994 film to the first season of &quot;Stargate SG-1.&quot;  Even if you find this film tedious, just get through it and move on to the good stuff.  You could not pass go and head directly for season one of &quot;Stargate SG-1,&quot; but you really need to know the players and some of the rules of the game before hand.</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>OK To You Out There Who Don't Own This Wonderful Sci-Fi Action Motion Picture. then i would suggest in getting it because it a great set not only do you get the theatrical version that was shown in theaters the  first time, but you get the director's cut which in my opinion is better. the sound and picture are excellent  those of you with a good dolby sound systems should try the 6.1 mix it great and at this price you'd be crazy not to. i think the story of stargate is just wonderful it's about time travel and lost civilizations James Spader  stars as a professor of archaeology and ancient languages is contacted by the government to solve a mystery within it's wall once opened then maybe secrets can be revealed of long lost  civilization in another universe. it's great story love it.<br /><br />It Stars: James Spader ( Of Pretty in Pink  ) Kurt Russell ( The Thing, OverBoard,Backdraft )<br /><br />Update Note: My review was for the original release with both versions of film in the case, although the director's  cut is much better. it would've been nicer if they would have  left this edition alone and left the original cut in this set and not confused the public.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Stargate" is fun, pure and simple.  It takes history and science, spins them around in a blender with a cup of fiction, and cranks out a reasonably believable sci-fi classic.  Starring James Spader as a geeky scientist who's really into decoding Egyptian heiroglyphics and a hard-nosed and slightly mentally unstable soldier played by Kurt Russell, "Stargate" gives the viewer a couple of things to ponder.  What if "Ra" wasn't an actual god worshipped by early Egyptians, but an alien looking for a nice group of simpletons to turn into his slaves?  What if those simpletons began to pick up on Ra's deception and run him off, only to have him gather up a few stragglers and start a slave colony on another planet that's linked to Earth via a "Stargate?"<br /><br />All of this sounds a little silly, but deep inside, we all know that there are some reasons to actually entertain the thought that aliens did interact with the ancient Egyptians.  No matter here, it's just used as a backdrop for a wonderful story in which Spader, Russell, and a team of soldiers trek off to the other end of the Stargate in order to see what's there.  When they do get to the other side, they find a colony of people enslaved by Ra.  They're also trying to decipher the gate on their end of the universe in order to get home.  They figure out the entire gate's code almost immediately, except for one symbol, which forces them to interact with the slave colony.  Slowly but surely, they prove to the slaves that Ra can be overthrown and that he isn't an actual god.  Rebellion ensues, and our heroes aid in the battle all the while trying to break the final code.<br /><br />This is a very fun flick to watch.  It mixes just enough parts history, science, and gee-whiz to make for a wonderful tale.  Along with Russell and Spader, it stars French Stewart (Third Rock From The Sun) as one of Russell's troops and Jaye Davidson as Ra.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and sci-fi in general.  The Devlin/Emmerich team hit a homerun with this one before stumbling a bit with "Independence Day."  This film is much better and more believable than that flick in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>I've never seen the TV series that this movie spawned; this is a review of the movie on its own terms.<p>This movie is _so_ close to being great that it's frustrating not to be able to award it five stars. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin had a terrific idea here and _almost_ sustained it for the length of a feature film.<p>The essential idea owes a lot to Robert A. Heinlein's _Tunnel in the Sky_ (and some of the plot details show debts to other Heinlein works as well). There's this stargate, see . . .<p>Well, that's enough about the plot, just in case you haven't seen it yet. For SF geeks like me, the first hour and a half is like a wet-dream come true. The ending doesn't exactly fall apart or anything, it's just that it doesn't manage to remain at the high level of the first two-thirds of the movie.<p>As Col. Jack O'Neil, Kurt Russell is terrific as usual (and I happen to think he deserves far more credit as an actor than he's generally gotten). James Spader is a bit hammy but generally credible as Daniel Jackson, the absent-minded academic-outcast astro-Egyptologist dweeb. In lesser hands these two characters could have devolved into cliches, but these actors manage to keep them alive. Of course there's also Jaye Davidson, the special secret surprise from _The Crying Game_, here used very effectively in a role I can't say anything about without spoiling the plot.<p>David Arnold's soaring score is just awesome. You'll want to plug your DVD player into your sound system for this one (if you don't have it there already).<p>And the plot is intellectually engaging for at least most of the way through. The, um, foreign culture in question is nicely evoked and fleshed out, with a few cinematic nods to everything from _Dune_ to Indiana Jones to _The Man Who Would Be King_, and without too many of the oversimplifications that always threaten films of this sort.<p>I have no idea at all how well the TV series has done in sustaining this stuff. But the movie stands quite well on its own.<p>The _Ultimate_ DVD set includes both a 'director's cut' and the original theaterical-release version -- plus some nice commentaries and interviews. The interviewees include (who else?) Erich von Daniken, whose _Chariots of the Gods?_ was part of the popular literature of my youth. If you've even heard of him, you'll probably like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>This movie when I first saw it in a private screening before its domestic release. I didn't know what to expect. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.<p>Unique story and an interest premise. The effects are very cool and the Stargate itself is an interesting concept. Kurt Russel begins the movie with his character as being a nasty guy, but then you warm up to him.<p>Jay Davis (The Crying Game) is a really starnge alien leader. I won't give much away but he is like a snake in the grass.<p>James Spader played a great &quot;nerdy&quot; scientist and the most unsuspecting leading &quot;love&quot; man. He falls in love with the alien female (played by Alexi Cruz)and ends up saving Earth and her planet too.<p>Overall the film is an action adventure but it also has heart. Dena Devling and Roland Emerich wrote this with Roland directing.<br />(This team also cretaed Godzilla and Independance Day!)<p>This is a good modern Sci-Fi film to have in your colleciton.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R3O02O0PON4.html">A29R3O02O0PON4</a><br/><p>First of all why 4 stars then?  Because I like Sci-Fi and while having a History degree I found the Egyptology interesting.<p>Now then, a comment about the guy who doesn't like Letterboxing.  Umm, dude!  DVDs are made for Widescreen presentations!  The letterboxing MAINTAINS the theatrical presentation.  Unless your local theater has a 4:3 screen then you're missing at least a third of the picture by LOVING Pan'n'Scan.  I hate to see what you're going to do when HDTVs are the norm in their 16:9 format.  If anything I HATE watching movies in Pan'n'Scan because I KNOW that there is more picture there that I'm not seeing.  I've been watching VHS widescreen versions for years now on a 27&quot; and have no problem &quot;tuning-out&quot; the black bars.  I have just bought a DVD player and a 32&quot; Sony WEGA Trinitron and Widescreen hasn't looked better.  One step down from HD.<p>But now back to the film itself.  Stargate is about a circular gate that is a portal from one point in space to another through a wormhole.  The portal in this film is one to a planet that apparently has simularities to Earth's Ancient Egypt.  Except the Gods are aliens that have adopted ancient Egyption dieties for appearances.  We have the pharoah-looking Sun God Rah, the jackal-looking Anubis, and the eagle-looking Horus.  They also have cool looking skypods armed with the same energy weapon that the ground troops carry.  <p>The film could have been better had the locale and culture of the people there on the alien planet been a little more dynamic.  But at least it spawned a highly successful TV series where these alien worlds and story lines could be fleshed out more.</p></br></body></html>

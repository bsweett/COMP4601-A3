Therefore, many of you grew up with the<br />original &quot;Oceans 11&quot; flick.  Back then, the film starred Frank Sinatra<br />(as Danny Ocean), Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, Angie<br />Dickinson, Cesar Romero, Richard Conte, Joey Bishop and a cameo role<br />by...yes...Red Skelton.  If you want to see your teenage son (and his<br />girlfriend), give you that neck-twist look like a dog listening to music<br />for the first time, tell them about Frankie, Dino and Sammy and they'll<br />look at you like you're a Senior Citizen.  Guess what?  We are!<p>The face lift (no pun intended) of &quot;Oceans 11&quot; is well done.  The<br />casting is superb.  George Clooney is the new Frankie (Danny Ocean), and<br />Julia Roberts is the former Angie Dickinson.  Support that with Brad<br />Pitt, Andy Garcia (excellent performance), Corey Affleck, Matt Damon,<br />Elliott Gould (hairy chest and all)...you've got a winner.  But the real<br />hidden gem is a performance by Carl Reiner.  I won't tell you more.  <p>I was thoroughly entertained and reminisced of the days when the legends<br />in the first flick were alive and on top of the movie and music charts.<br />That was, believe or not, a movie released FORTY ONE YEARS AGO!!!  I was<br />11 years old.  But don't feel old...go see the new version and regain<br />your youth.  It's a five-spot worth spending!<p>PAUL</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Steven Soderbergh is on a roll. Last year he awed the movie industry with his double-whammy of ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC, becoming one of only a slight few directors to ever be nominated Best Director for two different films in the same year. Now, Soderbergh strikes again with OCEAN'S ELEVEN.OCEAN'S ELEVEN is a classic heist movie, but updated with a post-modern sensibility. The story is simple, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from jail and immediately sets into motion a plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos. He meets up with an old pal and confidante (Brad Pitt) and the two form an ensemble team to pull off the heist. Ocean has personal reasons for this particular job, mainly to get his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) back from the malicious casino owner (Andy Garcia) who stole her.Clooney and Pitt have the bulk of the dialogue, but the ensemble cast also includes such stalwarts as Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, and Don Cheadle. Each performer brings just the right nuances to their roles, and though most of these actors are stars by their own right, none break the unity of the ensemble cast and steal the show.OCEAN'S ELEVEN is engaging (I only looked at my watch once) and seems to be a better movie than the Rat Pack version from which it originated. In fact, the film seems more like THE STING or THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR than the original OCEAN'S ELEVEN.Though the plot is perdictable; you know almost from the start that Ocean is going to succeed in his scam; knowing that doesn't really take anything away from the movie. However, the suspense leading up to the heist could have been built up a little more. Also, there were a few elements that could have added to the actual suspense of the heist itself (the grease man gets his hand smashed in a door-that could have been used a little more e.g.).Overall OCEAN'S ELEVEN is an entertaining movie that is sure to bring Soderbergh and Clooney (one of the film's producers) more kudos and perhaps bring about more movies with all-star casts that don't cost much to make (the film was made for a relatively low $30 million). It's a nice piece of stimulating movie mind candy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>When watching the many advertisements or interviews talking about the movie, I got the impression that this was George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon.  Following along behind these guys would be some other stars who did more cameo than anything.<p>Not true.  One thing I liked about the movie is that all the stars got a chance in front of the camera.  Yes, there is more George and Brad, but I never got the feeling that this was their movie alone.  It was odd that Julia did not have a larger role.  Perhaps with her star power, anything more would have eclipsed the other actors.<p>The movie never drags.  The pace is steady without seeming too quick.  There are special effects, but not so elaborate that it detracts from the movie.  It has an exciting, yet comfortable, feel to it.<p>The script is fresh.  Usually, when actors get in a jam, some divine intervention steps in to save the day.  Here, you may follow the plot and see some of the foreshadowing, but parts of the ending will surprise you.<p>I would recommend this movie to anyone.  It is not just a star vehicle produced because Hollywood wants to do.  This is a good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>As someone who has never seen the original &quot;Brat Pack&quot; version of &quot;Ocean's Eleven,&quot; I have no romantic ties to nostalgia and I saw the film with an open mind. I really don't care for plot lines that glorify crime as something that is exciting and without real victims, but the film has so many twists, turns and moments of excitement, you quickly forget that this is about the mother of all robberies and instead feel like you are a member of Ocean's team.<p>Carl Reiner is absolutely fantastic in his role and really helps to tie the film together.  Bernie Mac is also masterful in his performance.<p>Andy Garcia does such a good job at being a king-sized jerk (even though a few of these scenes were a little overwraught), you not only don't care that he's being robbed, you actually want to join in just to see him wince.<p>The plot is very clever and the story assumes that you (the viewer) are intelligent and are already thinking, &quot;No way, man... I saw a behind the scenes show on Discovery Channel and there is no way on earth you can rob a casino on Vegas!&quot; and then makes you believe it really is possible.<p>Of course, cameras are EVERYWHERE in a casino... and if you so much as picked your nose in a casino 10 years ago, there is most likely a video archived on a shelf somewhere showing your nose being picked from 3 different camera angles.<p>Nevertheless, you will find yourself smiling during the twists and turns and very clever ideas... because your mind is stimulated instead of being lulled into a coma.<p>Well acted, great direction, believable &amp; clever plot... makes a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>George Clooney, Brad Pitt and dozens of their elite Hollywood buddies get together to remake and rejuvenate this rat pack classic from forty years prior. The end result is a slick, mildly overproduced adventure that's smart and suave, though not quite so much as it seems to think it is. Much of the movie is blown on excessive, "look what we can afford to do" antics that are, admittedly, fun to watch but ultimately do little to endear the cast to their audience. Rather than a case of pillaging the rich to fill the coffers of the poor and desperate, this first installment of the Ocean's franchise feels more like a case of the filthy rich reaching into the cookie jars of the filthier. The heist genre loses a bit of its inherent suspense when a film's protagonists have access to a garage full of police paraphernalia, server racks spilling over with imaginary "future tech" computer equipment, Italian sports cars, cushy upper deck hotel rooms and access to all the blueprints they'll ever need. Clooney's charisma does buy him a degree of invulnerability to this phenomenon, which makes him an ideal centerpiece, but after the first viewing most of the team's close calls seem far too easily resolved. With these resources, Beavis & Butt-Head could have a pretty good shot at making off with a casino's millions. Good for a few action spots, at least.</p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>This is a really fun movie to watch, but you have to see it if for no other reason than seeing this incredible cast riffing off one another throughout an enjoyable crime caper.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>This is fun from beginning to end...clever, fun, fast and funny.  Every component is there: from the direction and writing, to casting and editing....incredible score, effects and production values.  In spite of the fact that it's about a huge robbery, it manages to be entertainment devoid of Hollywood-style violence and profanity.  A true blockbuster!<br /><br />This bargain DVD includes two great, warts n' all commentary tracks: one smart ass track with Soderbergh and Griffin, the other with 3 of its stars (Damon proves again that he's the smartest, most savvy of today's underestimated film hunks).<br /><br />You won't care that Don Cheadle's dialect coach was overpaid or that, for all her glamour, Julia Roberts still has difficulty walking in high heels...you will love this great movie, again and again!</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>No major special affects, no grand CGI animation, no promise of a violent showdown between the protaganist and antagonist.  Ocean's Eleven is a tribute to simple film making that relies on characters, dialogue and pacing.<br /><br />Considering the cast, it's amazing they were able to make this movie.  George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia...where does it end?  If this was the NFL they would have broken the salary cap five times over.  I think the money they cart out at the end of the movie was their paychecks.  It was reported that George sent his buddy Julia a twenty dollar bill in his request for her to be in the movie.  The quote inside; `I hear you work for twenty these days'.  This kind of simple charm has worked it's way into the movie.  Clooney and director Steven Soderberg have created a masterful remake of the Rat Pack movie that is far superior to the original, which starred Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.  The 1960's version was widely known to be a stinker, so you may wonder why anyone would re-make a bomb?  Why ask why?  The new version is witty, quick and sharp as a ginsu.<br /><br />Everyone is in top form playing characters who are specialists in one way or another.  Don Cheadle is especially note worthy speaking with a British accent, playing an explosives and electronics expert.  Clooney's character, Danny Ocean, pulls together a group of professionals to pull off one of the biggest Las Vegas heists in history.  Timing and intelligence are key, as well as the delicate art of the con.<br /><br />The story unfolds however to reveal that Ocean's former wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) is now married to Terry Benedict, the man he is trying to con, and rob over 200 million dollars from.  He knows Terry doesn't care about Tess like he does and in the midst of the robbery, he proves it.  Don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything for you.  Trying to keep track of everything going on can be a little exhausting, but in the end, everything is made clear.  And if not, don't worry because you will want to watch the movie again.  I'm really looking foward to the sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>I always wanted them to make a remake of Ocean's Eleven.  When I heard George Clooney wanted to do it, I was excited.  Saw it in the theater.  Well, I did not like Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Bernie Mac.  But I did like George Clooney, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould and Shaobo Qin.  Cameo appearances of Angie Dickinson (!) and Henry Silva (both in the 1960 film) was fantastic.  Other cameo appearances were Eydie Gorme, Wayne Newton, Jerry Wientraub, and Sigfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn.  Steve Lawerance has a cameo too but I could not see him in the Full Screen version.  Thank God for Elvis Presley music.  I'm still devoted to the original Ocean's Eleven (1960), but if they made a sequel to this 2001 version, I would probably watch it. I disliked the ending of this version.  Shaobo Qin is certainly a scene stealer, isn't he.  If they make a sequel I hope Qin is in it too.  Like the original film, this was filmed in Las Vegas too.  That's the way it should be.

One of the few Hollywood remakes that surpasses the original, this has so much style, panache and wit that it elevates it above the Frank Sanatra caper. Following the excellent ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC, Soderbergh has proved again that he is one of the hottest new directors out there. The superb ensamble of supporting cast are all perfect in their offbeat roles, especially Scott Caan, Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould (From TV's Friends). Ted Griffin's top-notch screenplay combined with the A-list cast, this one is a bonifide winner.<br />The DVD extra features include a halarious commentary with Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia, and an insightful commentary with director Soderbergh and Griffin. &quot;The making of Ocean's 11&quot; is a suitably stylish doco with interviews from the cast and crew and trailers. 5-star entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Danny Ocean (George Clooney), recently paroled from prison, puts together a crew of A-list stars (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, etc.) in order to pull of a complicated scheme to rip off three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously and take revenge on the slimy casino owner (Andy Garcia) who married his ex-wife (Julia Roberts).  This film features slick direction, mega-watt star power, a well-crafted script by Ted Griffin, and slick direction by Steven Soderbergh.  The result is lots of fun to watch.  There is a clever twist at the end, and the film closes with just the right note of quiet triumph.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Ocean's Eleven (Steven Soderbergh, 2001)<p><p>Soderbergh, coming off two films that everyone but me seemed to like, returned to the big screen to helm a &quot;remake&quot; of Rat Pack wunderfilm Ocean's Eleven. George Clooney was heard to say that the remake, in fact, had nothing in common with the original but the name, and he couldn't have been more right. It takes a little stretching and a lot of devil's advocate-playing, but if you look at Soderbergh's creation as its own film and don't try to compare it to the vastly superior original, you can have a good time for the hundred and fourteen minutes plus assorted commercials and previews you'll be in the theater.<p><p>The plot bears a strikingly similar resemblance to the original-- Danny Ocean pulls together eleven guys to rob a bunch of casinos in Las Vegas. The number of casinos has changed from five to three (thus allowing 1.8 more guys per casino. Jeez, what a ripoff!), and the band of merry men have gone from Ocean's old wartime paratrooper unit to a loose collection of professional thieves. But then, security in 2001 is a whole lot more stringent than it was in 1960, so the original caper would have been impossible to pull off. Oh, well. Can't win 'em all.<p><p>Once you've changed the premise, everything else goes its own way. Julia Roberts reprises Angie Dickinson's original role as Danny Ocean's wife, but Roberts has a much, much larger part in this film than Dickinson did in the original-- in fact, she's dating the guy (Andy Garcia) who owns the casinos that the guys plan to knock over.<p><p>There's nothing here that's too terribly surprising, and the twist at the end, while nicely delivered, doesn't even have the punch of the ending of Heist, much less the last line of the original film, which is a twist ending right up there with that of The Usual Suspects. Still, despite a pedestrian script and Soderbergh's usual &quot;just act as if I'm not here-- no, really&quot; directing style, a high-power cast makes it an enjoyable two hours. Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, and a really-not-aging-well-at-all Carl Reiner head the band of thieves, and the less-known members of the band of merry men (including Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, and the seemingly-ubiquitous Bernie Mac) prove, within the boundaries of the script, that they do have what it takes to stand in the glare of all this A-list talent and still be seen. The real treasure though, as he is in any movie in which he makes an appearance, is Andy Garcia. Despite looking rather like a Baldwin Brother, fear not; Garcia's got all the talent the collective Baldwins think they have, and it oozes from him every time he makes one of his big screen appearances. He gets a whole lot less screen time than Clooney, Pitt, and Damon, but that makes the time he does spend up there that much more enjoyable.<p><p>Catch the matinee and you won't feel too ripped off. ** 1/2</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Pay back means big money to some people!  Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has been just paroled and he has a plan, but he needs a crew, to pull off one of the biggest heists ever done.  He plans to steal $150 million from the high security vault that holds the money for three of Las Vegas' largest casinos.  His key partner is Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and they meet up with a former casino owner Rueben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) to bounce the plan off of him and get him to help finance it.  They recruit eight specialists to pull off the heist and they are all the best in what they do.  They are con men, mechanics, explosives expert, acrobat, an electronics expert and a pick pocket.  They all know each other and they begin the planning stage of the robbery.<br /><br />They are all in it for the money but Danny Ocean has revenge on his mind.  His beautiful ex-wife Tess (Julia Robert) is the casino owner, Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) girlfriend.  Rueben also has no love loss for the Benedict and anything that hurts him would make Rueben happy.....<br /><br />This is a funny and high action movie with top notch stars that just make the story better.  With all of the great acting personalities in the movie the interaction is just interesting to watch.  This cast doing this movie was just put together for pure entertainment and it works perfectly.  The entire movie is entertaining and a lot of fun.  I recommend it to you as a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>The majority of us are law abiding citizens but we can't resist watching a good robbery, especially if there's some humour thrown in as well. The Italian Job (1969) is one of the best but in 2001 Steven Soderbergh remade the Rat Pack classic Ocean's Eleven (1960) which is notable not just for an audacious robbery plan but its rich ensemble of Hollywood talent, but is it any good?<br /><br />The film begins with Danny Ocean (George Clooney) being released from prison and immediately hooking up with a multitude of talented criminals spread throughout the US. Ocean makes up the elusive eleven of the title which includes Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), Frank Catton (Bernie Mack), brothers Turk (Scott Caan) and Virgil Malloy (Casey Affleck), Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison), Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), Yen (Shaobo Qin), Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon). Ocean's target is $150 million held in the vault of a casino owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), and despite the reservations of the men he recruits at pulling off the heist they all sign up for the challenge. Complications arise, however, when Ocean's group learn that Benedict's lover Tess (Julia Roberts) just happens to be the estranged wife of Ocean which threatens to ruin the entire heist.<br /><br />Following his release from prison at the outset, Ocean is quickly breaking the rules of his parole and forming a lucrative gang to complete a challenging robbery that is deemed nigh on impossible. The notable members are Linus who is an expert pickpocket and Yen who Rusty Ryan first introduces Ocean to when they watch his circus performance; an outstanding acrobat ideal for avoiding security sensors and facilitating the gang's acquisition of the loot. The other members all have their individual roles from posing as businessmen wanting their goods putting in the casino's vault, to working the tables or posing as porters. Ocean's gang may seem as dissimilar a group as you could hope to meet but together they are a formidable force, planning meticulously with a replica of the vault they intend to break through despite the presence of guards, security sensors and doors whose codes change multiple times during the day. Getting into the vault is one thing but managing to walk out with $150 million in bags is not the most straightforward task. As the audience we know that this gang will have their close calls and there are many here, be it members posing as guards and being stopped in the corridors suddenly or the athletic Yen nearly stumbling a few times when his moment arrives in the vault.<br /><br />The love triangle between Ocean, Tess and Benedict is relevant but it is also fairly predictable what's going to happen. Despite being the head of the thieving operation, Ocean cannot resist joining his wife at a restaurant table while she waits for her new lover. Tess is adamant she wants nothing to do with Ocean, citing his lies and deceit as perfectly good reasons why she has nothing to say to him but his very presence clearly has an effect on her even though she professes to be loyal to Benedict. Ocean's encounter with Tess leads to a meeting with Benedict who is suspicious of everyone in his casino so the sight of a recently paroled criminal sets alarm bells ringing. Ocean's movements are not overlooked by his gang with Linus monitoring his encounter with Tess and Benedict and leaving Rusty Ryan no choice but to assume control of the operation for fear of Ocean blowing the whole thing. Linus is drafted in for a key role in the heist while a distraught Ocean is pushed to the background despite being the initial brains behind the robbery. With this setback are the gang's detailed plans left in shreds?<br /><br />Ocean's Eleven moves along at a fast pace and the heist itself is indeed the high point, being complex and precarious at every turn. Watching the ice cool Benedict begin to sweat as his impenetrable casino is suddenly breached is a sheer delight. The ending reveals another layer of intricacy to the plot that the audience will struggle to see coming but even the ruthless Benedict is left in awe at the audacity of the gang he has become a victim of. The outcome of the love triangle is very predictable and was something of a downside to the film for me. Tess doesn't want Ocean in her life at the outset but in the blink of an eye she quickly changes her mind! There is still a surprising outcome for one of the members of the group, it's a not a straightforward getaway for everyone involved and it makes for a more satisfying ending.<br /><br />Ocean's Eleven is a fast-paced heist thriller with some moments of comedy thrown in for good measure. It boasts an impressive array of Hollywood talent who are never allowed to dominate the screen for long. By no means a masterpiece this is still an enjoyable film that should appeal to a wide audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>It's got charm, some good lines, a few good setpieces and gets away with its flaws.

This is a remake of the pretty dull 1960s Las Vegas heist movie of the same title starring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack. I've seen both films and I must say that this is one of those rare exceptions where the remake improves on the original.<br /><br />Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is an ex-con newly released from prison who immediately jumps back into the shady life. He already has a larcenous scheme in mind and enlists his old right-hand man Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to help him recruit a thieving crew. Oh and what a crew: Matt Damon as the rookie, quick-fingered and well versed in pickpocketing; Bernie Mac as the inside man; Don Cheadle, the explosives expert, comes armed with a great Cockney accent and that weird Cockney way of rhyming ("We're in Barney"; Clooney makes a nonplussed gesture; "Barney Rubble - Trouble!"); old-school Carl Reiner plays the old con-man out for a last con; Casey Affleck is the nerdy computer/surveillance technoman; etc. Ocean and company target the super-protected vault underneath the Bellagio casino. This vault stores money for three casinos: the Bellagio itself, as well as the MGM Grand and the Mirage. Apparently, on weekend nights of big boxing events, the vault by law has to house at least $150 million to cover all bets. The man who owns the Bellagio is Terry Benedict (played with smooth, reptilian menace by Andy Garcia), who is also the current love of Ocean's ex Tess (a radiant Julia Roberts). Hmmm, you start to think.<br /><br />Ocean's motivations are not the only thing that'll keep the viewer guessing in this funny, fast-paced, twisty film. The director Steven Soderbergh skillfully plays fast and loose with flashbacks, dizzying, continuing pan shots and sleight-of-hand camerawork. There is plenty of false jeopardy played out in the course of this movie, numerous plot reversals. Don't take anything for granted until the end credits come up.<br /><br />Steven Soderbergh directs this remake with such a light touch that it seems as if all he's done is throw all these high-profiled megastars in the same room and direct them, with perhaps a nonchalant wave of a hand, to simply wing it. The performers deliver their lines convincingly and with panache. They are, after all, all damn good actors (check out the dvd actor commentary with Damon, Pitt and Garcia, who have a chuckle over the talented serious actor Don Cheadle, who delivers his lines while covered in poo). I had a sense that everyone involved genuinely liked each other and had a great time bouncing off each other in their scenes. Clooney and Pitt, in particular, seem to have great buddy rapport together, whilst romantically, Clooney and Roberts sizzle. Andy Garcia is a great villain, suave yet intense, worthy of going up against eleven crafty adversaries. Soderbergh does a masterful juggling act in this one: ensuring that everyone in the film gets his/her day to shine, managing to stage every scene so that every shot is interesting and keeping the topsy-turvy plot on point. Kudos, too, to the music, which works to great effect and greatly influences the mood of every stage of the film (I thought actually purchased the soundtrack). Great job by everyone involved. A four star effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>A movie filled with an A-list cast along with a solid directing crew you would think that a remake of Ocean's eleven would be a good movie.  In the end it is a well earned and respectable movie that has pulled some of its material from classic films to making new materal of its own.  A must see for the entire population.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>It's not easy for me to review this movie, as I couldn't possibly comment on the likelihood of them accomplishing what they set out to accomplish. But this is fiction, and I expect that Las Vegas casino owners or security personnel who saw this film found themselves rolling in the aisles. That's just my guess.<p>That aside, this was a brilliantly directed and acted film. It's difficult to direct an ensemble of three characters and have each of them fully realized. More difficult by far to have an ensemble of eleven. But Soderbergh pulls it off admirably.<p>Casting decisions were also well made. I didn't see the original movie (although I intend to), so I don't know who was who, but it was fascinating to watch Brad Pitt and George Clooney (both often selected or at least short listed as the sexiest men alive) engage in discussion, the camera switching from one face to another. One can imagine half of the women (and some men, let's be honest here) in the audience swooning for five seconds while the camera rests on Clooney, and they the other half swooning for Brad.<p>Other than Clooney and Pitt, Scott Caan and Casey Affleck (the brothers) had a perfect onscreen banter. You really felt for Matt Damon's character (another sexiest man alive short-lister) when he was shut up in the van with them, and his reason for fleeing. Damon himself demonstrated his usual talent, nervous while being instructed on how to play the role of a Nevada Gaming Official, but playing it perfectly when it came time.<p>Andy Garcia had just the right amount of frigidity and rigidity, but not enough evincible power.<p>To me, this was a movie about some the high jinks of the robbery and the comedy that some of these high jinks produced, and the terrific banter of the various characters. The ending was very satisfying, kept me in suspense, and surprised me (I didn't see it coming). This is what movies are supposed to do.<p>I'm very much looking forward to Ocean's 12.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>"Ocean's Eleven" is a Ferrari of a movie: cool, stylish, and classy.

But she's having nothing of it, as evidenced by this neat dialogue piece:<p>Danny: "I've paid my debt to society."<p>Tess: "Funny, I haven't gotten my check yet."<p>Dialogue like that is one of the great pleasures of this movie; watching it delivered by the likes of Clooney, Roberts, Pitt and the stellar supporting cast (Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould, et al) is the other.<p>And, in fairness, it's a good thing that the dialogue and acting is so good, because as a pure caper flick, "Ocean's Eleven" is, to be charitable, a little thin. In the best caper movies ("The Heist" comes to mind), the theft itself is the star of the movie - the intracicies, the backup plans, the intrigue. In "Ocean's Eleven," we're expected to believe that a casino with over $150 million in its vault wouldn't have a backup power generator, or that the vault's security system wouldn't have a motion sensor.<p>But criticisms like that are akin to nitpicking that red Ferrari 575 because it has a small trunk - the point isn't realism, it's style, and like a Ferrari, "Ocean's Eleven" has it in droves.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>There was no way, no how I was going to like this movie. How could they even think of remaking my beloved Rat Pack's Ocean's Eleven. I didnt even want to watch it at first, but my son bought it and I was looking for something I hadn't seen yet, so okay okay let's give a try.<br />What a ride! I really liked it! Danny Ocean played by George Clooney had a fresh new look and the story had a fresh new take. The basic idea was the same as the original, a parolee and his 11 buddies(including the likes of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Don Cheadle) all with special talents that are put to use to do the unthinkable... rob 3 of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas, which by all the experts is considered virtually impossible. In this new version though, we are much more technologicaly advanced in the tools of this trade, so it's more like a comedic Mission Impossible.<br />All 3 Casinos they want to rob are all owned by the same man (Andy Garcia), who (Uh Oh the plot thickens here) happens to be dating Ocean's ex-wife(Julia Roberts). So did Danny Ocean engineer this elaborate heist just for the $150 million they stood to gain or did he have other motives? You decide!<br />The cast also includes Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck,Scott Caan, and for those who still need a touch of nostalgia we get Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould in the mix. The whole cast does a really good job of bringing their own take on these characters, and Director Steven Soderbergh(Erin Brochovich, Traffic) has given a new stylish look at this story.<br />The DVD was enjoyable to watch, The widescreen, the sound,(Dolbly Dig 5.1) picture, all were exceptional. The cinematography has to be seen to be appreciated. For those in need of Special Features you get some pretty good ones. Commentary from the stars and the Director, Behind the Scenes Making of the Movie,and Theatrical Trailers.<br />So I was debating on 3 stars or 4 ( I would've gone 3 1/2 if I could've) I went with 3 because like "Mr. Toad"s Wild Ride" at Disneyland it was alot of fun but I Probably wont go back on again right away. If you havn't seen it I suggest renting it first.  It should be seen at least once though, even if you think a "remake" of this film can't be good. And by the way If you have not seen the original check it out, it stands the test of time.<br />have fun..Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Yeah, it's impossible, it's ridiculous, it's contrived, but you gotta love the acting and the chemistry between the actors. Only Julia Roberts' role was maybe a mismatch, and that's difficult for me to say as she's one of my favorites.<br /><br />The 1960's original version with Frank Sinatra and the infamous Rat Pack was fun, too, but this contemporary one makes full use of all the modern cinema techniques that make action/adventure films such fun to watch.<br /><br />The whole setup (a plan to rob several Las Vegan casinos owned by a guy who has `taken possession' of Danny Ocean's ex-wife) is convoluted and sometimes difficult to follow - and frankly, rather than hit replay and try to figure it all out, I'd just advise suspending disbelief and going with the flow.<br /><br />It's a hoot.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I didn't think I'd like this movie because I know much more than I'd like to about these actors lives thanks to entertainment shows and cheesy news programing. But the movie had a great, fast moving story and I loved it. I just hope George Clooney wasn't kidding when he said Barbra Streisand would appear in the sequel 'Ocean's Twelve.' I think she'd be perfect in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>When the high cost of top draw actor's salaries limits the number of big stars, any one movie can have, it's nice to see that the "remake" of Ocean's Eleven does succeed in gathering together a cast of some rather highly paid actors.  The "all star cast" includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, and Julia Roberts.  The second tier group of actors includes Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Hollywood veterans, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner.  With such heavyweight talent, and a setting in Las Vegas, one might expect spectacular results, but they never quite materialize.  Director Steven Soderberg's production is a slick, and well-structured, yet superficial and lacking in passion and emotion.  The tale is well told, but never aims for, or touches the heart.  <p>Low key, analytical, and in control, George Clooney, is Danny Ocean, the man with an audacious plan to rob the vault of the Bellagio casino.  Andy Garcia is Terry Benedict, the owner of the Bellagio, who's current love is Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts).  Ocean's team is headed by Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), who does most of the recruiting, and oversees the elaborate operation.  <p>Lack of passion?  Well, we don't really hate Benedict, the intended victim, who just comes off of as ultra competent.  Andy Garcia, plays his character as very straight and reserved.  Clooney, while a good actor, is not the ideal choice as a fiery romantic lead.  Julia Roberts is the lone female, and her performance is also subdued, rather than stunning.  What emotion there is, is mostly present in undertones.<p>The other performances are solid, but there just isn't any special chemistry to be found between any of them.  Pitt is steady, not flashy.  Don Cheadle's character "Basher" an electronics expert, uses unfamiliar English slang, to perhaps impart "authenticity", but it's more of a distraction ("naused?").  Some performances do sneak up on you.  Carl Reiner, is wonderful, and scores big time, playing a rich tycoon to perfection.  And versatile Matt Damon, is the "kid" forced into a primary role, in the biggest job of his life.  Just a tip, no more shots of Elliot Gould with his shirt open,<p>If you are satisfied with just a smoothly-executed, and rewarding heist, then give this a chance.  There's not much suspense or humor however, and character development is minimal.  The focus is on the task at hand.  The music, adds to its slick feeling, keeping things light and flowing.  Oscar winning director Soderberg draws top stars to his projects, and making a lightweight "fun" picture is certainly no crime.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>I used to think they could never make a con movie as good as &quot;The Sting.&quot;  But this one's pretty dang close.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>...The movie is ten times better than the mediocre original. Danny Ocean(George Clooney), is released from prison. It doesn't take long for him to get back to his old ways. He devises a plan to steal $163 million dollars from the tightly guarded vault of the Las Vegas casino The Bellagio. To do so, he needs to round up a crew of men to pull this very tough heist off. Enter the rest of the 'Star Power' cast. Brad Pitt plays Clooney's right hand man, Rusty Ryan. Matt Damon plays a talented pocket picker named Linus. Don Cheadle really has a nothing role, but makes up for it with his lively and entertaining accent. Comedy legend Carl Reiner is also on hand as an aging thief. Comedian Bernie Mac(one of the stars of &quot;The Kings Of Comedy&quot; film)is one of the gang as well. Andy Garcia plays Terry Benedict, the owner of the casino they are going to hit. Terry is now with Danny's ex Tess, played by Julia Roberts. There isn't anything new with the film really, but who cares?. It was designed to be a fun crowd pleaser from beginning to end. It delivers on all sides. There are numerous one liners that come fast and sharp. The actors deliver them with full force. The funniest gag is Pitt's character teaching young T.V. stars how to play poker. Those stars being Joshua Jackson from &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;, Topher Grace from &quot;That 70's Show&quot;, Holly Marie Combs from &quot;Charmed&quot;, Barry Watson from &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and Shane West from &quot;Once And Again&quot;. The &quot;Chewing Scenery&quot; award goes to Elliot Gould, who plays a casino owner equipped with big glasses, cigar, and lots of jewelry sprawled out in dark chest hair. It's a comical highlight. Good for him. Reiner gives a wonderful performance. It's nice to see the legend has still got it. Our stars are wonderful too. Clooney brings new meaning to the word &quot;charming&quot;. If there was anyone to have that cool, calm charm like Sinatra, it's Clooney. Pitt is enjoyable as well. The only fault this film has is the horrendous underuse of Damon and Roberts. People will be surprised to learn how small this Oscar winning mega star has. Could've been used so much better. Garcia balances his villain role just right. He stays on line and doesn't whoop it up and make it seem like some cheesy caricature of characters gone by. A nice, rather subdued, performance. I can't stress enough how much of a good time the film is. Director Steven Soderbergh is on fire. He films the town nicely, and, of course, the stars. It's almost hard to imagine this was the same guy who did &quot;Traffic&quot;. Ocean's 11 might not be Oscar material, but it is most definitley the nicest, most insanely entertaining film so far this year. Hands down. No if's, and's, or but's about it. It would definitley not be a bad thing to have an Ocean's 12, or 13, 14, 15, 16. This is a movie for people who like movies. If, like the one star negative reviews are any indication, you hate movies, then you will probably hate this one too. Ignore those reviews. Those are grouches who don't enjoy good, quality films.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>Remakes a movies tend to get mixed reactions from moviegoers, Oceans 11 is one of the greatest remakes ever. I'm a  fan of the old one with the rat pack, but it's got nothing on this one.<p>Oceans 11 is a fun story. Danny Ocean(Clooney) has just gotten out of jail. He wants to steal $150 million dollars from Terry Benidickt(Garcia). In the process he wants to also get his ex-wife back and he gets an all star gang to help him pull this caper off.<p>George Clooney was great in the film. I've always had mixed reactions for Clooney on the big screen, because he does a hit movie and then goes and does a bunch of duds. I don't get why he does it. He's great in this one and his fans will be well pleased.<p>Brad Pitt was the best in this film. He was cocky, arrogant, and so dang cool all at the same time. Him, Garcia, and Damon really drove the film for me. It's such a slick film, and Pitt has the slickest character. Awesome performance.<p>I didn't like Julia Roberts in the movie. You don't see a whole lot of her, but they advertised her name like crazy for it. SHe doesn't do all that bad, I just don't care for her to much.<p>Matt Damon was great in the movie. This guy really is a great actor. He doesn't get the kind of attention he deserves. He's signed on to do the sequel to this alond with Pitt and Clooney. Damons fans will be pleased with his job in this.<p>This is a great film. It's so slick and was very well made. The DVD could have had some more extras, but oh well. Look at the movies that are already copying it. The Italian Job was done the same way as this one, except it was gold and not as big of a cast. It's a great film and I have to reccomend it to everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>"Ocean's Eleven" is one of those films that does not attempt to be a stirring social commentary or a barrage of poop jokes that's supposed to be a comedy (although there is only one joke involving human waste in this film).  It is simply meant to entertain, and it does just that.  George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a paroled thief who decides to rob a major casino owner (played by Andy Garcia) of his casino's earnings during a boxing match.  He assembles a crew of eleven theives to pull of the heist, but why would he want to go through with this seemngly impossible job?  Is it because of the $160 million dollar pay off?  Or maybe it's because his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) happens to be the casino owner's new girl?  What do you think?  This movie manages to put together a nice ensemble for our crew (including Bernie Mac as a con artist, Carl Reiner as an aging thief, Don Cheadle as a explosives expert, and many, many others) and the solid performances and brilliant dialogue managed to keep this movie from being an empty, flashy caper flick and makes it an enjoyable, flashy caper flick.  The DVD itself has some nice additional stuff, including a commentary with the director and writer (dry, but funny nonetheless) and one with several of the stars (such as Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon) that's just as fun.  Definitely worth a look-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>this movie was cute.l george clooney plays danny ocean an con man. hes a cool guy. bruiser was my fave charector. tess played by julia roberts was gorgeous. this was just funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>In one sense it is a remake with some improvements on the original. In another sense it is an excuse for one of today's brightest directors to assemble an A-list cast and have a great time. The movie is funny and smart, and Soderbergh was the perfect choice to direct this film. If you haven't seen many of his films, check out "Out Of Sight" (with George Clooney and a pre- wanna-be diva Jennifer "J-Lo" Lopez) and "Erin Brockovich" with that Julia somebody-or-other. Soderbergh's movies are so good that you want to become an actor just to work with him. Watching "Oceans 11" its easy to see why so many big-name actors jump at the chance to work on his projects.  Watch for the cast credits, specifically "... and introducing Julia Roberts".  This review refers to the Theatrical release of the movie - I haven't seen the DVD extras yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>This movie is casted perfectly with a great story!  It's about Daniel Ocean (Clooney) who gets out of jail and hires a crew to help him rob 3 casinos.  Great movie that kept me entertained the whole time.  Must see!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>Call it improbable, or even a highly imaginative flight of fancy; either/and/or, all of the above are correct.  But whatever you choose to call it, this is one of the sleekest and slickest caper movies you're ever likely to run across, and what you're really going to end up calling it is pure Entertainment (yes, with a capital "E").  Incomparable escapist fare, impeccably crafted and delivered by director Steven Soderbergh and a dynamite cast, "Ocean's Eleven" is a joy ride that gives you a chance to root for the bad guys and feel wickedly good while you're doing it.  Because, after all, what's so bad about a bunch of regular guys ripping off a bazillionaire casino owner, who in the first place isn't such a great guy himself?  Remember, the key word here is "escapist"; don't worry about moralizing while you're watching this one, because a movie like this is made to let you to live vicariously for a couple of hours, so just sit back, relax and go with the flow.  Just remember:  These are professionals; don't try this at home.<p> When Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from prison, he doesn't waste any time.  Taking a rather indirect route after leaving the place he's called home for some time, he winds up in Las Vegas where he quite simply plans to rob three casinos owned by one Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), an extremely meticulous businessman, who is also-- if his reputation serves correctly-- an extremely ruthless individual.  He's not a guy you want to mess with.  So why does Ocean want to pick on Benedict, who has the means and the muscle to crush him like a bug with a mere nod of his head?  Suffice to say it has something to do with a personal agenda, as well as the possibility of a paycheck worth around $160 million, which-- even after splitting with the ten other guys he's about to recruit for the job-- will land him a share that won't be too bad for a day's work.  And, of course, there's the challenge; Danny Ocean and his buddies are about to attempt the impossible.  What he is proposing is something that has never before been accomplished, a gamble with nearly insurmountable odds; but, hey, this is Vegas-- and that's what it's all about.<p> To be sure, Soderbergh had the deck stacked in his favor right out of the chute with the cast he assembled for this film; but like any self-respecting odds-makers in Vegas will tell you, nothing is a sure thing.  Soderbergh still had to mix all the ingredients just right-- cast, story, photography, music, action, humor-- to make it cook.  Well, he may not get the Oscar for Best Director for it, but if there's a Golden Chef's Hat Award, he's a shoo-in for preparing this feast.  This is a veritable smorgasbord for the senses; it's easy on the eyes, it'll give you some laughs and make you feel good, it's easy to digest and in the end is a totally satisfying experience.  There may not be anything ground breaking about this movie, and certainly nothing especially new, but Soderbergh presents it with nuance and finesse, as well as that special artistic touch of his that is so definitive of his work.  Neither was a haystack anything new in Monet's day when he chose it as a subject for one of his paintings, and the rest is history.  It's how the artist renders the subject on canvas that's important, and it is in this that Soderbergh excels.  <p> As Danny Ocean, George Clooney demonstrates that he has the charm of Grant, the magnetism of a young Brando and the down-home agreeableness of Jimmy Stewart.  With his personality alone, he defines Ocean in no uncertain terms.  From the opening frame you know exactly who this guy is.  Still, there are a few surprises along the way that keeps him interesting.  Mostly though, he's just enjoyable to watch as he puts his plan into action, and it's easy to believe he's who he is and doing what he's doing.  And that's part of the charm of this movie and, moreover, goes to show you what a good performance Clooney actually gives here.  Unlikely as the story may be, he sells it in such a way that it works; and as the customer, you not only buy it, but walk away with the extended warranty and go home satisfied.  And that's a good bit of acting in anyone's book.<p> And though Clooney is clearly the star of the show, Brad Pitt checks in as Ocean's friend, Rusty Ryan, and emerges on fairly equal footing with his illustrious co-star.  Like Clooney, Pitt turns on the charm and serves up Rusty as a credible enough figure, with a performance that may not be much of a stretch for him, but one that is certainly engaging.  The character is lacking somewhat in depth and definition, but Pitt manages to give you a clear idea of who Rusty is without too much by way of development.  Call it a fast-food characterization; nevertheless, Pitt does a good job, and for all intents and purposes, he makes the character work.  <p> The single question mark in the casting may be with Julia Roberts as Tess, Ocean's estranged wife.  She looks good and gives a solid, if not memorable performance, but she seems to miss the mark slightly in capturing the true essence of the character, which may have been better served by someone like Catherine Zeta-Jones or even Rene Russo.  But that's a purely subjective observation, and I'm sure there are those who will argue that Roberts was perfect for the role.  In either case, Tess is an integral part of the story, and Roberts neither enhances nor distracts from the overall proceedings; most importantly, she does make Tess believable.  And in the end, with a terrific supporting cast (too lengthy to mention here), "Ocean's Eleven" is one you don't want to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Ocean's Eleven is cool. <p>I don't mean in the &quot;wow it's really great you should see it&quot; cool. I mean -- it's cool. The movie is genuinely cool. Watching it, you are convinced you probably look cool. Walking around with the DVD, you can imagine it will help you pick up chicks (it won't). But still, you can hope that the coolness inherent in this movie to rub off on you. It's THAT cool. <p>And with good reason. George Clooney. Brad Pitt. Bernie Mac. Matt Damon. Julia Roberts. That's a lot of slick actors in one package. <p>Clooney plays Danny Ocean, a recently divorced, recently released from prison con man. His ex-wife, who he is still very much in love with, has shacked up with a real creep -- an arrogant man who puts money before everything else. Danny sets out to get back at him in a rather extravagant way. He gets ten of his old buddies together and they take on the most oturageous heist in history. <p>The plot is about taking down not one, not two, but THREE casinos at the same time. It's full of manly, geeky fun. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously (how could it?), but the cast is obviously having so much fun that you can't help but enjoy yourself. I never saw the original -- but if it had half the charm this movie does, it must have been cool indeed. <p>Carl Reiner is excellent as a grumpy old conman. Shaobo Qin players a convincing acrobat (who doesn't talk much). There's two brothers who bicker all the time and you can't tell if it's part of the con or not. In fact, the whole movie plays with the audience -- is it really a con? Because of its playful tone, you forgive it for fooling you more than once, sometimes with the same trick. <p>The one weak point is Don Cheadle. He's a black guy playing a black guy with a...bizarre (Australian? Cockney?) accent. It sounds like me doing an accent. And I sound fake when I do it. <p>There are a few other moments that dim the glow of this movie -- Maleficent pointed out that Julia Roberts can't walk like a lady and apparently either no one's telling her or she just doesn't care. She stumps around onscreen like Lenny from the Grapes of Wrath. It's embarassing. The director tries to compensate, but fails -- in one scene, she's supposed to be sashaying across the screen, but instead ends up gallumphing by instead. For such a pretty lady that's supposed to be a real class act, it shatters the illusion. <p>But that's me being nitpicky. This movie is excellent. For any guy who has ever wanted to be cool...or in this day and age, isn't sure what cool is in anymore...this movie will help guide the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>No one's ever been able to rob a Vegas casino, but Daniel Ocean (Clooney) wants to rob three. As the film continues on, you realize his motivation.  The casino's owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), stole his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts.)<br /><br />That's all the cast I'm going to mention.  I'd practically wear the caps key off making parenthesis to cover who plays who.<br /><br />The story involves Daniel getting out of jail, hiring his crew, setting up the robbery, executing the robbery, and I won't tell you the rest.<br /><br />"Ocean's Eleven" is almost a runway for it's all-star male ensemble cast. You've got every kind of gorgeous from Clooney's slick, to Brad Pitt's 'Ted Nugent knock-off' chic, to Bash's bold and exotic patter.

His remake of the 1960s original, "Ocean's 11" is a hugely entertaining hesit flick that soars on the strength of its all-star cast. George Clooney stars as Daniel Ocean, who, upon release from prison, teams up with his sidekick played by Brad Pitt to orchestrate a robbery at Vegas's top three casinos, all of which are managed by their owner (Andy Garcia). Meanwhile, Ocean is trying to patch things up with his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) who is now with the owner of the very casinos he plans to rob. So, is the robbery a success or a bust? I won't spoil it for you, but the film, while lacking the deph and gravity of "Traffic," is fun to watch. Other notable players are the always-funny Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Matt Damon, Scott Caan (son of James), and Casey Affleck. I hesitated to give the DVD a 5 star rating only because it skimps on the extras. Aside from the 2 commentaries, all we get is a 15-minute fluffy documentary and a handful of trailers. Nevertheless, the movie's a real treat and gets the green light from me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>I have never seen the original movie but I will comment on this remake and the DVD.<p>First, it's nice to see a movie where talented people are together in one movie.  This rarely happens and it's nice to see everyone gel together quite well.<p>Second, I really enjoyed the characters especially the individual fashion sense of each character (explained in a featurette on the DVD)<p>But the one thing that has troubled me about this movie was the ending.  And to confirm how I felt about the ending, listening to the director's commentary, it seems many people felt the same way.  It blew me away to hear the commentary of what if we could of reshot the ending and talking of how they wish they could of done it.  Hmmm...<p>Anyway, the DVD has a lot of good features in it and the plot was interesting but I felt with so many talented individuals, I was expecting more from this movie.  Anyway, it's an ok movie.  Definitely not worthy of a perfect score but it's a good movie nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia and Matt Damon head a super-cast of stars (among others, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle -both of them, second timers with director Steven Soderbergh from Erin Brokovich and Traffic, respectively) in a movie about... yes, the traditional robbery theme! Seen it before? Yep! Clooney (Danny Ocean), yet in another ex-convict role (remember &quot;O, Brother...&quot;?), leads a gang of eleven experts to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Sounds like a familiar plot? Perhaps, but Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh manages to pull off a movie that's very entertaining. Not that it's in any way related to the plot of the 1992 movie, but it reminded me of the movie &quot;Sneakers&quot; where Robert Redford gathered a group of experts as well... That's where the similarities stop. Then it is very much like Traffic, in its overall feel, music, and even part of the concept. 'Nuf said! Check it out!

Danny just got out of prison for a mistake he made 5 years ago.  Along with that mistake, he lost his wife.  Coming out of prison doesn't deter him from crime.  He immediately rounds up 10 men to help him steal from a vault that stores money from 3 casinos.  This is a big and dangerous mission.  There has been 3 attempts to rob the casinos and none of them have been successful.<br /><br />In the midst of their planning and training, an tidbit of information comes to light.  The owner of these casinos is Terry Benedict (Garcia).  That's not the important part.  The important part is that Terry's current girlfriend is Tess (Roberts).  Tess is Danny's ex-wife.  So the question is...is Danny doing this for the money or is he doing this for his ex-wife?  Of course, the gang is upset as it puts the mission in jeopardy.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the mission continues with some adjustments.  The question is will Ocean and his gang succeed with the mission?<br /><br />I have to say that *Ocean's Eleven* is one of the best heist film that I've seen in recent years.  I may not have agreed with the selection of actors but I do have to say that the chemistry between them was great.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>After receiving huge box office and critical success with his daring dramatic films, "Erin Brockovich" and "Traffic", director Steven Soderbergh moved on to a much lighter and more fun loving film with his next directorial effort.  Helming the remake of the Rat Pack classic, "Ocean's Eleven", Soderbergh shows that he not only has what it takes to deliver tight dramatic pieces, but also has the directorial capability to deliver a drama that is much more light hearted yet still compelling, and providing audiences an entertaining film and remake that can stand up to the original classic without any problem.<br /><br />"Ocean's Eleven" follows a recently paroled thief, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) as he attempts to put his life back together by trying to get his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) back from Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to own the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas.  To accomplish this, Danny has devised a plan to steal 150 million dollars from the Bellagio during a pay-per-view boxing match.  In order for this mission to be a success, Danny must enlist the aid of friends and fellow cons or all is lost.<br /><br />"Ocean's Eleven" achieved several feats that are very difficult to accomplish in one film; the ensemble cast, remaking a classic and possibly surpassing the original, and presenting fresh ideas.  Most films can only hope to achieve one of these points, if any.  The ensemble cast for "Ocean's Eleven" is basically a who's-who of Hollywood A-list talent, from George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Bernie Mac; to legends, such as Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould.<br /><br />Anytime a director or studio hopes to remake a classic film that is loved by many people, especially Sinatra fans, you're just asking for trouble.  First, you're expecting the fans to forgive changes that you make to the storyline, second you have to compete with an already successful movie in it's own right, so to even be remembered a remake needs to be better than the original which is not easy to do.  What makes remaking a film even more difficult, is that in this day and age it is increasingly difficult to present new and fresh ideas to the big screen, and when you're core story is based on a film from 1960, this task is even more difficult.<br /><br />Thankfully "Ocean's Eleven" manages to please on all levels, giving audiences an entertaining caper film, that gathers the best of Hollywood and presents a new take on a classic film.<br /><br />"Ocean's Eleven" is rated PG-13 for language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>..in your script, and a poorly executed plot line? A box office homerun! That's right, for all the hype this film received in its movie previews and constant raving reviews from shows like EXTRA and Entertainment Tonight, the film misses the mark in a huge way.  Is it still entertaining? You betcha! But anytime you have Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, and at least six other notables in a film, you're gonna have some entertainment, even if it comes across as a bit shallow.<p>  Ocean's Eleven is a remake of a perfectly good classic film. As was the case with the original, we have a long line of familiar faces and names in the modern version. Eleven crooks are attempting to pull of the biggest theft scam in the history of robberies. Well, let's just say that if you like predictable films featuring some of the most overhyped names in Hollywood, this will be the perfect film for you. <p>I will note this: this is a good film to relax to. In other words, this film requires absolutely no messages for the viewer to ponder upon. It is a easy film to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>This is the story of 11 great actors coming together to make one beautifully made movie! The story has twists and turns and an ending you'd never expect! Steven Soderbergh is top-notch, right up there with Steven Spielberg! I'm not going to explain the plot, and I'm not going to babble on anymore about how great it is, so just see it!</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>I'm usually hard pressed to name what my favorite movie from any given year. That's because I tend to categorize them. So, in the category of `Most Entertaining Big Budget Hollywood Mainstream Movie', there is an easy answer for 2001. It's "Ocean's Eleven" by a nautical mile. This is one of those classics that gets overlooked at awards time, but, I suspect, it may be fondly remembered long after some prize winners have been forgotten.<p>The original "Ocean's Eleven", released in 1960, was a big hit because it starred Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack friends. It's not a great movie; in fact, if I made a list of a thousand movies someone should remake, it would not be on it. Director Steven Soderbergh obviously saw things differently. He lifted a few savory elements out of the original, added in his own ingredients and came up with one delectable movie. He reversed the order of things by taking a very ordinary film and turning it into an original. <p>Charming con artist Danny [George Clooney] is fresh out of jail. Learning to make license plates has done nothing to reform him. He used his time in jail to dream up his ultimate heist. Soon he's presenting his plan to his favorite partner in crime, Russ [Brad Pitt], who has been reduced to teaching the Hollywood elite how to win at poker. The idea is to relieve three Las Vegas casinos of $150,000,000. Russ is skeptical to say the least, since security at these casinos makes Fort Knox look like easy pickings, but he agrees to round up a crew. Meanwhile, in Vegas, Danny's ex-wife, Tess [Julia Roberts], is now the mistress of the three casinos' owner, Terrance [Andy Garcia]. Knowing this, you will not be surprised to discover that this heist is also a bit personal for Danny, who conveniently forgets to tell the rest of the gang about this little fact. <p>There is enough star power in Ocean's Eleven to light a small country, but this is less of a vanity project than you might expect. It's more like watching an acting troupe that happens to have some very famous members. The script is smart and sophisticated and provides enough interesting characters and memorable dialog for all the players to sparkle without resorting to upstaging. <p>This is NOT a `guy' flick, even if it is all about a bunch of guys doing guy things. Julia Roberts, the only `chick' present, has the weakest role. And everyone involved, including the lady herself, knows it. In a sly wink at the audience, her credit reads "and introducing Julia Roberts as Tess."<p>Soderbergh has become one of my all time favorite directors in the last few years. He's something special, a brilliant director who seems dedicated to reviving the notion that popular entertainment can also be intelligent entertainment. Instead of `dumbing down' the audience, he's out to smartening it up. What a cool guy! And what a cool movie! [NOTE: Admittedly, this is entertainment pure and simple. I try to rate movies within the range of what they seem to be trying to accomplish. So, within the confines of 'purely entertaining', I gave "Ocean's Eleven" Amazon's highest rating because it succeeds brilliantly on that level.]</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>After a runaway success with this year's heavyweight TRAFFIC, director Steven Soderbergh relaxes his pace with a hilarious take on the enjoyable caper, a remake on the 1960s Ocean's 11. It is in fact one that surpasses the original starring Rrank Sinatra and his Rat Pack pals - and part of the luminous glow attributes to Soderbergh's stylish directing and cinematography. The Las vegas glamour and casino burst in full glory with the cameras - consistent with the brilliance of the mega stardom. Danny Ocean played by the enigmatic George Clooney decides to erase criminal history with a heist on the casino tycoon Terry Benedict. He conjures up a plan to penetrate the 200 feet vault and ultimately the 150 million prize. Yet his motives run deeper - his ex wife played by Julia Roberts is now Terry's interest. Danny joins forces with a motley of swindlers and pickpockets - including Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell, Brad Pitt as Rusty - his sidekick, Don Cheadle with his British accent as a bomb expert, Shaobo Qin as a acrobat, Carl Reiner as an experienced hustler et al. <p>Despite the first hour of the movie rounding up the characters, there is never a dull moment. That's where Soderbergh's storytelling confidence takes full fledge - each is with his distinctive personality; their rapport and chemistry has bolstered the good-natured fun. The plot remains outlandish with a slight twist or two, speckled with some smooth humour and sleek moves in the action department. This year's best heist thriller? It is an intelligent plot serviceable enough but not much powerhouse acting like THE SCORE. Ocean's 11 has no plans to outshine or compete - the mood is dexterously imbued to entertain the audience with some light fluff and clean fun. The competent directing and scripting robs away your mundane boredom to light you up with a smile.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Finally someone in Hollywood has realized that re-making a great movie never works; try updating a dud instead. And Ocean's Eleven was a dud....self-indulgent and lifeless, it seemed to exist just so the Rat-Pack could get paid to hang out together.<p>  So here comes the remake. I have to admit that I wasn't interested in seeing it, but the good reviews made me take a chance. And I loved it! Steven Soderbergh's film just zips along, and is fun the whole way through. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end. <p>  Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) has just been released from prison, and is barely out the door before he's getting a crew together and plotting an audacious heist that, if successful, could net his 11-man team a cool $160 Million. The team is comprised of, among others, Matt Damon, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Scott Caan, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, and Brad Pitt. (Pitt is especially good as Clooney's unflappable sidekick; I thought he stole the film away from Clooney.) Andy Garcia is the cold-as-ice Casino owner; he makes a great villain. It's funny how the movie gets us to root FOR the bad guys (the theives), and boo the person who, in any other situation, would have our sympathy. Very well done, indeed.<p> If I loved the movie that much, why only 4 stars? 2 words: JULIA ROBERTS. I don't like her. The movie grinds to a halt whenever she's onscreen. I found her character to be a pointless distraction, and she serves no point in the film, other than as Marquee value. And her mouth is HUGE!!!! Her lips look like two raw clams are stuck to her mouth.......(Sorry, but I just don't like her....)<p>  Aside from Julia, Ocean's Eleven is a great way to pass a few hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>There's nothing special about Ocean's 11. It's an entertaining movie, with a great cast and a flashy Vegas, but nothing special about it. I haven't seen the original, but it seems to be more important that the Rat Pack was in it rather than anything to do with plot or story. And this remake is the same. It's more important that the Rat Pack was in the original movie rather than anything about this movie. It's a heist story, one that is plausible, though they gloss over many points (such as how did they know the layout of the vault to build the exact replica) and a few characters seem to have the ability to be in two places at once. They didn't attempt to create a new Rat Pack (except that they did, but in such a way that if it failed they could point to their interviews saying, we never tried to compare to the Rat Pack). They did put together an impressive cast. Clooney in the title role does the job he always does, and he does it well. Brad Pitt as his right hand man delivers the phenomenal performance that is typical of Pitt (in my opinion one of the best living actors). Matt Damon's role was small and irritating. Julia Roberts not only does one of her worst performances, but she also looks horrible in this film. Andy Garcia is over the top. And whoever decided to give Don Cheadle that accent ... <p>The dvd contains two commentaries, but I haven't watched either one--the movie just didn't impress me enough to watch it that many times. There is a behind the scenes segment which doesn't tell much. There is also a short documentary dealing with costume design. It could have been very interesting, since the costumes were great and important to the film (you can see the Sinatra influence on Clooney's costumes), but the documentary fell short and didn't really go into it.<p>I wouldn't buy this dvd, but I'd say it is worth the rental money.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>I saw &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; the day that it came to the theater, and I though that it was a really great film from the director of &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, and &quot;Traffic&quot;. This movie had just about everything...action, great storyline, and laughs. George Clooney was terrific as Danny Ocean, a recently released ex-con who decides that it's time to go back into the thieving business by stealing over $1 million from a luxurious Las Vegas casino. He and Rusty Ryan (played with excellence by Brad Pitt) plan it all out, etc. But how are they going to pull it all off? Get 9 other guys, of course! Among the 9 are Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, and Bernie Mac. Outstanding job from all of them. Andy Garcia, who plays the ruthless casino owner, Terry Benedict, was superb because I haven't seen Garcia act in a while, and this is kind of a comeback for him. And last, but not least, Julia Roberts. What do I think about Julia? Well...Julia was absolutely great as Tess, Clooney's ex-wife! In conclusion, &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; is slick, fast, and funny! This is George Clooney's best film since &quot;Out of Sight&quot;. Brad Pitt's best film since &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;. Matt Damon's best film since &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;. Julia Roberts' best film since &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and &quot;The Mexican&quot;. And Andy Garcia's best film since &quot;Desperate Measures&quot;. &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; is, truly, one of the best action-comedies ever made in the year 2001. It is so hilarious, so hip, that you'll want to see it again and again!</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This lighthearted romp of a caper movie is a remake of the successful 1960s film staring Frank Sinatra and the rest of the Las Vegas Rat Pack. The title refers to the name of the lead character, Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, who assembles a team of 11 men to steal $180 million from a casino. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film is a slick spoof all the way, the high profile cast being the glue that holds this film together. There's Brad Pitt and Matt Damon and Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner. And there was no expense spared on the wardrobe or the glittery sets or the use of modern high tech special effects. Forget about the story; it's not supposed to be real. But yet there's fast paced action and tension throughout as the cast deals with setbacks and complications leading up to and including the caper. It's fun all the way. Just relax and don't take it seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Danny Ocean wants to score the biggest heist in history.

It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking, that was really clever. Just sit back and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>Back in 1989 when Stephen Soderbergh triumphantly arrived on the movie scene with the multi-award winning debut movie Sex, Lies and Videotape the world seemed at his feet. Then followed 9 years of relative obscurity before the release of the excellent 'Out of Sight', starring Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney. Since then of course Mr Soderbergh's career has gone from strength to strength with critical and popular acclaim for Traffic and Erin Brockovich, not to mention the small matter of Oscar recognition.<p>So what of 'Oceans Eleven', the star-studded remake of the 1960 Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack picture? Well, first off, when it was announced as Soderbergh's next movie, it certainly seemed like an odd choice. The original movie was after all, by all apparent accounts, (to put it kindly) not that good and it was generally felt that it had been something of a vanity project for Old Blue Eyes. Then of course details of the cast started to emerge, and what a cast it is, which includes; George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle (with a silly and pointless English accent), Elliot Gould and in a cameo appearance, world boxing champion Lennox Lewis. Surely the combination of Soderbergh, Clooney, Roberts, Pitt et al could not miss, could it? <p>The story revolves around Danny Ocean (George Clooney), a career criminal who has just emerged from a stretch in jail (cooly wearing a blue tuxedo, of course) and his attempts to put together a crew (of eleven) to rob three Las Vegas casino's. Not only is it his aim to spirit away $80m from a seamingly impenetrable vault but all this is to be achieved whilst wooing back his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) who is dating the sleazy casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). To help in achieving this aim Danny contacts old friend Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), and gets bank-rolled by an ex-Vegas tycoon (Elliot Gould), who has a personal grudge against Benedict. Together they form a crew including a Chinese acrobat (Shaobo Qin), and a Jewish con man (Carl Reiner). Precisely what everyone's role is in the heist and indeed the movie is not always clear and perhaps because of this Matt Damon kind of gets lost among the myriad of stars and Julia Roberts is only really required to smile and look good (which of course she does). <p>Much of the pleasure in this movie is seeing all the plans of the heist fall into place with the odd twist and turn. It also has plenty of humour to bring a smile to your face and although this may not be the most exciting heist movie you will ever see, it is none the less everything that that the original tried and failed to be; smart, stylish and quintessentially cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>A rarity - a remake that's better than the original. Eleven men led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) prepare to rob a vault linked to 3 casinos in Las Vegas. His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Caset Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence. <p>Yes, it's light, yes, it's a trifle but it's so fun! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint - Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She's beautiful but her looks in this movie do not reach their full potential. Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>They may be a modern-day version of the famous 'Rat Pack', this cast of the remake of "Ocean's 11".  There is just such a smooth 'coolness' that emanates from this movie that they viewer can't help but enjoy it.  In an era where film studios and directors try to smash the audience over the head with what they think the audience should think is popular and cool, it's refreshing to see a movie that lets its 'cool' develop on its own.  Director Stephen Soderbergh to a break from such serious, award-winning movies as "Traffic" and "Erin Brockovich" to direct this film that was essentially a recreational activity with a group friends with names such as Pitt, Damon, Clooney, and Roberts.<br /><br />  The plot of "Ocean's 11" centers on a plan by con-man Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his partner-in-crime Rusty (Brad Pitt) to pull off biggest heist in Las Vegas history: the seizure of $150 million from a secure vault that services three of Vegas' biggest casinos.  This does present itself as an easy task to accomplish.  In a humorous aside, the man who will be financing this heist (played by Elliott Gould) tells Ocean and Rusty about the three most successful heist attempts in Las Vegas history.  Each one failed to make it past the security and each one incurred some major injury in the process.  These were the most SUCCESSFUL heists(!), and now Ocean is trying to break into the most secure vault this side of Fort Knox.  Obviously, in order to pull of this caper, many players will need to be involved and have to ply their respective skills in order to make this plan work.  However, beyond just the security issues, there are a couple of issues that put this plan in jeopardy.  #1: The casino vault is controlled by ruthless casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who, when crossed will "kill you, then he'll go to work on you".  #2: Ocean's motives seem suspect when it becomes known to Rusty that Ocean's former wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) is now the girlfriend of Benedict.  Is Danny committed to the success of the heist or will he compromise everything to show up Benedict in an attempt to get Tess back?<br /><br />  Clooney continues to develop into a top-notch leading man by improving on the smoothness he first demonstrated in earlier Soderbergh film, "Out of Sight".  He brings a swagger to the screen that is reminiscent of Sinatra's 'Rat Pack' days.  Garcia is perfectly cast as the menacing Benedict in this film.  The viewer can taste the venom dripping off every word he utters.  The performances of Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, and Elliott Gould add a degree of panache to the proceedings.  The Asian actor who played the contortionist was a unique 'twist' (no pun intended).  The Malloy brothers, played by Casey Affleck and Scott Caan don't really bring much to the screen other than there juvenile bickering, but they are necessary to plot.  The one truly disappointing performance is turned in by Julia Roberts as Tess Ocean.  Roberts seems like she has very little to do here other than pose as window dressing and upbraid Danny for being a 'bad boy'.  I don't know if it was just the material are just a poor performance, but an actress of Roberts' caliber shouldn't fail to register in a movie like this.  That gripe aside, though, "Ocean's 11" is as good a time as one can have at the movies.  If only more 'fun' flicks like this could be made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;Ocean's 11,&quot; directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a remake of a 1960 film of the same name. That first film co-starred the notorious &quot;Rat Pack,&quot; which included Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. Soderbergh's version stars George Clooney as Danny Ocean, an ex-convict who organizes a team of 11 criminals for an audacious plot: to rob the vault of Las Vegas casinos owned by super-rich Terry Benedict (played with a nice edge by Andy Garcia).<p>&quot;O11&quot; is a very entertaining film: an effective mix of humor, character drama, inventive plot twists, and high-tech thrills. The superb ensemble cast includes Julia Roberts (as Clooney's love interest), Matt Damon (as a pickpocket), and Brad Pitt (as a master card player). The ensemble members have great chemistry together. Clooney follows up terrific roles in &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; and &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; with his role as Ocean. Clooney is charming and likeable, and his expressive eyes bring a nice wistful touch to his performance.<p>The film is also greatly enlivened by the versatile Don Cheadle as a British demolitions expert. Elliot Gould is hilarious as a rival to Garcia's character: watch out for his outrageous costumes. But my favorite performance in the film belongs to show biz legend Carl Reiner as an aging con man; he is outstanding, and quite endearing, in his double-layered role.<p>Some aspects of the plot are a bit far-fetched, and I must admit to a degree of unease with a film that essentially glorifies destructive criminal behavior. But the film's strong points are evident. I particularly like how the film evokes the excitement, glamour, and intrigue of the high-stakes Las Vegas scene. &quot;Ocean's 11&quot; is another strong effort from one of our most interesting directors.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>Let me see if I get this striaght:  We're supposed to pretend that George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Don Cheadle (who?) are Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr.  Give me a break!

With that criterion, Soderbergh succeeds beautifully - this is a fun film, a popcorn movie in the best sense of the term.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite pull itself up enough to be a film that one would wish to watch over and over.<br /><br />The story - Danny Ocean, newly released from prison, hatches a plot to rob the vault at a Vegas casino, estimated to be worth 150 million.  He gathers 10 associates to help and we're provided with a complex but not complicated plan to break into the vault and more importantly, to escape with the loot.  To Soderbergh's credit, he keeps us guessing as to how the plan will ultimately unfold, and his solution is both deceptively simple and elegant, without cheating (a VERY important point!).<br /><br />However, Soderbergh's most important contribution is his reputation as a director, enabling him to bring in big names for relatively small parts.  This makes the film work, as the audience immediately recognises the actors and can therefore keep each character straight in his/her mind.  With 11 heist plotters, plus the casino owner and his girlfriend, gives 13 major characters - quite a number for a 2-hour film!  In fact, much of the fun is provided by the performances - Brad Pitt (for my money, the best actor of his generation), Julia Roberts (arguably the biggest movie star in the world), Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, etc., etc., etc.  George Clooney, the putative #1 star, makes no attempt to hog screen time and all seem happy to be part of the ensemble.<br /><br />But..... The film never really rises above its genre.  It's fun, but you don't take it home with you.  Enjoy it for the couple hours it runs, but it's unlikely to leave much lasting impression.  Part of that is because there's no reason to buy this DVD.  It consists solely of a 15-minute making-of featurette (possibly the most annoying, self-agrandising featurette I've seen in years!) and 2 audio commentaries.  The one by Soderbergh and his screenwriter is informative, but the second, by Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt, is the only real reason to buy the DVD - it's almost as much fun as the film itself.  (Pitt, especially, seems to have taken an interest in doing commentaries, and I welcome actors' contributions to them).</p></br></body></html>

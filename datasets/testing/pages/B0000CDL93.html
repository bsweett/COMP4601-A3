It's also scary as hell. The movie explores our collective national nightmare about the assassination of the President and its potential links to Castro, the Mob, the CIA, and of course Vietnam and the Military-Industrial Complex. It does not merely suggest that a great evil befell our country that horrible day in 1963, but shouts it from the rooftops. How Stone ever got this movie made is beyond me. But I'm glad he did.<p>&quot;JFK&quot; is first and foremost a movie. It is not a documentary and it is not journalism. I agree with critics and others who find its value in its willingness to confront such a difficult subject and exhort its audience to question authority, use their &quot;eyes and ears and good sense.&quot; Did Oliver Stone convince me that Lee Harvey Oswald did not, in fact, act alone -- that none other than Lyndon Johnson and military defense contractors were in fact behind the assassination? Not necessarily. But this movie intrigued me and scared me and got me to thinking, and that is really the highest compliment I can pay a Hollywood film. Most movies are interested in only one thing: money. This one is interested in ideas, enlightenment, and seeking out the truth. That alone makes &quot;JFK&quot; a rarity.<p>Besides all that, it's a terrific piece of filmmaking, period. I'm not a big fan of Oliver Stone, but what he pulled off here is remarkable. &quot;JFK&quot; feels like a combination of Hitchcock and Spielberg, with maybe a little Brian De Palma and Frank Capra thrown in. From the photography to the sound to the editing, it's a masterwork, vivid and alive. Though there is a lot of dialogue -- and two scenes that amount to soliloquies of Shakespearean depth -- Stone never bogs down, never loses steam, never loses his train of thought. The whole movie builds up to a climactic courtroom sequence that pulls all the threads together into a picture of what MIGHT have happened in Dallas that day. It then leaves us to think, and ask questions, and keep our own eyes open.<p>I want to mention three of the actors. First, Tommy Lee Jones, who is seductively evil as Clay Shaw/Bertrand. He deserved to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year, but of course there's no justice in that ceremony. Second, Joe Pesci, panicky and devilish as David Ferrie -- here's a whirlwind performance that dwarfs his fast-talking work in &quot;Lethal Weapon 2.&quot; Finally, Kevin Costner, turning in a powerful portrayal of Jim Garrison. Costner is in almost every scene, sometimes just watching and listening, but always credible in a role that took a lot of guts for him to play (after all, he is Stone's mouthpiece for a lot of highly unpopular ideas). Anyone who doubts Costner's acting ability has obviously never seen this film.<p>There are disturbing moments, many of them highlighted by pungent dialogue that gets right to the point. Donald Sutherland gets the movie's most gripping scene, walking Costner through all of &quot;the facts&quot; behind the assassination (it's a brilliant scene -- Garrison almost literally shuts down, he's so overwhelmed by what he's hearing). Lines like &quot;subtle as a cockroach crawling across a white carpet,&quot; &quot;it's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma&quot; and &quot;people like you just walk between the raindrops&quot; have a strangely chilling effect; simple lines that cast the drama in a sinister light.<p>Look, I realize that Stone altered some of the facts to fit his cinematic story (Ferrie, for instance, did not die under such suspicious circumstances). I know that the movie is not unbiased -- that it's a bald representation of the ideas of the man behind it. So what? Here is a movie that takes more risks than any other, before or since. It has flaws, but they are minor. &quot;JFK&quot; was the best film of 1991 and stands as one of my favorites ... disturbing though it may be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO.html">A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO</a><br/><p>A riveting drama of Jim Garrison & his pursuit for the truth in the Kennedy assassination. Kevin Costner plays the role superbly, with Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw. Sissy Spacek plays Mrs. Garrison who feels her husband is spending too much time on the case and not enough time with his family. This movie will make you stop and think...was it a conspiracy?</p></br><a href="../users/A243HY69GIAHFI.html">A243HY69GIAHFI</a><br/><p>JFK is brilliant filmmaking.  Innovative use of period stock, timeline distortion, flashbacks, and great acting all combine to immerse the viewer in a world that feels decidedly real.  Stone succeeded wildly in technically innovating his way to a new kind of cinema verite. The problem is, of course, JFK's just a movie, but the people it depicted (mostly) existed.  That immediately opens up Stone's directorial tour-de-force to criticism on grounds of accuracy.  There, it languishes in ambiguity and doubt.<p>Though Garrison only barely lived to see the film released, his colleagues at the time have since given interviews in which they described the characterizations of Ferry, Shaw and other principles as unfamiliar.  As another reviewer has pointed out, no mention is really made of Shaw's meritorious military service in World War II, nor is Garrison's characterization of Shaw as a "CIA operative" really challenged (he was never on the CIA payroll).  Likewise, the film fails to directly explore what happened to Garrison in later life, and how his theories about the assassination kept getting broader and less fact-based.  There's no discussion of the allegations of bought witnesses, flimsy evidence, or corruption which swirled around Garrison at later stages of his investigation, and which ultimately helped to lose him a re-election bid.  Garrison is merely portrayed as a quixotic hero tilting at government windmills.  <p>And indeed maybe he was.  Maybe the loss of David Ferrie (his star witness) was so devastating to his case that he tried to put it back together again, using flimsier evidence.  Maybe he really had a case and it just evaporated.  Or maybe, like some members of the Lousiana press were reporting at the time, he had nothing.  <p>JFK does little to settle the debate surrounding Jim Garrison.  If anything- and maybe this was Stone's point all along--it's just deepened it.  That escalating debate is mirrored in the emotions evoked by the film itself.<p>At its worst, JFK is seen to be dangerous, fact-starved propoganda.  Some have found it easy to compare Stone to the acclaimed German director, Leni Riefenstahl, whose stunning art glorified Hitler's regime at the expense of literal truth.  <p>At its best, Stone's vision is a dramatization of a few branches of the assassination story unknown to most Americans.  Prior to this film, many were unaware that there had been any sort of court case at all connected with the assassination, and that it might have led to a conviction, had Garrison been able to provide better witnesses.  It can be claimed that the many inaccuracies in the film are no more egregious than what generally happens in many historical dramas.  <p>Whatever faults there are in the facts on display, though, there is actual history in Oliver Stone's film.  It's just not the history of the assassination, or even an entirely accurate record of Garrison's investigation.  Rather, JFK's strength is in dramatizing some of the main conspiracy theories.  And if viewed as more allegory than fact--if Costner's Garrison is seen as a theatrical lens through which to view the various strands of conspiracy theory that have long floated around the assassination--then it works less problematically than if you try to see it as a definitive history of anything that happened in Lousiana or Texas in the 1960s.  <p>Fifty years from now, JFK will likely be seen as an accurate history of the way the assassination made people feel.  The assassination was the start of anger and rebellion against the government in America.  And, whatever its other faults, JFK shows why.  Even if many of the events in JFK aren't literally true, and real people take an unjustified beating in Stone's harsh light, Stone isn't exactly making it up.  He's putting on the screen the questions that so many Americans had then, and certainly continue to ask.  He doesn't arrive at his conclusions through meticulous academic research; Stone assumes, perhaps to his detriment, that Garrison and Marrs have already done his homework for him.  No, JFK Is history by reflection.  Stone has put a giant mirror in front of the American people and asked whether we like what we see.<p>[DVD Notes: Don't even bother with any other version but the new Director's cut.  Neither DVD version has any significant additional featres, but at least the Director's cut has 17 more minutes of footage.  It's very frustrating that the DVDs are so devoid of extra features, because there's so much that could have been included.  The only reason I'm taking a star away from this product is because of the inexplicably missing bonus material.]</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>"JFK" is a movie that combines drama with a documentary style, and it's a shocking experience for many reasons. The movie was made back on those days when Kevin Costner was a superstar in a hot streak, with movies like "Dances With Wolves" and "Bull Durham", and in this movie Costner gave one of his finest performances. He was the centerpiece of this daring and powerful movie.<br /><br />But he was not alone, Oliver Stone surrounded him with an all-star cast, that includes big names like Sissy Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Walter Matthau, Wayne Knight and Vincent D'Onofrio.<br /><br />"JFK" is built with theories, some of them are obviously fiction or just a mere supposition, but a lot of them seem authentic and based in real evidence. Oliver Stone pointed the finger to almost everybody: the FBI, the CIA, Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, Clay Shaw and many others. But he seems to hit the center of the target when he practically says that Kennedy was murdered because he didn't wanted to take part in the HUGE industry that is the war, an industry that moves BILLIONS of dollars, and a big part of USA's economical power.<br /><br />"JFK" presented an innovative narrative style, it combined real footage with acted scenes, but the acted parts were processed as historical footage, he also used a fast, dynamic editing to create interest in the audience, and of course "JFK" is interesting and provocative at all time. "JFK" has great acting (although John Candy was over the top, and some hair wigs are just hilarious), great direction, a solid script (yes, some theories are too forced, but there are solid theories as well), and the movie achieves its biggest goal: the movie gives something to think about to the viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>For anyone remotely interested in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, this film is a must-see. "JFK" dramatizes the events that led up to Kennedy's death on that fateful day in Dallas on November 22, 1963 and the subsequent days and months that Americans will never forget. The story is told through the eyes of a former New Orleans district attorney, Jim Garrison, played beautifully by Kevin Costner, and his belief that Lee Harvey Oswald did not murder the President and his opinion that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy by the U.S. government and other individuals.<br /><br /> Oliver Stone directed and co-wrote "JFK" and based his work on two books that dealt with Kennedy's death. The movie went on to become one of the biggest films of the 1990's and was subsequently nominated for an amazing eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture, ultimately winning two for Best Editing and Cinematography. The film was also a financial giant grossing over $200,000,000 worldwide.<br /><br /> This excellent two-disc set comes with an impressive array of bonus features including 54 minutes of deleted scenes, audio commentary by Oliver Stone, and a documentary entitled "Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspriracy".</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>For most of his career as writer/director, Oliver Stone has associated himself with controversial movies.  None provoked discussion more than "JFK," now available in an Ultimate Collector's Edition from Warner Home Video.  This powerful film about the mysteries surrounding the Kennedy assassination was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Tommy Lee Jones).  The all-star cast includes Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, and Ed Asner.  The three-disc set includes 17 minutes not seen in theatres, the documentary "Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy," deleted scenes, five reproduction letters written by or to John F. Kennedy, a set of six character photo cards with the stars and bios of the real people they portray, and a 44-page book of rare behind-the-scenes production photos.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>Conspiracy theories get a workout in Oliver Stone's JFK--he has hit upon every conceivable theory, every point and counterpoint to be made and has produced an absorbing, involving, and ultimately entertaining film that makes you think about which theory you believe is the likeliest. And he has a cast that brings every important character to life, even though the physical resemblances are not always there.<br /><br />KEVIN COSTNER, for example, is excellent as the doggedly determined D.A. Jim Garrison (but looks nothing like the real Jim Garrison) who will leave no stone unturned in his effort to find the truth behind the killing of JFK--even if it means ignoring his wife and family while he pursues justice. Costner uses his Honest Abe image to give the sort of heartfelt, man-of-integrity intensity that James Stewart and Henry Fonda might have given in their day. He is made to seem like a towering figure of integrity in the script Stone has written from Jim Garrison's point of view--almost like Atticus Finch resurrected, especially in his closing courtroom speech. Was the real Jim Garrison really this noble?<br /><br />As a note of irony, Stone has the real Jim Garrison playing Earl Warren and defending the Warren Commission Report with a straight face.<br /><br />Other roles are played with equal validity by Tommy Lee Jones (as Clay Shaw), Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Ed Asner (infuriating as Guy Bannister), and Joe Pesci as David Ferrie. Pesci is a bit over the top as David Ferrie (and gets on the nerves) but that's the way the role was written and directed.<br /><br />But the most remarkable moments in the film are provided by the exchange of information between Kevin Costner and Donald Sutherland as the extent of the conspiracy is revealed to come from higher places in the government. Sutherland gives an imposing performance, quietly restrained but chilling as he delivers his insider information.<br /><br />Special mention must go to Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. His face, voice and gestures are strikingly similar and blend well with actual footage of Oswald intermittently seen.<br /><br />Altogether a very competent piece of filmmaking which fulfills its purpose by making the viewer think about what might actually have happened on that awful day in Dallas when the age of innocence officially ended in American politics. Whether it's the Mafia, Castro's Cubans, the FBI, the CIA or LBJ and the Pentagon (with the help of the Warren Commission), it's all there for you to sort out and ponder--perhaps until 2029 when some new suppressed evidence will eventually be released.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>The last words he heard were, "You can't say Dallas doesn't love you, Mr. Kennedy." The sky was blue and the sun was shining as gun shots echoed in Dealey Plaza.  At that moment, all he was fated to be was done and his self-named Camelot vanished.  Immortalized in death, the man became a myth, and a mystery was given life.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's JFK -- DIRECTOR'S CUT (Warner Home Video) is a new two-disc Special Edition with an extraordinary commentary track by Stone that explores in detail the paradoxes and enigmas of Kennedy's assassination and aftermath.<br /><br />New to this edition is the superb feature-length documentary, BEYOND JFK: The Question of Conspiracy.<br /><br />If everything in this movie were fiction, it would still rank as one of the great political thrillers.  This superior piece of filmmaking that looks behind the mirror at the moment in American culture when our collective paradigm truly shifted.  Highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Stone has created a masterpiece.  The monologue of Donald Sutherland and the scene where Costner explains how he believes JFK was shot make this movie one of the most memorable that I have ever seen.<p>The only problem with this film is that the viewer is not sure if everything that is presented as fact, really is fact and not the invention of Stone for dramatic affect.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Whether or not the film answers the questions surrounding the death of President Kennedy, it does boast bravura performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, and, in a small yet memorable cameo, Larry Hagman.  John Williams also contributes a very subtle yet powerful score, simultaneously ominous and poignant.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>A triumph for everyone involved. But this is Oliver Stone's picture all the way, you can clearly see that he is also obsessed with the Kennedy assassination and that's where the film gets it's passion and it's  unstoppable search for the truth. He took as a premise, the case of Jim  Garrison, the only lawyer to ever take the Kennedy assassination to court.  This is only the excuse for Stone to bombard us with fascinating and  dangerous information that may or may not be true, but we all know that  something fishy was going on. Besides being a directorial triumph it is  also a technical landmark with outstanding editing, probably among the best  ever. A terrific all-star cast bring all these characters to life. Some we  pity, others we despise and some we respect. Kevin Costner gives a  dramatically powerful and effective performance as Jim Garrison, he's got  the All-American look stamped on his face. An extremely good supporting  cast filled with heavy-hitters. Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant as Clay Shaw  (Clay Bertrand). Gary Oldman is quietly effective as the patsy himself, Lee  Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon and John Candy are also great. Jack  Lemmon and Walter Matthau appear in yet another film together, and both  deliver good performances. But it is Donald Sutherland's cameo as Mr. 'X'  that is really gripping, those few scenes he is in, you can't blink. A  brilliant and truly important film. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a  9!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's "JFK" is a monstrous epic that revolves around the whole mystery around President Kennedy's assassination.  While it is a dramatic picture and Stone most likely twisted a few things to make this a more relevant and better movie, it is still an undeniable powerhouse that has you go through a whole set of emotions, ranging from fear, anger, paranoia and sadness.  There's no question that the majority of the country believes that there is more to the assassination than we were lead to believe.  I don't think it's exactly how it is in the movie, but that's not important.  What is important is that the film works for many reasons.<br /><br />President Kennedy has been assassinated.  Lee Harvey Oswald is the suspect and gets shot shortly after.  There is a secretive and brief hearing on the whole assassination, and it is in stone that Oswald was a lone gunman and nobody else was involved.  Seems like an open-and-shut-case, but District Attorney Jim Garrison isn't willing to buy it.  With his staff, they decide to work on the case, until they are shut down by the government.  Three years later, Garrison isn't willing to stand by in silence anymore and decides to go ahead with the case.  The further he digs, the more horrible truths he uncovers.  Not only that, but people high up in the ranks are willing to do anything to make sure that the American Public will never find out about them.<br /><br />As I said, this isn't meant to be an entirely accurate portrayal of how everything happened.  It suggests to you that it could've been this way, and it even does a good job of presenting its case to you.  What I think Stone was trying to achieve was to create his own commentary on how people feel about the handling of the whole assassination and how sloppily the case was handled.  The film wasn't made to merely exploit the death of Kennedy, but what it does exploit is the fact that we're willing to believe anything they tell us in the media.  It's a hard concept to grasp, because it's not too far from the truth.  The movie is brilliantly directed and well-acted.  Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career.  The film has a whole list of famous actors in it, like Gary Oldman, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek and a whole bunch more.  They are all fantastic in their roles.<br /><br />A word of warning; this is a VERY LONG movie.  It is about 3 and a half hours long in running time.  If you want to watch this, then you have to really commit to it.  If you're not in the mood for a very lengthy movie, then you will not be able to enjoy this.  The new 2-Disc Special Edition offers a remastered director's cut that looks and sounds great.  Another interesting feature is the documentary, "Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy."  Extras included are deleted/extended scenes, commentary from the director, theatrical trailer, essays and DVD-ROM features.  A very nice package that does the film justice.<br /><br />JFK" is an amazing picture that did not bore me for a single second.  Not only does it work as a powerful drama, but it also works as an intense thriller.  Did everything happen the way the movie proposes?  Maybe, maybe not.  What the film does is make you think about everything that happened around the assassination.  Any film that can get the brain thinking is more than okay in my book.  A very character-driven and passionate epic that is perfectly executed by Oliver Stone.<br />-Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; is a remarkable film that is too often overshadowed by the very real events upon which it is based and by the perceived political agenda of its director. But, as Stone himself has stated on numerous occasions, the movie is not meant to stand as a definitive historical document but rather as an alternative look at what might have happened on that fateful day in Dallas given the conflicting and incomplete information that came out of the official final word on President Kennedy's assassination, The Warren Commission Report. Much of &quot;JFK&quot; is based on known fact but Stone has taken it one step further and extrapolated out a variety of possible realities based on the many unanswered questions and perplexing coincidences that surround the case.<br /><br />The central character in the film is Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the district attorney from New Orleans who actually brought the case of the Kennedy assassination to court -- some three years after the fact. Although his attempt to convict Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) of conspiracy in the assassination of the president was doomed to failure, the facts that he uncovered, and continued to pursue through his later writings on the subject, gave a certain legitimacy to the claims by conspiracy theorists that all was not right with the official investigation. Through countless scenes, the government's assertion that Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) was in fact a lone gunman who acted of his own volition and with no outside help is continuously under siege. By the end of the film, every preconceived notion that the viewer may have had regarding the assassination has been called into question.<br /><br />In addition to the actors mentioned above, &quot;JFK&quot; is a virtual who's-who of Hollywood talent. Rounding out the cast are Kevin Bacon, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, and even John Candy. In all instances, the performers bring a certain degree of mystery to their roles that really reinforces the overall disconcerting feel of the film.<p>Enough about the film already, what about the DVD? Well, as many of you know, Warner first released &quot;JFK&quot; as a movie-only edition back in 1997. While this DVD featured Oliver Stone's preferred director's cut of the movie with some 17 additional minutes of footage reinserted, the video was non-anamorphic and the audio was a merely serviceable DD 2.0 mix. In addition, the lack of any extras was a shame and the disc itself was a dreaded &quot;flipper&quot;. With this new release, Warner has addressed all of these issues and &quot;JFK&quot; is at long last available in a fine special edition DVD.<br /><br />&quot;JFK&quot; is presented in anamorphic widescreen, preserving the 2.35:1 aspect ratio of the original theatrical release. Sharpness is usually quite solid although the extensive use of filters lends a somewhat soft appearance to the image in a number of scenes. Black levels and contrast are good with only the darkest of scenes losing fine shadow detail. Colors are accurate and exhibit no signs of bleeding but the palette is, for the most part, somewhat muted. I could spot no instances of compression artifacts and the edge enhancement that plagued the original release is mercifully gone. The video is a marked improvement over the old release and, while it isn't a perfect transfer, I could find no glaring issues with the work Warner has done preparing this release.<br /><br />Just as the video has been upgraded for the new special edition, so too has the audio. Replacing the fairly good Dolby Digital 2.0 mix on the previous release is a brand-new 5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack available in both English and French. The increase in dynamic range afforded by this new mix really makes John Williams's moving score come alive and adds some overall depth to the soundtrack as a whole. Surround use is frequent and well-integrated and dialogue is always clear and firmly anchored to the center. While this new 5.1 mix certainly won't give the best soundtracks a run for their money, it is a fair improvement over the previous release and is very well done.<p>Now we come to that facet of DVD that truly defines a special edition -- the extras. Seeing as how the film itself is quite long, Warner has taken the step of making &quot;JFK&quot; into a two-disc release in order to accommodate the plentiful bonus features.<br /><br />Disc One features the movie itself and provides a very engaging commentary track by Oliver Stone. I've listened to a number of his commentaries and they are always informative, entertaining, and full of great personal and professional recollections. &quot;JFK&quot; is no exception as the director delves into every facet of this remarkable film. His tone is always conversational which makes the three plus hours spent listening to him more enjoyable than one might expect. Rounding out the extras on Disc One are cast and crew bios and filmographies as well as a list of the awards that &quot;JFK&quot; has garnered.<p><br />Disc Two is where the real strength of this special edition resides. First up is a 15 minute interview entitled &quot;Meet Mr. X: The Personality and Thoughts of Fletcher Prouty&quot; in which the real-life Mr. X discusses his particular take on the assassination. Played by Donald Sutherland in the movie, Mr. X was to Jim Garrison as Deep Throat was to Bob Woodward -- a shadowy source who provides the hints needed to further the investigation. Next up is &quot;Assassination Update: The New Documents,&quot; a 30 minute multimedia essay hosted by noted conspiracy theorist James DiEugenio. Combining text, photographs, and video clips, Mr. DiEugenio delivers a very riveting, if not a bit overwhelming and scattershot, look at the facts of the case that have come to light in recent years.<p><br />Are we done yet? Not even close. Also included on Disc Two is 50 minutes of additional footage that can be viewed individually or as a complete set and with or without Oliver Stone's accompanying commentary. Combine this with the 17 minutes previously added back into the film and you have well over an hour of footage that wasn't in the original theatrical release. As is the case with some of the scenes that were added to the director's cut, much of this bonus material is redundant. Nevertheless, there are some real gems here and it's great that this abundance of cutting room casualties are included on the DVD.<p>Rounding out the extras on Disc Two is the DVD-ROM content that features links to a number of websites, a series of theatrical trailers for this and other Oliver Stone films, print reviews of &quot;JFK,&quot; and a link for a future online chat with Oliver Stone. Whew!<br /><br />Now we turn to an aspect of this DVD that I rarely mention in a review -- the packaging. &quot;JFK&quot; is presented in Warner's preferred snapper case, which should come as no surprise. But, in order to accommodate the two discs, a pocket has been added to the cover flap and Disc Two resides there in a flimsy little envelope. It really is a screwy method that may be a bit rough on that second disc over the long haul so it's best that the buyer be forewarned. But, on the plus side, Warner has taken the negative comments about this packaging to heart and have promised to come up with a better alternative for any future two disc sets.<br /><br />&quot;JFK&quot; is a thought-provoking film that remains almost as big a conundrum as the subject upon which it is based. Many viewers and critics see it as nothing more than another political rant by that crazy Ollie Stone. Others have had their eyes opened wide upon seeing it and no longer view the world in quite the same rosy light as they once did. Skillfully filmed, well-acted, and at its very core quite unsettling, &quot;JFK&quot; stands as one of Oliver Stone's finest films.<br /><br />And what better way to treat a great film than with a brand new two disc special edition DVD? Featuring vastly improved video and audio, the new release presents &quot;JFK&quot; in fine fashion. The wealth of bonus features that examine the film itself, and the real-life events it revolves around, add some much needed depth to the understanding of this pivotal moment in American history. Throw in the fact that Warner is offering this two disc special edition for much less than some studios sell their bare-bones DVDs for and you have a sure-fire winner. The film and the DVD both come very highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the 2 Disc- Oliver Stone Collection- Special Edition (Director's Cut) DVD<br /><br />Oliver Stone uses facts,speculation and some dramatic liscense to bring us this fascinating look back at the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination.The New Orleans District Attorney at the time of the murder was Jim Garrison(Kevin Costner), who uncovers a chain of evidence that leads back to his city and a possible conspiracy theory.He persues the evidence,witnesses, and suspects, and finally years later brings the first and only trial of the conspiracy theory to the courts.<br /><br />Stone's gripping film unpeels the layers of this "mystery wrapped in an enigma" by following Garrison and his staff's endless investigation into the facts.Interviews with the witnesses that heard and saw shots coming from the "grassy knoll" area, the "magic bullet" theory,which showed that there was more than one rifle and more than three bullets shot(as previously stated in the Warren Commission report) and conflicting autopsy reports to name a few.<br /><br />Garrison also has conversations with a man called"X", who relays information vital to the case that causes us to ponder not who or how many shot Kennedy, but WHY was he assasinated. Speculation on this leads to one theory, the discovery that Kennedy had set a plan in motion to pull out of Viet Nam, but there were many powerful people against this(ranging from the mafia all the way to the White House), and the day of Kennedy's funeral Lyndon Johnson signed documents that in effect brought us full force into Viet Nam.Other theories are also brought to light.<br /><br />The film,based on Jim Garrison's books, is outstanding in all respects. It looks at all of the issues and will keep you intrigued until the end. There is actual footage of the day of the assassination incorporated, and the photography going from color to black and white(in the flashbacks) is excellent. There are so many fine performances, I'll just name a few. Kevin Costner anchors this magnificent cast as the low key Garrison, Tommy Lee Jones is Clay Shaw,the only suspect brought to trial. Kevin Bacon as a key witness, Joe Pesci is wonderful as David Ferrie, the paranoid link to everyone, and Gary Oldman IS Lee Harvey Oswald! Donald Sutherland is the mysterious "X". The Musical Score by John Williams adds greatly to the film.<br /><br />In most cases I usually view the "extras" on a DVD as a bonus. In this case I was as enthralled by these features as I was by the film. They were welcome additons to this film of historical importance. Some included are interviews with the real"X", this was very enligthning,and new and updated information on the evidence surrounding this 40 year old mystery. There are also deleted/extended scenes with or without Stone's commentary and more. There are also subtitles in English Frensh, Spanish and Portugese if needed.The widescreen,clarity of picture and sound is as wonderful as the film. This DVD is a great addition to any film library.<br /><br />Each time I view this film I discover something new. You will too!.....Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRH302">Marilyn Monroe - The Final Days</a>(great bio includes clip of Marilyn singing happy birthday to JFK)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087EYC">Best Picture Collection - Epic Dramas (Casablanca/Gone With the Wind/Ben-Hur)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009QAIKM">Gandhi</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 3/06, 6/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />3/06: At first upon starting JFK, my initial reaction was "one and half marathon of boredom." After seeing JFK, it turned out that I was dead wrong. JFK is an incredible masterpiece and is the best movie ever in the whole career of Oliver Stone. Absolutely outstanding are the film editing, the story-telling, and most of all, the acting. Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, and Kevin Costner are mesmerizing and captivating. It's a shame that all of them, although I disagree vehemently with Tommy Lee Jones', aren't worthy of accolades. Simply, Kevin Costner is thoroughly brilliant. I've often complained that films taking on a supposedly huge magnitude and underestimating it, but Oliver Stone really did achieve the behemoth scale in its landscape based on the bureaucratic levels in terms of politics. Jim Garrison, in a brilliant quote, after learning the real story from Donald Sutherland's character sums up the startling discovery, "The size of this is...beyond me." Yes, quite so...so beyond me, too. JFK is just a brilliant political thriller. Three hours and twenty-six minutes of this director's cut whizzes through me like if it is a short story mystery. I absolutely love this movie so much for its attention-grabber, and I never thought conspiracy uncovering would have been this exciting as I saw in JFK. It is so methodically a much better film than Thirteen Days.<br /><br />6/11: JFK is a tour de force of performances from a throughly all-star cast at the hands of a master filmmaker. Oliver Stone has directed his best work in JFK. It's a complete picture, tackling a dangerous subject involving too many conjectures and "what ifs" with very little substantial proofs. In short, it's a conspiracy theory picture at best. It is also a great piece of work. Kevin Costner should be lauded for handling his work with ease and confidence. He is a professional actor who ranks up there with the best of the best. Obviously, everybody else throws their chips in and takes the picture further to another level. JFK is 206 minutes of fascination, never letting down or losing steam. It's a brilliant picture. All in all, JFK remains one of the best pictures of 1990's.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>As someone who experienced the assassination of President Kennedy as an 11 year old, I found myself rather engrossed in Oliver Stone's JFK.  I knew more about the assassination than the later trial in New Orleans.  Frankly, that whole episode seemed like a political side show.  However, I'm glad to have found out more about Garrison's investigation.  My own personal opinion of the assassination was that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.  The surge of conspiracy books and theories was overwhelming in the years after 1963.  I recall an earlier film that I believe was titled "Executive Action" which starred, among others, Robert Ryan and Burt Lancaster.  An impressive part of that film was the closing list of all the people directly or indirectly involved in the investigation who had died under unusual circumstances.  Frankly, it was the enormity of those who believed in a conspiracy that gave me the greatest assurance that there was none.  After all, how would you keep such an elaborate scheme such a secret over so many decades?  People eventually talk and the theory that those who knew were eliminated ignored the presumed fact that this would merely end up involving more and more people.<br /><br />As a practical person, I found myself caught in between my self-assurance and the suspenseful creation of the conspiracy in "JFK".  I decided, for the sake of art appreciation, to just let myself enjoy the movie...and I did.  My one objection to the movie was the depiction of Garrison's family life.  It slowed down the movie, distracted us from the suspense, and unnecessarily made a bigger hero out of Jim Garrison than the movie required.  If it were all true then what did his homelife matter?<br /><br />"JFK" excels because even non-believers can set reality aside and enjoy an excellent suspenseful drama.  The acting, directing, writing etc is all very well done.<br /><br />As a side light to "JFK", the next movie I watched was "The Paralax View".  I had no idea that I was watching essentially the same political assassination theme.  This one went out of its' way to be out on the fringe.  It's concept of assassination for assasination's sake made me realize that Oliver Stone knew that the greater the dose of reality, the more engrossing the suspense.  I got to thinking that too much of this sort of movie could be a bad thing.  As a public service, I offer the suggestion of watching "The Conversation" as an antidote.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>More has been written on this historical event than any other in history and I'll add a couple worthless lines of my own (if for no other reason than for some reason I decided to write up a bunch of reviews for spy/ conspiracy flicks on Amazon). I have virtually no interest in JFK or who killed him or why. The president that exists in popular imagination and media is largely a fabrication. The very fact Kennedy's brief time in the White House came to labeled "Camelot" perfectly illustrates mankind's tragic susceptibility to propaganda and favoring of myth over mere facts and empirical evidence. Always look at the voting record. Always look at the record. First thing to say is this is a movie. People always are saying, "It's just a movie" and of course often times because somebody they're responding to at least in their judgement is taking things too seriously. Well, I'd venture to say that this is indeed a great and in some ways brilliant movie, especially the editing. JFK is a classic crime mystery and political thriller. 4.5 Stars for the movie. However, Oliver Stone's JFK is not a subsitute for reading some of the many books--some of which aren't crazy at all--on this event. Oliver Stone wanted his film to challenge the official story, particularly the Warren Commission Report which he simply regards "a great myth". Stone took it upon himself to fight this myth, "And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a countermyth". Keep this in mind when considering the movie.<br /><br />For my part I think Oswald did it and probably acted alone with nobody else involved in planning and carrying out the hit. A case hasn't been made to really convict any other individual or group even if there have indeed been many doubts and suspicions cast, most of which are unreasonable. But what if "X" individual or group was involved? What of it now? Without getting into the byzantine labyrinth of JFK assassination conspiracy theories I'd just briefly mention that as far as the bigger ones go in which fairly large numbers of people are involved--sometimes from different governmental agencies and other groups--these are mostly discredited by the fact that their isn't more proof of them and at this late date no death bed confessions.<br /><br />And here we are as I add my 2 cents and people are still obsessing over this assassination. If you want to know what you can do for your country I would at least guess Kennedy would be of the opinion that you'd serve the common good by focusing on the many problems at hand, in the world now, geting involved with others doing work--taking action--to make America a great nation and in doing this you would best serve the idealism that JFK came to symbolize. That's how you fight the forces of darkness. Besides you don't ask what the government can do for you because it doesn't care about doing any good for most citizens--you join with other citizens to force the government to live up to its promise. The president isn't who you place your hopes and dreams in for the country.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>&quot;J.F.K.&quot; is Oliver Stone's opus magnum: a thrilling, taut investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy. Did Oswald really pull the trigger that fateful afternoon in Dallas? Perhaps we'll never know. But the film is a potpouri of investigative threads and niche conspiracy theories that, at least for my money, hold more than an ounce of truth. At the very least it shoots holes in the Warren Commission Report which - for anyone who's read it - isn't hard to do.<br />TRANSFER: This is the same stunning transfer that Warner Brothers gave us several years before as part of the Oliver Stone Collection. It's the director's cut. Colors are rich, fully saturated and well balanced. Black and contrast levels are solid. There is a subtle hint of edge enhancement and minor shimmering of fine details but neither will distract. The audio is 5.1 and powerful on every level.<br />EXTRAS: Ah, here's the reason for the re-issue: the brilliant documentary, &quot;Behind The Conspiracy&quot; which is thought-provoking and chilling; sort of like Einstein meets The Silence of the Lambs. There's also all the DVD-ROM junket stuff that came with the previously issued disc.<br />BOTTOM LINE: I had a hard time justifying buying this one again because the only extra feature not previously available was the documentary. But I believe this is a worth-while re-purchase for anyone who owns the previously issued DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICCTSCBT7GS9.html">A3ICCTSCBT7GS9</a><br/><p>How many years should are necessary for discover the lifelikeness or HONESTY concerning this unconvincing event ?

You root for Costner from beginning to end, not because he know's who killed Kennedy, but because of the deep conviction and Gut-Feeling that he think's he know's who killed President Kennedy. That is what the history has become. Not in the books, but in our theories. Mostly fueled by the thing's we cannot see, our fear's about Kennedy's death drove into the creation process of JFK the film. It is First important that you know the fact's about what was assumed to have happened before you allow a hundred different idea's change that view. JFK is great at delivering awesome performances (such as a very long and heated court scene with Costner) and showing a paranoid nation that now remembers exactly what they where doing when John F. Kennedy was killed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's films are being re-released in definitive DVD editions with commentary and extras. The masterpiece of the lot is his controversial take on the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy. This terrific two-disc set includes a riveting and highly detailed audio track by writer/director Stone as well as 17 added minutes to the now 223 minute feature. In Disc B, there's a collection of deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary by Stone and multimedia essays that update the assassination. <p>I was in Dallas on the eve of that fateful day. I remember an eerie, blood-red moon hanging over the flower-strewn grassy knoll at midnight. Later, I spoke to a baffled policeman who was running beside the President's car.  I heard many bizarre stories regarding the immediate aftermath of the events of that day including a witness, a local weatherman on WFAA, who claimed he saw Ruby and Oswald together at Dealy Plaza 24 hours before the death of JFK. Like Stone observes, "Once you enter the rabbit hole, there's no coming back." This gripping mystery-thriller stands on its own as a great piece of technical filmmaking whether fact or fiction (or both). Stone's incredible commentary raises the drama to a new level -- and is a valuable historical document. Cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. Oscar-winning cinematography and editing. Highly recommended. Rated R.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>The movie JFK was made 28 years after the assassaination of President John Kennedy and was an effective history lesson for people who were not alive at the time, like myself. This movie examines the event from the viewpoint of Jim Garrison, a New Oreleans District Attorney who takes a look at the case three years after the shooting and finds numerous inconsistencies with the given investigation. There are many stars in this movie that give great performances, among others Kevin Costner, of course, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau as a U.S. Senator, Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald, Kevin Bacon as a male prostitute, Joe Pesci as a principal part of the conspiracy, Donald Sutherland as an ex-CIA man who helps Garrison, Tommy Lee Jones as a conspirator with a few secrets, and Seinfeld fans will recognize Wayne Knight (Newman). This movie, although it is not a documentary and should not be regarded as one, does make the Lyndon Johnson coup theory seem more than plausible, but the only thing that makes sense. This movie will make amaze and surprise you until the end. It is too long, but it is worth your time.<p>Well, it's provocative, anyway, but pretty -farfetched-, admittedly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>MY IMPRESSION - - INCREDIBLY WELL DONE DRAMATIZATION: BUT WHERE EXACTLY IS THE TRUTH?<br /><br />To evaluate this film fairly is like evaluating the book "State of Fear". If one agrees with the Author/Director's conclusions, the film or book is great. If not, it is garbage or worse, in one's opinion. I have chosen to treat both of these as prime examples of fictionalization. In that light, this film is terrific entertainment and does indeed get people thinking and politicians worrying.<br /><br />A FICTIONALIZED INTERPRETATION OF THE FACTS - -<br /><br />Of course, it is a shame that everything in the book is not pure fact. Watching this film, one becomes certain that Clay Shaw, played by Tommy Lee Jones in an Oscar-winning role, was certainly guilty as sin. After all, we all but saw him commit the crime. Jim Garrison played deftly by Kevin Costner proves every point including Clay Shaw's perjury as we see the answers to the questions Garrison is asking in flashback form which is followed by Shaw telling yet another lie. The same style is used with John Candy's character Dean Andrews answering the question, "Did you ever met Clay Shaw?", with, "I never met the dude", while he asks for more cashews from Shaw in a simultaneous flashback. Oliver Stone uses this flashback device as a sort of lie detector for the viewers' benefit and entertainment throughout the film to reinforce his point. The benefit is the immediate comprehension of the point that Stone wants to make, but the entertainment value is the more lasting one. In essence, watching these scenes over and over is just as comedic each time but as one gets familiar with the facts [as they are being presented], one can both see the flaws in the argument and be drawn to collecting the facts oneself from more objective sources. If only Stone had been a little more objective with his arguments/facts, this film would have been a great gift to humankind instead of just great entertainment for film fans/JFK conspiracy theorists.<br /><br />ABOUT THE 2 DISK DVD SPECIAL EDITION:<br /><br />There are scenes in this DVD that are not on the VHS or theatrical releases. These additions make much of the rapid-fire quasi-facts presented during the Garrison explanations at trial make more sense. Widescreen helps too, as this ensemble cast does not quite fit in full frame in some sequences.<br /><br />FEATURES: THIS DIRECTOR'S CUT 2-DISK SET IS WORTH THE DIFFERENCE!<br /><br />Deleted scenes are usually best left deleted. This film is no exception as they really slow things down, but they do add understanding to the heart of the film's premise. There is also a thought-provoking feature which details what the Congress has done regarding looking into this matter (JFK's assassination) after this film's release.<br /><br />-- * ABRIDGED LIST OF THE CAST -- *<br /><br />Kevin Costner - Jim Garrison<br /><br />Sissy Spacek - Liz Garrison<br /><br />Joe Pesci - David Ferrie<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones - Clay Shaw<br /><br />Gary Oldman - Lee Harvey Oswald<br /><br />Michael Rooker - Bill Broussard<br /><br />Jay O.

However, as a theatrical piece it has no equal in the genre and is thoroughly captivating to see from beginning to end. As to truth, that is something much harder to ascertain. Having said all that, it is definitely worth seeing, and best if watched while paying very close attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's Director's Cut DVD has an extra seventeen minutes of footage added.  This adds to the general suspense of the movie.  JFK starts off very slow, like a History Channel documentary, and you think &quot;Bo-ring!&quot;  But suddenly, in the whirlwind of dizzying camera shots and angles, you realize you are witnessing dark and distorted history being unearthed.  By then you are so deep in, it is impossible to get out.<p>Kevin Costner is brilliant as New Orleans D.A. William Garrison, the man who brought the only public trial to this date on the JFK assassination.  A string of brilliant and well-known actors complement the film.  Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, John Candy, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, and Tommy Lee Jones give the movie so much credibility because their performances are simply so believable, and way out of the usual roles they play.  In fact, this whole film represents a role the U.S. player that is far, far out of the role we usually play.<p>The score by John Williams alternately scares the beejesus out of you, or galvanizes you to action.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>Its undeniably a conspiracy, face it our governement doesnt work, and has Costner states in this movie maybe we should change it.  This film says it all, and even though it is quite long it keeps you interested all the way through and never gets boring.  This is bursting with facts and shocking truths, and is more suspensful then any thriller out there.  The performances are also notably good, and even though Costner is an avergae actor at best, he impressed me with this, and actually had me tearing at the end, because he spoke the truth.  Its powerful, well crafted, very well directed, well acted, all around great film making.  Its not for the weak of heart because you see JFK get shot in the head numerous times and see very clearly what actually happened.  JFK was a good president and if he wasnt assassinated would have done many more great things for america, like stop the vietnam war (My father is a vietnam veteran, and he deserves better then what that idiot Bush is doin for him right now).  This is Stones best film so far, but i think Alexander is probably gonna be better since he has been working on it for years, and Stone is a great director.  I highly recommend seeing this film and Fareinghit 9/11 (sorry if i spelled it wrong) if you have a brain and truly want to understand how screwed up our government is.  10 out of a 10.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>In response to garbages complaints, you have got to look a little deeper into the facts of this case.  The distance that Oswald had to shoot from was considered 'Expert range'.  Oswald was not a prize marksman.  And he was using a mediocre weapon.  They had experts shoot the same distance with the same type of gun and they could barely make the shot on 90% of the attempts.  Oliver Stone's depiction is riveting, no doubt, but I'm sure he takes plenty of liberties.  He is liberal as hell and loves to create controversy.  The movie is still full of real facts, including the reaction of Kennedy's body when he was shot and the muzzle flash from the knoll.  THERE WAS DEFINITELY ANOTHER PERSON SHOOTING AT KENNEDY'S CAR.  There are other facts that raise a lot of questions as well.  The route of the motorcade, Oswalds motive, Ruby's death.  If you want to create an opinion, get information from more than one source.  This debate has been going on for a long time and we know there have been cover ups and undisclosed information.  Posner's book is most likely a jaded and one sided opinion.  The movie is fantastic, it makes you ask a lot of questions.  Good performances, one of Costner's best, with a very good accent.  John Candy makes a suprising and impressive dramatic turn.  All others; Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, Donald Sutherland and Gary Oldman all contribute greatly and make this a facinating movie based on historical fact.  No movie should be confused with a history lesson.  That's why I gave it four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Now that some time has passed and the dust has settled, JFK can be looked at as a movie that is NOT historically accurate portrayl of what went down on that fateful day in Dallas, but rather an engaging, nail-biting thriller.<p>Whether you agree or disagree with Stone's view, there is no disputing the craftsmenship that went into this film. The use of multiple film stocks that create layers upon layers of interpretation of the events depicted. The editing alone is masterful as Stone juggles many subplots at once. Robert Richardson's cinematography is incredible (there's a reason why he won the Academy Award that year) and has become Stone's signature look.<p>And there is the cast: Kevin Costner does a fine job as the Gary Cooper-ish Jim Garrison who doggedly pursues his investigation. From here on in, there is a staggering who's who of big name and character actors filling in major and minor roles: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Vincent D'Onofrio, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, and the list goes on. Everybody does a great job and give the film an authenticity and believability.<p>This new, 2-DVD set is a HUGE improvement over the old, single flipper-disc. The entire movie (Stone's preferred cut) is now on one side and included is a fascinating audio commentary by Stone who manages to keep it going for the entire running time! His commentaries have always been a real treat to listen to and he does not disappoint on this one.<p>The highlight of disc two is a nice collection of deleted and extended scenes with commentary by Stone. It's pretty obvious why they were cut but nice that he included them.<p>This is a DVD that should be in every movie lover's collection. It's an important work and a cinematic landmark. It's influence can be felt in the TV show, 24 and the made-for-TV movie, The Pentagon Papers. I would also recommend picking up the annotated screenplay to the film which acts as the perfect companion to the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />VC-1 BD-50 / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 3:25:49<br />Movie size: 38,42 GB<br />Disc size: 46,01 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 18.85 Mbps<br />Subtitles: English SDH / French<br />Number of chapters: 88<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio English 1611 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 16-bit / 1611kbps (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio French 640 kbps 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br /># Audio Commentary by Director Oliver Stone<br /># Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy (90 minutes)<br /># 12 Deleted & Extended Scenes (55 minutes)<br /># Multimedia Essays<br />--Assassination Update - The New Documents (30 minutes)<br />--Meet Mr. X: The Personality & Thoughts of Fletcher Prouty (11 minutes)<br /># Theatrical Trailer (2 minutes - SD)<br /># DigiBook packaging</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>It would be real cozy if Oswald had just been a disturbed individual who didn't get enough love and attention as a child, as in the Peter Gabriel song Family Snapshot, but alas, that might be an over-simplification.<p>Whatever you think about the Conspiracy/No Conspiracy battle, anybody should be able to appreciate this stunning movie, as a movie, which features a performance by Kevin Costner that is basically as good as it gets.<p>I won't repeat the rightful praise heaped on the movie by other reviewers, except to say that every good thing you have heard about this masterpiece is true. <p>As for the Conspiracy itself, the movie contains a few elements that may have arguably been discredited but on the whole, it asks a lot of questions that have never been satisfactorily answered.

It's just that there is enough questionable data to make any reasonable person doubt the official explanations. <p>Gerald Posner's utterly laughable 'explanation' of the second shot as being a reflex action, in which JFK's head suddenly jerked backwards, is all you need to hear to know that the level of intelligence of the anti-Conspiracy side is enough to give Homer Simpson a superiority complex. <p>Olly Stone has got so much right here that the actual fine detail is almost irrelevant. He has gone a long way towards proving that a complex Conspiracy did in fact exist, and that's without including some of the most extreme (though not ridiculous) theories.<p>Just enjoy JFK as a piece of Art, because thanks to Stone, Costner and a stunning cast, that is what it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>&quot;JFK&quot; is one of those movies that I love, but somehow it irritates me.  When I say irritate, I mean that it doesn't give me a clear-cut answer to the big question that encompasses this three hour film,&quot;Who killed Kennedy?&quot;.  What you're given are ideas and theories to who did the deed, but never a clear-cut answer.  Even the ending doesn't appear to be that hopeful.  But in the analysis, that's what makes the movie appealing.  It gives you the ideas to work with, then leaves them for you to put together.  Movies like this are generally never taken very well by mainstream audiences, but (as in the case with this film) &quot;JFK&quot; managed to renew interest in the assassination and bring some interesting facts to light.  The commentary by director Oliver Stone on this Special Edition DVD is not just about the film, but about the conspiracy theories, his disgust at current events, and general facts about this period of time that has seem to affect a good deal of his movies.  Also included are some interesting outtakes/deleted scenes and some features on events involving key players and the assassination itself.  The movie itself is full of great performers such as Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, and many others.  It's a film that strikes a nerve and is truly one of the best movies the 1990's has ever produced.  Period.</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>There are other, more full-featured releases to choose from, but don't bother. After almost three and a half hours of viewing, the only thing you'll want is time to savor and digest. In any case, the subject disc includes a commentary track from Director Oliver Stone. (Excellent and engaging, by the way.) Please note that like so many studio re-releases, the original theatrical release is *not* included here. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNOX94">The Natural</a> was another offensive example of studio double-dippage.) The extra 17 minutes included in the JFK Director's Cut is mainly comprised of two scenes which in my opinion only slow the narrative. Your mileage may vary. The original film made such an impact (some of the scenes entered the public consciousness almost immediately: "Back and to the left") and was so meticulously assembled (JFK won the Oscar for Film Editing) that a Director's Cut is unnecessary. Unfortunately and as far as I know, the theatrical release was never available here in the USA in DVD format. The more expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000542DJ">2-disc set</a> includes several featurettes and is commensurately more expensive.<br /><br />The film speaks for itself, or at least it will, after you've watched it a few times. Well-paced John Williams score and an all-star cast, many actors willing to make small roles memorable. Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, Sissy Spacek, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Martin Sheen, John Candy, Brian Doyle-Murray, Michael Rooker, Jay O. Sanders, Vincent D'Onofrio.<br /><br />Those interested in political assassination thrillers should also see 1973's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226853">The Day of the Jackal</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>The beauty of Oliver Stone's "JFK" is that it has and will for a long time still, engender a mass of hate, love, incomprehension and good old America debate.<br />Just this last week, being the 40th Anniversary of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, there were two documentaries televised: one supported the claim of the lone gunman theory and the findings of the Warren Commission while the other supported the two+ gunman conspiracy theory with all the attendant evidence in support. Is there any wonder that we as a Nation have no idea what/who/why happened on November 22, 1963 in Dallas? Stone's "JFK" seems heavily dependent on the second 7 hour BBC produced documentary (ridiculous in that it is better researched that the Warren Commission!) for many of it's facts, though the BBC program looked at Jim Garrison's contribution to the investigation as a sidelight not the main event.<br />Be all of that as it may, this film is a lollapalooza: a fascinating, dramatic, though obviously slanted look at what was the most important and riveting event in American history until 9/11. And Stone does a tremendously effective job of marshalling all of the facts, fiction and theories into a dramatic whole. This is not a documentary, this is a film based on fact.  And since the only fact we all can all agree on is that someone shot JFK in Dallas on 11/22/63, it seems to me that everything else is open to speculation and interpretation.<br />Kevin Costner gives a bravura performance as Jim Garrison: a man so conflicted and so troubled by the assassination that he feels compelled to bring someone to trial for it. His summation scene, which goes on for nearly 45 minutes towards the end of "JFK" is so moving, so strongly felt, so incisively acted, so emotionally aware that we actually see Costner underneath the performance as Garrison: the third wall is removed and it is Costner not only speaking to us, he is speaking for us.<br />We will never know exactly what happened in Dallas on that Friday afternoon 40 years ago, but we do have this film and Costner's performance as a reminder of what can happen when someone of intelligence and foresight tackles a problem and proposes a hypothesis: right or wrong is not the issue, making the effort is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>I don't always like watching a movie that pretends to be about history and takes all kinds of liberties.  I'm sure Stone took many liberties in this film, creating kind of a conspiracy paranoia.  Acting was good, and the story was interesting...but IT'S JUST A MOVIE FOLKS!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Stop the tape a minute, tell Mr. Zapruder to put down his camera, get comfy beside me here on this nice grassy knoll, and ignore that guy with the umbrella---he's probably one of ours---and let's ask one of the great, burning questions of our age:<br /><br />Is Oliver Stone's "JFK" worth a watch?<br /><br />Absolutely!---but you don't need to convene the Warren Commission to tell you that. Oliver Stone serves up a typically kinetic, visually arresting, deliciously conspiratorial and roaringly over-the-top film in "JFK", in which you're best served to worry less about historical authenticity, and just sit back and enjoy the movie for the feat of cinematic virtuosity that it is.<br /><br />Right from the start, Stone leaps in with style, wit, a well-equipped army of solid ensemble actors, and a crack team of skilled editors helmed up by his faithful Director of Photography Robert Richardson (who has worked on all of Stone's projects, from "Wall Street" to "Natural Born Killers"); Stone digs in from the beginning and goes to work with the aplomb of a natural---and gifted---storyteller.<br /><br />Stone has a little help from his friends, to be sure: Jim Marrs, (who wrote "Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy") and the still-crusading Jim Garrison (the New Orleans DA who wrote "On the Trail of the Assassins" and even appears in the film as his old nemesis, former Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren!) worked with Stone on the screenplay.<br /><br />That "JFK" is a work of passion is quite evident, and redounds to the credit of its screenwriters. That it is a work of somewhat dubious historical authenticity is, alas, not so evident---and again, that is due to the cinematic wizardry Stone works in putting you on Dealey Plaza on that sultry Dallas afternoon 40 years ago. But like the best New Orleans gumbo, it's not what's in the stew that counts, it's how it tastes---and this gumbo tastes mighty fine!<br /><br />All of this style and substance is put at the service of a contention that seems an article of faith by Stone: that President Kennedy was cut down not by a raving Marxist madman with a grudge and a mail-order rifle, but by a shadowy cabal of politicians and industrialists entrenched in the very highest levels of American government.<br /><br />"JFK" puts you at the side of young New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison(played adroitly by Kevin Costner in one of his best performances), who, four years after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, begins to delive into a sordid underground of New Orleans tycoons and orgiasts, spies and con-men, Cuban exiles and CIA spooks, mercenaries and mobsters.<br /><br />His suspicion aroused, Garrison reorganizes his office into a single-minded legal SWAT team designed to investigate the shadowy New Orleans bon vivant "Clay Bertrand", who may have had a hand in a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy---and to not only question the findings of the Warren Report, but to launch an investigation into the complicity of the White House into the death of the former president.<br /><br />For all of its political immediacy and slick cinematographic techniques, "JFK" is more sweaty Southern potboiler than stern Yankee conspiracy theory, owing far more to sultry Faulknerian southern town mysteries and the forbidden, sweltering interludes of Tennessee Williams. Stone uses every resource at his disposal to ratchet up an atmosphere of oppression and menace: characters don't just talk, they sweat rivers, their eyes dart nervously about, they pace like caged tigers, the camera tracking their edgy, jerky movements.<br /><br />All of this is supported by impeccable acting: "JFK" is studded with top-drawer talent, most of whom engage in a feeding frenzy of scene-chewing. Costner is given a foil in Tommy Lee Jones at his most sardonic as the elegant and poised Clay Shaw, who exudes menace in even the most genteel purr. Kevin Bacon is creepy, sinister, and volatile as Garrison's useless 'witness' Willie O'Keefe, while Joe Pesci lets the hairpiece do the acting as the unstable David Ferrie. Jack Lemmon anticipates his "Glengarry" act as Jack Martin, condemned to be forever pistol-whipped by a hulking Ed Asner (who plays the bilious, mysterious Guy Bannister); John Candy literally sweats bullets, hides behind his Ray-Bans, and chomps a cigar. And what conspiracy theory movie is complete without an obligatory appearance by Donald Sutherland as the mysterious Agent X?<br /><br />All of this works some powerful ju-ju: the movie is spookier than a decrepit New Orleans antebellum plantation at midnight, and spicier than a pot of gumbo. The new Director's Cut restores 17 minutes of material left cut from the theatrical run, and the new bits both reinforce and detract from the power of the original. On the plus side, we get a little more of the tactics used by Garrison's shadowy enemies to knock him off the trail of the assassins, including one of his creepier close calls at the New Orleans airport. On the down side, the restored sequence featuring Garrison on a campy, kitschy talk-show hosted by John LaRoquette feels like nails on a chalkboard; it plays like parody, and does nothing but detract from the seriousness and pacing of the film.<br /><br />If "JFK" raises questions about one of the more dubious and traumatic periods of our collective American memory, that's well and good---though the viewer should beware: Stone plays fast and loose with the historical record. But in building up an account of the assassination, Stone has created a modern masterpiece, a film that transcends the limitations of its subject and produces a creepy-crawly classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>"JFK" is not really so much about President Kennedy as it is about New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison and his attempt to find the truth about JFK's assassination, and if there was a conspiracy, to bring the conspirators to justice. Though he didn't get a conviction, he at least went farther than any other law enforcement entities. He brought a murder and conspiracy charge against one of the alleged participants. According to this movie, the jury believed there was a conspiracy, but they didn't feel his case met the burden of proof as far as the individual charged was concerned. Subsequently, it was revealed that he worked for the CIA.<br /><br />"JFK" is Oliver Stone's favorite Oliver Stone film. He considers it his 'Godfather.' "JFK" is also Oliver Stone's most controversial film, with some who share his high opinion, and others who consider it blasphemy, tantamount to treason. Walter Cronkite, who was at one time the most trusted man in America, thought it was rubbish. The head of at least one media empire suppressed a 34 word capsule review that was too favorable. The writer complained about it and was fired. I think they were killing the messenger because they didn't like the message.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Jim Garrison: Thank you for your time, David. I'm sorry this has to end inconveniently for you but I am going to have to detain you for further questioning by the FBI.<br />David Ferrie: Why, what's wrong?<br />Jim Garrison: David, I find your story simply not believable.<br />David Ferrie: Really? What part?<br />==========================================<br /><br />Likewise, some may find Oliver Stone's story simply not believable, but it is a lot more believable than the conclusions of the Warren Report.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Jim Garrison: Once you conclude the magic bullet could not create all seven of those wounds, you'd have to conclude that there was a fourth shot and a second rifle. And if there was a second rifleman, then by definition, there had to be a conspiracy.<br />===========================<br /><br />The director of a film can manipulate the truth -- omit certain details, highlight others, cherry pick certain facts to support his thesis, or completely fabricate from beginning to end. Fiction, as a literary form has been called "lies that tell the truth" and when you are talking about film, you just might be more in the realm of lies that tell even bigger lies." But I think that JFK was researched and put together well, and it was much more than either mere entertainment or propaganda. It actually was very entertaining, but in a way that makes you think. Though the truth of what happened that day in November may be "a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma" -- obscured so much that we may never know the real truth, Oliver Stone has really done a masterful job. I think that just like Jim Garrison, Stone has shown that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, if he was in fact an assassin and not just a patsy. The sequence in the courtroom where Kevin Costner, as Jim Garrison, lays out his case that there was at least a second rifleman is a masterful sequence. Filmed in one long take, requiring prodigious memorization by Costner, it is the compelling highlight of  JFK. Once you get past the hurdle of the idea foisted on the American Public by the Warren Commission that JFK was killed by a lone assassin, then all kinds of questions open up. It really gets you thinking.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />X: Fundamentally, people are suckers for the truth. And the truth is on your side, Bubba.<br />===========================<br /><br />Most people who were alive when JFK was killed remember where they were that day. It seems that when JFK died, our innocence died also. Jello Biafra of the punk band, The Dead Kennedys says that the name of his group was thought up by some hippies, Grateful Dead Heads who threw it out as a possibility in a long list of possible names. He grasped the significance of that name, as it expressed the death of our innocence. Jerry Seinfeld, trying to deal with the fundamental contradiction -- the rift in our society, used humor. In a parody of "the single bullet theory" called, "the single lugie theory" a baseball player is spat on in an incident after a game. Wayne Knight, who played Newman, Jerry's nemesis, is in both the TV Show, and the film, "JFK." In both, he plays the same part in the courtroom reenactment. I don't know exactly what all this means, but I would submit for your approval that the JFK assassination is the tragic touchstone of our generation, and that Oliver Stone, in taking it as the subject of his film, was tackling the biggest issue of our time. It was bound to be controversial. Perhaps you will walk away from it still unconvinced. But even if it just gets you thinking, "JFK" has done its job.<br /><br />--------------<br />Guy Bannister: Camelot in smithereens.<br />=========================<br /><br />SELECTED FILMOGRAPHY OF JFK CAST MEMBERS<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0B0">Natural Born Killers</a> (1994) ....

Don't you get it?<br />==================================</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>I've rated Stone's 'JFK' 3 stars not because of quality or accuracy but because this movie had a major impact on me.  In my first watching of this film, I detected at least one major, and I think deliberate, factual error.  One of the characters is handing a Carcano rifle as another character says words to the effect, "The three shots took 7.8 seconds to fire.  Let's time it."  He then picks up a stopwatch and clicks, "Go."  The other character, works the action [once], he works the action again [twice], he works the action a third time [three].  "9.2 seconds," the one man emotes.  "Impossible."<br /><br />Well, from reading over reports of the shooting I knew that this scenario was an untruth.  The timing was from the moment of the sound of the first shot--a couple of seconds after the first levering.<br /><br />Fascinated by such an obvious error and, considering the fact that I am a pathologist and a shooter, I decided to redo the entire shooting scenario--personally--using the same type Carcano-Mannlicher rifle and the same type ammunition that the FBI claimed Oswald used.  I performed accuracy, rate of fire, bullet penetration, bullet deformation, head deflection and other studies.  By the time I was finished, I probably did as much ballistic work with the Kennedy shooting as anyone in the world, not excluding the FBI and CIA.<br /><br />If you're interested in the results of my ballistic studies, try my website at www.mexicanconquest.com.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, MD, author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/A1IKOYZVFHO1XP.html">A1IKOYZVFHO1XP</a><br/><p>Ladies and gentlemen,citizens,it is with humble respect that director Oliver Stone presents the investigation of the death of a great American,John Fitzgerald Kennedy,the 35th President of the United States. It was Stone's hope and intention,that this courtroom epic,which runs for approximately three and a half hours,will become a living memory and an inspiration to both current and future generations. Kevin Costner is Jim Garrison,a district attorney who represents Lee Harvey Oswald who was accused of Kennedy's November 22,1963 assassination in Dallas. Sissy Spacek is Jim's wife. This film also features special appearances by Kevin Bacon and the late John Candy. Unlike Kennedy,then-Texas governor(now deceased) John B. Connolly survived the shooting although he was wounded. I dedicate this film to the memory of Kennedy and the surviving members of his family. Stone should make epics about the lives and post-presidency deaths of Lyndon B. Johnson,Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. I'm sure Nixon and Reagan saw this film(they were both alive in 1991 when this film was theatrically released). I'm also sure that Gerald Ford,Jimmy Carter,Bill Clinton,George W. Bush and Bush's father saw this film also.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>JFK (1991, dir. Oliver Stone, 3 hours) may be simultaneously the weirdest and most compelling movie ever made. It shall be no surprise, then, that I consider it to be simultaneously the best and the worst of cinema.<br /><br />Based on the book by real-life former New Orleans DA and retired Judge Jim Garrison (played by an unusually animated Kevin Costner, and in Stone's unique way of working, the real Garrison plays Chief Justice Earl Warren), this migraine-inducing piecemeal clunker attempts to explain the conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I've been watching this film over and over since it hit theaters - but I think now's the time for a review ....<br /><br />This film tried so very hard to explain the real cause of that famous "magic bullet" that allegedly changed angles and ended up in pristine condition at the end. Something that many years ago was proved, in a documentary that was hosted either by Tom Brokaw or ... someone. It showed that the bullet wasn't magic: it was the seating arrangement in that weird car of Kennedy's.<br /><br />Stone went with the expos&eacute; of the century, he thought, by demonstrating that the government-as-faceless-monster was responsible for the order to kill President Kennedy. It speaks of Kennedy being an actual communist, of getting in bed with the Russians, everything you'd expect from a criminal trying to justify what he's done. The government is the criminal trying to justify Kennedy's assassination.<br /><br />The Warren Commission is taken to task here, with an endless stream of repulsive gay men (Joe Pesci, Tommy Lee Jones), prostitutes of every stripe (paramount among them is Kevin Bacon), Jack Ruby (Brian Doyle-Murray) and a sadly creepy Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. What a mess. I still can't explain to you who Jack Lemmon (as Jack Martin) and Ed Asner (as Guy Bannister) were supposed to be ... so let it be in the eyes of the beholder. In fact you'll see everyone here from Sissy Spacek to Walter Matthau to Donald Sutherland to John Candy, like some screwball 1960s comedy.<br /><br />I credit Stone for several things: I remember he fought like a soldier to insert the Zapruder film at the moment of the head-shot. Stone endured what no director has had to endure since D. W. Griffith with his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFRRMW">Birth Of A Nation</a>. Yet the film has captivating points, among them, Garrison is the only American who has ever brought suit in the assassination of the president.<br /><br />At three hours - and God knows which version you'll be seeing here, I make no promises - this can get under the skin. We know much more now than Stone did back then: a very recent documentary taught me how Oswald could have and did achieve the four shots in the way he did from the book repository. Stone's film should be taken in halves. It's more comfortable that way.<br /><br />Otherwise, I don't know what else I could comment to recommend this movie. It's a thriller, it is entertaining and some of it scared the hell out of me. But then it had few surprises, especially for conspiracy buffs and theorists. The acting (unusually sizzling), the art (they filmed in the actual book depository, right where Oswald stood), the 'taste' (in fact they shot on location whenever possible) are all exquisite; the direction is haphazard and goofy.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, it was Stone who wanted to generate some kind of weird national event with the very making of this highly political film. However, his film did result directly in the passing of a law about government disclosures.<br /><br />I strongly recommend you help yourself back down to earth with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VL7UWY">Peter Jennings Reporting - The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy</a> (a/k/a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001BFDKU">ABC News Presents The Kennedy Assassination - Beyond Conspiracy</a>) and "Unsolved History: JFK ~ Beyond the Magic Bullet" (unavailable now at Amazon, as are all the other "Unsolved History ~ JFK" documentaries). Sadly, Stone did not succeed in exposing/helping to remove rabid psychopaths like Garrison from public offices.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>i read book after book after book about jfks assassination when i was in high school.then i saw the movie as part of this ongoing teach all school kids to hate the white people program the schoolboards are hung up on now.its so bogged down woth detail and specific information,youd have to be an expert to follow the story.basicly,at the end,you dont know anything more than when you started.hes dead.he got shot  a long time ago.there was probably more than one guy involved but well never know.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>The hubbub around JFK's death in Dallas is just too extreme and bizarre.  There's not enough money to be gained to kill a POTUS so publicly.  The second shooter represents the second shooter working for the Hapsburgs and their Germanic warmongers who wanted to get rid of a useless monarch - their Archduke Ferdinand.  The convicted shooter was a young Yugoslav whose earlier attempt failed because he had a JAMMED gun so when the Archduke fell later, he was surprised albeit pleased.  There was a second shooter and somehow the Allies know a lot more about German crimes in waging constant world war (though officially designated WWI and WW2) than the public is allowed to know about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13.html">A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13</a><br/><p>I have JFK The 2 disc Set and I love it much,'tis one of my Favorite movies for all time :)</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>This is a cinematic masterpiece by Oliver Stone. I think that this film along with the Doors and Platoon rank among his best works. Stone certainly does capture the essence of the 1960s America. I bet that he could easily remake Easy Rider and it might top the original! Film is based on the late Jim Garrison's memoirs and Jim Marr's &quot;Crossfire&quot;. There is a cast of a thousands in this one(COSTNER, JONES, PESCI, SPACEK, LEMMON, MATTHAU, CANDY, BACON, SUTHERLAND) and includes excellent music by John Williams. JFK won a well deserved OSCAR for editing and it shows. There is a unique and quite riveting mix of actual footage with re-created footage of assassination in Dallas.  The collector's edition includes several plusses. The theatrical trailer is just as riveting as film itself. The B- disk includes several deleted scenes. I felt that Stone should have left in the scene involving the Colorado businessman offering Garrison a bribe if he would stop the investigation. There is a sequence involving man-X that was the original ending(Stone felt, initially, that the Man-X and Costner exchange needed an intermission in order for audiences to absorb all of that intense information connecting the military-Pentagon involvment) of the film, and there was a great deal of ending credits that were cut explaining how Garrison was indicted for bribery following the Shaw Trial, de Mohrenschildt's suicide, divorce of Jim and Liz Garrison in 1978, etc. There is a director commentary option as well that is interesting.  The collector's edition sound is good quality, but use of rear channels does seem limited. I have the VHS and there is more of a surround effect on it! Picture quality is excellent, and highlights the use of the light coloring at the beginning and color increases as we are taken to 3 years after assassination(notice how the color changes during the beginning of scene with Senator Long(Matthau) and Garrison), and Stone explains why this was done on the commentary disk. The b-Disk includes an interview with Col. Fletcher Prouty.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>The film:<br /><br />Plenty of ink has been spilled with regard to Oliver Stone's "JFK." I won't add much to a critical debate of it. I think it is enormously entertaining as a movie, is a valuable exercise in stirring up doubts and passions about a critical period in our history, and is a superb exercise in style - no other film better captures the "through the looking glass" feel that anyone who has researched this topic must feel. I watch this film every other year or so, and I never tire of revisiting the dense, compelling world Stone has created. This or that aspect of the film's thesis may be outdated or inaccurate, but that's not the point. The point is to stir up doubts, and plenty of the material Stone has presented in this drama still succeeds at that.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />The video transfer is a faithful and restrained HD version of this film. It preserves quite well all of the wildly different film stocks that Stone employs. Black and white material is quite detailed and has a lovely grain structure. Color footage varies in lighting and filters depending on the year portrayed and the mood. So some material is quite hazy, while other material is relatively sharp. All of it is a good upgrade over previous DVD editions. The audio is a good Dolby TrueHD 5.1ch mix that presents dialogue and John Williams' wonderful score very well.<br /><br />Extras are where I have some problems with this disc. Several features from previous DVD editions (and there have been MANY) did not make it into this one, and the ones we have are of a generally low quality. The best of the bunch is 1 hour of cut and extended scenes. They are presented in 480p SD, with the option of a Stone commentary. Many are just extensions of existing scenes, however. A 90-minute film called "Beyond JFK The Question of Conspiracy" is a making-of with critical review and interviews of experts. It admirably tries to present all sides, but the production values are terrible. A new 30-minute doc about declassified documents post 1992 is kind of meandering and tough to follow. Unfortunately it ends up sounding like a conspiracy nut (it is narrated by the editor of a conspiracy magazine) happily confirming his own previously held opinions. Finally, we have an 11-minute shot on video interview with Fletcher "Mr. X" Prouty. A/V quality is terrible and for the most part nothing terribly interesting is said. In the end, as far as extras go, there have been much better productions by various outlets (BBC, History Channel, CBS, PBS) that you would do much better to watch than these extras. The best extra on this disc is Stone's commentary.<br /><br />The packaging is a "digibook," a nice idea that doean't really deliver. We get some pap about the movie's critical reception, and some biography pages of the director and actors. Which is to say, nothing that isn't better done than it is on the Internet. We also do NOT get a list of materials on the Blu-Ray. Kind of irritating, if you ask me.<br /><br />***********<br /><br />This is a must-own for Oliver Stone fans. It's one of his best films, easily. It is taut (quite a thing to say about a 3.5 hour film), moving, thrilling, and provocative. It caused a huge stir upon its release and had a real effect on the government, inspiring Congress to act to release documents. It's definitely one of the most important films of the 1990s, and any cinema fan should own it.<br /><br />It's not a perfect edition. The Video is good but not great, owing to the stylistic choices of Stone himself. It's way better than the DVD, though, and may be the best it can look on Blu-Ray. What is not better than some previous DVDs are the extras in this edition. So buy this edition for the film itself, not for the supplements.<br /><br />One final note: there are two anniversaries coming up - 2011 marks the 20th anniversary of the film itself. 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination. Take it for what you will, but I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that there will be a new edition of this movie on Blu-Ray during one of those years. This edition will probably have an entire extra disc of extras filmed in HD and produced at a much higher level. The film itself may also look better, given inevitable advances in film transfer technology and the learning curve of a new format (think of how DVD looks now vs. in 1997...). So "caveat emptor" for the inevitable double dip (or is it sextuple dip at this point?).</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>They say that the third time's the charm and this certainly applies to the latest DVD version of Oliver Stone's film, JFK. Previous incarnations included a movie-only edition spread over two sides of a single disc and an extras-packed two DVD set, part of the Oliver Stone Collection that came out a few years ago. What's new on this one? Aside from all the extras from the last version, only a feature-length documentary and that's it.<p>All of the extras on the previous edition are included as is one new addition, a 90-minute documentary entitled, "Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy." It uses Stone's film as a jumping off point in which to revisit the events of and surrounding the assassination and examine the cult of conspiracy theorists. There is some fantastic on the set footage of Stone in action and interviews with most of the star-studded cast. Detractors of the film (Walter Cronkite and a film critic from The New York Times) and its supporters (Robert MacNeil from the MacNeil/Lehr Report) are interviewed, providing an excellent snapshot of the controversy that swirled around the film at the time. This is an excellent, in-depth documentary that even includes interviews with Marina Oswald and fascinating archival footage of the real Oswald, including his infamous death on live TV at the hands of Jack Ruby.<p>For casual fans of the film who already own the Oliver Stone Collection version, buying this new one probably isn't really worth it. For hardcore fans of JFK and Stone, the inclusion of this impressive documentary is worth the price of purchase. For completists, however, one glaring omission is AMC's excellent episode of Backstory that was done on the making of the film. Perhaps this will be included on yet another future edition of this film. That being said, this is a solid two DVD set for a landmark film. JFK is essential viewing for any fan of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>This film is one that requires the watcher to immerse oneself in another world. A world of cold war tensions, clandestine operations, high level plants and communist witch hunts. Historical facts not with standing, it is a very enjoyable film and is very well done. The pacing and character development is second to none. The movie is star studded and the talent of those present is easily recognizable.<br /> It does not have 21 cars exploding, bullet time kung fu or little kids out smarting adults, so I suspect the general public of subhuman idiots that is today's movie watcher may complain that it's boring.<br />I highly recommend it</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>If you jettison the politics of this movie (and Stone's reputation as a muckracker), and simply look at JFK as a film, it's arguably Oliver Stone's best film and it is absolutely rivetting.  It's a masterpiece of cinemtography, editing, writing, and performances.  I've only seen the initial 189 minute theatrical version, and that film is my favorite Oliver Stone film.  Stone's scope of this project is incredible.  He not only makes an epic about the JFK assassination, but he makes it so fascinating and enthralling that you marvel as his talents as a filmmaker.  The cinematography here is astounding.  Robert Richardson shoots in 35mm, 8mm, and 16mm, color, black and white, tinted color, tinted black and white, and it all blends seamlessly.  The editing on this monster is also a marvel (it deservedly won an Oscar for editing).  The film has a ton of cuts (something in films I don't like), but Stone and his editors do wonders with it.  The performances deserve special mention as well.  Costner is very effective as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor who believed in the conspiracy of JFK's assassination.  Costner does a New Orleans accent very well, much better than his rather pathetic "English" one for Robin Hood:  Prince of Thieves.  There are numerous cameos in the film, but they don't feel like cameos.  Stone manages to make each actor/character unique and interesting.  It never feels like star spotting.  Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, and Ed Asner (as a right wing demogagoue, which is funny considering Asner is a very left wing liberal) are standouts in a magnificent cast.<br /><br />When you watch this film, think of it as "Stone's interpretation of the JFK assassination".  There are numerous discrepancies here (such as Garrison meeting with Mr. X, played by Sutherland.  That never happened), but if you look at this film strictly as a film, it's remarkable and worthy of the accolades it has received over the years.  It's one of Oliver Stone's most memorable films, and a reminder of what a great director he can be when he's on.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>`Oliver Stone's best filmed historical novel sees Costner bringing the overly aggressive Jim Garrison into the Kennedy assassination plot as a major player, years after his sun had set  nationally. In a highly realistic tale, Garrison and wife Spacek weave an intriguing story of mafia-Cuban relations, which many today still believe to be true. Fortunately, the book "Best Evidence", followed by modern forensics seem to have cooled down the hysteria concerning gunman Oswald's need of an accomplice. Meanwhile, even the bit players including Sutherland talking in his eerie manner on a park bench, deliver top rate performances. One has to alert the public however that this film is historical fiction on the screen, not pure history. President Ford went to his grave believing that Oswald had acted alone in Dallas as a "nut",with absolutely no Cuban backing.It's a great movie, just be careful of your objectivity.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>i couldnt tell you how much i love this film,, i have been waiting on this 2 disc set for a while and i gotta say it was worth it the 2nd disc has a great doc. and extra scence, i can not write a review because this movie is too good for words</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone has not been precisely my favorite director, but it goes far beyond any other reason not to acknowledge the undeniable virtues of this superb movie. A treasured picture that will be increasing gradually through years, once the actual generations or the previous who lived and witnessed the sordid JFK `s assassination and all the set of dark events hidden backstage.<br /><br />Stone recreates through a superb edition work a true sinister puzzle of unknown mechanism, disproving the pretended and infantile argument that argues Lee Harvey Oswald was the only brain master and executor of  this horrid fact. Kevin Costner starring Jim Garrison will be the assigned spokesman to reveal step by step, the immense tangle and multiple circuital web of facts and characters evolved. The thesis of the self will bullet that described a curious path is a trick that hardly could be managed by the same Dave Copperfield.<br /><br />Intriguing, sensationalist if you want but extremely passionate, systematic and exhausting rebuilding of the events that make you reconsider -with Executive Action, a previous film of 1973 sincerely recommended- that not all what it glitters is gold.<br /><br />Towering performances by Pesci, Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones and the brief cameo by Sutherland.<br /><br />"Commit a crime; and the world is made of glass."

JG joined the National Guard in 1940, served five years in Army artillery, went to law school, joined the FBI, went home to New Orleans, and was elected District Attorney (3 terms) and then a judge. The controversy around this movie is due to Oliver Stone's dramatization of the facts. In one scene DA Garrison points out that LH Oswald's Camp St. address was across from the FBI, the CIA, and Naval Intelligence. At that point in time the offices of the FBI and CIA were a few blocks away. But the point is dramatically made: the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" was practically underfoot. Who was watching them?<p>I think it was a mistake to cast Ed Asner as the private detective who was former Naval Intelligence, former FBI. Efrem Zimbalist JR had a better resemblance. Walter Matthau played Senator Russell Long. The movie generally follows the book. DA Garrison hears of the connection to David Ferrie, and turns him over to the FBI; nothing happened. A few years later he talks to Senator Long and learns of his doubts on the Warren Report. JG then opens his own investigation into any crime committed in New Orleans. When his secret investigation is uncovered, the corporate media vilify his operation. There was NO cooperation from either J Edgar Hoover, President LBJ, or government agencies. The trial ended with a 'not guilty' verdict. The Congressional investigations in the 1970s revealed many more facts. Many books were written from this new information.<p>The "Mister X" brought in as a 'deus ex machina' is not in Garrison's book. He is based on L Fletcher Prouty, whose articles or books were available to Oliver Stone. LF Prouty joined the Army in 1941, and retired decades later. His experiences were in "Black Ops": executive action for the Government. Prouty was in the Philippines, Vietnam, etc. Prouty pointed out that it was SOP to have Army officers scout any location for a Presidential visit. It was not done in Dallas. The questions of "Mr X" remain: who benefited from JFK's assassination, and, who could cover it up.<p>So watch and enjoy this drama. You should read "On the Trail of the Assassins", or other books on the unsolved mystery of the Assassination of JFK. Is the conspiracy still trying to kill JFK's reputation? JFK was neither the first or last Ruler to enjoy female companionship as a perquisite of office, like stars in music or sports. Politicians are not moral role leaders, like ministers, priests, or rabbis. <p>An assassin who uses a pistol will be caught or killed. They are fanatics who sacrifice themselves for their cause. As assassin who uses a rifle will be able to get away to collect his pay; this implies a conspiracy. You can decide for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Oliver's Stone's "JFK" is one of those lightning-rod films.  Immediate controversy was stirred up by its questionable accuracy and its seemingly outrageous claims.  However, one must remember that this is a feature film from a Hollywood studio and not a documentary objectively examining its subject.  "Historical" films are notorious for "fudging" the truth in order to maximize its dramatic impact and "JFK" is no different.  The film does stack the deck by leading its viewers to draw only one possible conclusion - that the official inquiry into JFK's assassination was part of a conspiracy - but should the film be penalized for its one-sidedness?  The answer is no.  "JFK" is meant to be art and makes no claims to be 100% accurate or objective.  It is a fictional interpretation of a traumatic historical event with elements of the real-life event included in its narrative.  It is a story about the possible circumstances surrounding JFK's assassination and not a story of what actually happened.  On that level, the film is a masterpiece.  <p>"JFK" stars Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, a man obsessed with getting to the bottom of the Kennedy assassination.  Through his investigation, he becomes convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) did not act alone in killing Kennedy? The physical evidence cited in the Warren Commission report just does not support the claim of a lone gunman.  Something is amiss but what exactly?  Does businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) have the key to unlocking the entire investigation?  So many questions but unfortunately so little answers.  In the end, the holes in the story are never filled and the mystery of what really happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963 survives to haunt the nation for another day.  <p>Stone never does try to solve the "JFK" mystery once and for all.  He merely puts forth his own personal interpretation of events and the technique he employs in dispensing his evidence is a technical triumph of editing.  Documentary and newly-shot footage are weaved together with flashback sequences to create a mesmerizing chronicle of what Stone thinks happened.  Costner is dazzling in his portrayal of Garrison.  Those filmgoers jaded by Costner's lack of recent quality performance should revisit "JFK" to remind themselves of just how much talent Costner does possess.  The supporting cast is made up of an honor roll of screen legends past and present.  In addition to the aforementioned Oldman and Jones are Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, and Walter Matthau.  Under Stone's guidance, the contributions of all these performers along with those of editors Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia have gelled together to produce one of the finest films of the 1990's.  It must be remembered that "JFK" is a work of fiction and not fact and on that level it is a truly inspirational work from a talented filmmaker.</p></br></body></html>

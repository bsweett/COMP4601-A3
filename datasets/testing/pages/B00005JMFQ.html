But unlike most of the offerings for those occasions, Love Actually is both smart and funny. The reason it works so well is the writing and the acting. Richard Curtis is genuinely witty and knows what these actors are capable of. Although the movie is long at 135 minutes, I usually find myself wishing it lasted a little bit longer.<br /><br />Most romantic comedies tell the story of one couple or two at the outside. Love Actually contains too many relationships to count and it doesn't restrict itself to romantic love. You'll also find the love between friends and family members. Some new relationships are formed, while others weaken.<br /><br />There are so many good actors involved. Hugh Grant plays the Prime Minister and he's not in a relationship, but soon finds that he likes a member of his staff. Colin Firth plays a writer who sees his marriage threatened when his wife has an affair, but unexpectedly finds new love. Laura Linney's character has been in love with a work colleague for years, but has never acted on it. Her reasons eventually become clear and illustrate another kind of love.<br /><br />My favorite relationship is the one between Daniel (Neeson) and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster). Daniel's wife has recently died, leaving him to raise Sam. He worries that Sam spends too much time in his room, but eventually learns what the problem is. The relationship between the two is so warm and honest that it's almost impossible not to root for Sam as he attempts to resolve his problem. It leads to some of the funniest scenes in the movie.<br /><br />You'll also find plenty of other good performances from the likes of Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Martine McCutcheon.<br /><br />Not everything turns out perfectly for the couples involved. Some face threats to their happiness and not all of them can be completely resolved to their satisfaction. Love Actually examines love and the many forms it can come in. Some of the situations reach the expected conclusion and many are uplifting. A few are even surprising. I've just never seen a movie attempt to keep so many romantic threads alive throughout the running time. Against all odds, it somehow keeps us invested in the outcome of all the story threads by continually updating the progress of each.<br /><br />According to my friends, I watch so many sad or depressing movies, but here's one that will lift your spirits. The opening scenes show how people allow their real emotions to show when they meet their loved ones at airports. That's essentially what Love Actually is about. To enjoy it fully, you'll need to allow your own emotions to show.</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2009 'BLU RAY' REISSUE ***<br /><br />Like many people who have probably seen Richard Curtis' "Love Actually" one-to-many times, the idea of buying it yet again on another fangled format is enough to make you yawn and turn away.<br />But have you actually seen it on BLU RAY? Because if you haven't, you need to...<br /><br />Having reviewed so many 'oldies' transferred to Blu Ray and been elevated fifty-per-cent of the time/disappointed the other half - it's a real delight to report that here is a genuine upgrade from every previous version. Suddenly, the film feels all grown up - the print is incredibly clear - and it adds so much to your enjoyment of the movie. There isn't a part of this rather lovely little gem that 'doesn't' seem improved to me.<br /><br />The extras are the same as the 2003 DVD - Deleted Scenes and Music Of (with introductions from Richard Curtis), Kelly Clarkson and Billy Mack Videos (Billy Mack is Bill Nighy's character), a Feature Length Commentary with Director and Writer Richard Curtis and actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Thomas Sangster (Neeson's son in the movie). The picture quality for these clips is old actually and hardly high-def, but they are informative and hugely entertaining (especially when the galaxy of stars are talking - Liam Neeson and Laura Linney so enjoying themselves).<br /><br />Apart from being wonderful to look at, you also forget what a great film it is - a huge upbeat pick-me-up of a thing - and hopeful in a way that seems to elude Hollywood stories so much these days. And it's so funny too - Martin Freeman and Joanna Page lying naked on top of each other as the rehearse making out for a skin flick ("Judy this is a real pleasure. It's lovely to find someone I can actually chat to..."), Bill Nighy on the Ant & Dec show "...kids, here's an important message from your Uncle Bill. Don't buy drugs. Become a pop star and they give you them for free!" and the ever-hopeful Colin as he embarks for the States to meet girls who will all helplessly fall for his English accent - and they do (title above).<br /><br />So there you have it - great actors, clever intertwining stories, witty dialogue, genuinely funny and touching moments - even sadness and a bit of heartbreak - "Love Actually" is a bit of a British gem frankly. And on BLU RAY it's a winner. And cheap too.<br /><br />Recommended like a night in with a saucy minx in Number 10...<br /><br />BLU RAY Credits:<br />VIDEO: 1080p High-Definition Widescreen 2.35:1 aspect<br />AUDIO: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and French, Italian, German, Spanish and Latin American Spanish DTS-Surround 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English SDH, French, Canadian French, Italian, German, Spanish, Latin American Spanish and Dutch<br /><br />PS: for other superb BLU RAY reissues (including full restorations) - see also my reviews for:<br />"The Italian Job", "Saturday Night, Sunday Morning", "The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner", "North By Northwest", "Cool Hand Luke", "The Dambusters", "The Prisoner - The Complete (UK TV) Series In High Definition", "Braveheart", "Snatch", "The Ladykillers", "The African Queen", "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", "Back To The Future Trilogy", "Brief Encounter" and "Kelly's Heroes"</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>This film is so manipulative, guys and girls, but it's also so much fun. If you're in the mood for romantic comedies that don't shy away from rampant sentimentality and that go for those big finishes in which the romantic score soars on cue, then LOVE ACTUALLY is your huckleberry. I won't beat around the bush. I love this movie, love it for many reasons.<br /><br />First, it takes place during the holidays, a time when - according to these characters - one must tell the truth and one is allowed those extravagant gestures. Director Richard Curtis's inspiration for this film originated from when he languished at the L.A.X. airport for hours and - by dint of witnessing all the folks hugging and kissing - arrived at the mini-epiphany that "Hey, love really is all around." LOVE ACTUALLY, featuring a legitimately all-star cast, tracks its many characters thru the four weeks leading up to Christmas as they struggle and find and lose love. There are at least nine story threads - I just tried counting them off in my brain - and they occasionally interweave.<br /><br />All story arcs not being equal, Hugh Grant is featured in the flashiest one. He plays the new British Prime Minister who arrives at his bailiwick and is instantly smitten with the earthy food caterer (played by a delightful Martine McCutcheon). To give Hugh his props, hands down the best moment in the film is when his Prime Minister stands up to the semi-slimy U.S. president during a press conference. Two other prominent threads revolve around the unexpected romance between a reserved writer (Colin Firth) holidaying in France and his quiet Portuguese cleaning woman and Liam Neeson's grieving widower left to raise a young step-son who's fallen in love with a girl in his school.<br /><br />But love isn't all bright and heady, exciting and new. Sometimes, it's melancholy and dreadful and gut-wrenching. Emma Thompson is phenomenal in a supporting role, playing a wife of long standing who is suddenly ambushed by her husband's infidelity. Laura Linley sacrifices her chance at romance to be there for her needy institutionalized brother. Keira Knightley is the focus of unrequited love, and she and Andrew Lincoln provide my second favorite moment from this film. The sequence at the door step in which a luminous Keira is silently serenaded by Andrew Lincoln's cue cards is simultaneously heartbreaking and romantic as fucl&lt;.<br /><br />Rowan Atkinson has a nice cameo as a jewelry salesman, and it's probably best that Curtis refrained from portraying him as literally an angel (Curtis admits this in the audio commentary). Bill Nighy steals all the scenes as the aging and very blunt-talking rock star who gets one last shot at glory with his Christmas jingle. The sub-plot with that British bloke raring to go to America to find true love, I didn't think that was going anywhere. But damn if it didn't have a nice payoff. I think the only one left I haven't mentioned is the arc with the two actor stand-ins, and now I've mentioned it. That one also has its sweet moments, which is rather a coup, considering that a segment featuring a persistently naked couple engaged in simulating the deed could be construed as a bit sleazy.<br /><br />LOVE ACTUALLY is a sprawling narrative which covers a wide romantic spectrum. Don't be put off by the huge cast because you'll find yourself invested in quite a few of the characters. This is absolutely a chick flick, but, for the manly men, the funny does come in frequent like clock work. Hugh Grant is again very good, with his Prime Minister dance and that bit where he goes down the block, knocking at every door, looking for his food caterer. I do have one neggy, though. I think it's stretching it a bit that Colin Firth's writer and his Portuguese girl can be in such conversational synch while speaking two different languages and not comprehending each other. But perhaps the point is that love is universal and can hurdle silly obstacles such as language barriers and Colin Firth being very British and therefore a bloody cold fish. See what I did there? I reasoned it out and so saved the movie's internal logic. Huzzah!<br /><br />My favorite line here, by the way, is sub-titled: "Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003." Heh.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features: Audio Commentary with actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, and Thomas Sangster and director Richard Curtis (worth it alone for Hugh's good-natured but relentless ribbing of Colin Firth); 10 Deleted Scenes with intro by Richard Curtis (totaling 00:37:14 minutes); "The Music of LOVE ACTUALLY" - Richard Curtis introduces the songs used to score the film and then the DVD cuts to the actual scenes featuring these songs; and Kelly Clarkson's music video "The Trouble With Love Is."</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>The start and end of the film takes place at Heathrow, where a montage of people being greeted by their loved ones is lent poignancy by the opening narration of Hugh Grant stating that all the known messages left by the people who died on the 9/11 airplanes were messages of love and not hate, and the closing song of the Beach Boys' God Only Knows. Also effective is the use of cameos in the film, most notably as dream babes such as Claudia Schiffer, Denise Richards, and Shannon Elizabeth make brief appearances in the airport as love interests for some of the diverse characters, who we see now have known each other in casual ways, each with different takes on love.<br />  Is Love Actually a film that will challenge you the way 2001: A Space Odyssey does? No. But it is a film whose well-written and acted characters and charm will stick in your mind long after their counterparts from lesser, schmaltzier films in its genre have faded.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.<br /><br />I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job.<br /><br />"Love Actually" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Whether you're newly in love, an old married couple, hopelessly single or burned out and bitter, there is a storyline in this all-star ensemble piece that will make you laugh and cry.  Beautifully done film and superior soundtrack with a cheeky commentary track and poignant director's notes.<br /><br />Sure to please, bargain priced and also a great gift idea for anyone on your list!<br /><br />Only problem (and pet peeve) is the unescapable PREVIEW TRACK included...you can't even skip 'em, you have to fast forward through them.  Really obnoxious.  OK if it were a rental, but to stick these on to something you purchase is plain WRONG!</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>Love Actually is a feel good movie..in fact is a feel very good movie, one that is superbly written, but then it is not surprising coming from Richard Curtis, a man who has forever changed British Comedy back in 1979 with Not The Nine O'Clock News launching as a result the careers of Britain's most loved comedians, like Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith, and Griff Rhys Jones.<br />Curtis also co wrote with Ben Elton the classic Blackadder and showed an early talent and understanding of a highly sophisticated,satirical,intelligent as well as hilarious type of comedy. His venture into movie writing was as successful, and Four Weddings and A Funeral and Notting Hill are now considered as classics.<br />What is surprising though is Curtis's abilities as a director. He has managed to tell his own script with such ease, sympathy, and simplicity, and to direct more than twenty main characters, each to a varying degrees with a three dimensional and deep personalities.<br />Love Actually is actually a film that combines some very funny scenes with a lot of poignancy...It is all about love as we know or experience it.Love that crosses language barriers, love that means sacrifice, love that is dedication, love that can be an instant infatuation, love that means forgiveness, love that means fantasy, love that means to just be there, love as in hope, in short love as in life..There are ten stories of different kinds of love that occasionally cross paths, colorful canvases of different people, and different relationships, and different loves.<br />The casting could not have been better, from Liam Neeson, Laura Linney (one of the best American and most underrated actresses),Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman,Martine McCutcheon, Bill Nighy and two of Curtis's personal friends from the old days, Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant.There are also plenty of very well cast cameos, from Billy Bob Thorton as the American President, Rowan Atkinson as a salesman (although he is billed as one of the main stars, his role is actually very small),Sienna Guillory, Claudia Schiffer, to January Jones and Denise Richards.<br />The most hilarious dialogues and scenes come courtesy of Grant as the prime minister!! You should just hear what he says talking to the painting of Mrs Thatcher!! But every one contributes equally to make you laugh, smile, and reflect..<br />The film starts and ends at Heathrow, with the images of people greeting, hugging and kissing each other and a very touching narrative tells us about how the message of the plane passengers of the 9/11 tragedy in their final calls was about love and forgiveness and not hate and revenge. It is ultimately the message of Curtis himself, and throughout the film until  the end you realize just how significant and true this message is.<br />Love Actually is a MUST SEE movie that is totally endearing, one that will make you feel so good about love and life!<br />DO NOT MISS!</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>I saw this with my wife in the theaters, thinking it would be to "girly" for me, but it is actually quite funny. This follows about 7 storylines which are intertwined in one way or another through the christmas season.  The story lines are aged rocker past his prime, the single prime minister, the writer in a foriegn land, the troubled marriage, the widower and stepson, the single young man not living to his potential, and the newlywed best friend.  Well done, decent acting, and not a minute to long or to short (2 hours 15 minutes jam packed).  The bonus scenes on the DVD are nice, but needed to be cut.  Worth owning to watch over and over again.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>One word that comes to my mind upon describing Richard Curtis' movie is charming.  His works are always understated but seemed to evoke emotions that other Hollywood movies won't do.  As viewers might have guessed already, this movie is about love; love in all sorts of shapes and forms; love that transcends language, culture, & border; unspoken love, love that is to be confused with lust; puppy love; endearing love, the kind of love that would last a lifetime and beyond; love of the same sex. et cetera.  Richard Curtis attempted to cover as much love as possible in this movie but as he said in the additional features in DVD, the movie length came to a staggering 3 hours 20 minutes.  Naturally, some scenes needed to be edited to much his disappointment as some scenes were his personal favourites & which I personally think should be included in the original movie itself.  Anyway, this is a very subjective view.  There were talks about how the soundtrack came about in the movie and the complexity of matching them with the length of the scenes which almost never worked out as planned.  I needn't say more.  Should you enjoy his previous writings such as Notting Hill, Four Weddings & A Funeral, you would love this movie actually!  All actors and actresses in this movie are brilliant.  Highly recommended.  It encompasses what's truly essential and what's sorely lacking in this world today, LOVE in a very big way.  As John Lennon & Yoko Ono sang, all we need is love.  DVD is definitely a better way to go to appreciate this movie in its full glory.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The half dozen or so love stories that comprise "Love Actually" are neither highly dramatic nor emotionally earth-shattering in nature - and I suspect that this is exactly how writer/directer Richard Curtis intended it to be.  This epic paean to the glory of romance involves, for the most part, run-of-the-mill (albeit middle or upper middle class) Londoners just trying to find a little happiness for themselves in the arms of that one true love.<br /><br />Hugh Grant, as the newly elected Prime Minister of England, unskilled in the ways of romance, leads a large and gifted cast through this roundelay of love, actors of no less a stature than Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Billy Bob Thornton and Rowan Atkinson, just to name a few.  They all portray characters in various states of romantic upheaval.  Some are headed towards blissful, happily-ever-after endings, while others suffer the pangs of jealousy, infidelity and unrequited love.  The best thing about "Love Actually" is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and it isn't afraid to take its time introducing and developing its large roster of characters.  The film, as a whole, has the kind of unhurried, laidback charm that one expects from a movie with Grant in the lead.  The worst thing about the film is its over reliance on those fairy tale "only in the movies" moments that seem to be an integral part of virtually every romantic comedy that comes down the pike these days (there`s a scene set in Wisconsin that is so lacking in basic credibility that I was absolutely positive it would turn out to be a dream of one of the characters.  It didn`t).  The film culminates in a jaw-droppingly bad scene near the end in which a young boy crashes through airport security with full approval of his beaming stepfather so that the tyke can tell a little classmate of his who is boarding a plane that he loves her.  The sequence is a bit tough to take in this post-9/11 world, especially when the violins start swelling, cuing our tear ducts to well up in approval for this horrific stunt.  There's also a bit of gratuitous America-bashing in Thornton`s portrayal of the President of the United States, a  rather mean spirited diversion in a film whose tone is otherwise all sweetness-and-light.  It's perfectly fine for American films to portray the president as a venal, lecherous bully, but it takes a certain amount of gall for a British film to do so.<br /><br />"Love Actually" suffers the fate of many films that attempt to write large on too broad a canvas;  some of the characters and stories inevitably turn out to be more involving and compelling than others.  That is simply the nature of the beast.  I certainly wish that the troubled marriage of Rickman and Thompson could have been explored in more depth, since Thompson provides the few moments of genuine feeling and heartbreak in the movie.  And certainly one or two of the other lesser stories could have been dropped from the lineup with little or no harm done to the film overall.  Given that limitation, however, it must be stated that "Love Actually" succeeds more often than it fails.  This is partly because the cast is so appealing and partly because much of the writing is really very funny.  The choice of background music is occasionally obvious, though the songs frequently make wry and witty commentary on the action taking place on screen.<br /><br />"Love Actually" is definitely a long movie (135 minutes to be exact) and it does leave a few loose ends untied at the closing credits.  But that, perhaps, is as it should be.  Life, after all, leaves some loose ends untied as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I bought the DVD because I knew I'd love the film, and I do. First of all, every single notable British actor that you can think of is in this movie. The plot follows approximately ten different couples who are struggling through their respective relationships. Some of my favorite couples are Hugh Grant's character (the Prime Minister) and his outspoken assistant, Liam Neeson and his adorable son, and Colin Firth and his Portuguese maid. The best scenes in the film are between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, who portray a married couple going through a rough patch. This is an amazing movie that will have you in fits of laughter one minute and fighting back tears the next. The DVD is great because it contains over 20 minutes of deleted scenes, most of which are very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>This is the perfect Christmas gift to get any member of the group of free-loading moochers you call your friends.  It's the perfect excuse to have a movie night at THEIR house, and make them ante up some wine, cheese, grapes and lots of chocolate, then hunker down for an evening of cornball romantic comedy with a difference.<br /><br />Chances are, with Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman on show, you won't even notice that the storyline is hardly Pulitzer Prize material, but you do stand the chance of busting a seam when Hugh does his Footloose/Saturday Night Fever/Risky Business impression at Lot 10 Downing Street, and Bill Nighy makes like Robert Palmer for a video shoot of the worst ever chart topping Christmas song.  There's also the incomparable Rowan Atkinson, making like Mr.Bean at appropriately inopportune moments.<br /><br />In case you think it's all about the guys (it is - but one can't take sides) there's a brilliant performance by Emma Thompson, and also Laura Linney, who has the worst cell phone ring tone ever invented.  Keira Knightley is more "Bend It Like Beckham" than "Pirates of the Caribbean" in this one, feigning wide open surprise a little too often. She's cute though, even if I always get her mixed up with Natalie Portman, the Amidala girl.<br /><br />There are enough love stories and love disasters here to sink a luxury liner - and yes, there are "Titanic" references too.  Even though the couples are for the most part separate little stories, there's a connection running through the movie that really ties them all together.<br /><br />The music is great, the movie is funny, and your friends will have to entertain you at their expense - what more could you ask from a movie?  Did I mention it has Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman?<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 17, 2004</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>&quot;Love Actually&quot; is a delightful medley of seemingly unconnected love stories which come beautifully together in the end. This ensemble comedy features some of my favorite actors, and they all seem to be in top form in this feel good film which features &quot;love&quot; - romantic, platonic, unrequited, fulfilled, unspoken, impossible and even filial.<br /><br /> Colin Firth is fantastic and sexy as the cuckolded husband who runs off to France to escape his sorrows, and discovers a cure for a broken heart. Hugh Grant is a riot as England's bachelor Prime Minister whose mind wanders every time the teagirl enters his office. His middle-aged sister, played by Emma Thompson, is fearful her husband, (Alan Rickman), is having an affair with his vamp of a secretary. Laura Linney is a lovelorn employee of Rickman's, who just can't get it together to make a commitment. Liam Neeson is struggling to get a grip after the recent death of his wife and finds himself distracted by his delightful stepson's shenanigans. Bill Nighy is hilarious as an over-the-hill rock star who is re-releasing a song for the Christmas season and hopes it will hit Number One on the charts.<br /><br /> Director Richard Curtis, (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary), is an expert at putting together this kind of movie and he is certainly at his best with &quot;Love Actually.&quot; I held off seeing this film while it was in the theaters, and even after it hit Blockbuster. I was fearful I would expire from an overdose of fluff and saccharine. I finally broke down...and, what a surprise! I really liked it - a lot!!<br /><br /> This film is set at Christmas time but it brings great cheer no matter what the season.<br /><br /> JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Richard Curtis ("4 Weddings and a Funeral," "Bridget Jones' Diary," "Notting Hill") may be the reigning champ of the British romantic comedy.  In "Love Actually," he lets his writing and directing talents run wild as he gives us seemingly dozens of interlapping tales of romance -- mainly comic, some farcical, others poignant -- all based in London in the five weeks before Christmas.<br /><br />Where does one start with a movie that stars (and gives quality time to) such luminaries as Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, and has inspired cameos by Billy Bob Thornton as the U.S. President, and numerous American beauties such as Shannen Elizabeth and Denise Ricahrds?  I'd probably start with the guy who nearly steals the show, Bill Nighy.  In the movie's most original subplot, Nighy plays Billy Mack, an aging pop star reduced to rewriting one of his hits ("Love is All Around," from the "4 Weddings" soundtrack, naturally) in a shameless bit of exploitation as "Christmas is All Around."  Mack knows he's doing this just for a buck, and he tells everyone (including the listening public, to the horror of his long-suffering manager) what horrible dreck the song is.  But it's his chance to become popular again, and that's what a pop star needs.  Nighy personifies the aging rocker to the hilt in a movie-defining performance.<br /><br />The Billy Mack sub-plot kind of stands to one side in this movie, as its only connection to the rest of the stories comes through the other characters listening to Mack's "hit" on the radio or watching the video, a horribly sexist monstrosity directly descended from Robert Plant's "Addicted to Love" video.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is more or less inter-related, whether by employment, marriage, or birth.  Take your pick for charming subplots.  Colin Firth discovers his wife's affair with his own brother, and he falls for his Portuguese housekeeper -- leading to a romance that overcomes a hilarious language barrier.  Liam Neeson's wife has just died, and his adorable 11-year old stepson is tormented both by the loss of his mother and the fact that he is in love with the most popular girl in school.  The solution - become a talented musician, and the girls will fall for you (just like Billy Mack!).  Or there's Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister, who becomes a national hero after publicly chastising the U.S. President (Thornton, so very creepy) for lording its superpower status over its friends.  Sure, he's a national hero, but he's also got a crush on his catering manager, and he's not sure if he can ask her for a date.<br /><br />And so on, and so forth.  One could go on describing sub-plots (and there are many other worthy stories here), but it would take longer than it does to watch the movie.<br /><br />Curtis' greatest achievement is the magnificent interweaving of these various tales.  Each has a slightly different emotional heft to it -- there's the melancholy tale of Alan Rickman's tepid experimentation with an affair at the expense of his wife, Emma Thompson, but there's also the absurdist adventure of Connor, self-proclaimed "sex god on the wrong continent," who goes to America to meet girls, and in Milwaukie, Wisconsin, he hits the mother lode.  But the stories flow together naturally, and that's no small trick.<br /><br />This is an ultimately silly-yet-heartfelt movie that contains a several laughs and outright guffaws, and you will also probably find yourself tearing up during a few scenes, as well.  But be warned -- this is definitely an R-rated movie, both on the language front as well as with the "skin."  Some movies are rated 'R', and you're not really sure why - but this one's clear.  I'm not criticizing, but you may want to think twice before watching this movie with prudish friends and family.<br /><br />Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There is a lot going on in `Love Actually'; a whole lot.  That is a good thing, for that means that there is more to love, and love I do, for `Love Actually' is kind of like the ultimate romantic comedy.  The film revolves around eight couples (not always in the most conventional sense) as they strive for love during the holiday season.<br /><br />To get into every aspect of this film individually would take too much time and space, plus it would take away from the whole surprise and joyous mystery of the film, but I will touch try and outline the plot a little.<br /><br />At the center of the film there is the young prime minister who has become smitten with his caterer.  His sister is having trouble in her marriage, for her husband has fallen prey to the young office temptress.  Her best friend Daniel is dealing with the death of his wife and raising her son (his stepson) Sam, not to mention finding some solace.  Then there is Jamie, who is going through a rough patch in his love life when he catches his girlfriend in the arms of another man.  Young lovers Juliet and Peter are trying to get their marriage off to a good start, and Sarah is trying to find love while juggling other responsibilities.  Add to this a washed up rockstar on the verge of a comeback and workmates (working in very compromising positions) and a young Brit who dreams of American girls and you have, in a nutshell, `Love Actually'.<br /><br />You'd think that this may be a little much, but it works, really, really well.  Each couple actually finds some sort of closure to their story, even if it's not the typical happy ending we are hoping for (I'm looking at you Sarah).<br /><br />What makes this film work so beautifully is above all else the script, penned by first time director Richard Curtis (who made a name for himself writing `Four Wedding's and a Funeral').  He wonderfully shifts the focus of the film from character to character without ever losing the audience or taking away from his characters.  Each group or couple or individual is given their opportunity to shine and engage us.  Sure, some couples are given more scenery to chew, but the audience will never feel jilted in any way.<br /><br />And then there are the brilliant comedic (and dramatic) performances by the entire cast.  Truly everyone is outstanding and to single anyone out in particular seems almost cruel, but there is no denying that Bill Nighy steals the show as Billy Mack, the washed up rocker who is battling the popular boy band for billboard sales.  His comedic timing is brilliant.  Other actors who shine are Colin Firth and Liam Neeson and Laura Linney who all capture the loneliness that comes from abandonment and or responsibility and they do so magically (especially Neeson and Linney).  Emma Thompson is marvelous as Karen, wife to Rickman's Harry; the husband with a wondering eye.  Hugh Grant is always superb, and Martine McCutcheon matches his humor beautifully.  I know I'm missing some, but I would be just foolish to miss Thomas Sangster who turns out a beautifully well rounded and sincere child performance that captures his youth and not a Hollywood fabrication of childlike maturity.<br /><br />As the films final frame comes into view the audience feels fulfilled, albeit a little stuffed, but it's a good kind of stuffed; like the feeling you get after holiday dinner.  There's a smile on your face, a little food on your chin and this overwhelmingly warm feeling in the pit of your stomach that lets you know everything is alright.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I liked this film a lot. Richard Curtis has put together a fine film, showing the foibles of human nature, and the characters' reactions. I laughed often, reflected softly, and ultimately thought it is a treasure among those films that talk about "love". The stellar cast handles the material well, especially Bill Nighy, the over-the-hill rock singer. Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth are all excellent.  It's very episodic, and the episodes with Mr. Firth are especially sweet. "Love Actually" won many awards, worldwide, but was ignored by the Academy. I laughed often, reflected quite a bit, and was allowed to put myself in touch with these wonderful characters. ALL love, or infatuation, is an enigma, and the "porn" couple really put it in perspective. I loved those two. Also, Neeson's son (I don't know his name) is one of the best kid-actors I've seen in a long time. It's a good ride, and loads of fun. Check it out!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>I was a bit apprehensive about watching a movie with a series of disjoined storylines, but Love Actually revealed itself to be a masterful film with storylines that interconnected on literal and metaphorical levels.  A viewer can't help but be sucked into these storylines, brilliant acted by the cast of Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Kiera Knightley, Rowan Atkinson in a delicious cameo, and others.<br /><br />The soundtrack beautifully integrated the different scenes of this movie.  An external sound-over (background music) from one scene would transition into sound-in (music playing in the scene) in the next segment.<br /><br />This movie explores all different types of love--fragile relationships, people that magically fell together, relationships being constructed piece by piece, unrequited love, glorious crushes, the pursuit of physical satisfaction, and more.  This is a testament to all the different forms of love, from the joyous to the mundane to the painful.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>There is very little really not to like about this charming collage of a movie. <p>Brilliant ensemble of actors, and thus by implication great cameos from the ilk of Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Emma Thomson; credible romantic vignettes intercut together, and thankfully not too saccharine to be implausible (not everyone ends up in their preferred romance for instance); a fair bit of nudity (a big bold "R Actually"); and above all, some delectable humor -- there are sentimentalistic crests but swiftly followed by a jibe or crack that balances the narrative. <p>The vignettes: <p>-- Hugh Grant as a wonderfully self-deprecating bachelor prime minister in love with a benign Brit version of M.

Set in London, the film has all the appearances of one of those holiday movies we see several times a year (New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day) and in fact is.  The difference is that this one is well done.  The music alone (no not Christmas carols) is worth the price of admission (or purchase or rental).  Several stories evolve at the same time.  The characters are loosely connected in some way, although it isn't all that evident for a while.  In fact if there is a dig at the film it may be that there are too many story lines.<br /><br />Director and writer Richard Curtis assembles a cast that Robert Altman would have been proud of.  Liam Neeson is a recent widower raising his step-son.  Hugh Grant is the recently elected British Prime Minister, single but looking.  Keira Knightley is a new bride who may have married the wrong man.  Andrew Lincoln (TV's "Walking Dead") may be the right man.  Bill Nighy is hilarious as an aging rock star trying again with a Christmas twist on an old song.  Laura Linney is a spinster-like office employee longing over a co-worker but obligated to care for an institutionalized brother.  Emma Thompson is the wife of an executive (Alan Rickman) who may be cheating on her.  Kris Marshall is the hound dog Brit who can't get a date so decides to go to Wisconsin (!) where he's sure he can find plenty of women who will love his accent.  He does!  They are Shannon Elizabeth, January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert, Denise Richards and Ivana Milicevic.  There is the couple whose job is too "stand in" for actors in a porn film and eventually fall in love.  Finally, there is Colin Firth, a writer who falls for his housekeeper (Lucia Moniz) who doesn't speak English.<br /><br />I know this all sounds so convoluted, but it works.  The writing is crisp and funny.  The film is sweet and moving at times.  There is humor, heartbreak and romance.  I'm also glad to see that the filmmakers and studio kept the "R" rating rather than excise some of the more titillating scenes and change the language.  Well done.  Merry Christmas!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>There's plenty to love about LOVE ACTUALLY. It's just that I found a couple of the stories downright perverse. It may be convenient for the film not to show us where Keira Knightley's new romance will lead but nothing changes the fact that is not a love story but one of betrayal in which not much good will come out at the end; at least the Alan Rickman / Emma Thompson part is honest about its subject and what the consequences to his actions will eventually be for both of them. Further, what can you say about a story in which a girl is unfaithful to his boyfriend with his own brother ? The funny thing is that the filmakers want to make us believe these are just different facets of love and for some reason, they time them at Christmas time, as if they would actually have anything to do with the real meaning of Christmas.<br />Still, any movie in which Hugh Grant makes a convincing British Prime Minister can't be all bad. The truer love story in LOVE ACTUALLY ?: Laura Linney giving up on her dream for the sake of her brother, that part might just be enough to justify the title.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>An interplay on the connections between eight different couples in the weeks leading up to Christmas. What a comedy of errors in London. The new Prime Minister has a new admirer on the No. 10 Downing Street staff who makes him jealous when the American President hits on her. A luckless errand boy flies to Wisconsin to catch American girls with his accent. Two body double actors meet on the set of a film. One lonely writer runs off to Portugal to get over a break up only to fall for his young house manager. An American advertising executive in love with a colleague. Her boss and his attempts to keep an attractive secretary at bay. A man secretly in love with  his best friend's new wife. A school kid learning the drums to impress a girl before she moves back to New York. It's a British comedy on the craziness of affairs of the heart.

It was funny, romantic, touching, etc., with some really memorable scenes (proposal in the Portuguese restaurant and scene in the airport involving young boy and his first love).<br /><br />The nudity and curse words (including cussing by a young child) was just completely unnecessary.  I'm not usually a Hugh Grant fan, but I must say he did an excellent job as the smitten British Prime Minister.  There are too many star actors and actresses to name, but all made this film exceptional.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>I love this movie as much as Notting Hill and 4 Weddings and a Funeral. The different storylines keep you laughing and crying. Collin who goes to Wisconsin is absolutely hilarious and you cheer for what he encounters, though unrealistic! Sam, the son of Daniel (Liam Neeson) is fantastic, as is Emma Thompson. You feel her heartache. My favorite is probably Hugh Grant and his Natalie. What a gag she is with a 1000 watt smile. the 'porn' is done in total jest, and anyone who is offended needs to lighten up. It's much ado about nothing. Perfect to see with your honey. My guy even liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R90OGE1EACZE.html">A3R90OGE1EACZE</a><br/><p>This movie is not just one movie it is many movies rolled into one.  There are many characters that interact that it can be confusing.<br /><br />There is Prime Minister David played by Hugh Grant who is in love with one of his attendants named Natalie.<br /><br />There is David's sister Karen played by Emma Thomson who is married with two children and finds out that her husband wants to have an affair with his secretary.<br /><br />There is also Daniel played by Liam Neeson who is a new widower who has the responsibility of raising his step-son Sam played by Hugh Grants real life cousin. Daniel's step-son is having problems though. He is in love with a girl at school who he thinks does not even know he is alive. He and Daniel come up with a plan that gets her to notice him at the end though.<br /><br />There is also Jamie, played by Colin Firth whose wife cheated on him so he goes to France to write a book. He falls in love with a maid at his cottage that is Portuguese and goes back to London to learn Portuguese so he can ask her to marry him.<br /><br />There is also Colin who strikes out a lot in London and thinks that he needs to go to the U.S. to get laid. His friend tries to dissuade him from going, but Colin eventually goes to Wisconsin where he meets several woman.<br /><br />Colin's friend is a producer who is making a porno movie and the two stand ins for the main characters fall in love while doing the things needed for the movie.<br /><br />There is also Juliet played by Kiera Knightly who finds out that her husband's best friend has a crush on her.<br /><br />There is also a character named Bill. He is a former singer who wants to have a comeback so he performs a Christmas version of Love is all Around that sucks, but makes it to number one.<br /><br />And last, but not least there is Sarah played by Laura Linney. She works in the office of Karen's husband who is in love with a man named Karl who works with her. On the night of the office Christmas party they get together, but there is one complication- her brother. He is mentally ill and calls all the time, he even calls her right before Sarah and Karl get together which stops them in their tracks.<br /><br />All in all a very funny, poignant look at several lives at Christmas</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>Director Richard Curtis has a charming vision of love surrounding us and affecting everyone's lives in a multitude of ways.  He also has a terrific all-star cast.  What he does not have is a script worthy of either the vision or the cast.  While the film is enjoyable in a breezy way, several of the many story lines are superfluous or gratuitous, and often situations and lines are much too predictable.  Hugh Grant is, of course, charming in his blinky way, and Emma Thompson is terrific, but the most consistently good scenes go to Bill Nighy, who shines as a comeback rocker, charming Brits with his profane comeback attempt.  Grant, Thompson and Nighy rise above a trite script, but others don't fare so well.  This is not an evil film.  I don't resent the time I spent watching it.  But it is a shame to have such a nice idea and such a talented cast wasted over this cliched script.<p>The dvd extra features are good, and include a commentary track with director Curtis and stars Nighy, Grant and Sangster; 37 minutes of deleted scenes; 8 minutes of music; and a Kelly Clarkson video,  The film can be heard or subtitled in English, French or Spanish.<p>Chances are, if you like these stars or this premise, you will enjoy the film, but it's not as good as one would hope.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>I didn't get to see this movie at Christmas which may have made the viewing that bit more special, but I was not disappointed at waiting. A veritable &quot;who's who&quot; of well known stars grace a collection of short stories, in funny, romantic, sad, and heartwarming scenarios, and the end result, though a bit muddled is cleverly handled. A real testament to the success of this movie after it's release was how well it was received here in the States, for being a fairly formula laden Richard Curtis written &amp; directed production. Some of the stories do stretch the boundaries of credulity a little, but the flavor of the Christmas magic allows even the most cynical viewers to be forgiving. The performances are ALL great, as seemingly the entire range of human emotions are played out before you in each individual tale, culminating in a clever, and touching set of finales. Some of the language will make this unsuitable for younger viewers, but good family viewing overall. Often very touching but never sickly sweet, this is a great DVD buy, and will be surely pulled out every holiday season, along with the host of other well known seasonal regulars. Enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Writer-director Richard Curtis intends his Christmas-themed, indulgently operatic "Love Actually" to be an Altmanesque tour of comic romance dashed with London wit. It is and it isn't: While a handful of the dozen or so couplings produce funny, poignant scenes, others border on insult, and never does the ensemble piece come together in its entirety. British humor is more literate, but, in many cases, no less shameless. <p>The movie is so protracted and bracketed into segments you can divide it into categories: <p>Terribly good: Hugh Grant, as usual, as the British Prime Minister sweet on his buxom, foul-mouthed catering manager (Martine McCutcheon). While their attraction is quite like a president/intern tryst with which we're all so familiar, Grant is such a daft fool we don't mind. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman accurately portray a married couple rocked by infidelity. Though others may groan at it, I liked a bit story about a good guy who loves his best friend's new wife (Keira Knightley). Ditto for the aging rocker (Bill Nighy) who recaptures the pop charts with an ugly "Christmas" remake of an old tune. <p>A Bit Sordid: The story of a luckless-in-love American woman (Laura Linney) saddled with a mentally ill brother - who, uh, also happens to be in London - is better suited to its own story. Liam Neeson is good as a widow whose young stepson has fallen in love, but Curtis takes the sugar too far. <p>Bloody awful: A ludicrous cross-cultural romance between a crime writer (Colin Firth) and his Portugeuse maid, and an awkward, stupid meet cute of body doubles on a film set. Both, however, are trumped by British geek's quest to bed sex crazed American women. <p>"Love Actually" is loaded with odd quirks. Black actors are cast throughout the movie as sidekicks in an obsequious, almost proplike manner, and Curtis digs on fat people with no particular point in mind. A subplot involving Grant's PM and a creepy American president (Billy Bob Thornton, entirely unconvincing) is heavyhanded. And one of the body doubles is a disturbing lookalike of Mia Farrow in "Rosemary's Baby." <p>Curtis, who wrote "Notting Hill" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral", is talented, but his arrogance peeks through, and his directing doesn't play away from it. In certain moments, the movie projects something resmebling disgust. <p>And yet the other moments, the good zingers, are worth a single viewing. Grant caroling. Thompson, putting together her husband's imperfections to a Joni Mitchell song. Rowan Atkinson in a snappy little cameo as a fastidious department store clerk. A scene where Knightley's character "gets it." Now that Curtis has the bravado out of his system, his sophomore directing effort should be more focused on those kinds of moments, and less fixated on delivering the world a giant love letter.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>This is a different sort of Romantic comedy that tends to take one by surprise.  Featuring the talent of Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightly, it is also more star-studded than most RC movies I have seen.<br /><br />The film is like a collage of stories of several couples.  The way the plot progresses reminded me a little bit of the drama PLAYING BY HEART.  We are able to view myriad short-stories that are all interwined (in one way other) to form a cohesive whole.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of flicks in the RC genre, this one is not afraid to engage in political satire.  Set in Britain, the writers taken some not-so-subtle "shots" at both the Clinton and Bush(jr) administrations.  Fans of either Clinton or Bush are likely to be miffed, while detractors of both are sure to be gleeful.<br /><br />If you want to different kind of heartwarming drama / comedy, you might actually find some love here.  It's worth taking the chance, anyway!</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Generally I really like the film scripts that Richard Curtis has written.  This one is no exception, but in this film, his directorial debut (I think), he ups the "sappy" quotient a few notches too high.<br /><br />A few examples:  the musicians rising up from the pews after the wedding ceremony to add musical accompaniment to the Beatles song, Liam Neeson's kid learning the drums practically overnight to win the affections of the most popular girl in school (whose singing in the film looks more like another pop-music video than anything else), and several other hokey sentimental moments that add too much saccharine to the proceedings.  On paper those moments are okay, but the way they are shot cinematically cheapens the film.<br /><br />Good moments abound too, however:  Emma Thompson's Christmas Eve realization that her husband Alan Rickman is unfaithful leads to an acting moment that ranks with Thompson's best work, and the sweetly romantic scene where Colin Firth clumsily proposes in another language to Lucia Moniz.<br /><br />There are too many good things about this movie to write it off as a sappy piece of fluff, but there are too many sappy moments in this film that compromise the "structural integrity" of the script.<br /><br />DVD bonus features are what we've come to expect nowadays:  Commentary and another little feature or two.<br /><br />Worth watching?  Oh yes.  Worth buying to watch over and over?  Depends if you're diabetic and have a tolerance for sugary sappiness.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>&quot;Love,Actually&quot; is a feel-good Christmastime collection of love stories  from writer/director Richard Curtis that aim to say, in spite of strife and bad goings-on in the world, &quot;love  actually is all around&quot;. In London, beginning five weeks before Christmas, ten different but loosely connected love stories unfold.  As the Holiday season builds toward its climax, so do the relationships. The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls head over heels for a member of his staff (Martine McCutcheon) on his first day on the job. A novelist (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid (Lucia Moniz) find love in spite of -or perhaps because of- the language barrier. Newlyweds and long-married couples alike discover chinks in their relationships and new possibilities. Young and old discover loss and new love. And throughout the film, the wonderful Bill Nighy plays a curmudgeonly aging pop star who uses every opportunity his new hit single provides him to inject a little sardonic  humor into the holiday cheer.<p>Truthfully,at two hours and fifteen minutes, &quot;Love, Actually&quot; is too long for a romantic comedy. And it's slow in places. And it improves upon viewing during the Holiday season. But it's a charming film with a very appealing -and very large- cast. Sometimes it's a little too cute, but Bill Nighy's Billy Mack character is likely to amuse even resolutely cynical members of the audience. So there's something for everyone. And the love stories are more light-hearted than sappy. &quot;Love, Actually&quot; is fun, light entertainment.<p>The DVD: Bonus features include an audio commentary, deleted scenes, a documentary on the film's music, a music video for &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot; by Kelly Clarkson, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). The audio commentary features writer/director Richard Curtis and actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Thomas Sangster, and a couple of others whom I couldn't identify. Three of the actors are seeing the film for the first time, so their commentary is very conversational. Director Richard Curtis does mos t of the talking, however, and provides a lot of information. There are 37 minutes of deleted scenes, all of which are introduced by the director. Curtis' introductions and explanations are good, but, unfortunately, the scenes must be viewed one after the other. There is no way to choose what scenes to watch. In &quot;The Music  of Love Actually&quot;, director Richard Curtis talks about the five songs featured in the film and their influence on the script as he was writing it. Captioning is available in English. Subtitles and dubbing are available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>I watched `Love Actually' with an eclectic group of friends last Friday night. And even though we all thought that the movie (which traces the seemingly separate love stories of several couples - and some love triangles) didn't quite gel together we all agreed that it was a true "feel good" picture and overall an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.<br /><br />With a simply incredible cast that toplines a number of the major British actors (Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley) the movie does occasionally seem unwieldy and top heavy. But the most common effect throughout the group of us who sat through it last week was smiles as the simple charm of the picture wins you over.<br /><br />This is a hard picture to give a brief synopsis of the plot for. There is so much going on and a lot of which appears unrelated that all one can say is the film tries to convince us that love is everywhere. We have a newly elected single British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant). An author taking a working holiday in France (Colin Firth). A young bride (Keira Knightley) whose best man comes to realize he also loves (who can blame him) and a young boy who loves an American girl who is returning to the USA and a number of other stories. Stories that all come to a satisfying conclusion by the time the end credits roll.<br /><br />Another notable highlight of the movie is the soundtrack and as our group tried to figure out what the connection was between all people in this movie we all decided that regardless of how well it turned out - the soundtrack was a winner. With its selection of favorites one of the group exclaimed `I think this movie has all my favorite in it.'<br /><br />So, if you feel like getting into one of the best `feel good' movies of the past year (or any year) or simply want to watch an all-star cast at the top of their game then `Love Actually' needs to be on your list. It's a good reminder that entertainment comes in many different forms  - just like love.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>This movie is a bit longish and could have done without several scenes, but nonetheless is still a fun and sweet film that deserves to be checked out at least once. It's a refreshing romantic comedy-- one that ties together several different love stories that can all be traced back to the Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant.<p>Some of the love stories include a young boy who is in love with the most popular girl in school, a man in love with his best friend's wife (or the best friend as implied in the beginning), the Prime Minister falling for his secretary, and a writer who falls for his cleaning lady. Some of the love stories (though none of what I mentioned) could have been left out. Some were just a bit much, like the story about the couple who met doing body double work on a film. The scenes are just awkward, and not just because their nude the whole time. Otherwise, the stories create a nice woven effect throughout the film and are incredibly enjoyable and laugh out loud funny.<p>It's well-written and the cast is absolutely amazing. We are charmed with the presence of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, and many more. It's a film that will definitely make you smile and realize that &quot;love actually is all around us.&quot; Highly recommended!!</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I missed this movie at the theater and have been waiting for its dvd release with considerable anticipation.  I'm happy to say that the wait was worth it.  This film has a great cast of actors including Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Lian Neeson, Laura Linney and Hugh Grant---whose characters are all dealing with different levels of love and relationships.  There is Emma's character dealing with her husband being unfaitful;  Liam's character dealing with the death of his wife and his endearing relationship with his stepson; Hugh Grant's priminister falling for a young lady from the wrong side of the tracks; and Colin Firth's character dealing with love and the barrier of two languages.  The director seams the stories together nicely and leaves the audience with a renewed faith in love and a realization that love comes in many forms---love for a sibling, love for a stepchild and, of course, romantic love.  Not every story in this film has a perfect ending but the overall effect is that love is all around us.  In a time when we seem to focus on the hatred and wars of the world, this little film gives a small sample of what we all need--love!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Love Actually" is one of those movies that catches you with its originality.  Richard Curtis wrote and directed this movie as he did with "Four Weddings and A Funeral". He placed England's best known actors in it. This is a movie of love, actually, all kinds of love. The theme and the situations are funny, sad and illuminating.<br /><br />Hugh Grant is a newly elected prime Minister and falls in love at first sight, may I add, with his caterer. His character is quite humorous, and Hugh plays it to the max. Billy Bob Thornton plays the POTUS and is rightly put in his place, when he comes to visit the Prime Minister .Colin Firth plays a man who falls for his maid who can't speak English -and this is quite a stretch, but we believe it. Martin Freeman and Joanna Page play actors who film pornography, and while they are uuhmm filming they talk and fall in love.  Emma Thompson plays a very busy English mom who is married to Alan Rickman. They are going through the motions of a marriage until something happens that takes them up short.  Bill Nighy plays, Billy Mack, the most interesting and wonderful of all characters. He is an English musician and is going for one last effort with a pop song. He sings one of his old songs with new Christmas lyrics, and it becomes a hit. He begins to realize who he really loves. Liam Neeson is a recent widower with a very precocious son who is in love with a fellow student. Liam takes his son's infatuation seriously, and he aids his son in declaring his love. Laura Linney plays an American with unrequited love for a fellow worker, but her mentally disturbed brother takes first place.  Several very famous people dart in and out of this movie. I'll leave that as a surprise for you.<br /><br />The cinematography is glorious. The music uplifting and supreme. The characters are many, but it is not too difficult for characters to flit in and out of each story. We are able to keep up. Sometimes I wish there were more time to develop a few of the characters.<br />This is a light film to be enjoyed and relished- time to laugh and time to sigh. Highly recommended. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Excellent talent holds you to the end of this story, which would have looked ok on a stage, but the contrived feel ultimately disappoints.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>The movie shows a collection of stories that at first seem independent of each other, but we start seeing interrelationships as the action advances. The narrator is trying to demonstrate that love is everywhere and that is why he is &quot;telling&quot; us all these different anecdotes. <p>I have always favored British humor, and in this case I was not let down, since some of the situations are absolutely hilarious. There are almost no words to describe the unbelievable cast, which includes actors like Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Colin Firth, among many others.<p>David (Hugh Grant) is the new British Prime Minister and upon his arrival at his new &quot;home&quot; is captivated by Natalie, his new personal assistant. Bill is a singer at the end of his career trying to make a come back with a Christmas hit by adapting the lyrics of an old hit to make it a Christmas song. Peter and Juliet got married recently, and Peter's best friend, Mark, is having trouble dealing with this new event because he holds a secret that can destroy everything. Colin, a young impetuous guy, is looking for love and decides that his best option is to go to America, where the girls are &quot;easier&quot;. <p>Daniel (Neeson) has recently lost his wife and is trying to surge into clarity again while taking care of Samuel, his beloved stepson. At the same time, Samuel has a crush on a girl at school and is very serious about it, seeking Daniel's help for his quest. Sarah is in love with one of her co-workers, but has a burden that makes her life very complicated. Finally, Jamie is an author, who found his wife cheating on him with his brother, and looked for refuge in France. Here he meets Aurelia, a Portuguese girl that works as his maid.<p>This is the best romantic comedy I have seen in the last few years. The dialogues are funny and witty, the cast is first class and there is not one dull moment in the whole film. As a final note, just watching the scene in which Hugh Grant dances, makes this movie worth seeing!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>[Actually, my rating is 3.5 stars.]<p>No one can deny the fact that Richard Curtis is one of the best screenwriters in the world.  And yes, "Love Actually" confirms the fame again.  But as to his directoral skills, "Love" actually shows that it is short of the ones' such as Roger Mitchell who did in "Notting Hill."  In short, good, but not great.<p>"Love Actually" has many (including potential) couples in love, and too many, I am afraid.  Hugh Grant as Prime Minister of UK is in love with his chubby secretary while Emma Thompson plays a wife of Alan Rickman, in whose office Laura Linney works, who is in love with a hunky guy, and so on and on.  However, though the film includes the stars like Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, and Liam Neeson, the screentime alloted to each actor is too short for any character they play to fully engage our attentions.<p>That does not mean the film is boring.  On the contrary, it has a lot of witty dialogues of Richard Curtis, the same kind of funny lines you enjoyed in "Four Weddings and a Funeral."  But as you keep watching on, you will probably some stories should be left in the cutting room.  Actually, two (or three) couples' stories are not interesting at all.  And the slightly political satire on the US-UK relation (represented awkwardly by the US President Billy Bob Thornton) clearly sticks out.  We need romance here, not political comments, even wrapped with laughter.<p>Among the many actors, it is Bill Nighy who steals the show, as an ex-rocker whose acid tongue cannot be kept silent even on the air.  The way how this down-and-out, die-hard rocker sings his awful version of "Love Is All Around" (used in "Four Wedding" by Wet Wet Wet) is a real pleasure to see, and you can find him in every funny moment of the film.<p>"Love Actually" is too long, and its story clutters with too many characters.  It is a fun to see it, but no one would complain if Richard Curtis concentrate his enormous talent on writing only in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the concept of this movie and the cast was just tremendous. <p>I felt it was like watching the British All-Stars.  All of the acting they did was outstanding, yet the movie troubled me.<p>It was Love Actually, actually it was more about dysfunctional lives and relationships.  <p>The warm part of the movie and the potential starts and ends with those at the airport, the mosiac of loved ones hugging one another and a reference to 9-11 and the question is there still love in the world.  This is the most touching piece of filmography I can remember.  With Hugh Grant narrating as people come up hugging and crying and laughing, you witness love, actually.<p>There are some great moments in this movie with some great twists.  <p>I felt the down side though was that there was too much flirtation with cheating, dicussing sex to a young child that was way beyond his years, fairly graphic shots of a couple progressively 'practicing' sex scenes for lighting.  If just this last one was eliminated the movie could be a classic because there are dysfunctions in life.  Yet I felt there were too many that did not really show the love, actually, shown at the airport.<p>It is a good movie for couples to discuss relationships and where they see themselves.  There are some cute relationships and some neat twists, yet it is not for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>I just saw this film in the cinema and yeah it is one of those films that everybody who is in the festive spirits will enjoy at the time but that is all really. It is nothing memorable, just sort of a 2 hour xmas time filler to get ya in the mood.<p>The premise is simple. Various persons each have a crisis love situation around xmas time and then eventually it tries to all come together. There is a lot of diversity in the various stories and it is very moochy, kissy, awww---shucks, kind of stuff. So take your girl to see it and I am sure she will be happy for the next few hours after it, but the film does lash on a bit with the whole emotion of love sort of premise that it is born out from.<p>The scenes with the aging old rocker are worth the admission fee alone. Just do not go in expecting a grade A comedy and you will enjoy your two hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Sometimes its enough just to have a lot of fun in seeing a film.  This is a big, stuffed-to-the-gills film, presumably with something to entertain every viewer, but also something for anyone to criticize if they so wish.  I did not so wish, simply because most of it was fun, nearly all of it was funny, and as a whole it is a very good time.<p>Some seem to be criticizing the film for not having more Hugh Grant or other actors, but that completely misunderstands what the film is.  It is not a star vehicle, a la MAID IN MANHATTAN or TWO WEEKS NOTICE from the last Holiday season, but an ensemble piece.  In other words, there is a large cast of actors, and the film tries to balance a number of stories instead of focusing merely on one.  More than that, it is not an ensemble film in the sense of GOSFORD PARK, which uses a group of actors to tell essentially one story.  This film uses its ensemble to tell a number of stories, stories that manage to overlap to a degree, but separate stories nonetheless.<p>Telling several stories at once, some are going to work better than others.  The worst, by far, was the Laura Linney story, in which an American is prevented from a romance with a man to whom she is enormously attracted by her willingness to accept at all times of the day and night calls from her mentally ill brother.  Anyone who knows anything about having a relative who is mentally ill knows that the first rule is setting limits to their behavior, so that it doesn't control the behavior of those around them.  No mental health professional in the world would have allowed the brother to call his sister at will.  But that was the only one of the tales that I found to be absurd.  Most of the others were delightful.<p>My favorite performer was without question Bill Nighy, who stole nearly every scene he appeared in, playing an aging rocker who is trying to get back in the public eye by singing a god awful updating of the Troggs's classic &quot;Love is All Around&quot; to &quot;Christmas is All Around.&quot;  He takes the entire thing as one huge joke, and his joking nearly steals the film.  <p>At a time when the American presidency is held in greater disdain in the world in general and in England in particular, there is a particular interesting bit of fantasy in which the British Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant, stands up in a press conference to the American President, played by Billy Bob Thorton.  Basically, Hugh refuses to be Billy Bob's poodle.  Obviously, the movie portrays a prime minister the likes of which most Britons would love to see, instead of the way that Tony Blair currently is.  <p>I also enjoyed the part that featured Colin Firth falling in love with his Portuguese housekeeper during a trip to France to write, but with whom he could not communicate.  He then learns a smattering of Portuguese, flies to her on Christmas Eve, and then in his halting Portuguese asks her to marry him, with her accepting in the halting English she has obviously just picked up.<p>This is not a great movie.  It will not be used in film classes to illustrate film writing technique or to show the way that the camera can tell a story in a way that is unique to film, but it is a heck of a lot of fun, and if one doesn't take it too seriously, will create a very, very good couple of hours of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Love Actually is a sparkling Christmas comedy about eight couples and the love in their lives.  Hugh Grant stars as the newly-elected British Prime Minister, who falls in love with his unsophisticated secretary.  The wonderful Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman play a bored couple whose marriage is on the rocks.  Handsome Colin Firth plays a writer working in France who is attracted to his Portuguese assistant, who doesn't speak English.  Bill Nighy nearly steals the show as an outrageously flamboyant  middle-aged ex-rock star who has a new hit.<br /><br />All of the actors are excellent in their roles.  Hugh Grant is my favorite, playing his usual, adorable, Prince Charming role to perfection.  Thompson and Rickman are compelling as spouses who have lost the spark, at least for each other.  The script is solidly funny, and poignant as well. (Note:  Bring your hankie.)<br /><br />The film would have been better if it had concentrated on just  three couples.  One of the unnecessary stories deals with a couple in the porn business, and there is a great deal of nudity.  For this reason, I think the film should be rated NC-17.  But it is a real feel-good movie and a genuinely funny comedy that will leave you smiling through your tears.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>At first, I was really pissed at this movie because it's obviously affected - you can feel it - but it's pretty and comfortably sumptuous.  I also went bananas at the chinese influenced seating in Hugh Grant's sitting room - since cured by the superior English upholstered furniture in Julian Fellows' Separate Lies.  Everyone's being cutesy English but I know, it could be a LOT worse so this is a guilty pleasure but at least it is genuinely entertaining (unlike Notting Hill and that I Love Paris movie - I can't remember the latter's name - now those films are really unwatchable.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>It's hard not to like "Love Actually", 2004's whirlwind romantic comedy set around a series of couples in the weeks before Christmas in London.  Everyone's romantic situation is under stress; how those situations are worked out is the engaging, funny theme of this holiday movie.<br /><br />Some subplots are fairly obvious: a single Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) who falls for his attractive young caterer; a widower (Liam Neeson) helping his young stepson through his first big crush; a writer (Colin Firth) fleeing a failed relationship who falls for his Portuguese maid; and a middle-aged wife (Emma Thompson) who suspects her husband is cheating.  Other subplots are more subtle: a young man's affection for his best friend's new bride; two porn actors exploring a real relationship; an office worker in love with a co-worker; an aging rocker facing a lonely Christmas; and a sex-crazed youth seeking an American female.<br /><br />Managing this many storylines becomes a point of dramatic tension.  Director Richard Curtis keeps the action moving, sliding us past a few gimmicks while lingering in the right places.  The result is heartwarming, humorous, suprisingly honest, and sometimes absurd. The story is well-seeded with distinctly British humor and surprise cameos.  "Love Actually" is very highly recommended as worthwhile romantic comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>Love, Christmas, London, England<br /><br />Richard Curtis, the talented writer of the very successful Four Weddings and Funeral, Nottting Hill, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and one of Mr. Bean's the creators, wrote and directed Love Actually, and what a directing debut it is. The ultimate romantic dramedy, the film that is not ashamed to be sweet, heartwarming, and outrage romantic. Love Actually talks about love, romances, break-ups, moving on, and does it admirably. This is the film I can watch over and over - during Christmas time or spring time, or summer, and it always brings warmth, humor, laughs, sadness, and yes, Love that is everywhere, just look a little closer. This is the film that makes me smile and even brings the tears to my eyes - all at once. Love Actually gives romantic comedy its good name back. It is a very good movie - sometimes, close to perfect, gorgeous, sweet in the good sense of the word and always lovely.<br /><br />First, and foremost, I admire the film for outstanding (and I mean it) cast. Some of the best British and American and European actors (and there is also simply gorgeous Rodrigo Santoro who deserves a special mention) play twenty or even more Londoners who were hit by the Cupid's arrow during the Christmas season of 2003 in absolutely stunningly looking, lively and bright London. I won't be original if I say that the funniest character belongs to Bill Nighy as once super-famous rock star (in Keith Richard's type) who is making his comeback with an old love song that he is turning in the Christmas super hit. Another outstanding performance belongs to divine Emma Thompson. She brings depth and real emotions into her and Alan Rickman's story of the marriage in crisis. Laura Linney's story of love that was so close and possible but not meant to be was also very well told and acted.<br /><br />This time, Liam Neeson's story as a newly widower with the young step-son who is desperately in love with the most popular girl in school, touched me the most. After recent untimely tragic death of Neeson's wife, the mother of his two sons, Natasha Richardson, the story feels the most poignant and sweetest. The scene during Daniel's wife funeral, his speech celebrating Joanna's life, moved me almost to tears.<br /><br />Yes, it is a long movie and it tells the stories of 20 people or so who all happen to live, work, fell in love, sometimes have their hearts broke in London that I've never seen so bright and lovely as in this picture - perhaps, because the stories start five weeks prior to Christmas and end on Christmas night. With so many intertwining stories, not all of them are equally good. Some could be dropped, leaving the movie shorter, leaner, and perhaps better but even the way it is, Love Actually deserves its place on such top lists as Best of 2003, Favorites, and Favorite Romance. It is beautiful and magical - just like the season during which it takes place.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>The British are still trying to find that 1930's to 1950's style, Golden Age romance for the Cinema.  They spruce it up with modern mores, bed jumping and adultery, sprinkle a little adult movie moves, add a chubby, Monica Lewinski love interest for a single Prime Minister that looks a lot like Tony Blair, add mental health issues, and bingo, ya got Three Weddings and a Night to Remember.<br /><br />What's all this mean American President business?

They tug at our heart strings, make us sick to our stomachs, and leave us dripping in sacharine sweetness.  LOVE ACTUALLY is no exception to the mix.  In fact, this film seems to be a romantic comedy on steroids, combining the Hollywood happiness of several movies into a single extravaganza.  Throughout the film, we are treated to many interweaving storylines of love.<br /><br />Although I found the film to be a bit too sweet for my tooth, I did enjoy watching the storylines overlap one another and I was entertained.  Despite the film's length, I found myself interested in a couple of the storylines in particular..like that  of Billy Mack, a cynical rock star who steals every scene he is in.<br /><br />LOVE ACTUALLY is neither a great film nor a terrible one.  It is an average film.  No more, no less.  Not worth a buy...but perhaps a look.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>There were many epics released in 2003, Cold Mountain, Return of the King, and Big Fish, but none was more unexpected than the Romantic Comedy "Epic" Love Actually.  Set in charming merry old England at Christmas time, Love Actually, brought forth holiday chher like no other film in the holiday season.  You leave the theater, wanting to fall in love with someone.  The film brought together great British acting, which included Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, and OMG Keira Knightly. It all came together in a not so tiring 2 1/2 hours.  See it for a feel good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>"Love, Actually" could have been titled "Love, Almost" with an American director.  With new fewer than eight couples vying for attention in this cameo-laden romantic comedy, you need a score card to keep up--and yes, everyone does win, more or less.<br /><br />We start at the top, brand new Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) just moves in to fall in love with the girl who brings him coffee. Liam Neeson is helping his grade school stepson win the heart of the very young woman he loves. Emma Thompson is on the bittersweet end as she tries to wrap her head around the idea that her husband, Alan Rickman might be cheating with an office girl.<br /><br />And that's not all...The stories are heartfelt with just enough British irony to keep you laughing instead of falling into a sucrose induced coma. Kudos for producer, Curtis, for giving this story enough spice to keep it real and interesting.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, June 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>This was a fun movie - flawed only by taking on the lives and loves of a few too many people. It's a romantic comedy in which there's a happy ending for about 12 of the 16 people involved as they careen into the stress and chaos of the Christmas holidays.<br />Another stretch is accepting Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister; I'm sorry, but he just doesn't look the part, nor does his endearing, hesitant, bumbling persona lend itself well to the role of a world leader. HOWEVER, there's a scene in which he thinks he's alone and he's dancing all over #10 Downing to recorded music, and he's really laying on some hotshot moves - - - and suddenly there's a staff member-secretary-middle-aged-woman-person type standing in the doorway with a sheaf of papers. It's terrific. I replayed it 3 times and laughed just as hard the 3rd time as I had the 1st.<br />Emma Thompson has a scene that's difficult to do justice to in words, and indeed, the scene is wordless. On Christmas morning, she realizes her husband (smarmy Alan Rickman) has a lover, and she leaves her family to go to her bedroom where she quietly, wordlessly, and eloquently regains control of her devastation. Masterful acting.<br />Good movie. Some wonderful acting. But man, that's a lot of people to keep track of.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>I have to admit it...I LOVED This movie...Maybe it is a "chick" movie; maybe it borders on schmaltz and sentimentality..who cares?  Richard Curtis has crafted a movie that is wonderfully entertaining, peopled it with an outstanding list of well known and not so well known actors, set it at Christmastime, and I had a smile on my face almost the entire movie.  This is brilliant film-making.  I even enjoyed the deleted scenes!!!<br />BILL NIGHY & GREGOR FISHER - Bill is outstanding as the has-been rock star who wants his new unabashedly awful Christmas song to be the # 1 song for the holidays.  He is rude, crude, potty mouthed, obnoxious, but ultimately loveable.  His relationship with his manager Joe (Fisher) culminates in a wonderfully tender scene where Billy admits his love.<br />COLIN FIRTH & LUCIA MONIZ as Jamie and his Portuguese housekeeper are a delightful pair, whose descent into love is touching, poignant and humorous.  The scene where Firth proposes and the whole town joins in is cinematic hoodoo, but what fun it is!<br />LIAM NEESON & THOMAS SANGSTER - this is Liam's finest work since SCHINDLER'S LIST.  His recently widowed stepdad to Sangster's brilliantly precocious Sam is a highlight of the movie.  Tender, warm, and extremely funny at times.  Sangster's love for his schoolmate Joanna is so representative of young puppy love.<br />EMMA THOMPSON & ALAN RICKMAN - Thompson is superb; her scene alone in the bedroom without one word of dialogue reflects the kind of actress this lady is.  Rickman is good too as the husband tempted by his lucscious secretary (played very well by Heike Makatsch).<br />LAURA LINNEY & RODRIGO SANTORO have the less uplifting relationship.  She is a hard working woman who feels responsible for her mentally ill brother, who is institutionalized, paranoid and schizophrenic.  Rodrigo is the office nerd who is really quite a stud and when he and Linney finally get a chance to express their feelings, phone calls from her brother interfere.  Linney is a brilliant actress and she does wonders with this difficult role.<br />HUGH GRANT & MARTINE MCCUTCHEON - Hugh is at home in this movie, even improbably cast as the Prime Minister.  But Hugh is Hugh, and his dashing aplomb and carefree masculinity match the torrid undercurrent of McCutcheon's Natalie.  His putdown of President Billy Bob Thornton is marvelous.<br />MARTIN FREEMAN & JOANNA PAGE - what a hoot!  Here we have two young people who are standins for sexual scenes of some movie, and they talk about the weather, the Prime Minister and all other kinds of things while in very compromising positions.  Quite original and well played.<br />KRIS MARSHALL is Colin, a self-proclaimed stud who ventures off to America to find babes.  One would think that he would turn out luckless, especially since he chooses to go to Wisconsin.  But true to Curtis' originality, Colin scores right away with not one, but four luscious babes.  Charming.<br />KEIRA KNIGHTLEY and ANDREW LINCOLN - she's recently wed to Lincoln's best friend, and for all intents and purposes, it looks like he resents the marriage.  We all know of course the real reason for his behavior.  Wonderfully played out by these two charming actors.<br />There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie, and the entire cast is sublime and perfect!<br />I didn't think I would like this movie at first, but it is one of my favorite movies I've seen in some time.<br />Forget the schmaltz, just enjoy the company!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>This is such a well-written piece on romantic relationships. Its success lie in its wide appeal. I ask my friends and all have their own favorite characters and moments in the movie. I watched it 3 times and I find my favorite scenes change too. There is the writer (Colin Firth)'s proposal  to his Portugese maid. Not to forget the hilarious Hugh Grant performing his dance sequence. Keira Knightly with her secret admirer opening his heart to her at the doorstep can be overwheming. Not to mention the modern London feel throughout the movie.<br /><br />These wonderful short stories are so fragmented when I watched it the first time there is a longing for more. It allows me to repeat watching the movie again with nice surprises here and there. The fact that each piece is so short allows the audience to feel rather than being told the story.<br /><br />This is one of the few romantic classics in recent years that arouses such warm and deep feelings from a wide range of audience - young and old. An excellent combo of romantic moments that can truly stand the test of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>As far as romantic comedies goes, for the most part `Love Actually' nails it.  The only problem I have with this film is that it covers the lives of so many young lovers that no one is truly explored or explained, there's just simply not enough time.<br /><br />But that aside, the cast is truly talented and make for a wonderfully delightful time.  Bill Nighy comes to mind right off bat as a real reason to watch this film, for his portrayal of Billy Mack, the washed up rock star vying for a second chance is just utterly hysterical.<br /><br />As love triangles are formed, new love blossoms and lasting love begins to fade, a cast that includes Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman deliver laughs and smiles that are sure to please the viewer.<br /><br />Some of the characters and relationships could have been axed to provide stronger storylines for key characters, but all in all this is a great slice of entertainment and not a bad way to spend some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />As long as you don't take this modern-day fairy tale literally you'll have a heck of a time; combining laughs, romance, and a bit of pathos into one of the shortest-seeming 2+ hours movies ever made, Love Actually is well-worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>I'm not usually a big fan of romantic comedies, but I enjoyed "Love Actually" nonetheless, mostly because the performances by the various actors were entertaining and the pacing was brisk enough that I didn't get bored even though the movie is over two hours long.

I give this a low 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Definitely a great movie and one of my personal favorites, Love Actually, brings to the screen a set of stories that take place in London, England, involving an unlikely group of people who are linked to each other in varying ways.  The list of top quality actors taking part in this film is very long!  All the actors' performances are outstanding; their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The plot is very witty, very well thought through, and fantastically executed.<br /><br />But that is not the only thing that puts this movie at the very top; it combines excellent comedy, realistic drama (for a change), and the music is such an asset (!!!), making this movie one of the best of its kind.<br /><br />After Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, Richard Curtis has scored another major hit with this movie! In short, Love Actually is a movie guaranteed to make you both laugh and cry, and in the end leave you with the warmest feelings of joy!  I for one would definitely line up to watch a sequel!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I am not sure what the British equivalent of throwing in everything including the kitchen sink would be, but that would certainly apply to the romantic marathon that Richard Curtis has put together for this holiday season.  Curtis has previously written the screenplays for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; and &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; along with the adaptation of &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary,&quot; along with a slew of &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;Bean&quot; scripts (which explains the choice bits for Rowan Atkinson).  With &quot;Love Actually&quot; (is all around, is the rest of the title we see in the opening credits) Curtis tries his hand as director as well and apparently gives himself permission to work in every idea for a plot that he had come up with recently.  I have seen several descriptions of this film talking about their being eight couples, but there are at least nine plots lines which collide with each other in various ways at various points in the film.  All of them have them moments and it will be interesting for couples who see this film to pick and choose which three story lines they like the best.<br /><br />Curtis sets the range of tone for this film in the first two sequences.  During the title credits Hugh Grant makes a poignant comment about September 11th that evokes an emotional response from many audience members and then we are confronted with the spectacle of over aged rocker Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) turning a familiar song into a holiday exploitation number.  The laughter outweighs the tears in what follows over the next 135 minutes, but there are ample opportunities for both (I had no idea the film was that long, I was too busy enjoying it).  Curtis juggles all the plotlines effortlessly, buoyed by the fact that all of them are interesting and we have a strong rooting interest in several of them as we follow them through the four weeks before Christmas.  However, do not be fooled into thinking that everybody gets a happy ending, because that is not the case, whether they deserve it or not.  Still, there are enough endings to go around (maybe even more than &quot;The Return of the King&quot;), and it is good to remember that sometimes the triumph of love is a peck on the cheek.  <p>There seems little reason to review the plot lines, because there are just so many, and no need to tell you which parts were my favorite because you should make up your own mind.  The cast alone should be enough to get your interested in this one.  I commented that it had three of the four leads from &quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; only to see the fourth one pop up (sort of).  True, I have trouble believing Hugh Grant is the Prime Minister of England, but that is a minor concern.  Mostly it is the relative newcomers that standout, including Andrew Lincoln as Mark, Martine McCutcheon as Natalie, and Thomas Sangster as Sam.  Another fun part of this film is all the recognizable faces who pop up at interesting moments (you will need the fingers on both hands to count them).  Be forewarned that this is a British comedy, which means naked bodies are usually funny rather than sexy, which is a shame only because there are parts in this film kids would like but their parents will not let them see because of the other parts.  Also, be prepared to stop at a store on the way home to pick up the soundtrack, because the music is a big part of this film and you have to find a way to get Billy Mack's song out of your mind.  <p>I can also tell you that my wife laughed louder and cried more often than at any movie we have ever seen.  In fact, I was told I had to get the DVD for her for Christmas, so stick a fork in me, because I am done.  On the other hand, on the other side of the two bridges I can see from our windows is Wisconsin...</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I've heard some bad stuff about this movie. The couples aren't given that much screen time etc. But I was surprised, when I sat & watched it, with the wind howling outside, and found myself really enjoying it, and laughing along.<br /><br />Apart from each couple's separate storylines, the movie is also a spot-the-celebrity kinda thing, and there's some surprising cameos in there. Some of the more recognisable cast include: Bill Nighy, Gregor Fisher, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Kris Marshall, Martin Freeman, Andrew Lincoln, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Laura Linney, Junior Simpson, Alan Rickman, Ant McPartlin, Declan Donnelly, Billy Bob Thornton (playing an almost spot-on US president!), Michael Parkinson, Rowan Atkinson, Elisha Cuthbert, Claudia Schiffer (for her one-minute cameo, she received a reported ?200,000), Nancy Sorrell, Shannon Elizabeth, and Denise Richards.<br /><br />My favourite character in all of this was Martin Freeman for definite. I'd only seen him before in the UK show, The Office, but he actually looked really cute in this! His hair was a bit messed up, and he got his kit off! It's amazing, cos he's filming what looks like a very bad porn movie, and they're faking all the positions etc, and him & the girl get together by the end of the movie! The girl also appears topless, which is no doubt to make the guys watch it. Martin is terrific in this movie though.<br /><br />I got quite soppy at the wedding scene with a very blonde and very skinny (b*tch) Keira Knightley. That scene was so romantic and I think I went all gooey inside!<br /><br />The whole scenes between Colin Firth and L&uacute;cia Moniz, are hilarious! There's quite a few subtitles, but they're so funny! The lake that L&uacute;cia and Colin are "swimming" in was actually only 18-inches deep and they had to kneel around and pretend to be in deeper water. It was also over-run by mosquitoes and Colin Firth was badly bitten and his elbow swelled up to the size of an avocado, requiring medical attention. This scene is the funniest:<br /><br />[Aurelia jumps into the lake with hardly any clothes on to save Jamie's book]<br />Jamie: Oh God, she's in. And now she'll think I'm a total spaz if I don't go in too.<br />[takes off his sweater]<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] [...]. It's cold.<br />[Jamie falls in]<br />Jamie: [...]. It's freezing! [...]<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] This stuff better be good.<br />Jamie: It's not worth it you know, this isn't bloody Shakespeare.<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] I don't want to drown saving some [...] my grandmother could have written.<br />Jamie: Just stop, stop.<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] What kind of idiot doesn't make copies?<br />Jamie: I really must do copies.<br />[beat]<br />Jamie: You know, there'd better not be eels in here. I can't stand eels.<br />Aurelia: [in Portuguese] Try not to disturb the eels.<br />Jamie: [screams in shock because of the eels] Oh God, what the hell is that?<br /><br />Hugh Grant plays virtually the same character he did in Bridget Jones (except he's the prime minister), including calling Margaret Thatcher a "saucy minx", and making some little jokes about the person before him, having a scary wife, and horrible children.<br /><br />When David arrives at No. 10 Downing Street, his tie changes 11 times between shots when meeting Natalie. Apparently, Hugh Grant had changed his tie after a post-lunch nap and no one noticed at first. They decided to "play with it" and went all out and changed the tie 11 times just for the heck of it.<br /><br />I've seen quite a few reviews, that complain about the ending, but so what if the ending is left hanging? It's the exact same way as life, nothing ever ends perfectly, nor are all the loose ends tied up.<br /><br />What could be done with this movie, is make little spin-offs, and see what happened with all the characters. Of course, then they'd probably be a pile of trash. But there are some of the characters I would like to follow up.<br /><br />Despite the greatness of the movie, it does have its flaws. Why are almost all the women servants or assistants and almost all of the men more powerful (bosses, prime ministers, authors etc)? Women serve lots of coffee in this film! And the more ambition they tend to show (sexual or work-wise), the more villainous they seem. This movie has a very old-fashioned view of the sexes. Why are there no gay couples? With so many couples present, it could have been easily done.<br /><br />I doubt many guys would like to see this movie, and would probably moan right the way through - and not in the way you would like, believe me! This is an outright girly movie, something to spend time cuddled up to your duvet/cuddly toy, with hot chocolate, or having a girly afternoon with your mates. Make your guy watch on the promise of something else later.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Love Actually brings the audience a bright glance of what most people on earth strive to encounter and/or attain, love. Love is a word with many different meanings in regards to the relationship between people, but it is uniformly positive to how people interact to one another. Love in this film is most often meant as how the Merriam-Webster dictionary would put it: "1 a (1) : a strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties (2) : attraction based on sexual desire : affection and tenderness felt by lovers (3) : affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests b : an assurance of love."<br /><br />The film displays several characters that are linked to one another in some way and how these people find a love connection with each other. The story emphasizes that time and place are irrelevant and that no one is above love as the story depicts the British prime minister (Hugh Grant) falling in love with one of his maids. The story also shows the first love as a young teen falls in love with the school's popular girl, and how love sometimes can be painful when it is not returned.<br /><br />Richard Curtis who also directed films such as Bridget Jones Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral has previously displayed his skill in making romantic comedies. Love Actually continues to presents Curtis's skill to make light hearted, yet meaningful films where love is the essence. In addition, it is a film that will cheer up the audience while viewing it as it offers much humor, entertainment, noble notions, and much else to ponder. In essence Love Actually offers what it teaches, love, which provides an excellent cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>It has as much to do with Christmas as Home Alone, The Bishop'a Wife & other holiday fare.<br />  Here's the deal: You meet somone new during the holidays.

It's not enough to have a huge ensemble of couples all rushing toward the inevitable happy endings. The director has to mix in Christmas schmaltz on top of it all. Beware. Only for the rose-colored glasses set.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>One of the more interesting movies of 2003, Love Actually is a hilarious, romantic, emotional rollercoaster chronicling the effects of love on an interconnecting web of individuals. Filled with a number of memorable scenes, yet completely ignored by the Academy Awards, Love Actually is the type of film enjoyed by a wide array of people. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't like it, which is saying a lot considering this could fall under the category of "chick flick". But what makes Love Actually a successful film is its ability to identity with each audience member on a personal level. Each character is easy to relate to, and the multiple storylines are surprisingly easy to follow.<br /><br />Starring a plethora of Hollywood stars and starlets (Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, etc), Love Actually follows the lives of various loosely connected characters as they struggle to deal with their love lives in the hectic month leading up to Christmas. Set in London, England, the film is a collage of various lives. The central character is the world's most eligible bachelor, the new Prime Minister named David (Hugh Grant), a powerful man who falls in love with his newly hired personal assistant Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), but can barely summon the courage to tell her how he feels.<br /><br />The film also follows the life of the Prime Minister's older sister Karen (Emma Thompson), a woman struggling with her husband Harry's (Alan Rickman) possible infidelity with an office co-worker named Mia (Heike Makatsch) who she knows is after him. Meanwhile, Karen confides in her male friend Daniel (Liam Neeson) who is concerned about the strange behavior of his young son, who he later finds out is in love with a young girl in his class - a girl who will soon move to the United States. Rounding out the storylines are a writer who catches his girlfriend cheating and moves away to France where he find new love, a secretary who questions her love affair with an office co-worker she's wanted for years, a photographer smitten with his best friend's new wife, and a pair of porn stars who develop a relationship after filming a number of scenes together (many of these sequences are hilarious). To top it all off, one young man moves to Wisconsin were he believes girls will stand in line to make love to him. Love Actually features a multitude of eccentric and lovable characters the audience gets to know, and each character crosses paths in the final moments of the film, projecting a very uplifting message about life and relationships.<br /><br />But the show stealer of Love Actually is Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), an aging rock star desperate to climb back to the top of the charts. He achieves his goal by means of a wildly outlandish and funny personality that puts him on radio and TV shows everywhere and leads to his indescribable song "Christmas Is All Around" taking the country by storm.<br /><br />With a likeable cast of characters, and a multiplicity of viewpoints (pessimistic, optimistic, young & old, etc.), Love Actually is a refreshing film boasting a little bit of everything. It's a film that will make you laugh, make you sad, and in general, provide you with a good feeling when it's all over. For that reason, Love Actually is a definite must-see film. Don't hesitate to rent this one...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Many interesting stories, mostly fluffy but heartwarming tales, blend together in a loosely interwoven tale. The cast is impressive both in number of people in the film and in the quality of actors (Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, just to name a few) and the film is a mad dash sort of romantic comedy careening toward the Christmas climax. The story follows possibly eight couples who are trying to get together, falling in love, just discovering their true feelings, making their true feelings known, giving in to their feelings or saying "to heck with convention", and going above and beyond the call of duty for love. It touches in a shallow, but not wholly unsatisfying, way the various trials and triumphs of different types of love and does so in an entertaining way. The fact that the characters here could be as well developed as they are (given their sheer numbers) is remarkable and laudatory. Still there is something a bit saccharine about the whole thing, but the viewer will probably forgive because the director is new at directing, because it is a sort of heartwarming and cute story, and because the performances are all good. Besides, it was a Christmastime release and everyone wants a happy ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Yes, the old saying is true, love is all around us. There is no real chance anyone has of escaping its effects as best we try sometimes. For as simple an act as falling in love may seem, falling out of love or moving on after lover lost is never quite as easy a thing to actually carry out. It is never a gracious thing to go through life believing what our mothers had always told us, that there would be someone out there for every one of us, especially when you have nothing with you now to show for it. As hard as we might try, it is practically impossible when we are alone to prevent our minds from racing with the thoughts of "what if I never find that special someone". There is always tomorrow, you tell yourself day in and day out as the weeks and months slip slowly by like tiny grains of sand through a timer, wondering within your subconscious how long you can keep this act up of fooling yourself with such nonsense. Depression inevitably sinks in as life pitches you the perfect no-hitter in the field of relationships, knocking you about as if you were the universe's personal whore. All around you see couples holding each other's hands and clinging tight to their loved ones while you travel the seemingly desolate sidewalks alone and downtrodden. If love is as chaotic as everyone makes it out to be, why is it that we find ourselves returning to it time and again despite the afflictive lessons of the past? Love is simply a natural occurrence, instinctive really, and there is nothing you or anyone else can do to control those feelings you have for someone close and dear to you, even if they may not know it just yet. Love, when lost or unrequited, can truly be dispiriting, but once you are able to get back on that horse it can be the most completely fulfilling experience of your life and no one should prevent themselves from embracing it head on.<br /><br />The story is a mingled interweaving of several individual storylines, all of which involve the enchanting, if not often perplexing, subject of love written by Richard Curtis, the man behind such romantic comedies as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones's Diary. With just five weeks left until Christmas, London, England is abuzz with men and women sorting out their love lives, or lack of them. The film begins with David, the recently elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who, not even seconds into the door of his new home, has fallen deeply in love with his catering manager Natalie, recently dumped by her ex-boyfriend who complained of her being "too fat". David's younger sister Karen attempts to juggle a crippling relationship with her husband, Harry, the operator of a local magazine, who has become quite friendly with his flirtatious secretary Mia, and helping her friend Daniel cope with the recent passing of his wife. While attempting to move on with his life, Daniel must also help navigate his eleven year old son through a situation of his own, having fallen in love with an American girl who happens to be the most popular girl at school. Karen is also friends with Jamie Bennett, a novelist who has temporarily relocated to France to nurse his broken heart after discovering his girlfriend cheating on him with his much younger and more attractive brother, only to be captivated by Aurelia, the Portuguese housekeeper of his country villa. Harry's best editor Sarah is absolute smitten by Karl, a fellow magazine editor, and has been ever since she started working at the magazine over a year ago but has not had the courage to tell him how she has felt and complications with her brother, who is currently in the asylum, has not made her personal life any easier. Juliet has just married Peter not realizing that his best friend Mark, the photographer, has been infatuated with her ever since they first met, though he has never spoken a word of this to anyone, let alone herself. Colin Frissell, a lascivious waiter at Peter and Juliet's wedding reception, unable to connect with British women decides to travel to the states, specifically Wisconsin, to score with a bunch of American girls relying solely on his "British charm". And burnt-out former British rock-icon Billy Mack, desperate for a comeback to the top of the charts after overcoming a long standing heroin addiction, acts as the main connection for all these individual love-lines.<br /><br />The story for Love Actually is almost as complicated a matter, ironically, as the concept of love itself. In order to find all the connections between the characters and understand the unfolding of events within the framework of the picture one must truly pay attention throughout the interwoven storylines but it is not as complicated a concept as it would seem. We connect with the characters and their actions on screen almost instantaneously because we, as individuals, see ourselves and our own lovelorn, often foolish, actions paraded in front of us on screen. Having experienced at least one, if not more, of the complex love stories in our own lives, we are at long last able to see our own actions for ourselves and are able to gain a fresh perspective and a far better understanding of those events, thus putting our minds, and perhaps even our souls, at ease for it.<br /><br />Colin Firth works splendidly as Jamie Bennett, a man so desperate to escape the pangs of lost love that he flees the country to concentrate on his novel only to fall in love once again with a charming woman who doesn't speak a word of English. This just goes to show that love is both blind and strong and it can not be deterred by the mere language barriers that have separated us in so many other functions of human interaction throughout the world. It would have been more appropriate for the filmmakers to have taken Liam Neeson's Daniel a little more serious - the events at the funeral were not offensive given the context but they did seem a tad bit out place considering it was a funeral after all - being how he lost his wife but this is a comedy and it was expected for them not to dwell too longingly on the rather serious subject matter. The deteriorating relationship between Karen and Harry, played eloquently by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman respectfully, on other hand, was handled as it should have been allowing the audience to contemplate in their head the events, not always in consecutive order, that can lead to love loss in a relationship to love found in another and how everyone in that triangle is affected by it. The most charming scene in the entire film has to be when Mark, played with such effort by Andrew Lincoln, visits Juliet on Christmas Eve and tells her, silently via the use of cue-cards (clever) and carol music, how he has always felt about her but never bucked up the courage to tell her until now. Often, when we lose someone close to our heart to another man or woman, quite possibly forever, we instinctively want to shut out those feelings we once had for that person and attempt to move on with our lives as best we can but never seems to work out. We, as human beings, need closure with any close relationship we have in our lives, whether it involves family, friends, or loves, and we can never fully move on until we let our feelings be known to that person. It is better for us to act upon those feelings then to hold them in, worrying ourselves to death with the thought of "had she/he but known", even if nothing is to come about as a result of this forthrightness, as this particular scenes demonstrates. Then and only then can we be one within our mind once again, telling ourselves "enough" and having the ability now to move on fully with our life. Billy Bob Thornton makes a cheap cameo in the role of the President of the United States. Though his slick southern persona and entirely unlikable womanizing style, eerily renascent of William Jefferson Clinton, are worth a few laughs, he contributes practically nothing to the storyline and could have easily been downplayed or excluded from the film altogether. Originally Rowan Atkinson's character, Rufus, the jewelry department salesman, was supposed to be an angel and would have disappeared after passing Daniel in the airport near the end of the film, which would have done a better job in clearing up his involvement in both Harry's and Daniel's son's relationships but as it stands it works out fine.<br /><br />Overall, critics may complain about Love Actually's uniquely over-the-top nature and its ability to be so overtly clich&eacute;d even for its own good but, in actuality, often love is like that sometimes - it is never as spontaneous or original as we would want it to be but it retains its charm and effective none the less, which goes hand-in-hand with this film and enduring message. Despite creating a distinctively potent and dazzling directorial debut, there are several aspects to the film that failed to pan out properly for Richard Curtis. For example, though come-back rocker Billy Mack does tie all the loose coalition of storylines together and ultimately lends help to the charming, if not overtly clich&eacute;d, ending involving Daniel's son and the love of his life at the airport, his own storyline on the other hand feels flat and uninteresting. Either his character should have been expanded or simply pushed more into the background as a mere side character instead of what is given to us here. John and Judy, the couple that meets on the set for a stimulated love scene for a motion picture, are two other supporting characters that could have been left out of the film entirely as they contribute nothing to the story at all. It is fantastic to see that Curtis wants to demonstrate love lost and found in a variety of situations but there is a point when so much becomes too much and you eventually have to cut something loose to balance the feature out again, something Curtis fails to do here. But these are comparatively minor slip-ups, as unnecessary and inconvenient to the overall storyline as they may be, and hardly leave a lasting affect on the film's clear-cut purpose and contemplative message that love is truly all we need in this world to be happy. True, the sole intention of this film was that of romantic comedy but it does not hurt to pay closer attention to the events that unfold within this feature and perhaps gain a clear understanding of a situation in our own complicated love life, one we may not have obtained else where. Love actually is all around us - all we have to do is open our eyes and see it for ourselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I thought this was going to be a lot better.  I'm glad that I just rented it because that's all it is good for is a watch.  The only part that meant anything to me was the ending.  The rest of the movie was quite bland.  I do have to say there was nice casting here, but it's such a shame that they were wasted on this movie.  As for the DVD extras, there was a lot of boring stuff.  I went to the menu, then quickly got out of it.  If you decide to watch this, rent it because I think 20.00 is steep for a movie like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>Anyone who says Love Actually is too saccharine is simply missing the point.  As it makes perfectly clear in the beginning, the premise of this movie is that "love actually is all around."  Nowadays, cynicism is too often confused with wisdom, and "independent" movies that go for the cheap "unhappy" ending are really just cheating the audience.  In the movie, as in life, the characters care about being happy and are ready to put in the work to achieve happiness.<p>There are a lot of stories going on here, so we never delve that deeply into any one of the characters.  It may be simply an over-ambitious plot exercise, but I think it succeeds more than it fails.  I sat through the movie with a dopey grin on my face and I was never bored.  The only story-line that didn't pan out for me was the one concerning Laura Linney - but I won't spoil it.<p>This is a sweet, funny, life-affirming film and very entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>"Love Actually" is the perfect feel good movie for anyone who has ever felt the innocence and pitter-patter of butterflies in your stomach as you fall in love.<p>This British film starts out a little shaky until you get involved with the stories behind all of the eight couples who will weave their way into the hardest of hearts. The movie contains many well known actors like Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Colin Firth as well as a few cameos. It is well written and somehow all of the interesting characters end up just as they should.<p>Hugh Grant plays the British Prime Minister who falls in love with his assistant and as usual he is adorable and quirky, especially during his solo dance scene. Emma Thompson plays a wife who exists in a 13 year marriage believing it to be perfect until an unexpected Christmas gift from her husband ends up being for someone else. Your heart will break as she pulls herself together while Joni Mitchell sings softly in the background, "Both Sides Now." Liam Neeson is a recent widower who spends the film helping his adolescent son cope with his first case of puppy love....really adorable and holding all of the innocence that young love somehow always contains. Laura Linney is the ever responsible sister of a handicapped brother who is never able to break herself away from her duties in order to pursue her love interest, although she reaches that pinnacle of greatest accomplishment in unrequited love, that perfect moment where it all appears to work. Colin Firth is a writer who falls in love with a foreign maid while trying to work. His pursuit is both funny and touching as he learns another language and obviously does not master it while pulling an entire little town into his pursuit of love and relays the fact that love really can cross those awkward barriers. All of the rest of the stories are just as intriguing and often times gut wrenching for romantics.<p>A perfect film to watch when love treats you wrong and you need to feel right. You will be reminded of all those simple treats that come with love. From innocent starry-eyed puppy love all the way through to a lengthy marriage that is safe and secure despite the wretched boredom. It shows you that love can work and even if it doesn't another flicker will always come along if you let it. The soundtrack is its own character as great background music influences many of the scenes. It is corny, campy, silly, touching, at times stiff and then again provocative....its actually all that love is in all of its various shapes and forms.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>This is a wonderful film where 130 minutes just fly by in the blink of an eye.<p>There are many who might regard "Love Actually" as a chick flick.

He's been the guiding hand - in one way or another - behind a remarkable string of movies...Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones' Diary (and the upcoming sequel to that).  Plus, as long-time collaborator with Rowan Atkinson (the various incarnations of 'Mr. Bean' on small- and big-screens), the guy knows how to stage physcial comedy.<p>So, it's no surprise that 'Love Actually' is (mostly) a triumph.  There's a lot going on here; some of the stories are stronger than others, most notably the tale of married couple Alan Rickman (fantastic here) and Emma Thompson (who is looking more and more like Hillary Clinton with each passing day).  There's a brilliant bit of serious acting here by Thompson locked away by herself in her bedroom.  Grade A stuff.<p>From a comedic standpoint, the movie is absolutely stolen by the incredibly gifted Bill Nighy as 'wrinkled rocker' Billy Mack.  If you've never seen Nighy do his schtick (check out his over-the-top performance in "Still Crazy"), you're in for a real treat.  Plus, his holiday rendition of "Love Is All Around" sets the tone of the movie from the opening scene.  It pops up over and over and never wears thin.<p>Hugh Grant is the surprise here as a Blair-like British PM (without the Cheri).  I know he can do the serious stuff.  Check out his sublime performance in 'About a Boy' - the bumbling, stuttering Grant persona is nowhere to be found.  The eye-openers here are twofold:<p>First, Grant was quoted during "Two Weeks Notice" that he "doesn't do physical comedy," and would leave that to 'Two Weeks' co-star Sandra Bullock (the best physical comedienne in film today).  However, here he is shaking his booty through the halls of No. 10 Downing St. to the Pointer Sisters' "Jump."  It's quite good stuff.  Grant has sold himself short all these years.<p>Second, there's this one bit of politicking that Curtis slides into the movie.  Grant meets with the US President (Billy Bob Thornton is a stellar cameo in which he oligeneously combines the worst qualities of Bush and Clinton).  Expected to parrot the U.S. line in a press conference, Grant ferociously blurts out a statement of independence.  Curtis' less the veiled intent here:  "Message to Tony Blair; don't be anyone's poodle any longer."  Frankly, the only way this scene works is via Grant's ability to deliver those lines and have it seem credible.  He does that.  You never doubt him for an instant.  For anyone with an interest in the U.S.-Britain 'special relationship,' this scene alone makes 'Love Actually' worth checking out.  It'll spark hours of conversation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>When my wife said she really wanted to see "Love Actually", I was indifferent, not overly anxious to go sit in a theater and watch another "chick-flick", but equally uninterested in spending a night home alone-and so we went.<p>I have to confess, it was a great film.<p>The premise is a bunch of individual relationships reflecting the many facets of love.  At one end of the spectrum, there is the dignified, new elected Prime Minister of England, (Hugh Grant), who is at once smitten with one of the many assistants working in his office.  At the other end there is a brash, aging rock star, whose self indulgent lifestyle and brazen behavior has made him a loner, never having found true love.  In between are seven other relationships-newlyweds, an old married couple struggling with fidelity, a husband whose wife has recently died leaving him with a step-son he hardly knows, a man who struggles with bachelorhood after he catches his wife sleeping with his brother, a young couple who meet on the set of a movie they are both "starring" in, a woman who struggles with approaching a man she has secretly loved for years, and a young man who sets out for the United States in search of the other great American dream-dating a supermodel.<p>The movie is fun and funny, at once touching and satirical, painting a vivid portrait of the many struggles every individual and couple faces throughout the course of their particular lives and in the life they share with one another.  The film has a very warm feel to it, and really touches on the many issues that love carries with it.  It is great for men and women alike.  For the men, the story touches on the many challenges we all experience in trying to live up to the expectations, demands and needs of the women we love.  For women, it has the warmth of romance, combined with the reality of the imperfections men never see in themsleves.  Surely, this film is a reminder that all relationships, even the great ones, have flaws, speed-bumps and little curves that nobody can expect or see until they encounter them.  Whats more, this film is genuinely funny, and will leave the audience laughing as they exit the theater. <p>Rated R for sexuality, nudity and language, the movie should be reserved for older viewers.  The R rating is there with good reason and should not be ignored.  This is not a film for children, and it is doubtful that children would enjoy this as much as the more "mature" audience for which the film is intended.  <p>So men, fear not, this movie isn't just for women, you will enjoy it as much, if not more, than they do.  Go see it, I promise you won't be disappointed.<p>Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p><p>That is the spirit in which I can approach a film like Richard Curtis's LOVE ACTUALLY.  It is so close to being my favorite romantic comedy I almost wished that my own stupid sense of right and wrong didn't mess it up for me.  This is a movie that's so good that it's flaws are doubly illuminated. <p>Love is everywhere or at least that's the premise that Hugh Grant's (About a Boy) opening narration claims.  Then the movie goes on to prove just that.  We watch as 10 or 15 delightful and charming people fall in love.  And in the end each of these people is also connected either directly or indirectly to the other characters in the movie and so in the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a small microcosm of British society. <p>The film has charming written all over it.  Hugh Grant again plays that charming and debonair lady-killer he's gotten so good at playing.  Colin Firth (Bridget Jones's Dairy) plays this charming writer who falls for his maid, who doesn't speak English.  Emma Thompson (Junior) plays a mother and wife trying to come to grips with a tragedy in her own mind.  Liam Neeson (Schindler's List) play a widower who's young son has fallen "desperately" in love.  And While all this is going on, Alan Rickman (Dogma) and Laura Linney falls people in their office and Keira Knightly (Bend It Like Beckham) marries the man of her dreams, only to discover a little secret about his best friend.  As you can see a lot is going on here.  I can best be described as if you took a hundred romantic comedies and jammed them together.  Kind of a silly and romantic version of Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS.<p>Thankfully most of the major characters are fun, charming, and bring their own little piece of life to the film.  There is scene after scene of inventive fun.  I also liked how the film was full of silly cameo's that didn't destroy the overall structure.  Sure I saw Billy Bob Thorton, but the film didn't try to jam him down my throat.  I found my self momentarily going there's Billy Bob, but he embodies his character (The US President, think George W. Bush with Clinton's Libido), he's not playing Billy Bob.<p>The most interesting story arc follows Grant and his secretary (Martine McCutcheon, TV's Eastenders).  It's pitch perfect.  Every scene of him and McCutcheon made me smile.  I wanted to the see the outcome. I truly wanted these two people to fall in love.  It's hard for me to want to think that about characters in a more vapid rom-com.<p>It's scenes and characters like Grant and McCutcheon that make the weaker moments of the film fail miserably.  Most notably the stupid segments involving the stand-in's on the porno movie set and the dumb scenes involving the annoying British boy who goes to Wisconsin.  I wanted to watch characters that were involving.  These two story arcs were built on cartoon premises.  They're both weaker, like two bad jokes in an utterly flawless comedy routine.  They were both to silly, and did not have enough development to warrant their inclusion in this film.<p>The film also suffers from an overload of characters.  With so many interesting people to follow, it was difficult to dwell on one set of characters.  In the end you wind up getting the Cliff's Notes view of all these people. This hurts the Laura Linney (Maze) story most notably, because Curtis's screenplay tries to introduce dramatic scenes that are barely touched upon.  This makes at least one heart-wrenching scene in a mental hospital feel a little out of place.  Like it was tacked on cause every comedy needs a dramatic moment.<p>I also hated that the screenplay glossed over much of the Rickman's characters humanity.  Leaving the final outcome of his story arc vague, cause god forbid we leave the movie hating one of the main characters.  If you're going to waste time creating tension only to keep us in the dark in the end don't waste my time.<p>In the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a wholly frustrating and equally a great film.  It's chock full of funny characters, silly romance, tragic stories, and in the end it delivers a movie that is mostly worth watching.  <p>I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Bill Nighy's (Underworld) wonderfully silly Billy Mack, a character that is really funny if a tad bit unnecessary. He plays an aging rock musician who's re-written one of his classic tunes into a Christmas song.  Sure he's sold out, but he sure won't promote it as if he did.  If Oscar has a funny bone, this performance is worth a supporting actor nomination.<p>Listen if you can shut out the flaws, LOVE ACTUALLY will leave you satisfied.  If you're like me, then you like the movie with maybe a few too many reservations.  LOVE ACUTALLY is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a long time, and one of the best (if frustrating) movies of the year.<p>****1/2 (out of 5)</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>Twenty minutes into this movie, I laughed out loud. From that point on, I never stopped smiling.<br />It's now three days later and I haven't stopped smiling.<br />A movie you want to wrap your arms around and hug, "Love Actually" is an anthology of love stories involving over a dozen people set in modern pre-Christmas London.<br /><br />A woefully incomplete list:<br />Hugh Grant, the new young British PM, falls for his tea server. Newly widowed Liam Neeson bonds with his young stepson. The stepson is hopelessly smitten by a girl in his class named Joanna. Emma Thompson plays the PM's sister, married to Alan Rickman. He is disaffected with his home life, and is flirting with the idea of flirting with his secretary. Laura Linney works for Rickman, and has a crush on a co-worker, but her life is complicated by a mentally ill brother. Two adult film stand-ins develop a sweet relationship while hanging around nude and simulating sex so the film crew can set up for the real deal. The adult film directors' roommate heads to the U.S. because all U.S. women are hot, and they all want to have sex with English men.<br /> Supposedly.<br />Keira Knightly is a newlywed who discovers someone else may be drawn to her. Bill Nighy steals the film as an aged rock star, angling for the Number One spot on the charts. Writer Colin Firth obsessing about his new Portuguese housekeeper.<br /><br />Well, you KNOW how this movie is going to end. You really do. It's no surprise.<br />If it didn't end the way you THOUGHT it would, it would suck.<br />It's like music. You expect verse-chorus-verse, maybe a guitar solo here or some background vocals there, but the overall pattern is constant. It's the CONTENT that sets it apart.<br /><br />This film is SO funny, with so many loops and asides, you'll be giddy. It's smart and sweet and heartwarming, all in the best way without being sappy or cloying.<br /><br />This film is LOADED with uncredited guest stars. I won't spoil all the fun (there's at least a half dozen) but when the daughter from the TV show "24" showed up, I giggled. Get a load of the guy who plays the President of The United States. An absolute hoot.<br /><br />The soundtrack is astonishing. An absolutely perfect melding of pop songs/performances to situations. Eva Cassidy's 'Songbird" is appropriately aching. The Beach Boys "God Only Knows" soars. The movie ends with a Christmas pageant performance bringing many (if not all) of the characters together, and little Joanna brings down the house.<br /><br />While it is a romantic comedy, not every tale has a conventional or happy ending. Some are, yes, but others are bittersweet. Unrequited love. Familial love. The love between best friends, or old friends.<br />Puppy love, which if you think about it, may be the purest form of true love. You just like somebody, and you don't know or care why. You just do and that's it.<br />The love of sex. The love of possible sex. Love AFTER sex.<br />Love of parents, children, brothers, sisters, co-workers and colleagues; the love of cultures, of tradition, of language...<br /><br />So I guess the overall theme of the film really is just love, actually.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ.html">A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ</a><br/><p>there's a good version of A Y N I L but otherwise I found the movie to be pretty boring and slow. Just fast forwarded through it. Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Somehow when I rent a DVD &quot;starring&quot; Hugh Grant, I expect to see a lot of Hugh Grant.  Silly me!  In this ensemble effort, he is in just a few scenes, playing the Prime Minister of England who is inexplicably attracted to a foul-mouthed female assistant.  If that's not enough, there's a couple starring in a porn film who are too shy to even kiss on their first date.  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this movie can't decide if it's concentrating on its R rating or trying to be a feel-good movie.  It tries to do both and doesn't succeed very well in either effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>The cast, headed by Hugh Grant, was so promising that 5-10 minutes into the movie you figure the movie must have cost an arm and a leg to produce...<br /><br />Though funny at many points, the movie starts to get diluted very early in the game, with so many different plots, that you start "missing" characters until they come back much later into the movie. The biggest problem with this plethora of plots is that most of them are resolved quite poorly, or left unclear. Barely a couple of the stories kept me engaged all the way through, specially since so many of them had such a weird ending.<br /><br />As much expectation as we had for this chick flick, it turned out to be quite dissapointing. Save yourself the time and rent some other Hugh Grant movie. As for this one, definitely not his best or a good movie worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>This is an ensemble film with romance, comedy, and loose ends. I'll start off with the negatives.  There are simply too many stories going on at once to make a complete film.  There were plenty of moments when I was wondering what happened next in another sub-plot, side-story, whatever.  Also, there were a few scenes where I was shaking my head.  Then I realized that this is a movie, so I let it slide.  One such moment comes when a 10-year-old boy is running through the airport looking for his one true love, and he is being chased by at least 4 security guards.  At one point the guards are apparently running at top speed (a mere 4mph--excuse me, this is England--try 10kph) with the child blazing ahead of them at a jog.  I know, I know, it's a movie!  But scenes like that that made the film falter.  As for the positives, and there are a lot here, the ensemble acting is refreshing and very well done.  Two performances stood out for me.  Emma Thompson, as usual, is excellent, showing once more her wide range of emotions and able to spin around and change direction on a dime(okay, a schilling).  The other great performance here comes from Laura Linney, and her situation is truly heartbreaking.  She finds love, but circumstances and timing just don't allow the great possibilities to unfold.  I wanted to give her a hug.  There are many other, fairly believable scenarios between other characters, some of which take a turn toward Hollywood sensationalism.  But overall, the emotions, and the universal need to be loved is present in nearly every frame of this film.  As for that aspect, this film is remarkable.  There are many humorous situations, a few emotionally difficult character moments, but the end result is one of hope.  As I said before, there are simply too many plots going on for a complete film to be possible, leaving many frayed and/or loose ends like, &quot;What ever happened to that character?&quot;  But that alone should be dully noted.  Why would I have cared about those characters if they hadn't been rendered so convincingly?  There are some over-the-top Hollywood moments, but they are forgivable because the heart of this film is in the right place.  Thank you.</p></br></body></html>

In the majority of the cases with an age discrepancy, it is the man with a younger woman and not the other way around.  There are exceptions, of course, but this is accurate as a general rule.  "Something's Gotta Give" messes with that stereotype a little bit (and, unfortunately, only a little).  Harry (Jack Nicholson) is the older man.  He is a top executive at a record company and he is legendary for his propensity to date younger women.  He is also legendary for never having been married.  His current fling is with Marin (Amanda Peet).  She is the "younger woman".  Harry and Marin plan on spending a weekend together at Marin's mother's home.  The mother is supposed to be away for the weekend working on her new play.  <p>This means, of course, that Marin's mother will show up and complicate the weekend.  That is exactly what happens.  Marin's mother Erica (Diane Keaton) and her aunt Zoe (Frances McDormand) show up just as Harry is downstairs in the kitchen (wearing only a shirt and underpants) getting something to eat.  Naturally, the women freak out and are about to call the police on Harry when he is finally able to explain, with the help of Marin, who he is and why he is there.  They all decide to act like rational adults and all spend the weekend at the house, but to keep out of each other's business.  It wouldn't be much of a movie if that happened.  When Harry and Marin are starting to get frisky one night, Harry has a heart attack (he is a 63 year old man, after all).  They all rush to the hospital and his doctor, Julian (Keanu Reeves), helps save Harry.  Julian also insists that Harry cannot return to the city and will only let him leave the hospital if he has somewhere to stay.  Where might that be?  Erica's house.  Just as this happens, Marin and Zoe both leave and Erica is left to care for Harry, and she didn't even approve of him in the first place.  <p>This is the movie.  Erica and Harry begin as two people who do not really like each other and are certainly not interested in each other.  Erica finds Harry to be disgusting and Harry has never been attracted to a woman his own age (at least not since he was in his 20's).  Julian, on the other hand, is familiar with Erica's work as a playwright and he is attracted to Erica.  In this instance, we have a younger man falling for an older woman.  But...the movie is about Harry and his journey, so we know that Harry must get over his obsession with younger women and we know that he is going to start to become attracted to a woman his own age.  <p>On one hand, it is nice to see an older man begin to be attracted to an older woman, especially when he is giving up a younger woman (in this case, the older woman's daughter), but I started to care more about Erica's journey because we knew exactly where Harry was going to end up and I wanted something different.  This was a very standard (if well acted) movie that could very easily have given a twist to make "Something's Gotta Give" special.  Let's be honest, and I'll ask the women who are reading this: Ladies, would you rather have Jack or Keanu?  This movie could have been a whole lot more and could have really played with the convention and expectation that this movie was bringing, but it didn't.  At nearly every moment, we know how this film is going to play out, and I was hoping for more.  With that said, "Something's Gotta Give" is well acted, and well produced, but it is nothing out of the ordinary, either.<p>-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>Dianne Keaton and Jack Nicholson are on fire in this new romantic comedy.  Finally a movie has been made for the over 50 crowd.  Ironically it can appeal to anyone, not just seniors.  I had so much fun watching this film.  Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand, and Keany Reeves highlight the supporting cast.  The film may be a tad offensive to the older folks, but it is completely likeable.  Keaton reprised the Annie Hall type role once again, and Jack Nicholson plays a cooky Hugh Hefner type.  I applaud this film.  All Rom. Comedy film fans should see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>What's not to enjoy? The script has Snap!, Crackle!, and Pop! Also several moments of genuine tenderness as well as natural hilarity. As ably directed by Nancy Meyers whose previous work in What Women Want is also first-rate, the cast is excellent and  Diane Keaton's Academy Award nomination for best actress (as Erica Barry) in a leading role was well-deserved. I also expected a nomination for Jack Nicholson as Harry Sanborn. The supporting cast is also fine, notably Frances McDormand (Zoe Barry) and Keanu Reeves (Julian Mercer). The core situation is that the wealthy and charming Harry is dating (at least for the moment) Erica's daughter Marin (Amanda Peet) and accompanies her for a weekend in the Hamptons where her divorcee mother (a successful playwright) has a lovely oceanside home. Of course, Erica and her sister Zoe appear unexpectedly. <p>As a result of his hedonistic lifestyle, Harry suffers a heart attack unrelated to Erica. After emergency care by Julian, he is released but must reside nearby during the recovery period. Guess where? Of course, he and Erica fall in love. Meanwhile, prior to Harry's appearance in his life, Julian had become strongly attracted to Erica...not to her daughter. Apparently she has had no romance in her life since the divorce and is currently hard at work on a new play which is not going very well. Harry eventually becomes well enough to return to Manhattan. And then....<p>Eventually, both Harry and Erica must make very difficult choices. It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen this film to explain what those decisions prove to be. However, I feel free to say that the decisions are juxtaposed very effectively with various humorous incidents, a few of which are featured in the trailer shown in theaters. Yes, this is a comedy but it also has some attitude. On occasion, an edge. There are implications to the lives which the two seniors have led, prior to their meeting. The resolutions of various conflicts (both major and minor) are entirely plausible, except -- in my opinion -- for one which involves Erica and Julian. See this entertaining, sometimes serious film and then reach your own conclusions.  <p>The special features provided with the DVD include a "Commentary" by director Nancy Meyers, producer Bruce Brock, and actress Diane Keaton, another "Commentary" by director Nancy Meyers and actor Jack Nicholson, a "Hamptons House Set Tour" with Amanda Peet, and "Harry Sings Karaoke to Erica" (a deleted scene).  For whatever reasons, Keaton chose not to contribute much but Nicholson did and, as always, is charming, articulate, and generous. Contrary to his persona in so many films, Nicholson is renowned among his film colleagues for the same endearing qualities which are evident in one of the commentaries.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>I took my wife to this movie since it was her turn to pick one out (I was all up for seeing Lord of the Rings AGAIN!!).  I brought my Palm Pilot to keep me awake through this as I'm not big fan of romances, not even romantic comedies.<p>Well, the Palm Pilot never came out.  This was truly a wonderful movie to see.  It was funny.  The three stars are Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, and (surprisingly) Keanu Reeves.<p>Jack Nicholson plays an old man hot on the trail of younger women.  He meets Diane Keaton, his young girlfriend's mother, and develops a (somewhat strained) relationship after having a heart attack and being forced to recuperate at her house.  Keanu Reeves plays the Doctor (when he walked in I said, "Oh, no!!  Not Keanu Reeves playing a DOCTOR!!!!") that helps Jack recover, but also develops a love interest in Diane Keaton as well.  Okay, I'm not what you would call "a Keanu Reeves fan"... but he actually did a great job in this movie... except the parts he was playing a doctor.<p>Highly recommended.  Prepare to be entertained and have you laughing from start to finish.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Oh, it's so nice to see a mature romantic comedy today.  Great acting, superior script writing, and well-paced directing make this a must see film.  It's a surprise that this film got made at all.  Imagine, a film about people over 50 being sexually active and still seeking love.  I'm not talking 60+ Harrison Ford with anorexic 30-something "Alley McBeal" sexually active, but two people over 50 sexually active with each other.  In fact, both, I think, are actually in their sixties.  Hollywood is obssessed with either youth or the older man/younger woman relationship.  We rarely see young men with older women or two 50+ individuals in a romantic relationship.<br /><br />It's also wonderful to see mature women not embarrassed or ashamed of how they've aged.  Diane Keaton looked radiant in the film; I don't care what age she is.  There are many other actresses these days who have aged very gracefully and are still a pleasure to see on the silver screen.  Anne Archer, Meryl Streep, Debra Winger, and Goldie Hawn are just a handful that come to mind.  It's nice that Hollywood has continued to give these terrific actresses top billing instead of putting them out to pasture.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>I love Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton..Without too much explanations, they are simply two of the best actors/actresses of all time.<br />But watching Something's Gotta Give, I can not but feel sheer disappointment at the result that could have been far better with a tighter script and better director.<br />First of all the problem with the film is its length, over two hours long..<br />I never minded long films, (I sat through Bertoluccis's Novencetto more times that I can remember without being aware or bothering too much with its length)..But to sit through two hours of an overstretched story that is drenched in sugary sentimentality was tiring.<br />Moreover, the problem with the film is too many unnecessary characters. For instance the characters of Frances McDormand and Paul Michael Glazer, although credited as stars, were too shallow, appearing in a couple of scenes at most and added nothing to the plot.<br />Amanda's Peet character was also very badly written: we see here at first falling for the rich older guy without sleeping with him, inexplicably telling him when they arrived at her mother's house: are you glad we waited?? !!! Then towards the end of the film and in a space of six months,( movie time), we see her the image of domesticity, married and  three months pregnant!!<br />Keanu Reeves also inexplicably falls head over heels with Keaton's character, and their short romance is probably the lamest and most confusing I have seen in a film.<br />Now I have to mention few words about the acting of Nicholson and Keaton:<br />Nancy Meyers manages to get so much over the top acting from them, and fails miserably to get the right performances.<br />The scenes I cringed in the most are the ones we see them crying, probably intended to add some bittersweet humor, but it became overbearingly annoying.<br />When Nicholson cried at the very end of About Schmidt, I connected totally with him, and it was genuinely bittersweet because his tears reflected his whole story, his loneliness, frustration and tinge of hope for the future, in short they had deep meaning. In Something's Gotta Give, even for a comedy, it was totally pointless.<br />Yet I must say that there were few laughs in the first half of the movie, and some promise of a sweet romantic movie, unfortunately lost in the second half, ruining the whole film.<br />Having said all that, the only aspect of the film which I liked, was how refreshing to see people above sixty, falling in love and having sex..not many films have shown that.<br />I now must mention, maybe two trivial observations,that did not help this negative review.<br />The first is the issue of smoking..We see Keaton as an anti smoking healthy woman, but at the end she lights up!! Probably intended to reflect how she has lightened up..but it was a very wrong message to give (and this is coming from a smoker!!) it is time filmmakers take some responsibility in this very sensitive issue.<br />The other observation revolves around a scene when just before making love, Nicholson asks Keaton about birth control pills, and she naturally answers,no menopause!! Although it is kind of a funny dialog, she should have asked him instead whether he had a condom or not!! him being as it has been over emphasized,a sexually promiscuous man..again this would have been a good message to send at a time when sexual transmitted diseases and especially AIDS are still very much with us, and more so with straight people..<br />So Something's Gotta Give is a missed opportunity to take advantage of the wealth of talent involved, and a proof that excellent actors are not enough to make a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"Something's Gotta Give" is a much over hyped film that plays on the marketability of its two main stars, Jack Nicholson and Dianne Keaton.<br /><br />After watching trailers for this film, I was given the expectation of a witty, clever film.  Unfortunately, it is little of the sort.  The handful of amusing scenes or lines are in the trailer and the film itself drags slowly to a maudlin conclusion.  There are no high points.  The film simply encourages the view to keep checking to the time in the hope that a merciful end is close.<br /><br />Both Nicholson and Keaton are better actors than this film allows them to play.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Harry (Jack Nicholson) and his much younger girlfriend Marin (Amanda Peet) plan to spend a romantic weekend at Marin's family home in the Hamptons. But their plans go awry when Marin's mother Erica (Diane Keaton) and her aunt Zoe (Frances McDormand) show up unexpectedly. The couple is further foiled when Harry has a heart attack in Marin's arms. As Harry is unfit to travel, Erica reluctantly allows him to stay in her home while he recuperates.  Erica, who is an accomplished playwright and 50-something divorcee, and Harry, an aging confirmed bachelor who has always confined his romantic aspirations to women half Erica's age, find themselves both attracted to and repulsed by one another. And the friction between them may ignite an unexpected spark.<p>Let me first say that "Something's Gotta Give" elicited more laughs in the movie theater than any film in my memory. It's a good time at the movies. It's too bad that the movie runs too long and doesn't maintain its charm through the third act. It would be nice if the audience could leave the theater in as good a mood as they experienced for the first two-thirds of the movie. At about 2 hours long, "Something's Gotta Give" is too long for a romantic comedy. It has a few subplots and a few acts too many. The film is charming enough and paced well enough to overcome it, but a tighter script would have done wonders. And although most of the film is hilarious, it loses a lot of its charm and humor after the action moves from the Hamptons to New York city. <p>The comedy and romance in "Something's Gotta Give" are, of course, derived from the notion that women of a certain age have a terrible time finding suitable men because the desirable men in that demographic date much-younger women. That's funny stuff, but it often seems like writer/director Nancy Meyers is trying to do more than entertain. She waves the older-women-can't-get-dates and older-men-who-date-younger-women-are-scum flags a little too high. And the repeated assertion that both old and young women are somehow victims of these aging Casanovas is insulting and, dare I say, inaccurate. This is a comedy; why not simply see the humor in the situation? It would be fine if the film said nothing. But mixed messages are a nuisance. Harry is chided for constantly cavorting with younger women, while Erica is congratulated when she does approximately the same thing.  And why are these people so preoccupied with the age of their mates anyway? It's tiresome.<p>"Something's Gotta Give" is undeniably funny but far from perfect. Erica's neuroses wear thin after a while. Harry is lovable when he's  lecherous, but trying when he's earnest. The film is too long. I didn't for a moment believe that Harry and Erica were actually compatible, but romantic comedies are contrived by definition. But ultimately a comedy is required only to be funny in order to succeed. And two thirds of "Something's Gotta Give" is laugh-out-loud funny. Jack Nicholson deserves a lot of credit for being willing to look like a fool -and an old fool at that. There's some terrific physical comedy. I like the decision to use brief nudity  for comic effect. And Keanu Reeves does a nice job as a very handsome doctor who pursues Erica. It would have been better if some of the clutter had been cleared out, but smart writing and no-holds-barred performances make "Something's Gotta Give" a funny and enjoyable film for just about everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>&quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot;, starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, is a great comedy release of 2003.  Its plot of a playright whose daughter falls in love with an older man, then later develops a relationship of her own with him, is great.  It has many creative hilarious scenes that keep audiences interested.  It gives new meaning of romance after age fifty.  The other added details, namely the characters' past, gives it the additional unique flavor.  Such interesting chain of events keep audience watching closely, always wondering what will happen next, especially through the numerous surprises.  Though a few scenes are unnecessarily repetative, audiences will never forget this.  Diane Keaton's Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated performance is outstanding.  Her presence alone gives the film the added viewing pleasure.  Her own sense of drama and humor is clearly pleasant.  Jack Nicholson is outstanding as he always is.  He proves that he plays the best characters the audiences love to hate.  This film is no exception.  All other actors, especially Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand, and Keanu Reeves, also offer quality performance.  &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; is a great romantic comedy for all ages to enjoy.  This is sure to please audiences for a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>To quote John Mellencamp, this "little ditty `bout Jack and Diane" called "Something's Gotta Give" is somewhat of a sleeper comedy nowadays but still managed to give Diane Keaton a Golden Globe for Best Actress (as well as an Academy Award nomination) in 2004.  Co-star Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Golden Globe as well for his performance and these are two of the best reasons to watch the film.<br /><br />Keaton is Erica Barry, a divorcee and accomplished playwright who decides to spend some time at her beach house in the summer with her sister Zoe (McDormand).  When she arrives, she is shocked to find a man digging around in her fridge, clothed only in his oxford shirt, boxers and dress socks.  With Erica threatening to phone the police, the man quickly introduces himself as Harry Sanborn (Nicholson) and explains that he is there with her daughter Marin (Peete) for the weekend.  Embarrassed that he has been caught in his skivvies, he insists that he will leave but Zoe pipes in, suggesting that all four of them spend some quality time.  This is where the fun begins.<br /><br />Over dinner that evening, Erica quickly learns that Harry is a chauvinistic playboy, Marin another notch on the belt of his quest to desperately cling to his youth.  Harry senses Erica's disdain not only for his capricious behavior but also her disapproval of his relationship with Marin and reciprocates the hostility, quite certain that they will not get along no matter what happens.  What neither of them bank on is keeping up the venomous front for several weeks while Harry recovers from a heart attack he suffers that night.<br /><br />At the urging of his doctor Julian Mercer (Reeves), Harry recuperates close to the hospital, Erica reluctantly providing hospice.  Born out of what is at first an irksome period is a surprising camaraderie and eventual love affair, one that turns Erica's world upside down.  Aside from her exhilarating dalliances with Harry, she is simultaneously squired by the handsome Julian, a man nearly half her age.  Erica's once ho-hum life is thrown into an emotional upheaval, her heart quickly set aflame and just as quickly extinguished by the wayward Harry.  Not one to let a broken heart disrupt her life completely, she uses her romantic foibles as the primary tool for penning another successful play, one which more or less tells the entire story of her brief romance.<br /><br />Screenwriter and director Nancy Meyers wrote the parts of Erica and Harry with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson specifically in mind to play them and they are smart casting choices indeed.  The best pairing since Nicholson himself and Shirley MacLaine in 1983's "Terms of Endearment", Erica and Harry are that couple least likely to succeed but when they fall for one another they fall harder than one would care to predict, despite their vastly different personalities and ideals.  Keaton prevails with the comedic timing she possesses in spades whilst Nicholson is the wry and strangely sexy older man that he's so fond of playing.  Reeves, normally armed with the dramatic prowess of knotty pine, is surprisingly looser and warmer here, the most natural and enjoyable performance I've ever seen; for such a minor role, it's without a doubt his best so far.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's obvious at first glance what the film's strong suits are (screenplay and lead actors) and both are in top form here.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a reason not to see two film veterans at the top of their game in one of the better romantic comedies of 2003.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>One of the most embracive comedy-dramas I've ever gotten to see. I don't know why I ordered this from Columbia House (it was 25ish bucks at the time) but I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />I can't say enough about it because it has an all-star cast (Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Keanu Reeves (sexy doctor) and Amanda Peet was the love-starved daughter of Diane's.<br /><br />The love in this movie was so misdirected. Amanda's character fell for Jack's and soon, Jack's fell for Diane's. For the longest she kept her guard up and refused to date him cause she was her daughter's ex (very good, Diane) but she gives in.<br /><br />And takes happiness by the ears and has a little fun. They live in one of the nicest beach houses you could possibly imagine, that looks down on the sandy beach.<br /><br />Jack has this heart issue and when he's overactive or having sex, it tends to act up. Amanda and Diane are at his side at the hospital when he has a heart attack but then he recovers.<br /><br />Diane and Jack are soul mates but they don't even know it till the very end. This movie is charming to a tee, very witty and smart. A little sexy is thrown in for good measure also. You get to see Diane naked (Ew) and Jack's but too (Funny).<br /><br />Cover Art: C<br />Story: B+<br />Characters: A<br />Length: B<br />Overall: B+<br /><br />4.1 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Something's Gotta Give directed by Nancy Meyers isn't her best film but nonetheless, this romantic comedy is quite enjoyable. Starring Diane Keaton, Jack Nicolson, Amanda Peet, and Keanu Reeves Something's Gotta Give is a breezy romp about love at any age. The cast is full of enthusaism and Keaton was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for her performance as Erica, a successful playwright but lacking a healthy love life. Ultimately love blooms for Erica in the form of her attractive daughter's much older beau. This isn't a perfect film, but Something's Gotta Give will give you a few chuckles here in there.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this film from start to finish. Jack Nicolson shines and Diane Keaton is great. The soty is good about a man in his 60's who dates younger women about half his age, he then has a heart attack and falls for the women he's dating's mother. The film is great and shows what love really is and shows the reality on life. The last 20 min of the movie is a little slow but other then that it's hallariouse and fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>I just can't remember laughing so much at a recent movie!<p>I was prepared for a slightly-deranged, lecherous, self-absorbed Jack Nicholson.

She's a sweetheart, right?<p>I wasn't prepared for the flat-out laugh-out-loud humor, irony, and wit of this charming comedy! Just so much fun...my wife and I were still chuckling as we walked out of the theater into the parking lot.<p>I suspect that all baby boomers will get a big kick out of seeing this film - at home or in the theater! A terrific entertainment value.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>I don't know if it's fair to call this movie a chick flick. It can be considered so every bit as much as Mel Gibson's "What Women Want": it is a chick flick with a twist, where the chauvinistic "highly coveted" bachelor is redempted from his world... well, sorta!<p>The movie is quite predictable: there are some sex scenes; romantic moments with french music, wine and the beach, and tales of heartbreak and reconciliation. For such a repeated plot, you probably wouldn't give the movie too much credit, but except for a few moments, the movie is actually saved by the performances of the two leads, mostly Diane Keaton, who played a brilliant part that will make you laugh real hard.<p>I don't think it's "the worse movie ever" or some other categorizations it's received like that, but there are far better movies (and stories) out there (if you want to dig into the theme, do pick up the Gibson flick I mentioned earlier -you're bound to like it even more). Overall, I give it 3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Ya gotta love Jack. Sit back and enjoy professional entertainment deliver some laughs.

Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are both fine actors, and they both play their parts as best they could, and the storyline moves at a good pace as their two characters, clear opposites, start to form a crazy bond all it's own. The film has some great lines in this first act, ("The woman wears turtlenecks in the summer for crying out loud!") but at the hour-mark things go downhill from there, as the script takes an excellent set-up and destroys it due to terrible writing.<br /><br />The biggest offender was the play subplot. It had no purpose. It didn't build on the plot, it delayed it. It didn't change anything between Jack and Diane that hadn't already been set up in the previous scene. It's just there. It's like that guy staring at the camera in the very back of a family photo, acting like he's part of something he's not. It's the myesterious fourth act stuck between the second and third. Bottom line: it was unecessary, and if any one had handed me the script in pre-production I would have taken a big red marker and crossed out every page dealing with that subplot.<br /><br />The other big offender was the ending itself. Diane Keaton dumps Keanu Reeves for Jack Nicholson. And no, it's not a shallow thing, the Diane and Keanu character get along just fine and you feel better chemistry with them than you ever do with Diane and Jack. It was basically the writers copping out having a unique and different ending and simply saying, "Oh wait! We're making a romantic comedy. We have to have the characters get back together after twenty minutes of breaking up as per according to the official Cliche Rule Book." So enjoy as Diane dumps the perfect love interest for your average grumpy old man. I don't know any woman who would do that - and even the women watching this with me said, "Why would you go back to him?"<br /><br />So should you see this? No.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Marin Barry (Amanda Peet), a 20 something, is dating Harry Sanborn (jack Nicholson), a 60 something.

He recovers in the hospital under the care of Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves), a 30 something--who is immediately attracted to Erica. Harry wants to leave the hospital--but the doctor will only let him go if he stays a weeks at Erica's beach house. Erica hates Harry, but agrees. Naturally they become attracted to each other...but the doctor is also attracted to Erica. Sometimes hilarious and romantic complications ensue.<br /><br />This movie took me by surprise, I wasn't sure if I could handle watching old actors getting it on but this movie turned out to be a great romantic comedy. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton always give their 100% best in their performances, they did a great job in their roles. It would have been nice to see more input from Frances McDormand and Keanu Reeves, but otherwise I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />The movie has problems--it's WAY too long (there are at least 5 times I thought it was ending) and I HATED the ending. I won't give it away but Keaton ended up with the wrong guy! It's a quick turn around at the end that I just couldn't swallow.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>Surprisingly good romantic comedy focusing on older people.  Who'd of thunk? lol<br /><br />Most likely the best rom com of its year.<br /><br />Tale centers on a man close to 60, played by Jack Nicholasan, who has a thing for young women, finding that they don't have "baggage", as he puts it.  One of the girls he dates, Amanda Peet (i.e. from cancelled TV show JACK & JILL and a host of other feature films), takes him to a family summer cottage where he meets Peet's character's mother played by, wait for it, Diane Keaton.  Story then focuses on the two of them getting together, breaking up and taking a long and twisted road before he "gets it".  Also look for Keanu Reeves as the love interest of Keaton and the Frances McDormand (known as the leading lady in FARGO) as Keaton's hippy oh so feminist sister.<br /><br />Keaton was nominated by the AA for best actress but did not win it.  She did win it in the Golden Globes though.<br /><br />Excellent interweaving of music, especially with Maroon 5's SUNDAY MORNING which focuses on healing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Romantic comedy with stellar cast.

Nicholson falls for her, too. Keaton is in the enviable position of having 2 men, who have maybe a 25 year age gap between them, salivating over her.<br /><br />The scenes of the developing relationship, including a nude scene for Keaton and a bare-butt scene for Nicholson, are marvelous fun and quite believable.<br /><br />The there are detractions. Frances McDormand's talents are wasted in a role as Keaton's sister, a role that is far too small for her. Reeves' role is understated, gentlemanly - and ultimately unbelievable. Not unbelievable in terms of a man falling for a woman 15+ years his senior, but unbelievable in terms of the minimal emotional range he brings to his performance.<br /><br />But the best part by far is the fact that this romantic comedy doesn't deal with the foibles of 20-30yo actors; it focuses with truth and affection on the foibles of a 'mature couple.'<br /><br />Great theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>This is a fun and cute comedy with a great cast and beautiful scenery, but it drags on WAY too long, and ultimately ends up as an unmemorable waste of 2 plus hours. I know I would have liked it more had it been about 20 minutes shorter. Either way, this is worth seeing for fans of Diane Keaton, who just sparkles. Jack Nicholson is his usual self, but I LOVE Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand, who unfortunately, aren't given much to do. Keanu Reeves is less irritating than in his other films and luckily, has a small role. I'm glad I saw this, but it is way overhyped by critics. The usual formulaic Hollywood romance, only this time, the ones who fall in love are old.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This was a so-so romance comedy. It is certainly not my favorite genre. I have liked many of Jack Nicholson's movies, but my wife has not (excepting &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;, which Nicholson shows a lot of the same acting in this movie). Nothing great, nothing bad, very predictable, everyone is well-mannered, etc. Just too blah for me.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>This movie seemd like one Hollywood Cliche after another.  I thought Diane Keaton looked great, and one can never get enough of Jack Nicholson misbehaving.  However, Keaton's character is the typical older woman who is bitter and resentful of men her age who show interest only in the younger woman. Her character never shows any such resentment towards those younger women themselves, nor does she acknowledge that she has actually raised a daughter who has turned into one of those younger women dating an older man. That sort of irony seems to be lost on Keaton's character. Perhaps she might admit, also, that if she had made better decisions about men when she was younger then she wouldn't be alone when she was older. Or perhaps the movie should just preach a tad bit less about how men are evil for liking younger women but how there's not a single thing wrong with younger women liking older men. These types of romantic comedies, and by type I mean totally unrealistic, idealistic misrepresentations, do more harm than good because they further exacerbate the already hugely problematic and offensive belief that anything wrong that's ever been done has been done so by a man.  There were a few funny lines and themes such as when Nicholson's character was in the hospital discussing Viagra, but this movie could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>Diane Keaton is outstanding in her lead role in this movie. Jack Nicholson is hysterical. I laughed through out the entire movie.<br />Its wonderful to see a fun, romantic comedy where the actors are mature adults. No kid stuff here, this is a comedy anyone over 35 can relate to and appreciate. My favorite scene is Diane's crying scene - which is still hysterically funny. A great fun movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>We all remember Annie Hall, but somehow in the intervening years Diane Keaton has become a very sexy lady. Her goofiness, which seemed just goofy when young, is quite endearing in a 50-something woman. Nicholson is charming but I'm not sure I saw the "thing" that made ooddles of women fall for him. Frankly, Erica, I think you made a mistake--as a 50-something myself I'd have gone with the doctor any day!</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Let's see: Erica Berry (played full out by Diane Keaton in a role to die for) is a successful playwright with a beautiful daughter (Amanda Peet) and at least one very fine bosom buddy (Frances McDormand).  Along comes Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson, 66) in his PJ's or underwear-I forget which--to be discovered behind the opened door of her refrigerator ("Boy Meets Girl--Cute," as they say in Hollywood).  Turns out he is dating her twenysomething daughter Marin.  Well, gee, what a guy.<br /><br />However daughter and man about town have not yet consummated their relationship; indeed when they try, Viagra Harry has a heart attack.  And now the plot thickens.  Enter handsome, dashing, young and very eligible Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) who tells Harry that he can't go anywhere yet because they need to keep a close watch on his heart.  So Erica ends up babysitting him.  Ah, yes we can see where this one is going.  Playboy of the Western World finally but finally gives up the young stuff, meets the love of his life (Erica), and falls clumsily, but hopelessly in love with her.<br /><br />For Erica, who hasn't felt a man's touch for lo these many years, it's like electrifying.  Ah, but here's the rub.  The old bachelor can't comprehend his feelings.  After all he has never but never dated anyone over thirty before, and the prospect of COMMITMENT is way scary.  So he demurs, shall we say.  Meanwhile, the dashing young doctor reveals his romantic and clearly carnal interest in--no, NOT the beautiful young daughter!  How prosaic would that be?  No, he reveals he has quite a yen for the great playwright herself, and age does not matter in the slightest!<br /><br />Okay, at this point if I were a woman of any age I would say that my cup doth runneth over.  I would also suspect that this Fantasyland is a bit much for belief.  But hey, why should the starlets have all the fun?<br /><br />Anyway, Nancy Meyers's direction of this self-authored fairytale will appeal to its targeted audience no doubt, but don't try to screen this for your boyfriend.  He won't survive the first reel.<br /><br />Incidentally, this flick is not even in the same league as the somewhat similar romantic comedy, As Good As It Gets (1997) starring Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, which I recommend that you see instead.  Jack and Diane give it their best here-and Keaton is very good--but the lame and cloying script defeats their efforts.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>'Something's Gotta Give' purports to be a comedy and romance that mixes two opposites that eventually attract.

Comfortable in her static, routine existence, surrounded by her characters, living her life vicariously through them at times, Keaton seems blissfully unaware of her own appeal. (Typical to any Keaton character, which is likely part of her basic charm.)<br /><br />Keaton and Nicholson have a battle of wits, a battle of charms and an ultimate battle of hearts (notwithstanding Nicholson's heart attack about mid movie.)<br /><br />In the closing minutes, the question is looming... will they or won't they? And I won't spoil it... you'll have to watch it to find out.<br /><br />but I will say this... the movie is satisfying in its conclusion and is remarkable throughout.

Diane Keaton portrayed Erica Barry, a famous playwright who has been divorced for a few years and never thought she would be involved with another man again.<br /><br />Sanborn is dating much younger Marin Barry (Amanda Peet), Erica's daughter, and the two opt for two days of nooky at her mother's house in The Hamptons.  When Erica and her other daughter stumble upon Sanborn in his boxers raiding the fridge, they're surprised to learn that this much older guy is Marin's boyfriend.  Thus begins the adventure.<br /><br />After Harry and Marin go into the bedroom for a little fun, Harry suffers a heart attack.  He's ordered to take it easy for a while and his doctor, Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) orders him to stay in the vicinity of the hospital in order to keep tabs on him.  Erica's house just so happens to be in the vicinity.<br /><br />While Marin enjoys the nightlife, Harry recoups at her mother's house and, while sitting around, has nothing better to do than strike up conversation with Erica.  They discover they are curious to know more about the other but just won't admit to it.  The daughter sees the chemistry and gets out of the way (although she realizes that Harry broke up with her and not the other way around).<br /><br />In the meantime, much younger Dr. Mercer takes an interest in Erica and she goes from a lonely divorcee to an older woman in the middle of two mens' affection (and I think Reeves was charming in his role).<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I was thrown for a loop when it seemed that Harry and Erica were getting along great and then, boom, she's all of a sudden pissed at him because she sees him in a restaurant with another woman (whom he, typically, refers to as a "friend").<br /><br />He admits that he's not a good "boyfriend" and Erica is devastated.  She channels her hurt by sobbing uncontrollably and completing her autobiographical play, basing it on her experiences with Harry - which he doesn't find out about until a (young) actress he's wining and dining explains the premise.  Feeling insulted, he confronts Erica, explaining that "...schmucks are people, too" and she wants to go forward as friends.<br /><br />Fast forward: Harry retires to the Caribbean for a whole 2 weeks and seeks out his former girlfriends who inform him what kind of a jerk he's been to them.  He travels the farthest to Paris to see Erica (remembering her favorite resturant there) and just when you think they might end up together, in comes Dr. Mercer who proposes.  Erica accepts and one thinks that they may end up together and leave Harry in the cold.  Not so.<br /><br />How Dr. Mercer got out of the way was a little too easy (more conflict?) but Harry and Erica wound up together (and married) after all.<br /><br />And Diane Keaton parle fran?ais tr&egrave;s bien (and from what I could hear on my TV, Jack ain't too shabby himself).<br /><br />Refreshing premise that proves women aren't obliged to sit at home and roll up into a ball for the remainder of eternity just because they're over 25.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Diane Keaton plays a divorcee who finds love in the strangest of places: with her daughter's 60-something boyfriend (Jack Nicholson), a self-proclaimed playboy who's never had a serious relationship in his life.  The dynamic that makes this movie even more interesting is that both Keaton and Nicholson seem to be playing themselves on screen, or at least they're playing the characters that the media has made them out to be in real life.<br /><br />"Something's Gotta Give" is a wonderful love story that will have you laughing from start to finish.  Nicholson and Keaton have great chemistry, and supporting cast members Frances McDormand and Amanda Peet are fabulous as well.  Keanu Reeves also has a supporting role as a love interest of Keaton's, and he does a fine job (I realize that might be hard for you to believe, but it's the truth).

The film is a romantic comedy about Harry Sanborn (Mr. Nicholson), a 63-year-old playboy who is infamous for never having been married.  Harry has a penchant for women half his age and the film opens with him driving to the Hamptons home of 30-year-old Marin (Amanda Peet).  Marin's mother is a famous playwright, Erica Barry (Ms. Keaton) who is not supposed home.  While Harry is in the kitchen, Erica &amp; her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand) come into the house and mistake him for an intruder.  When Erica finds out he is dating her daughter, she immediately dislikes Harry.  While engaged in some foreplay with Marin, Harry suffers a mild heart attack and is rushed to hospital.  The scene of Harry being taken in on a gurney will be repeated several times throughout the film.  The attending physician, Dr. Julian Mercer, turns out to be a big fan of Erica's and asks her out to dinner.  Harry is forced to recuperate at Erica's house and sparks fly between the two and they end up sleeping together.  The romance doesn't last as Harry is not the commitment type and Erica is heartbroken.  The play Erica is writing ends up to be about the their relationship and it is a smash hit and Erica ends up with Julian.  Harry has second thoughts about the relationship and eventually tracks Erica down to Paris where she is with Julian.  In the end, Erica &amp; Harry end up together with Marin being married and having a baby.  Ms. Keaton won a great deal of praise for her role including winning a Golden Globe and garnering an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.  While Ms. Keaton is good in her role, her character seems a bit too whiny.  The premise of the movie is supposed to be that middle-aged woman are desirable as they have strength, smarts and looks even though middle-aged men overlook them for younger women.  Ms. Keaton comes off as flighty and emotionally high strung that puts her against the premises.  Her relationship with the much younger doctor is the retort to Harry's dalliances with younger women, but it doesn't seem to be a believable relationship.  Mr. Nicholson is perfect in his role, as he is essentially playing a character he has played numerous times.  Ms. Peet is also quite good as is Ms. McDormand in a under utilized part.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>SGG is an enjoyable movie. Nicholson and Keaton make a nice couple, but I dont think Keaton deserved an Oscar no. The movie is a little long, but it's a fun romantic comedy...esepcially for the older folks.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Oscar nominee Diane Keaton stars with her old friend Jack Nicholson in the film about learning to play with kids your own age. A test disc looked fine despite speckles here and there. Audio was just OK. Director Nancy Meyers does separate commentary tracks with her two stars. Keaton doesn't start talking until 40 minutes into the movie (until her brief nude scene has safely passed). "That's a fiction!" Keaton says at one point, as her character walks toward the camera, gorgeous and dressed to kill. "It is you -- there are no special effects," Meyers assures the famously shy actress. Fans of Keaton and Nicholson will get a kick out of comparing the actors' comments about their extended lovemaking scene. Keaton talks mostly about how embarrassed she was -- Nicholson is so precise about the acting techniques he used it seems as if he's pulling our legs.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>There's a great scene on the beach between Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, which seems almost improvised, where they talk about his reputation for non-commitment and her supposed non-date with his doctor. Ironically it feels like a scene from "Annie Hall", and this mostly charming movie could have done with more seemingly spontaneous moments like this. But director/screenwriter Nancy Meyers ("What Women Want", the "Parent Trap" remake) is borne out of the packaged Hollywood filmmaking that finds double-takes and double-entendres suitable replacements for insightful wit in a formulaic romantic comedy. Luckily, as embodied by the two veteran actors, the characters do not come off as menopausal stereotypes like some pre-"Golden Pond", sunset-gazing couple. True, there are some serious sitcom lapses in Meyers' script, and it does lack the uniquely quirky perspective of a James Brooks in the similar feeling "As Good As it Gets". For the most part, however, this is quite a step up for Meyers, a refreshing look at the emotional complications that come with love among the more mature set. What is particularly nice is how sex is treated as an emotional release rather than just an act of pure passion.<br /><br />Nicholson plays womanizing record producer Harry Sanborn like most of his late-career roles, i.e., with a sense of eye-rolling panache that somehow gets dismantled when his character reveals too much of his vulnerability. It's probably the unsurprising aspect of his acting that allows Keaton to steal the movie from him. Looking svelte and unapologetic for her age, she brings a lovely sense of gravity to her role of successful playwright Erica Barry, a familiar type who lives in a Pottery Barn-furnished world and has rationalized love out of her life. Keaton has a great honest moment when her character reveals her true feelings outside the restaurant where she catches him on a date after their own tryst. The film somehow loses footing after this scene, as this last portion feels like the story is marking time until the plot strands eventually sort themselves out to the inevitable ending.<br /><br />The film looks good in a "Metropolitan Home" sort of way, and the supporting cast is quite capable and serviceable. Keanu Reeves is surprisingly believable as the lovelorn doctor smitten with Keaton's character, but he is given short shrift by the script and comes off ultimately as a plot device. On the other hand, Amanda Peet comes across as alternately bright and flighty, a fetching combination, as Erica's daughter. Sadly underutilized as usual, Frances McDormand steals all her scenes as Erica's sister. Someday she will hopefully repeat her success with "Fargo" and get a meatier role deserving of her smart talent and saucy sense of humor. And even more hopefully, perhaps this movie will provide a springboard for other older-skewed romantic comedies given our country's aging demographics...but who am I kidding?</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>After watching this movie after two years of procrastination, I asked myself why did I wait for two years to find such a gem.  If you are a fan of "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless in Seattle", then, you probably know what to expect on this one.  To make a subtle comedy romantic movie isn't easy because the storyline has got to be good, the cast needs to have chemistry, their comic timing has got to be impeccable, and the scripts need to be tight. I have to say that other than minor glitches, this movie simply breezes through.  What other reviewers said about underutilising Frances McDormand, Keanu Reeves, Amanda Peet is true but what bothers me more is that whilst all efforts are made to ensure that Jack's and Diane's characters are as wholesome as possible, Keanu's character seems to be a cookie cutter character with a rather two dimension perspective.  Whilst the ending is what all dreamers like you and I are wanting, right in the snowy night in Paris, and that they all live happily ever after, I find it too formulaic and too good to be true.  Still, the journey heading to the final destination is such a joy to watch.  There are elements in this movie that reminds me fondly of "The Producers" which is now to be converted into a movie medium.  I find the DVD great with two versions of commentary, one with the main cast and the other with the Director and Producer who are covering the dryer and technical aspect of the movie.  The commentary of the cast commenting upon some of their funnier moments in the making of the movie is hillarious and funny for its own sake.  Well, don't miss this one like I did.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Diane Keaton- I just love her! She is a fabulous actress who is able to take the screen as her own, and then slink off and we miss her.  Jack Nicholson is a superb actor who is bigger than life and knows it. He owns the screen.<br /><br />In "Something's Gotta Give" Jack plays a record producer who is always dating younger women. That seems to be Jack's persona. One of the young women he is dating is Diane Keaston's daughter. Diane is about to visit her daughter, at the same time that Jack is having a heart attack in the daughter's apartment. Diane and her daughter bring Jack to the hospital. and worry and fuss over him. For some inexplicable reason, Jack goes to Diane's beach home to recuperate.  Diane is a writer and is having some difficulty getting her story together. She and Jack share some time together, walk the beach, have some truthful moments. One night their romantic intentions turn into sexual love. Diane falls in love. Jack falls a little bit in love, but doesn't want this attachment.  They play cat and mouse for a year or two. Diane runs into Jack when he is with other woman. Jack finds he is having anxiety attacks that mask as chest pain and is at the local Emergency Department  every week. He receives advice that he should relax, take it easy. He sells his business and goes to the Caribbean, where he discovers after one day that he needs more in life. He does s a strange thing; he visits every woman he has ever had in his life. Most of these women slam their doors in his face. However, one or two tell him what life was like with him, and he listens.  Jack learns that he needs someone in his life, and he wants Diane, He follows her to Paris, where she is celebrating her birthday with another man. He braves the storm and wishes her well.  You know the rest- eventually they find each other, and fall madly in love.<br /><br />This is a romantic comedy that has many true moments. Most of the characters in the movie are overlooked for the two giants Jack and Diane, however, that is another movie. It is a great chick flick; more of a women's movie. Entertaining and fun. I saw this on a chilly autumn afternoon, with a roaring fire and hot chocolate- a perfect end to a perfect day.<br />Highly recommended. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>I admit that "Something's Gotta Give" [not a great title!] was not on my must-see list. Now, having seem it, it is my must own DVD list. While its stars, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, are two of my all-time favorites, most recent romantic comedies have not been original, funny or, for that matter, particularly romantic. While the only thing in the least original about the movie is the fact that the leads are practically senior citizens, it is outrageously funny and extraordinarily romantic. <p>Harry [Nicholson] is a dedicated playboy who always dates young women. The sad thing is that he is now 63, perilously close to being old enough to be some of his girlfriends' grandfather. One summer day his latest flame, Marin [Amanda Peet], takes him on a weekend outing to her mother's beach house in The Hamptons. The couple is surprised to find that Erica [Keaton], the mom, is also visiting. Erica is a famous playwright. She writes romantic comedies, but, being 57 and divorced, she long ago gave up on falling in love again herself. Suddenly, Harry has a heart attack. The attending physician, Dr. Meyer [Keanu Reeves], suggests that Harry stay at Erica's house for awhile until he is strong enough to go back to New York. It turns out that Meyer has a thing for older women, and he begins to pursue Erica. Meanwhile, Harry's brush with death is causing him to rethink his life [maybe older ain't so bad], while Meyer is forcing Erica to rethink hers [maybe younger is the answer]. The ultimate solution to this love triangle is predictable, but the getting there is great fun. <p>Director/writer Nancy Meyers, herself 54, has written a mature, witty, sophisticated screenplay, but I think she herself knows that it is the magnetism of Keaton and Nicholson that makes the movie such a great success. [Interesting note: In real life the two once were lovers] The supporting cast is excellent and includes Amanda Peet Jon Favreau  and Frances McDormand.] <p>If there is a problem with the movie, it is that it may be somewhat too sophisticated for today's mainstream audiences and critics. It has a very French feel to it, which is perhaps why the ending takes place in Paris.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>I really like the aging Diane Keaton ever so much more than I did the Annie Hall-ish, squirley younger Keaton with her annoying mannerisms. She is at her best in this laugh out loud (and sob out loud, as well) film. In fact, "Something's Gotta Give" is also a superb vehicle for the talent of Jack Nicholson. Were Keaton and Nicholson ever a real-life couple? I ask because there is such chemistry at work between the two!<br /><br />Real life--yes, that area where older men--wrinkled, weightier, and richer, date young women who still have dew on their skins. As Amanda Peet's character reminds him: "You don't date women over 30." The older (and larger) he is, the sillier he looks with these women. And intimacy? Do those young women really--well, you know.<br /><br />Am I saying that older men are repugnant? No, of course not, but the movie itself makes my point. Where is the comfort level for a couple in a relationship? Where is a real sharing of life? With the couple of similar ages, similar life styles, similar experiences, or the relationship in which one is trying to stay young and the other is seeking what?--riches, a good time, what?<br /><br />Jack's character Harry has never been in love and finds himself in a dither concerning what it might mean for his life. Give up those under-30's? For a woman his age? The initial idea of kissing Erica's (Keaton) less dewy mouth makes his face screw all up. Enter Keanu Reeves, a doctor who treats Jack's heart attack and becomes part of the triangle. The doctor has long admired Erica's talent as a very successful playwright, thoroughly familiar with her work. He is smitten.<br /><br />Reversing the older man/younger woman scenario to older woman/younger man is quite interesting. Keaton plays it for all it's worth. Reeve is an excellent casting choice here in making this combination work. (But Demi and Ashton have already shown us that.)<br /><br />When Harry meets Erica at her house on the shore (outside New York), he is there with her daughter, one of those dewy younger women, for their first-time experience. A heart attack stops the action, setting up a scenario for him to get to know a woman his age. Their sex scene (which reveals very little) is one of the two funniest sex scenes I've ever seen. (The other was Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson trying to imitate early television scenes in which one foot is always on the floor.) The scene is also poignant.<br /><br />When Harry returns to the city, Keaton believes they actually have something. When she sees him out with one of the dew creatures, she is heart-broken. I sobbed with her for the next few scenes (and every time I watch the movie again). Enter the doctor to mend her broken heart.<br /><br />Paris is the scene of reconciliation. Ah, Paris, that city of romance. The one false note of the film is Keanu's reaction to Harry and Erica.<br /><br />"Something's Gotta Give" is an excellent film which addresses issues of an aging population seeking love. Romance? You bet! Reconciliation? Oh yes! But first, something's gotta give!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Diane Keaton gives the performance of her career in "Something's Gotta Give," writer/director Nancy Meyers' smart and savvy take on middle-age romance.  Keaton plays Erica Barry, a 50-something playwright living on her own in a swanky beach house in the Hamptons.  Although she has achieved enormous success in her career, her personal life leaves much to be desired.  Erica, though brilliant and attractive, has pretty much shut herself off from the dating scene since her divorce a number of years ago.  Erica's life runs like a well-oiled machine, with each element - both personal and professional - fitted neatly into place, with no room left over for spontaneity or passion.  One fateful day, Erica stumbles upon a strange man rummaging through her refrigerator, a 63 year-old professional bachelor named Harry Sanborn who, Erica discovers to her horror, is dating her 30 year-old daughter, Marin (Harry is, actually, a notorious bachelor, having been profiled as such in a number of tony New York magazines).  Even though Erica is disgusted by the situation, she is forced to take care of Harry after he suffers a heart attack while staying at her place.  Despite their diametrically opposed outlooks on love and romance, Erica and Harry spend quality time together, discover their ultimate compatibility, and eventually fall in love.<br /><br />Meyers has written a witty, sophisticated screenplay that offers insights into any number of "battle of the sexes" issues.  She has outrageous fun exploring the phenomenon of middle-aged men cavorting with women half their age.  Jack Nicholson, known in real life for doing just that, has a great time poking fun at his own public image while, at the same time, providing a richly textured portrait of a man who may not be quite as shallow as his persona would suggest.  When he so unexpectedly finds his head turned by a vibrant, attractive and intelligent woman in her 50's, Harry, a middle-aged Lothario who finds he needs Viagra to help him keep pace with his youthful "conquests," is forced to re-evaluate what has hitherto been the defining philosophy of his personality and lifestyle.  Nicholson is magnificent at showing us the profound confusion his character undergoes as he takes those much belated but faltering steps into adult maturity.<br /><br />Nicholson is, however, only one half of this extraordinary couple.  As the other half, Keaton, having been handed what is clearly the role of a lifetime, has never seemed so natural and self-assured on screen.  She makes of the character a capable, no-nonsense woman who has allowed her passions to lie dormant far too long.  Though, on the surface, she appears confident and in control of her life, Erica is, underneath it all, a woman wounded by past experience and intimidated by a culture that expects women to be put out to pasture the moment they reach middle age.  It is this combination of strength and vulnerability that makes Erica such a complex, recognizable individual - and it is the very quality that Keaton captures so exquisitely in her performance.  The chemistry generated between Keaton and Nicholson in this film is so glowing and palpable one wonders why no filmmaker ever saw the potential of this dynamic duo until now.<br /><br />In addition to these two outstanding performers, the film boasts excellent supporting work from Frances McDormand as Erica's pragmatic, clear-headed sister; Amanda Peet as Erica's level-headed daughter; and Keanu Reeves as Harry's handsome young doctor who finds himself smitten by Erica's mature beauty and charm.<br /><br />"Something's Gotta Give" is that rare romantic comedy that not only acknowledges the romantic inclinations of people over forty, but also recognizes the emotional complexities of their relationships.  Because both Erica and Harry have been around the block a few times, they bring a lifetime of baggage to their burgeoning attachment.  Thus, unlike in the vast majority of romantic comedies, which are clearly geared to the younger generation, the lovers here have a depth not often encountered when the focus is on two inexperienced neophytes.  It takes the experience that comes from living to make a person interesting, after all.<br /><br />Thanks to the quality of the writing and the performances, "Something's Gotta Give" takes its place among the great romantic comedy/dramas like "Two For the Road," "Annie Hall," "When Harry Met Sally" and "The American President."  That's mighty august company indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>The above title was taken from a revire I read somewhere in the Web, and I think it says it all. This movie is boring. It begins with a good premise, then everything goes down. And it's not funny at all. I don't know how it was advertised as a comedy. It's almost a total drama, with romantic obvious ending.<br /><br />The performances by everyone involved are great, and I was sorry that Paul Michael Glaser and Francis McDormand had so few time on screen. Keanu Reeves proved that there's life after his disastrous performances in both sequences of MATRIX (script's fault, not his, and Amanda Peet in very likeable as Keaton's daughter.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>"Something's Gotta Give" was directed by Nancy Meyers, who gave us "What Women Want." The common factor between the two films are that they are both about how men treat women. In this case, it is how an older man would treat a younger women, or vice versa. Or, that is how I thought of it as. Jack Nicolson and Diane Keaton star, and Keaton has a performace that is Oscar worthy all the way. I felt that way even before the nominations came out, and I still feel that way. I saw the film twice already, and have decided to voice my mind over it now. <p>Jack Nicolson stars as Harry Sandborn, the owner of a successful hip hop label, and a person who dates women under 30. The only thing is, he is 63. His newest girlfriend is Marin, and the two go off to her mothers beach house for the weekend. It is supposed to be empty, so the two are surprised when Marin's mother Erika, and her sister Zoe show up. Erika is a playwright who wants to come for the peace and quiet so that she could write. She instantly doesn't approve of her daughter's relationship with Harry. The four decide to stay at the house, untill Harry has a sudden heart attack. The doctor helping him, Julian Mercer, is a big fan of Erika's work. But when releasing Harry, he falls onto the ground, causing Julian to not let him travel for a couple of days. The only place for him to stay is the beach house, and that does not sit well with Erika. When Marin returns to work, Erika and Harry find themselves alone with each other, and complete opposites. But as they are alone, they relize that they have much more in common than they thought. And when Marin and Harry break up, romantic feelings begin to develop between Harry and Erika, but problems arise when it becomes clear that Julian wants to become involved with Erika, and Harry does not want to switch his lifestyle when it comes to women.<p>The only reason that I gave "Something's Gotta Give" four stars was because of the last few scenes. I don't want to ruin what happens, but I don't feel that it should have ended the way it did. It started as a great, orignal, hilarious comedy, and then by the end just became another one of those predictable comedies that stick with a formula. That's why I liked the beginning. It wasn't formula. But the end was. Although it only got four stars, I do consider "Something's Gotta Give" one of the most notable films of last year, and it was a good enough movie to see in the theatres, and see more then once. I really did like it, and Keaton should get an Oscar. This movie is fun from start to finish.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 sexual content, brief nudity and strong language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>I for one am very biased against romantic comedies. A vast majority of them are extremely predictable and go nowhere for me. While some of that does apply to &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot;, however the main characters however though give this film a more original twist. <p> Harry Sanborn is a 60 year old bachelor who never dates women over 30 years old and has fallen in love with another one...again except by this point he realizes he has been finding himself being attracted to someone who is in his age group (50+ years of ago) and this has started to make him think about his polygamous ways plus heart problems have plagued him. <p> He starts to realize that the older woman, a Playwright worker and he share a lot in common and Harry realizes that he has a choice to make. <p> This movie while stymied by some predictable elements, is a really smartly done movie in a lot of ways. No pun indended at all but many movies of this genre are focused on younger couples and this extremely formulaic pattern really ruins many movies in this category but SGG however steers clear of that by focusing on older characters. <p> In some ways this film was bothersome but it was because it reminded me of someone one of my relatives dated years ago before things went sour. <p> This is a great movie worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>In this story we find an older gentleman(Jack) who is dating a younger woman(Peet) and they go up to meet her mother(keaton).  Jack then goes onto have a heart attack and is hospitalized.  He then must stay at keaton's house until he is all better.  During this time we see loving blooming between Keaton and Jack.  And how the emotional rollercoaster is pushed into high gear by the end of the movie.<br /><br />  Jack and Keaton do an excellent job of acting in this movie.  Which makes it even better of a movie(as if these two actors couldn't of done that on their own).  A cute story about love is just right for almost any situation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>I saw Jack Nicholson's last hyped movie 'Whats the Matter with Harry' or something like that and I was disgusted ... what a dog of a film .... My fears that this would have been the end of that fabulous real life cartoon Nicholson character have been calmed when I saw his perfomance in Something's Gotta Give .... <p>What a pleasant and enjoyable light hearted film poking fun at our modern 'divorce' society. The acting is superb and, contrary to most of the DVD garbage out there today this is a movie that will brighten up whatever rainy and dreary Sunday afternoon that you decide to play it .....</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>Nancy Meyers (What Women Want) wrote and directed this charming romance starring Diane Keaton as a successful but lonely playwright and Jack Nicholson as a successful music producer who has never dated a woman over 30.  Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves handle their supporting roles quite well, though the storyline for their characters is not as well written, and Frances McDormand and Jon Favreau are terrific in their small parts but are, unfortunately, underused.<p>The true pleasure of the film lies in the interactions between Keaton and Nicholson, who make you appreciate what good acting is all about, even as they make it look easy.  They are terrific onscreen together.  The film holds together just fine until the last half hour, when the action moves to New York and becomes less intimate, and the ending is much too trite and tidy.  Nonetheless, I would recommend the film based on the first two-thirds, which are completely enjoyable.<p>The film can be heard in English or French, and can be subtitled in English, French or Spanish.  Extras include two commentary tracks -- one with Meyers, Keaton and producer Bruce Block, and one with Meyers and Nicholson.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I'm only 28, and yet I still really enjoyed and appreciated this film. Why? Because it's the first romantic comedy I've seen in a long time that I didn't find to be a complete insult to my intelligence. On a surface level, this film is about an aging playboy who's spent his life chasing youth and beauty, who inadvertently falls for the middle-aged, successful yet lonely mother of his current trophy girlfriend. However, beyond that premise, this film has lots to say about intimacy, romance, loneliness and love that I think people of any age can relate to. The script isn't perfect, but it is genuinely clever, thoughtful, and touching. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, both screen icons, give fantastic performances that carry the film. Diane Keaton is especially excellent: she has an amazing ability to display several complex emotions at once. All you need to do is look at her face to know exactly what her character is thinking and feeling. Overall, a smart and insightful comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is just what the season needs in the theaters - a bit of fluff with enough of a message to make it worthwhile.  FINALLY we're getting movies about women who are not only beautiful but are intelligent and definite candidates for the roles of desirable leading ladies.  Diane Keaton is a joy to watch - not only because she is beautiful but also because she is such an enormously gifted actor.  Yes, the director could have put the reigns on her 'post-transformation' crying at the loss of love; that does get tiresome.  But watch the way Keaton responds as a mother to Amanda Peet, as a sister to the always superb Frances McDormand, as a gradual paramour of an aging (well cast and well performed) Jack Nicholson, and as an incredulous recipient of the honest attractions of the younger Keanu Reeves.  In each mode of her role she is not only credible, she takes us with her on a wise (and wise-cracking) journey into new territory.<p>The openness of dealing with issues of the 'over 50 crowd' in career changes, love lost and love gained, and frank sexuality is such a relief from the norm and it is to the credit of Nancy Meyers that she continues to explore this realm (see "What Women Want").  Meyers manages to tell her tales of older romantic episodes without showing prejudice to either men or women.  <p>This is a well written (at least for the first 3/4s of the film) and well directed (ditto) funny yet tender comedy that shows off the talents of the five leads very well indeed.  While the critics continue to pan the acting abilities of Keanu Reeves, here is a film that allows him subtleties and promises of depth we have not seen before.  Well worth an afternoon's relief from the holiday madness.</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>I was pretty disappointed with this movie.  It was entertaining, but very contradictory.  You have Diane Keeton who plays Ericka a play write, who is pretty bitter about older men who seem to go for younger women.  Yet her own daughter who is in her early 30's is dating a man (Jack) who happens to be 63 years old!!  Harry is older, and is pretty commitment phobic, so he believes in dating and having fun.  Harry is also prone to lots of hospital visits due to his heart problems.  So Ericka's daughter decides to end her relationship with Harry because she spotted the chemistry between her mom and Harry.  Now knowing that Harry is such a commit phobe, you would think that Ericka would ignore Harry and enjoy the attention she is getting from Julian (Keanu's character) who is totally smitten with her.  No, she sleeps with Harry, it means a lot more to her, then it meant to him, and when he admits he only wants to be friends she spends a good deal of the movie crying.  Now the crying was okay the first few minutes, it was funny at first.  Then it got on my nerves !!!  Her heartbreak helps her complete her play she is writing, and Harry is the subject of her new play that becomes a hit.  Ericka's daughter is all upset her father is going to marry a woman who is only a few years older then her.  Do you see the irony?  Ericka goes to Paris, and Harry finally realizing he is in love with her goes to surprise her.  However, the surprise is on him when he realizes that Julian is with her.  The chemistry once again is evident, and Ericka goes after Harry.  I'm sorry, but Julian is so much cuter!!!! <p>I also have a feeling my age may have had something to do with why I did not enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would.  I'm 36 and the thought of dating someone 63 does not appeal to me.  If I were older, I would not be upset that men older prefer younger men. The other issue I had with the movie was this.  During the scene when Ericka and Harry was about to have sex, they mention birth control, but when she mentioned "menopause" all the sudden everything was GREAT.  Now I know this is a movie, but what about using a condom so you don't have to worry about the spread of STD's or HIV?  Sure she does not have to worry about pregnancy, but with Harry being so commitment phobic, I would be worried about getting HIV!!!!  So that part really disturbed me.  I would just go out with a younger man if he were attracted to me.  The movie was cute, the movie had some funny moments, but the movie was not all that great to me.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This movie is well cast and well acted; the cast headed up by Jack Nicholson, Keanu Reeves, and Diane Keaton does a splendid job which permits the viewer to develop a concern for the characters and a desire that all will work out well for each of them.<br /><br />There are a lot of laughs as well as touching situations to which many will be able to relate. The movie is well paced and seems to go by quickly. There is beautiful scenery which always contributes to the enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />Although funny and entertaining for mature adults I can in no wise recommend this movie for the entire family. It presents ideas and situations which are not suitable for children and does not promote high moral values.</p></br></body></html>

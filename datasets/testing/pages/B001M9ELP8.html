These fight scenes, most of them starring The Rock as a straight-arrow skip tracer, are at least devoted and energetic, more joyous than angry. It's jungle war, all right, but they're loving it. <p>The Rock is Beck, hired muscle for a loan shark looking to bring his son Travis (Seann William Scott) back from South America for reasons the movie never even cares to explain. Travis is a Stanford dropout and a treasure hunter; he is currently looking for a hidden, &quot;priceless&quot; aritifact called &quot;El Gato,&quot; which in Travis-speak translates to &quot;My Gato!&quot; As in &quot;You're not going to take me away from My Gato!&quot; This is before he's even found the Gato. <p>Travis seems to work for Hatcher (Christopher Walken) the Kurtz-like mayor of El Dorado, a gold-mining town. A barmaid (Rosario Dawson, on the 12th of her 15 minutes) has her own buried agenda. El Dorado is a mix of sadist soldiers (whips, chains, old Jeeps), kung-fu natives and a Scottish pilot (Ewen Bremner) given to drunken, biblical, incoherent stump speeches. &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and &quot;Romancing The Stone&quot; are influences, as are any of the hard whiskey movies of William Friedkin and Sam Peckinpah. <p>Amidst this, The Rock brings a dash of Schwarzenegger with him, a detached, comical disbelief that, one, he's in movies to begin with; and two, that anybody inside the movie even bothers to mess with him. Scott still tries to channel Jim Carrey, but he's beginning to settle on becoming a more gifted version of Ashton Kutcher. Berg, praise be, shoots and lights the film without any artistic flourishes: There are no washed-out skies, no sepia jungles, no cool blue interiors, no high contrast. It's bright, lucid, crisp. Doesn't seem like much, but the natural scenery is its own character because of it. <p>&quot;The Rundown&quot; aspires to escapist, Saturday matinee entertainment. It succeeds, although Rock-ogling aside, women will likely want nothing to do with this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>If you haven't seen &quot;The Rundown&quot;, you're probably wondering about how good it really is. Prior to viewing - what are your expectations? You can look at this movie in two ways: One - as a big blockbuster action flick with the WWF's &quot;The Rock&quot; and all kinds of incredible fight scenes, an incredible story, bombs going off, and the bad guys getting what they deserve. Or two, have no expectations at all. I feel that if you go into &quot;The Rundown&quot; with high expectations thinking Dwayne Johnson will be the next &quot;Terminator&quot;, &quot;Commando&quot;, or &quot;Predator&quot;... you might be let down. However, I went into this movie with NO expectations. I've never been a fan of the WWF and the only thing I've seen The Rock in was the &quot;Mummy Returns&quot; (and was unimpressed with him and his claymation double). I watched some of the behind-the-scenes features before the actual movie and was pleasantly surprised at the Rock's smarts, athleticism, (Hawaiian) charsima and sense of humor. I never knew the Rock was such a smart, let alone a funny guy. As for co-star Seann William Scott - he remained true to his other well known characters...a bit obnoxious and often funny at times. The other shock in this movie was director Peter Berg. I had no idea this guy could direct! I only remember Berg from Copland (&quot;Joey&quot;), and probably more so as Corky Romano's illiterate brother &quot;Paulie&quot;. Don't look for an incredible plot here; &quot;The Rundown&quot; is a very simple story. &quot;Beck&quot; (The Rock) is a &quot;Professional Retriever&quot; or bounty hunter. He wants to retire from the mobster for whom he works for and with his last big pay-off, open a restaurant where he can be the chef. The mobster's son &quot;Travis&quot; (Scott) is deep in the jungles of South America and is mixed up with some of the wrong people (namely &quot;Hatcher&quot;, played nicely by Christopher Walken). It's Beck's job to bring Travis back home to Los Angeles. The trip home is a long one and there's some great action, explosions, jeeps going off the road and the stars tumbling down a mountain side, fight scenes, monkeys going ape, etc. The opening scene (prior to Beck hitting the jungles) takes place in Los Angeles. Beck has to confront a football quarterback with a betting problem. As Beck walks into the night club he passes many people (one being Arnold Schwarzenegger in his shortest movie role ever). Beck finds the QB, but he's surrounded by his entire offensive line (and they're huge). The QB won't cooperate, and Beck whists thru these larger-than-life guys one by one while the strobe lights flicker and the music blazes... a great scene! Only thing out of reach in this movie was some of the stunts where you just knew the actors in the fight scenes were on &quot;wires&quot;. Sure, they were fun to watch, but you knew they were physically impossible - even for The Rock. Go into this movie expecting nothing and you'll get much more out of this movie. I was entertained... I found &quot;The Rundown&quot; had a good pace (I never looked down at my watch), plenty of action, great fights, some good stunts, and good dialogue between the characters (humorous and not).</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment makes their foray into the motion picture business with this action-adventure.  &quot;The Rock&quot; gives a pretty good performance as a bounty hunter who is tasked to bring back a family member (Seann William Scott) from an Amazon jungle.  The stunts are almost too good to be true.  The story almost falls apart with the ridicuous dialogue.  However, the action is enough to make this a pretty reasonable movie to endure, much like bubble gum.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>This is The Rock's real first breakthrough action picture.  There is a great moment early on when the torch is symbolically passed on from a different action hero.  What is astonishing about The Rundown is how visually interesting it is.  This is surprising because it is directed by the actor Peter Berg, who was the male lead in The Last Seduction.  He comes up with a lot of interesting techniques and special effects, which is important in the action genre because we've seen it all before.<p>As an actor, Berg seems to have an intuitive sense of how to get good performances out of people - in this case, The Rock.  He comes off sufficiently charming and heroic in this movie, if somewhat rough around the edges.  He is also allowed to play some of the gags for laughs.  Christopher Walken turns what could be a forgettable villain into an interesting part.  Sean William Scott is as good as always - he is well on his way to becoming a great romantic/comedic leading man.<p>The Rundown may not win any Oscars, but it certainly makes for a fun rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>A BOUNTY HUNTER [THE ROCK] IS SENT ON ONE FINAL MISSION INTO THE AMAZON TO BRING BACK HIS BOSS'S SON [SEANN WILLIAM SCOTT]. BUT, A LOT OF OBSTACLES STAND IN HIS WAY. HAS VERY GOOD ACTION, AS WELL AS A LOT OF GOOD JOKES. FROM START TO FINISH, THIS IS A PURE CLIFFHANGER. SO FAR, THIS IS THE ROCK'S BEST MOVIE. I RECCOMEND ALL FANS OF THE ROCK GO RENT THIS ONE NOW! AND IF YOU WANNA SEE MORE OF THE ROCK, GO CHECK OUT THE REMAKE OF ''WALKING TALL'' WHICH IS IN THEATRES NOW.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>If you watch this movie as a critic, you'll mess it all up.  If you watch this movie for fun, you will have a blast.  <p>The opening scene, with The Rock attempting to collect a little "past due" cash from a gambling football player, was excellent.  The Rock did an awesome job portraying a man about to get into some serious "toe-to-toe" knock-a-round.  For anyone who has been in a real bar fight, this scene was right on the money.<p>The Rock is excellent in this movie, and I finally have a new Steven Seagal to watch - seeing how all of Seagal's recent stuff sucks.<p>Seann William Scott did an excellent job in this movie, too.  Christopher Walken plays himself, as usual.  But all and all, this movie is what a good action movie should be.  I think The Rock has a great movie career going.  <p>Rundown is a definite hit.  I suggest you push that "buy" button and enjoy!<p>That's all I have to say about that...<p></p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>The film focuses on a bounty hunter named Beck ( WWE's The Rock)who works for a loan shark named Walker ( William Lucking). Beck longs to get out of the business and open up a restraunt. Walker agrees to release Beck of his obligations if he pulls one last job. That job consists of Beck traveling to Brazil to bring home Walker's son Travis ( Seann William Scott). Travis is currently trying to find a priceless and ancient artifact refered to as "The Gato" which is a solid piece of gold in the form of a cat. Beck assumes that it will be an easy job. However, when he gets to Brazil, Beck discovers a local slave driver/ gold prospector named Hatcher ( Christopher Walken) who needs Travis to lead him to The Gato. Now Beck must not only deal with Hatcher and his men, but Travis's repeated escape attempts as well.<p>Before I watched "The Rundown" I had some serious doubts. I have been a fan of the WWE for years, and I respect The Rock as a sports entertainer. But after seeing his last film "The Scorpion King" it became apparent that The Rock could not act his way out of a paper bag. However, after watching The Rundown, I was majorly suprised at how good this film turned out to be. It is incredibly similar to "Midnight Run" because it involves action, comedy, and aspects of a buddy flick. At times, this film is funnier than Midnight Run because it is set in the jungles of Brazil, and Beck and Travis must deal with crazy villagers, sex crazed monkeys, etc.. This provides for a lot of entertainment. The Rock actually did a very good job. He was smooth when he delivered his dialogue, he did very well in the fight scenes, and he brought aspects of his WWE character into the role with his skill for comedy and even a "rock bottom" in one of the fights. Seann William Scott also did a very good job and worked extremely well off of The Rock. Christopher Walken and Rosario Dawson also did a nice job in their roles as well.<p>While "The Rundown" might not be the best movie ever made, it offers a solid mix of action and comedy, and turns into the best buddy flick that I have seen since "Midnight Run". The fight scenes were extremely well choreographed, and all of the actors did a nice job in their roles. This is definately a film that enforces the rule of " don't judge a book by its cover" because I went from thinking this film was going to stink, to buying it shortly after I watched it. The DVD itself brings excellent picture and sound quality, as well as some cool extras.<p>A solid 4 stars...</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>If for no other reason, you can watch Walken do his thing, as only he can do. A fun evening, with no heavy lifting, Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>On a treasure hunt in South America, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has charisma to spare in THE RUNDOWN.  This inventive, visually striking, fast-paced action adventure delivers fun and thrills way beyond expectations.  A buff Sean William Scott, pretty and feisty Rosario Dawson and dastardly Christopher Walkin co-star.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I read a two star review for the Rundown where the critic says, "why is it called the Rundown ?, no one in it looks rundown. Um hello lol, Rundown doesn't just mean being exhausted it can mean being chased down and in this case that's what it means. The Rock's character Beck who's a repo-man is sent to South America to find his boss's son (Sean William Scott from American Pie fame). After he finds him and hits him around a bit the duo have no choice but to team up to in-order survive. Some rebels headed by the great Christopher Walken are after a price-less artifact and are willing to kill anyone that stands in there way. Beck wants to retire and become a chef but he has to survive his trip to South America first. <p>  The Rock is charming, funny and dangerous at the same time as Beck. There's no doubt that he has a future in movies behind him. I heard he might get into politics but I hope he just sticks with Wrestling and Movies because that's what he does best. He works great with Sean William Scott and Rosario Dawson who both are good in their roles as well. Anyway the Rundown is an entertaining and often very funny movie. I mean in what other move are the 2 heros almost raped by a bunch of horny monkeys ? lol. It's some funny and original stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>The Rock is the next big action star, this film is proof of that prophecy. I paid to see this film at the theatre and I got my money's worth. The Rundown is funny, has some great action scenes and Christopher Walken as the villian (his "tooth fairy" speech is hilarious!). <p>What else could you ask for in a movie?</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Rundown" takes place in the Amazon and has The Rock and Seann William Scott fighting each other. The Rock is Beck, a bounty hunter who has to do one more bounty in order to get his job and to have his own restaurant to be a chef. Seann William Scott is Travis Walker, the last bounty he is hunting. Travis is the son of Beck's boss, strangely enough. The beginning of this movie is dynamic with The Rock taking out a whole offensive football line. Unfortunately, when trying to grab Travis, Beck runs into a little trouble from Hatcher, played brilliantly by Christopher Walken, at a bar runned by Mariana, played by Rosario Dawson. Beck and Travis ended up in the Amazon jungle, trying to survive for their lives running from Hatcher. Unfortunately, they again, run into Mariana, who is strangely enough, the leader of the rebels. Travis, Beck and Mariana, look for the artifact that Travis is looking for. They find it, but, unfortunately, falls into Hatcher's hands, as does Mariana. Beck and Travis both return back into the town and get the artifact and Mariana back. The ending is amazingly funny and brilliant. The movie is excellent and I very much recommend it. Go see it any time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Sorry, couldn't resist the pun. But in the same vein as "Romancing The Stone," Indiana Jones" and about a dozen other find the treasure in the jungle action-comedies, "The Rundown" succeeds as a big noisy popcorn flick. It also proves that The Rock can carry his own picture when surrounded with a cast of A-List actors. <p>It's worth noting the opening quick cameo with Arnold S., who, in a significant "pass the torch" moment, mutters "have fun" to our hero. And that The Rock does. There's enough scenery chewing here to feed a few starving nations, all of it delightfully shot in "Brazil" (ne: Hawaii). Christopher Walken is the baddy, but he does get to hammily play something other than a deranged villain for a change, Sean William Scott continues to grow into a mature comic actor, and Rosario Dawson gets the tough but gold-hearted female heroine in peril role. All suit their roles well. Given the generally disappointing action movies of the summer, it's nice that one was saved till fall to redeem the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>***1/2 2003. Directed by Peter Berg. The Rock must bring back the son of a L.A. mobster who's searching for a golden statue in the Amazonian jungle. Great stunts and an always terrific Christopher Walken as the villain. The screenplay was co-written by James Vanderbilt who already wrote the scripts of two other above average action movies: John McTiernan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009L1TA">Basic</a> and David Fincher's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUCNP4">Zodiac (Widescreen Edition)</a>. At last, note Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo at the beginning of the movie. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>Watching this movie hasn't really changed since the DVD days.  The story is exciting and the action is constantly flowing.  That is why this movie gets four stars from me.<br /><br />What keeps this movie from getting five stars is the grainy picture.  I have a 1080p and watching other hd movies looked good.  This movie appeared as they did very little to enhance the quality of picture.  The picture was grainy and really didn't appear any better than my dvd version.  You may want to invest in some other movie with a better quality picture unless you haven't viewed it before.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>Don't expect a smart movie here.  A lot of the action is rather clich&eacute;, the humor is okay (not hilarious, but who can resist humping monkeys?), and the plot is rather thin.  But with these things in mind, it still turns out to be an entertaining movie.<br /><br />If you like The Rock and the other movies he has done then you can't go wrong with this movie.  If you like anything staring Steven Segal, Jean Claude Van Dam, or the earlier works of Sly Stalone then this movie will be up your alley.  If these type of things turn you off then avoid this movie like the plague.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The goodhearted and forceful Beck (The Rock) retrieves anything that is asked for by his employer, an influential mobster.  However, Beck dislikes his job and wants to get out of it and open a restaurant as he is also somewhat of a culinary expert and gourmet chef.  Beck accepts one last job where he is asked to bring home his boss's son, Travis (Seann William Scott),  who has stepped on the wrong feet and caused some problems.  Beck flies to South America's jungles where Travis is searching for the mythical Gato del Diablo, which is estimated to be worth millions on the black market.<br /><br />Rundown is a fast paced action comedy where jokes are thrown out as quickly as bullets are fired and Kung-Fu kicks are delivered.  Underneath the silly humor and punches there is a MTV-like seriousness about exploitation of poverty in poor countries where injustices are as frequent as fast food joints are in the suburban United States.  The cinematic experience is enhanced with the vibrant colors and the excellent cinematography as it offers a swift and entertaining cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Who needs Steven Segal when you have The Rock.

He just always made me laugh whenever he delivered his hilarious insults and one-liners. &quot;...If u smelllllllll what the Rock is cooking!&quot; Which self-respecting wrestling fan couldn't resist that, hehe? Now he is trying his luck as a Hollywood action star, and I've always thought that if there was to be a new action star on the level of Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the '80s, The Rock (he should really start crediting himself by his real name, Dwayne Johnson) could be it. Who cares if he ain't a great actor? Charisma, a tough physique, and even a tough presence is all an action star really needed (anything else is a bonus), and The Rock pretty much has all three.<p>Okay, I'm not the biggest Rock fan in the world. I have seen neither THE SCORPION KING, in which he got his first top billing, nor the recent remake of WALKING TALL, in which he plays the role Joe Don Baker played in 1974. I have, though, seen this movie, Peter Berg's THE RUNDOWN. In it, he plays a bounty hunter named Beck who has to go through one last mission down in El Dorado before he can retire the business and open his own restaurant. And what a mission it is! Having to deal with a brat looking for treasure (Seann William Scott), a mad dictator (Christopher Walken), and a bartender (Rosario Dawson) who turns out to be a tribal leader (I think) also looking for the same treasure as Scott's character. Needless to say, it's more than Beck bargained for.<p>Unfortunately, the movie he's a part of is a little less than I bargained for. I respect director Berg's attempt at being something other than the usual frenzied, overscaled brainless action spectacle that is seemingly the norm today, and perhaps it can be argued that the Amazon settings of the movie are worth the extra time. Still, I couldn't truly work up a lot of enthusiasm for THE RUNDOWN. Despite some interesting plot twists and turns, it seems to me basically another genre picture, and ultimately a forgettable one at that. It had more intrigue than most, but overall it wasn't as much fun as I expected. <p>Who knows, though? Maybe it's simply b/c I saw it on the reduced proportions of a TV screen rather than on the much-bigger, wider screen of a theater that I react this way. It might seem grander---particularly its pictorial imagery---on a big movie screen then it would on the small screen, with its grandeur vastly reduced. At least, though, the small screen doesn't diminish the performances, which were all at the very least competent. Seann William Scott may simply be playing a slightly smarter version of his Stifler idiot in the AMERICAN PIE movies, but at least he does it well. Rosario Dawson also doesn't have much of a developed character, but at least she looks very nice (as she always does) and delivers her lines with conviction. I gotta say that, to me, Christopher Walken seems to be on autopilot in this movie, but at least he resists overacting as the bad guy---his madness is subtle---and Christopher Walken on autopilot still isn't totally without interest for the audience.<p>And as for The Rock...well, once again he may not blow anyone away with his acting skill, but in the confines of this role, he has that formidable presence and conviction that a powerful action star should have. He shows here that he certainly can be an action star, and while this movie doesn't totally succeed for me as an action flick, it at least tries to be smarter and better than those dumber-than-dumb star vehicles for Stallone and Schwarzenegger in the '80s.<p>Still, despite its noble ambitions, I would not recommend THE RUNDOWN.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>This flick is carried by the charisma of THE ROCK.  The plot, which centers around a 'recovery specialist' named Beck (THE ROCK) who is sent to the Amazon to collect the son of a mobster (SCOTT) who is on a treasure hunt, is solid at its base, but way too top heavy with silly fight scenes, hit or miss humor, and MTV style direction.  This is one of those films that doesn't take itself seriously, hence the action/adventure angle is always on either side of the goofy line between funny and exciting.  You can't help but like THE ROCK, there is something about him that captures your attention, but by the end of THE RUNDOWN, you feel slightly embarassed for him.  It will be nice after a couple more movies to see him in full-on TOTAL RECALLish action mode.  THE RUNDOWN isn't an awful film and does have a few entertaining moments, but must have looked a lot better on the printed page.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>this is one of that passable entertaining movies. it could be better if they had used a more gorgeous guy than THE ROCK! yes, he has a big muscular body but a ridiculous and ugly face! he can never in no way take Arnold Schwarznegger's place! but his beauty is not really matter in this movie, the whole movie, scenario, directing and actings were terrible! BECK (The Rock) maybe a strong big guy but a guy in that size and weight could never be that fast! all of the fight scenes are terrible and clumsy! fastening slow pictured fight moves could be recognized in all of fight scenes. and the story is not something special, two guys are running away trough the jungle and a group of gangs are following them and at the end, they find a treasure, so what? finding a treasure or a valuable artifact sounds good but this is not a Indiana Jones movie! the only person who has given this movie some credit is "Sean Eilliam Scott". I can not tell that watching this movie is an absolutely waste of time but I can never suggest to anyone to even rent it.<br />Although The DVD release is pretty good and it's full of special features but even this could not help it.

"The Rock" as a bona-fide movie star. As Beck, a "Retrieval Expert" who longs for a simpler life as a chef, he displays for the first time on film the humor and charisma that won him "Millions....and MILLIONS!" of fans in the WWE. Dispatced to the South American town of El Dorado (Called Hell Dorado by the locals) to fetch Travis Walker (Seann William Scott), the wayward son of his shady boss, Beck gets more than he bargained for. He finds Travis easily enough, but getting him home might pose more of a problem. Not only does Travis not WANT to go home, but local land baron Hatcher (The hilariously nutty Christopher Walken, at his eye-popping best here) won't LET him go...At least not until Travis finds a mythical golden idol for him. The Rock vs. an army of gun-toting slave-drivers......Place your bets!<p>  As I said earlier, The Rock is awesome in his role, bringing a mix of self-effacing humor and quiet strength to the mix, balancing out the potentially irritating Scott's whiny character. Walken is, as always, a joy to watch. His diatribe about The Tooth Fairy is worth the price of admission alone, and hearing him say "Oompa-Loompa" is sure to go down in history as one of my all-time favorite movie lines. Director Peter Berg shows himself to be equally comfortable with comedy and action; He keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace, and the action scenes are simply stunning- Not only are the fights choreographed beautifully, but the action is easy to follow, with none of the choppy editing and shaky photography that has ruined many an action movie. <p>  The Rundown is just what it portrays itself as: A fun buddy picture. I had a blast, and so did everyone else in the theater. If you're in the mood for action, The Rundown is a sure bet. If you smell what I'm cookin'.....</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>This movie is truly Rock-solid; the inimitable pro-wrestler turned actor admirably struts his stuff here in terms of sheer muscular star power and heavyweight charisma, and proceeds to turn the Amazonian jungle upside down in the process. This is certainly no dramatic masterpiece, but all of the cast are excellent in this incredible action movie, especially Christopher Walken, doing a turn as a witty yet egomaniacal villain who simply isn't prepared for the consequences as `Beck' (the Rock) arrives on his doorstep in his part of the jungle to retrieve the errant son of a gangster he is indebted to. The murder and mayhem that ensue make up two hours of first class entertainment as we find Rock against the world, and the world getting the worst part of the deal. <p>The movie is wonderfully photographed, and the comic moments flow from the opening sequences, when Beck step into a crowded bar to retrieve a debt from a pro football player. The ensuing madness is so well choreographed and played out that it is entirely believable despite the fact that it is strictly super-heroics that the character Rock plays has to deliver to punch, elbow, and drop-kick the whole offensive line of a pro football team in pursuit of his man. Likewise, the bar-room fight scene that sets up the rest of the movie once Beck arrives in Brazil is a study in athletic make-believe, so far out it is both fun and amazing to watch, as long as you can suspend your critical faculties long enough to not laugh out loud at the silliness of some of the supposed stunts. But the Rock never disappoints, and he always entertains! <p>Indeed, like some of the better early Schwarzenegger movies (e.g. `Predator'), the wit and winsome qualities of both the characters and the plot are indeed quite entertaining despite the fact we all know who is going to win, and thus have very little doubt as to how things will progress as the tale spins along toward its conclusion. Also, one can see that Rock is rising very quickly to fill the action hero void once held by Arnie and Sly Stallone. He has a lot of screen presence, and is a joy to watch in action. What's more, he seems to handle himself very well, and is quite believable on the screen, which is no small feat given the cartoon-like aspects of the story line. All in all, a great action flick, and one you will likely want to include in your video library. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>Praise for The Rock's performance in this film is not overrated. He has come into his own in this film and established himself as a true actor and not just a muscle-bound cretin. The Rock plays Beck, a polite leg-breaker for a low-life loan shark with big-time &quot;clients&quot; such as NFL super stars. In a business where violence is his back-up when diplomacy doesn't work, Beck loathes guns and has a deeper desire to run his own 5-star restaurant and leave this knuckle-busting life behind him.<p>His boss gives him one last assignment before he cuts him loose and gives him the restaurant of his dreams... the mission: bring back his son Travis (Seann William Scott). His father has pulled his son's butt out of a sling so many times, he is reeling him in to face the music.<p>Beck heads to South America to retrieve Travis in what he believes will be a quick grab and flight back to the U.S. Unbeknownst to Beck, Travis is seeking a priceless golden idol and a local slave driver (Christopher Walken) is keeping tabs on Travis so he can steal the treasure from him as soon as he finds it. Hatcher (Walken) runs a gold-mining operation, employing  the local populous at disgustingly pitiful pay and slave-like hours and treatment. It's a real shanty-town, but filled with sophisticated cameras and other surveillance equipment and gun-toting thugs.<p>There is non-stop butt-kicking and far-out choreography through-out the film. So many scenes are so proposterous, it borders on insulting your intelligence, but things happen so fast and you get such a good laugh along the way, you really just sit back for the ride. There are a couple of scenes involving monkeys that are real gut-busters for laughs - but they used African baboons for these scenes - not animals you'd ever encounter in the western hemisphere. Anyone who watches the Discovery Channel even once in a while will roll their eyes at these scenes, but still laugh.<p>A local bar-keep named Mariana (Rosaria Dawson) adds an additional twist. Is she just a bar-keep, or is there something else going on... and how does she keep her hair looking so nice while running for her life in the middle of a humid rain forest?<p>Seann William Scott has proved that he is much more than the &quot;Stifler&quot; character in the &quot;American Pie&quot; series... he is a talented actor and can portray a range of characters and emotions. This film will probably be his launching pad into more serious roles in the future.<p>There is some language, but nothing beyond what you'd see on NYPD Blue on TV, limited in-your-face violence... just butt kicking, and no sex scenes - so the movie is fairly family-safe.  <p>On the overall first-time-viewing enjoyment meter, I'd give this film 5 stars, but on the &quot;would I ever want to see it again&quot; meter, I give it half a star.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie on DVD and it is even better on HD DVD.  Great picture quality with the lush jungle scenes and lots of bass in the soundtrack.<br /><br />The movie is also very entertaining with lots of action and humor.  The Rock plays a goon that has been sent to retrieve his bosses son played by Seann William Scott (a.k.a Stiffler from American Pie).  The interaction between them is hilarious.  The great Christopher Walken plays the bad guy and he is his classic self.  His awesome dialogue (I wonder how much was ad-libbed?) and his pants pulled up to his drooping breasts add the finishing touches to this terrific movie.  I think this is the Rock's best movie and a sequel must be made!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>There is no such thing as a nice action hero. Good thing The Rock learned early and beat up a bunch of football players who gave him troubles. He even gave one of them a Rock Bottom through the floor! "The Rundown" is about a bounty hunter (The Rock) who has to find that noisy "American Pie" guy in South America. There he meets an evil tycoon man who likes free labor. Throughout the movie, Beck falls off a cliff, gets thrown into the air buy some jungle warriors and his privates are smashed on tree branches. He even has to avoid these monkeys trying to seduce him. Then towards the end, Beck picked up two shotguns and started blowing up the village! The genius director even put Rosario Dawson in the movie to make it that much better! This is one of the best action movies of 2003 and it even has Arnold Schwarzenegger in it! Yes! Passing the torch has never been so monumental! Excellent!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>Man...this film had it all...action, an actual storyline that you could follow and eve more action.  This is the second film that I have watched that THE ROCK has headlined, and I just absolutely loved them both!! If you are looking for something that will keep you interested and wanting more of the same...this is the movie for you!! Glad that I chose THE RUNDOWN...you will too!!</p></br><a href="../users/A13RM1AWD1C5ZR.html">A13RM1AWD1C5ZR</a><br/><p>The Rundown, directed by Peter Berg (Very Bad Things)and starring The Rock a.k.a Dwayne Douglas Johnson, Seann William Scott, Rosario Dawson and Chrisotper Walken is one cool, action flick.<br />  The Rock, who plays the natural action hero shows us he can act (much better than in the dreadful, "The Scorpion King") as well as his softer side.  Seann William Scott is funny and amusing as always, though he's best known for playing Stifler in the "American Pie" films.  Rosario Dawson, (looking better) pulls off her role too as a rebe leader of a village and who could forget Christopher Walken as our villan playing a typical role here, who is also reasonbly amusing.<br />  The storyline to this movie is nothing amazing, but it's a little different than the formulaic plots to a lot of action films coming out these days.  The Rock plays Beck, a bounty hunter who is collecting debt for his mob boss.  Though he wants out of the business and wants to retire to open up a restaurant his boss says that he has to do one more job for him, in which he'll gain 250 thousand dollars.  He of course agrees, this time to rescue his boss's estranged son in the Amazon.  The film takes on an interesting path from here with nice and new might I add action sequences.  With stylish stunts done by the big guy himself.  This film is pretty humorous too, mainly due to Scott and The Rock, the rapport between them is well portrayed.  Rosario Dawson plays the love interest of Scott as a  rebel leader who is more deceptive and dangerous than she seems.  And Walken plays a mine owner who is on their trail when he finds something of interest to him that Scott's character has.<br />  The Rundown is rated PG-13 for Adventure Violence and Some Crude Language.  There are mainly intense but bloodless gun, knife, and whip fights.  Also some nice fighting sequences, which are well choreograped and different.  There is also toilet humor, reasonably mild sexual innuendo and as stated earlier some crude dialogue & language.  Worth seeing in theatres as I have luckily and possibly owning on Video or DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>And very funny.<p>I can honestly say I seriously doubted I would like this film and I only went to see it because it was on and I was there. I'd never seen a movie with The Rock before or even watched any wrestling so I was kind of dubious as to whether or not he would be any good. <p>In fact he was a great actor, full of personality and charisma, willing to make fun of himself and was great with the action. The Rock is definitely the next Arnie. Vin (Donald Duck) Diesel is the next Jean Claude Van Damme.<p>Seann William Scott was also pretty funny in a rare NOT Stifler performance. As an actor he does have genuine talent that's usually wasted in low-brow teen sex comedies. <p>The Rundown is a sort of Indiana Jones-lite movie. The Rock plays a bounty hunter/chef who is sent to track down Seann William Scott south of the border. Against his will The Rock ends up on a trek through the depths of the Mexican jungle looking for some ancient artefact. Unoriginal it may be but director Peter Berg keeps it moving with plenty of stunts, action and laughs. Christopher Walken's villain is a bit of a cardboard cut-out but how evil are you allowed to be in a PG-13?<p>I look forward to the next movie starring The Rock. With talks of a third Conan movie I can only imagine him being the best choice. And keep a lookout for Arnie in the nightclub at the very beginning. 'Have fun' is his only line. And fun The Rock will certainly have as the next BIG action hero.<p>Keep a lookout for Scottish actor Ewan Bremner (a zillion times the 'star' Ewan MacGregor is) in a funny role as a slob pilot.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Do you smeeeeeelll what the Rock is cooking? Well The Rock has been cooking up a whole load of goodies ever since his less then stellar debut on the WWF circuit. Not only has his popularity in the wrestling ring improved greatly from the days of "Rocky Sucks!" but he has been able to do what few fellow wrestlers can: Break away with a successful acting career. After a largely hyped appearance in The Mummy Returns, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson starred in the Mummy spin-off film, The Scorpion King, which was able to gross $84 million in the summer of 2002 and have him labeled as the next action star. Universal Pictures, seeing the great investing potential of this former wrestling icon, quickly signed him up with his next project teaming The Rock up with Seann William Scott, who has already had success this year with American Wedding. Dwayne Johnson has been able to work well in the action area but can he bring comedy into the mix? The studio definitely hopes so after investing $75 million in The Rundown (aka "Helldorado" aka "Welcome to the Jungle") and releasing it in a time period that is not known to have too many top earners.<p>The story centers on a hit-man who's out for one last job but this small assignment is more then he bargained for. Beck, an efficient man for hire, is not the normal kind of person in his line of profession. He gives people options, he would prefer cooking to fighting, and hates to use guns. After a brawl in a bar one night, Beck decides he wants out but his boss isn't going to let him off so easy. He sends him out on one more job: Travel to the Amazon, picking up his no-good son, and bring him back to the house. If he completes the job, he gets out of the hit-man profession and can open his own restaurant, the one thing he seems most passionate about. Beck believes this will just be another typical job but things change quickly. Not only does he have to deal with horny monkeys and quarrelsome natives, Beck knocks horns with Hatcher, the ruthless tyrant of Helldorado. Both men are after the same thing and both will do anything to get him but the question lies on who wants him more? The story for The Rundown is, quite surprisingly, fabulous. This is quite possibly one of the most original action/comedy films of the year with a wonderful blend of well choreographed fight scenes, hilarious comedy, and a balanced story to back it all up.<p>Though the cast is small, most members perform beyond expectations while others achieve the normal acting level. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson flattens Stalone, Willis, and even Schwarzenegger becoming the next cultural action star. Every fight sequence is packed wall to wall with high testosterone action and The Rock proving he can kick some serious ass in a grand style. And who knew he could be so funny? Well, a good amount of people who saw him perform on Saturday Night Live last year, but outside of that group, not many. For those not lucky enough to catch that one of the few truly funny SNL episodes in recent years (And, yes, the show has been pretty bad for a couple of years now), he proves all the skeptics wrong in this film. Seann William Scott, who performed earlier this year in Bulletproof Monk and American Wedding (the latter being the much bigger success), sure proves he has the comedic idiot act down pat though not as hilarious as he was in the last American Pie film. Perhaps it was the absence of using the F-bomb so many times but maybe it was the fact that the movie-going public isn't use to seeing him as the idiotic yet nice guy in comedies. Christopher Walken, as usual, never fails to amaze us. Once again he is able to mix comedy and drama well together without balancing one or the other. There were several jokes made by the talented actor that took awhile to get the point of but when the punch-line came, the jokes really paid off. And Rosario Dawson, a not too well known performer, was moderate at best but the main problem was that, as semi-important as her character was, wasn't featured as much as she should have been. There weren't too many that showed off her acting chops, which is quite a shame since there could have been plenty of potential had they allowed her to showcase her talent.<p>Overall, The Rundown smashes, blasts, and bombards the movie theater with everything its got and, quite surprisingly, the audience is left wanting more, which, for once, isn't a bad thing. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson proves he can live up to all the hype declaring him as this generation's action star and shows off some true acting chops that few from his former line of work can do. As good as the film was, it wasn't quite as funny as other comedies like American Wedding were. The problem lied in the fact that The Rundown took awhile to really get going by setting up a decent back story and stuff like that, which can be good on its own but when you're dealing with a buddy comedy such as this, it can come off as being a bit of a disappointment. The time length of the feature seemed a little too short but this is quite a minor squabble compared to all the praise one can say about this film. The Rundown is another valiant effort from The Rock and Universal Pictures that proves action flicks can be funny, intense and dramatic all in the same feature without outbalancing itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>The Rock goes from bodyslamming his opponents in WWE rings to doing likewise to the bad guys in The Amazon in his second major starring role. Unlike his role in the somewhat boring "Scorpion King", a prequel to "Mummy Returns" with Rock reprising his role from that franchise, the big guy actually gets to do some acting in this one. He's no Al Pacino here but he does have some decent acting chops. He seems to be going that Vin Diesel route here. <p>The Rock is essentially a loan shark who is sent in by his boss to retreive a wise-cracking treasure hunter named Travis Walker (Sean William Scott). As one might guess, Walker is rather hesitant to give up his mission and go home. Enter Hatcher (Christopher Walken), a mean-spirited overseer of sorts who breaks his deal with Rock's Beck and this results in battle after battle. Along the way, the mismatched duo comes in contact with hyper monkeys, exploding jeeps, and a rebel group that just happens to be led by the local bartender. <p>"The Rundown" has received some rather overblown reviews likening it to such classic buddy comedies as "48 Hours" and calling it one of the best action films ever. Reviewers like this seem to be so hypnotized by the "star power", thus ignoring a lot of other elements. Peter Berg gets props for the presentation. The action sequences look amazing but there are a lot of other things that aren't done so well. Looking beyond the glossy packaging, the script is thin. The comedic pairing of Rock and Scott is cute at times but nowhere near on the level of Nolte and Murphy or Gibson and Glover. Walken is always gonna be good but this is not one of his better roles. He is having fun with the role and so are we in watching him but he made for a much effective villian in the five minutes he appeared in "True Romance" then in the more than hour we get him here.<p>If you know what you are getting into, "The Rundown" is a real fun movie. I was not expecting too much from The Rock here but he surprised me. There is nothing "landmark" about this film though Berg's visual flare makes for something different. This movie is for the most part, a more visually-developed version of Deran Sarafian's "Gunmen" with a much more high-profile cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In &quot;The Rundown,&quot; the Rock plays a &quot;retrieval expert&quot; named Beck, whom we first meet when he has to get either $50,000 or a ring as collateral from a NFL quarterback (Stephen Bishop), who is hanging out at a club with some of his teammates.  When his initial overture is rebuffed, Beck checks in with his boss, pointing out that the QB has his entire offensive line with him.  But the concern is not over the obstacle that these hulking gridiron giants might pose to him, but that the team has a chance to make the playoffs again.  The clear implication is that if Beck gets rough, the boys will be out of commission, and the tone he takes shows that the Rock has found the perfect note for creating his big screen persona.  <p>This is just the prologue to the main adventure, which is when Beck is sent to the Amazonian jungle to retrieve Travis Walker (Seann William Scott), the wayward son of his employer.  If Beck does this he can pay off his own debt and get the startup money for his dream: a restaurant.  Travis is looking for the Gatto, a legendary ancient artifact made of gold.  Unfortunately he is doing this on the land owned by the evil Hatcher, who is exploiting the natives right and left.  Hatcher is played by Christopher Walken, who has another one of those legendary moments in his career when he tries to explain the idea of the tooth fairy to his troops through an interpreter.  There has to be a woman in this type of movie, and here the lady is Mariana (Rosario Dawson), who does a lot more than tend the local bar.  Basically, everybody wants Travis and/or the Gatto, complicating Beck's life, and that is before we throw those fun loving jungle monkeys into the mix.  <p>The Rock sets the tone for the film, Scott supplies the comic relief, Walken has fun chewing on the luscious scenery, and Dawson provides the brains and beauty.  Scott takes a half-step back from the quantum leap forward he took in &quot;Bulletproof Monk&quot; in getting beyond the Stifler character from the &quot;American Pie&quot; movies, but he holds his own against the Rock.  It will certainly be interesting in the future to how both actors can build on what they have established here.  The film takes as much effort to set up the comedy sequences as the action ones, which is why the end result is pretty solid.<p>My only serious complaint with &quot;The Rundown&quot; is that the action sequences consist of a series of rapid jump cuts, which probably help to cover up the wires and mirrors and whatnot, but which also make it rather difficult to follow the action.  I understand this is the current language of cinema, a legacy spawned by music videos and fast paced commercials, put sometimes I just want a nice minute long tracking shot or to just have the camera stay put for a while.  But director Peter Berg certainly brings some flair to the proceedings.  <p>&quot;The Rundown&quot; is the best action-comedy of the fall, which is not exactly the most desirable honor to be won in Hollywood and rather surprising.  You would think a film that takes place in the jungles of Amazon (filmed in Hawaii) would be a natural to put out in the summer, but I guess that would make too much sense.  This is not a great action film, but it is a solid one, which is apparently the best we can hope for nowadays.  The title does not have any real meaning, besides initially paralleling the name of the film's star.  Producers ditched &quot;Helldorado&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Jungle,&quot; which probably explains why the television spots are talking about the Rock rather than the film's title.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>The year started off with "Daredevil." Decent but not good enough. Lighter action films took place such as "Agent Cody Banks", "The Core", and then "Bulletproof Monk." Then a few bigger ones came like "Bad Boys II", "Lara Croft Tomb Raidor The Cradle of Life", "SWAT," and "The Medallion." But none of those hold a candle to the fun, excitment, and action packed laughs as "The Rundown" the film where The Rock proves that he can be a good actor. He is joined by "American Pies" Sean William Scott and "Catch Me If You Can's" Christopher Walken, along with the help of Rosario Dawson of "Men in Black II." But I think that the best performance is The Rock. He started his acting career in 2001's "The Mummy Returns" but wasn't in it enough. He then took another movie spinoff of The Mummy in his "Returns" character "The Scorpion King." But the problem with that movie was that there was not enough dialouge to make me think of him as a good actor. It was mostly running or him doing his trademark look from wrestling. I don't think in any of the 104 minutes of "The Rundown" he does anything close to his trademark look. <p>In this movie The Rock plays Beck, an expect finder. He always gies people two options. For instance, in the beginning when trying to get a ring he gives them option A which is "Give me the ring," or option B which is "Have me make you give me the ring." Most people always choose the latter which NOT the way to go. He then proceeds to give you the beating of a lifetime. But he wants to get out of that and open his own resturant. His boss Billy agrees to let him be out, as long as he does one last job for him. The job is to travel to Brazel, the jungle, to get Billy's son Travis, who has been in the jungle searching for treasure. But he's gotten into so much trouble that his father has had to bail him out of prison. He is flown there by Declan and thinks that finding Travis will be a quick job, in and out. But of course problems arouse. Beck meets Hatcher, a businessman who uses the locals as slaves to mine gold for him. Hatcher finds Travis for him but when he finds out that Travis knows where a great artifact is, he decides not to let Beck take him back to his waiting father. But a fight between Beck and Hatcher, has Hatcher and his men wanting to find Travis and Beck dead. They do flee into the jungle, with Travis sturggling to regain his freedom. They do get help from local bartender Mariana who is looking for the same artifact that Travis knows where it is, so she can liberate her people. <p>"The Rundown" is loaded with action, effects, and comedy. It's loads of fun as well. It's not just a predictable action comedy, and they don't even use the character of Mariana as a love intertest to the character of Beck. Beck basically wanted to finsh the job so he can fullfill his dreams of becoming of chef in his resturant. I think that after this great work of film, The Rock can finally start starring in action movies that are worth seeing on the screen. His "The Scorpion King" was a good movie, but it's more of a movie that you rent rather then pay a large sum of money to see on the big screen. "The Mummy Returns" he had a very smaller part and it was his film debut so you pretty much didn't know what to expect. But he is a movie star now, because "The Rundown" proves it.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 for adventure violence and some crude dialogue.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Beck is a bounty hunter, and the best at it...and he can cook, too!

FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>RUNDOWN is a simple big budget film that succeeds very well in what it sets out to do - entertain you.  It is not deep, it is not profound, it does not take itself too seriously.  That is the fun of it: intrigue, danger, capture, bad guy vs. good guy  are all served by Director Peter Berg with an emphasis on our having a good time.  The Rock is a surprisingly good actor and a very fine martial arts proponent. Christopher Walken contributes his usual keen study of evil with a twist, Rosario Dawson provides a delectable heroine, but the real surprise is Seann William Scott (why oh why do capable actors have to futz with names like "Seann" and "The Rock" as though they don't want to be taken seriously?), an actor primarily known for his jerky toilet mouth roles in such things as American Pie 1 & 2, American Wedding, Old School, Road Trip, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  Scott is in a role here that 1) shows his estimable physique 2) displays quality comic timing and 3) lets us see him in a role that actually requires skill.  The story is sort of a rehash of the Indiana Jones tales, but it is delivered with gusto and tongue in cheek by a fine cast under tight direction.  A good time!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In order to get out of hock with mobster Billy Walker, restaraunteur-turned-"retrieval expert" Beck has to go down to Brazil and retrieve Billy's ne'er-do-well archaeologist-wannabe son Travis, who is searching for an ancient gold idol called the Gato del Diablo. This idol is prized by not only the local population as the path to their salvation, but by Cornelius Hatcher, slavedriving operator of the Helldorado mining town who oppresses said population in the name of profits, and Hatcher just won't let Beck leave with Travis. Gotta tell ya, folks, The Rundown is a whole lot of fun. This movie is funny from start to end. If you love action and comedy then you will love this movie. Take my advice and see this movie you will have a great time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>THE RUNDOWN<br /><br />I have always been a fan of the Rock or should I say Dwayne Johnson especially in villain roles [film and wrestling], but what ever I have always been a fan. This movie in particular was really the first time Dwayne shined, I know the "Scorpion King" and all that was out first but that really was in his wrestling/action realm. This was the first time he was put a little out of his norm [although there is a lot of action and fights] with addition of comedy. He was always good a making people laugh and it was a natural fit and I must say that he pulled it off nicely.<br /><br />Beck [The Rock] is working for a rich guy retrieving late payments form various people and he is really good at his job. After crashing a party and knocking out some pro football players he thinks his time working for this man is done, but he has one more job left. He can't refuse to do it because he needs the cash to open up his own restaurant. So off he goes to the Amazon to hunt one Travis [Seann William Scott] and bring him back home to papa, Travis has other plans as he is close to finding a priceless artifact. Unfortunately for both of them Mariana [Rosario Dawson] the leader of a rebel group and Hatcher [Christopher Walken] the leader of the oppressors of the natives both want to stop them. So the fun begins as they must fight both groups, each other, the jungle, and some monkeys in a quest to get home.<br /><br />Naturally this is a funny movie and very enjoyable particularly the cast, every one is excellent in this movie. The Rock is very charismatic and has a great presence on the screen, he gives a great performance here. Seann William Scott is excellent here which is nice because he can be really annoying in certain roles, can you guess what those are? Rosario Dawson is fine and also gives a great performance and once again is very much, fine. Christopher Walken as always is a legend and commands respect every time he is on screen, always great to see him. Ewen Bremner is a scene stealer in this one with his whip wielding ways, oh those silly oppressors.<br /><br />The script by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt is great and full of some great and funny moments but it is the action that marks my favorite parts of the film. There is one scene in particular that has a lot to do with Capoeira or Capawara depending, although Travis calls it some kind of Jiu-Jitsu or something. Director Peter Berg did a nice job with this film adding in that art form in particular. Add in some excellent shoot outs, fights and some excellent scenes involving monkeys and you get a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />This is not the best movie ever and may not even be the best WWE produced film either but it is close in the latter. I would recommend a purchase on this one but you could go with a rental if you prefer. This is a very entertaining movie and is perfect for a Saturday at any time, love those lazy days.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>My review title somewhat summarizes the mentality of this film...note that I did enjoy "The Rundown" (halfway through I recalled having already seen it) and I could watch it again in the future. There's a lot of action and some really stunning jungle backdrops along with some incredible mountainous vistas...a fun movie for the entire [13yr+] family!<br /><br />The HD transfer looks excellent and the DD+ 5.1 audio "rocks"!<br /><br />I recommend "The Rundown" to anyone who would enjoy a little bit of toilet humor mixed in with some priceless artifact seeking adventure and a whole lot of explosions. Beck (The Rock) doesn't like guns, though...well you'll just have to see how that turns out.<br /><br />Great fun for almost anyone!

The Scorpion King was a poorly written fluke and a bad movie to judge he Rock's acting abilities on, where as the Rundown shows that he is a multi-dimensional actor and not just a macho knuckle head. The Rundown is a fun movie, and Arnold even makes an apperance to "pass the torch" of the action genre to the Rock.<br /><br /> The rock plays a retreaval expert out to track down a mobster's son and bring him back to L.A. so he can get the money to open his own resturaunt, but he runs into many obstacles along the way which provide the fun and action of this great movie. Well worth the watch and worth adding to any movie collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HWD9PTM7RBXN.html">A2HWD9PTM7RBXN</a><br/><p>Whereas The Rundown did not live up to my expectations, it did have some good moments.  The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) does add some charisma to the screen with his glib style.  Sean William Scott and Christopher Walken are fine in supporting roles.<p>However the story line is really nothing special.  It certainly lacks depth and basically was written as a vehicle for The Rock to show if his wrestling moves and stunt man abilities.  There are other action thrillers that succede on both levels(story and action).  Just check out anything by Denzel Washington or even Arnold Schwartzenegger.<p>The Rundown does feature some comedic moments and some good action scenes.  However, the story is middle of the road at best.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>&quot;Rundown&quot; is a surprisingly good action film, perhaps better than &quot;The Scorpion King,&quot; starring The Rock, whose mustles and humors will always entertain you.  Slick, funny, and most of all bone-crunching, this is what a good action flick should be.<p>The Rock is &quot;Beck&quot; who wants to own an Italian restaurant (seriouly, and he is a cook), but now has to work as a &quot;retrieval expert&quot; for a mobster.  Now he is assigned another job, hopefully the last one, of bringing back the gangster's son Travis (Seann William Scott) from the Amazon, where he is seeking for a treasure somewhere in the jungle.<p>The Rock flies there; among the beautiful rain forests, he finds Travis, who is not happy to meet him.  To make things more complicated, greedy baddie Hatcher (Christopher Walken with his usual quirky mannerism), the king of &quot;El Dolado,&quot; a goldmine where the natives are forced to work for criminaly low wages, steps in, to require the secrets of the treasure Travis is after. <p>Against the backdrop of the green jungles, the great actions go on with the Rock in top form.  One of the unique points is that he refuses to use guns, relying on his physical agility and strength, and it works nicely in each moment.  The gravity-defying stunts of the Rock are all well-choreographed, without using too much wire-works.  They are exciting and funny, the best kind of actions coming from Hollywood.<p>Rosalio Dawson and Ewen Bremner appear as support, and they are good.  But the real scene-stealer is Christopher Walken, who can infuse slight touch of comic (perhaps without his knowing) into the simplest word like &quot;wow.&quot;  Actually, he is the kind of the villain whose first appearance on the screen would make you cheer and applause eben if you know that he is a villain.  That is something you are not going to see in Hollywood films everyday.<p>The fascinating jungle location (of Hawaii, in fact) works well as a bonus point to &quot;Rundown,&quot; great action film.  And don't miss the cameo of Arnie whose short line is very meaningful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ.html">A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ</a><br/><p>"The Rundown" features the Rock in his second outing in a Hollywood leading role and he lays the smackdown.<p>THE STORY:<p>Beck (The Rock) is a bounty hunter sent on his "last case" to bring back his boss' errant son, petty hustler Travis (Sean William "Stifler" Scott) who is running amok in the Brazilian Amazon.  While in the Amazon Beck runs afoul of the ruthless local Overlord, becomes part of the people's revolution and along with Travis finds the secret fortune hidden deep in the jungle.<p>THE COOL THINGS:<p>Overall, this was a very satisfying action-comedy flick.  The fight scenes and big money stunts were awesome and the comedic chemistry between Rock and Stifler was top-notch (monkeys and paralyzing beans anyone?).  The Rock's billing as the "2nd Coming of Schwarzenegger" is pretty well justified by this film.  The story wasn't the best but I seriously doubt anyone's checking this film out for a good story.

Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) has all the moves, muscles, and mouth to make this a rocking good story. Classic good vs evil plot makes this reminiscent of the Raiders of the Lost Ark trilogy. While the Rock gets top billing, Christopher Walken is the perfect bad-guy-you-love-to-hate.<p>The dialogue is crisp and surprisingly witty. This is a sit-back and enjoy your popcorn and cold beverage type of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>Even with three movies released (well, technically four, if you count The Mummy Returns), it's still difficult to tell if The Rock is going to have a strong film career. Reasons? He's not much of an actor and his movies haven't exactly &quot;rocked&quot; the box office, if you'll pardon the pun. But he's got plenty of charisma that just radiates &quot;movie star,&quot; and that speaks volumes more than anything solid talent can when you're starring in a brainless action flick.<p>And brainless action flick The Rundown is, with its generic title and equally generic plot, starring The Rock as bounty hunter/aspiring chef Beck who heads into the Amazon to retrieve amateur archaeologist Travis (Seann William Scott) at the orders of Travis' own mob-boss father. But Travis is highly reluctant to leave, seeing as he's on the verge of discovering a gold artifact worth millions, but said artifact is also desired by two warring groups, slave-driving operators led by Hatcher (Christopher Walken) and the local rebels fighting Hatcher's mining establishment, all with Beck and Travis caught in the middle.<p>Despite the fact that The Rundown is a bit of a return to the 80s-style of bone-crunching action extravaganzas, it comes up short real fast. A perfect example of a missed opportunity comes in the film's opening scene; after a delightful &quot;pass the torch&quot; cameo from Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Rock lays the smack down on the entire offensive line of football team for the sake of a superbowl ring. This should have been a hilarious, wildly thrilling setpiece, but the constant quick cuts and flashing lights make the action almost incomprehensible.<p>After this brawl, the film slows down considerably during its endlessly draggy exposition before finally picking up with a decent barfight about a half-hour into the picture. It's at this point we realize the film has the same basic problem that permeates Arnold's mindless action thrillers; the sight of a hulking hero beating down on smaller opponents just doesn't generate much in the way of suspense or excitement. <p>Most Arnold flicks usually compensated for this with great one-liners or even bigger villains, but in The Rundown's case, there aren't nearly enough laughs and the action just doesn't thrill. Where the film does truly come to life is at the forty-minute mark, when a full-bladdered but hands-tied-behind-his-back Travis desperately has to pee, leading to several mishaps that result in a baboon just hankerin' to fornicate with Beck; you have to see it to believe it.<p>This is, unfortunately, the only scene where the film genuinely comes to life. The following action sequence, a showdown between Beck and several quick-footed local rebels, is pretty inventive, but marred by quick cuts, the obvious use of stuntmen, and an awful soundtrack that employs beating drums and, of all things, a whistle.<p>The final battle is almost a complete letdown, with director Peter Berg once again unwisely editing the film in MTV-style. It's when the action slows down enough that the real impressive moments stand out, like Beck's fight with the whip-slingers. And let me say this, when our hero makes a huge point throughout the film about never using guns and we the audience actually find this pretty unique, it's very disappointment to see the climax feature the hero resorting to shooting down all the bad guys, without even cracking a smart-ass one-liner, to boot.<p>The cast is actually pretty engaging for this sort of film (with the only real weak link being Rosario Dawson, who's utterly bland); I kinda like The Rock, I also kinda like Seann William Scott, ditto for Ewen Bremner, and I definitely like Christopher Walken, but the film puts this cast's considerable action and/or comedic talent to waste. This is an average action film, period.<br />** 1/2 out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>Anyone who has read my reviews knows I don't pander to crap. <p>A typical `bad'-good-guy-trying-to-clear-his-lfe flick, this film really is a fun movie to watch.First off, after The Scorpion King, I was sure The Rock's celebrity was destined to be one-dimensional. After this film, I have to admit I was wrong. He can act, he can do the tough scenes, and he can actually be funny in a long cut rather than short one-liners.  <p>From Christopher Walken cast as a Jungle Gold Slaver, to Deklan, the moronic Scottish bush pilot no one can understand, this film is filled with a deluge of characters. <p>Sean Scott is the son of a gangster, and is living in the jungles trying to find `El Gato de Diablo' a gold artifact. The Rock is a truly honest strong-arm who hates guns (&quot;Nasty things happen when I am involved with guns...&quot;), and is hired to bring him home. Seems like a typical formula film. But every character, including the jujitzu forest rebels (&quot;they are very short...&quot;) is bizarre in their own right. And there is a slew of humor in this film (my favorite is The Rock getting face-humped by a Rhesis Monkey while he's hung up in a pig-snare, and Scott is yelling at him to be dominant...hilarious!).<p>Walken is...well...Walken, and a perfect choice in his role. He says every line in the Walkenesque prose we have learned to love.<p>Scott shows he can play the rough adventure hero. He gets his ASS kicked over and over. This kid has such a future...<p>The soundtrack accentuates, rather than creates, the scene and tempo. The action sequences are a la Brian De Palma (quick clips, snap close-ups) and there's a bit of the Matrix thrown in. The whip-fight scene near the end is phenomenal!<p>This flick was FUN. A great mix of humor and adventure. And I can see a sequel with Scott and the Rock coming. <p>I can't recommend this as a rental. I have to recommend it as an own-it. I have watched mine 3 times already.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUZOJZM9008Y.html">A3TUZOJZM9008Y</a><br/><p>Director Peter Berg has crafted a well-paced action movie.

Once in Brazil, Beck finds that Travis is beholden to a man named Hatcher (Christopher Walken), the megalomaniacal owner of a huge gold-mining operation. He becomes embroiled in a  race to find an ancient treasure hidden in the jungle that is sought by Travis, Hatcher, and the local tribespeople who want to free themselves from Hatcher's mines.<p>&quot;The Rundown&quot; is a comic action adventure movie. It has a silly plot and acrobatic fight sequences that are more preposterous than anything from The Rock's pro wrestling career. But if you can get past that, &quot;The Rundown&quot; features 3 good comic performances that are the backbone of this film. The Rock is often compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, but he's a lot funnier. And whereas Schwarzenegger and Stallone are known for their stoic countenances, The Rock has an unusually expressive face, which he puts to good comic use here. Pro wrestling fans may like Beck's fight sequences, but a wider audience will enjoy his comic scenes. Seann William Scott once again proves that he's an actor who will do anything for a laugh as Travis, a kooky would-be archeologist. And Christopher Walken's deadpan delivery of Hatcher's ruthless, preposterously funny lines is priceless. These three actors are the only thing that makes &quot;The Rundown&quot; watchable. But if you're a fan of The Rock, Walken, or Scott, this might be worth seeing. It's no surprise that The Rock is a competent action star, but even a mediocre film like &quot;The Rundown&quot; shows him to be a very charismatic screen presence with a good deal of comic talent. Better script next time, hopefully.<p>The DVD: This is a nice package for a single disc. Bonus features include 2 audio commentaries, 6 featurettes, deleted scenes, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), and bios for cast and crew. One audio commentary is by director Peter Berg and The Rock. The other is by producers Kevin Misher and Marc Abraham. The featurettes: &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; is a documentary about the film's fight scenes. &quot;The Amazon, Hawaii Style&quot; is about re-creating and filming the Brazilian jungle in Hawaii and features a lot of mutual comic criticism by The Rock and Seann William Scott. &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; is about the film's special effects. &quot;The Rundown Uncensored&quot; is a faux (spoof) documentary about The Rock's illicit onset relationship with the film's baboon star, Camilla. &quot;Running Down the Town&quot; is about the creation, in California, of the small Brazilian rain forest town where the film takes place, narrated by production designer Thomas Duffield. &quot;Walken's World&quot; is about the Hatcher character and his domain. All featurettes include interviews with the film's stars and director Peter Berg. Looking for a simple making-of documentary? Try &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;. Like the film's humor, particularly in the style of Seann William Scott? Try &quot;The Amazon, Hawaii Style&quot; and &quot;The Rundown Uncensored&quot;. &quot;Running Down the Town&quot; is impressive, if you're interested in production design. The disc has 3 unavoidable previews before the film. Subtitles are available in Spanish and French, and captioning is available in English. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>In the opening scene of "The Rundown," the current governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, stops by for a brief moment to pass the torch off to Dwayne Douglas Johnson - a.k.a. The Rock - officially anointing him as the action hero star for the new millennium.<br /><br />In this film, The Rock plays a wannabe restaurateur who finds himself in hock to a vicious mob boss.  To work off his debt, the rock-solid behemoth becomes a retrieval expert, strong arming other people into paying what THEY owe to the gangster.  For his final assignment, the Rock is sent off to the jungles of South America to find and bring back the boss's recalcitrant son, who is busy searching for some buried Indian treasure and making a general pest of himself.  While there, The Rock becomes involved in a small war between a gold miner who has virtually enslaved the native population (who else but Christopher Walken?) and the band of rebels out to defeat him and regain freedom for their people.<br /><br />"The Rundown" is a fairly standard action adventure film in which the ever-resilient hero is able to pulverize a whole army of armed-to-the-teeth bad guys with little more than his own bare hands and without suffering a single scratch in the process.  No matter how many times he gets punched, kicked, stomped on, thrown into the air or tossed over a cliff, The Rock always manages to pick himself up, dust himself off and fight again.  Writer R.J. Stewart and director Peter Berg make it a point to emphasize The Rock's humanity by having him rarely use a gun when fighting (and then only as a last resort) and by giving him a homey domestic dimension in the form of his culinary talents.  There's something downright incongruous about having a human side of beef beating everyone he meets into a bloody pulp, all the while declaring that he is really opposed to violence on principle.  The film is also filled with all the verbal bantering, wisecracks and quips one has come to expect from these big budget action pictures.  Some of the humor works and some of it doesn't.<br /><br />Although The Rock has yet to develop his chops as an actor, he has a certain laidback charm that works well on screen.  He is effectively paired with Seann William Scott (Stifler from the "American Pie" movies), who has a ball playing the hyper kinetic jokester who just happens to be hiding a heart of gold under his mercenary exterior.  The two develop a kind of nagging, love/hate relationship that generates a few laughs along the way.  Rosario Dawson, with her seamless, pearly white teeth and perfectly coiffed hair, is far from convincing as a woman who is a bartender by day and a jungle-dwelling revolutionary by night.  She is so grave and serious in her overall demeanor that she seems to be acting in a whole other movie entirely.<br /><br />The Rock has a long way to go before he finds a vehicle even half as good as the best that Arnold has done, but "The Rundown" has its moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Featuring professional wrestler `The Rock' in the lead role of Beck, a professional bounty hunter, this is an action comedy film that's not about intellectual stimulation, but sure is ideal for pure entertainment and eye candy.  Beck heads to Brazil in order to retrieve his boss's son, Travis Walker, from a small town and mine run by the bad guy Hatcher.  But Travis isn't too cooperative because he first wants to find an ancient golden artifact, and Hatcher isn't keen to let him go, not least because he wouldn't mind the artifact for himself.  Add Travis' barmaid friend Mariana to the mix, some rebel forces, and you're all set for some action packed drama.  Beck stars in his role, and as a hero figure who doesn't like guns, he comes across almost as respectable rather than vindictive, and its evident that when he needs to resort to violence it's only because he has to rather than that he wants to.<br /><br />While the plot isn't always plausible, and the characters don't have any real depth, the film never has any illusions about being serious - it's deliberately larger than life, and all about fun entertainment. The stunts and fights may seem silly and far-fetched at times, but that's partly the point.  The violence isn't gratuitous or gory, and while there's enough of it to make it unsuitable for younger kids, for the most part it's an innocuous and fun ride, with some good cinematography and extended fight scenes with special effects.  Aside from a couple of incidences of blasphemy, the film is also relatively free of the foul language, sexual content or other objectionable material that can sometimes plague films of this sort (although there is one `bathroom humor' scene involving urination and another making crude reference to it, and some minor profanities on occasion).  In the final analysis, The Rundown is a solid success for The Rock, and can be appreciated as half-decent escapist entertainment for mature viewers. - GODLY GADFLY</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This is one of those action films in which I can sit back and enjoy as I watch every second of it. It's good to see some spectacular action and visual hilarity without the exploration of logical positivism, Aristotelian symbolisms, etc. Philosophy and Ethics are for drama films, not action films (although Terminator: 2 did a fabulous job with questions of human nature). Like I said, the action and humor are superb. I had a heck of a good time watching The Rundown. Honorable mentions go to the actors (especially Walken) for giving this film a higher entertainment value.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The  Rundown (aka Welcome to the Jungle) is more fun than it looks without ever making it to the top grade of disposable action schlock. Aside from one energetic fight with diminutive rebels swinging from ropes, director Peter Berg isn't so hot at action scenes, the script doesn't bother with much in the way of explanations and a little of Ewan Bremner's Pogues act goes a long, long way. But The Rock is a likeable lead, Seann William Scott is less annoying than usual, Christopher Walken works his usual value for money mojo as the villain of the piece (typecasting, you say?) and Rosario Dawson is hot, so all shortcomings are forgivable. As one action hero says to the other in a nice cameo, "Heff fun." Fairly good DVD extras too.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Yup, this is way hokey and one of the dumbest movies I own in my collection, yet it's very likable and mostly a fun film with great style and scenery.<br /><br />An adventure story, played strictly for entertainment value, it mostly succeeds because Dwayne Johnson, better known as "The Rock," is a very likable hero. He's clean-cut, well-spoken, modest, etc. Supposedly this film was supposed to be The Rock grabbing the action mantle, so to speak, from the king - Arnold Schwarzenegger - who will no longer make movies. They even have Arnie make a quick cameo, wishing The Rock good luck! That was a good touch.<br /><br />I didn't realize until the second time I watched it (which is where I stand now) just how stylishly this was filmed. This movie reminded me of many made by either Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Taranatino with the gimmick photography. It makes it all the more fun to watch. Add some excellent sound, tremendous Hawaiian scenery simulated to look the the Amazon jungle in Brazil......and you can put up with the stupidness of the story and have a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>I found this to be a surprisingly entertaining movie.  Filmed in Hawaii (a stand-in locale that doubles for Brazil), the cinematography is terrific.  The ROCK plays a sort of bounty-hunter who is out to bring a kid (Seann William Scott - AKA "Stiffler") back to his father.  Along the way, they have run ins with the local who runs the town (Christopher Walken).<br /><br />The ROCK's movies tend to be entertaining, although I can't see him being the next Arnie.  The action / adventure / comedy is his most natural genre.  He doesn't quite have the charisma of the slow-talking, talk-with-an-accent Arnie.  However, The ROCK can still carve out a niche for himself and make many more movies to come.<br /><br />As always Seann William Scott is hilarious, although some of the comic elements in this film don't really "work."  Christopher Walken was a good choice to be the stoic villain who is bent on enslaving a town of natives.<br /><br />If you enjoy adventure movies, give this one a spin.  It's more comical than most adventure movies.  And, most importantly, it's a whole lotta fun to watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>The rock in what would be his first major release movie, the rundown is a story of Beck (the Rock) who is a "collection agent" for a gambling ring.

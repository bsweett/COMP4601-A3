My 8 year old was captivated. My 6 year old thought that it as "awesome". When I asked my 4 year old if it was a good movie...well...I got a "no". But my 4 year old was definitely as captivated as my 8 year old.<br /><br />Here's the thing: They just don't make movies like Bridge to Terabithia for kids anymore; or, if they do, it usually gets smacked with a PG-13. But Bridge to Terabithia is no more frightening or deep than The Wizard of Oz <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ADS63K">The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> , My Girl <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800177991">My Girl</a> or Old Yeller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005RRG4">Old Yeller (Vault Disney Collection)</a> .<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia is a tale of what tweens might do to have fun--use their imagination--in their spare time....They dream of a magic place where they are The King and Queen of Terabithia. (The movie is based on the 1977 children's novel of the same name by Katherine Paterson, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064401847">Bridge to Terabithia</a> .)<br /><br />One of the kids is even invited by his teacher (Zooey Deschanel) on what ends up being a private excursion to a museum; and I must say that during the scene my wife and I looked at each other and we were like, "Oh no, what's going on here?" Well...nothing....The female teacher took the young male student (who indeed clearly had a crush on the teacher) to a museum. Nothing else. It just goes to show what a different world we live in today where you (sadly) can't trust a situation like that from the days of Old Yeller where Barney Fife might show up and not arrest the teacher, but instead suggest that they all stop by the local ice cream parlor on the way home.<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia is a very good movie...a family movie...that might frighten at times; it might make a kid think at times; and it might make a kid cry here and there.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Much to my surprise, I decided to view "Bridge to Terabithia" after hearing about the fine critical and popular acclaim it's received so far. It's one of the more memorable films I have seen lately, and one that should be remembered as among the finest films of 2007, or rather, of any recent year. Young Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb (who's probably best known for her cameo performance in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory") lead a superb cast that also includes Robert Patrick - in a superb performance that's quite atypical from the roles he's best known for - and Zooey Deschanel in a riveting, delightful, yet also memorable, tale about using a child's superb gifts for imagination, the magical bonds of friendship and love that result between two young outcasts, and the bittersweet lesson which one of them must learn after an accidental tragedy. I was especially moved by Hutcherson's and Patrick's emotionally riveting performances, which almost left me in tears towards the end. I haven't read the original young adult novel of the same title, but I suspect that this fine film is a faithful adaptation, blessed with superb digital effects from WETA, which was also responsible for special effects work on "The Lord of The Rings" trilogy and "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe". This surprisingly well-crafted and well-acted film will touch the hearts of many, and is definitely one well worth viewing by an entire family.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Introduction: If you're like me and knew nothing about the 07' release `Bridge to Terabithia' before watching the film I'm sure you were as surprised as I was. This is not a story about elves, fairies, trolls or any other such mythological beings of lore and legend. It is a coming of age tale about a young boy and girl, Jessie (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie (Annasophia Robb) who develop a strong friendship centered around a fantasy kingdom of their own making.<br /><br />Synopis: Terabithia lies in the woods adjacent to the homes of best friends Jessie and Leslie. It is just beyond a rushing stream which they traverse by swinging across using an old rope tied to a tree.  The two find this imaginary land a perfect escape from their daily problems revolving around school bullies, family difficulties and just growing up in general. Unfortunately even an imaginary kingdom can only hold out the harshness of reality for so long. The children are about to learn that some lessons in life are more difficult to accept than others.<br /><br />Positives: The cinematography, sets, special effects and music are superior as you'd expect from a Disney feature. The children are also quite charming, especially the talented Annasophia Robb. She will definitely be heard from in the years ahead.  Lest I forget, Zooey Deschanel plays the part of Miss Edmunds their music/art teacher. Zooey's always a plus to anything she's in.<br /><br />Negatives: Due to a rather dubious advertising campaign promoting this film as a fantasy adventure it has targeted an audience much too young for its slow pace and storyline. Further complicating matters, the characterizations portrayed in the movie are a little too stereotypical and one-dimensional to attract many adult fans. These two demographic miscues leave `Bridge to Terabithia' virtually a movie without an audience.<br /><br />Postscript: So if you're looking for a film in the tradition of `The Chronicles of Narnia' or `The NeverEnding Story' be forewarned, this isn't it. On the other hand, if you're in search of something more in keeping with the mood and message of `Pay It Forward' this film's for you.<br /><br />Rating: 3 1/2 Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I agree with the reviewers who say that this film doesn't really know what it wants to be. I must say that after watching it, I would not place this in the fantasy genre. I mean, it has it's fantastical elements, but when you get down to it, it's more of a friendship film with a great imagination. The two leads do a remarkable job portraying middle school kids who form a type of bond dealing with an imaginary world. Its actually very sweet and sentimental. That aspect of the film really is what makes it worthwhile. I found that when they introduce the fantasy elements, the film lost it's trail of thought. I'm aware this is based off a book, and maybe the book portrays things better. But as a film, it doesn't quite work. Still worth a look. It does have an unexpected ending which caught me off guard. Its a very bittersweet sort of film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is the middle of five kids and the only boy.  His family is poor and lives on a farm in the country.  In fact, they're so poor he has to wear his older sister's shoes on the first day of fifth grade.<br /><br />It's also that first day of school when he meets Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb).  She's his new neighbor.  When she beats Jesse at races during recess, he's less then happy.  But slowly the two build a friendship.<br /><br />It's Leslie's idea to create a magical kingdom.  In Terabithia, anything they can imagine goes.  They are the rulers and must fight against the evil creatures of the realm.  Slowly, Leslie's imagination rubs off on Jesse, and he begins to enjoy these games as well.  Their friendship even helps them deal with the bullies they face at school.  But will it help when tragedy strikes?<br /><br />This movie is based on a classic children's novel.  Those familiar with the book need not worry, this movie sticks closely to the book.  For those not familiar with the book, that means pay no attention to the ads you may have seen because this is not a fantasy movie.  The majority of the movie is spent in the realities of fifth grade life.<br /><br />And it has a very bitter sweet ending.  If you are looking for a light film, you will be disappointed.  But it is well worth enduring the sorrow for the beauty of the ending.<br /><br />The original novel was written and set in the 1970's but the movie is given a modern setting.  It only affects little things, and the heart of the story remains unchanged.<br /><br />The acting is top notch, too.  AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both newcomers and are perfectly believable as the leads.  The other stand out is Bailee Madison as Jesse's younger sister.<br /><br />My only complaint comes from comparing the movie to the book, a situation in which the movie almost always loses.  I read the book for the first time last month, and was deeply moved by it.  The characters were rich and there was lots of depth to the story.  Naturally, that can't be achieved in a movie.  If the book wasn't so fresh in my mind, I would have enjoyed this version more.  This is a minor complaint, however, since I was as deeply moved by the ending of the movie as I was the book.<br /><br />Don't watch this expecting a light fantasy story.  But by all means do watch it.  You'll be moved by this story of the power that friendship can have on a life.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EZHMGGWY74HY.html">A3EZHMGGWY74HY</a><br/><p>No, this is NOT your typical fantasy story.  It's what we expected, and why we rented the movie in the first place.  Rather than be disappointed, we were thrilled at the depth of the story and performances.  Our 7 year old LOVED it, despite the sadness and difficult turn the story took.  She found it to be a "beautiful movie" (her words) and she asked that we keep it an extra night so she could see it again.  She especially liked when the boy became more sensitive and closer to his sometimes "annoying" little sister at the end.  She said that the bridge and his sister would help him to feel better about things.  She couldn't be more right!<br /><br />A must see.  A movie that will teach compassion and caring to our young children.  Not an easy movie at first glance, but parents should NOT be afraid to have their child see something with a bit more substance.  Kids see enough mindless movies, fantasy for the sake of fancy computer graphics, adventure movies that teach nothing other than it's fun to be pirate.  This movie has soul and depth and feeling, and I wouldn't have missed it for the world, and neither should you!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>For those of us who fantasized about make-believe lands, this movie is right up our alley!  Two misfits (a boy and girl) become friends, bonded by a play area across a stream from the boy's house.  They swing across the stream on a rope that the girl says is enchanted.  While on the other side they imagine a different world called Tarabithia which seems to come alive.<br /><br />As the two bond together, they seem to make peace with the rest of the world from the kids that bully them at school to the boy's seemingly cold father, and the boy's sweet little sister that he seems to always ignore.<br /><br />This is a movie that you really need to be an adult to understand.  This is a different experience from the other movies of this genre (The Chronicles of Narnia, The Golden Compass).  I found this movie very enjoyable!</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>This movie is a sweet, but sad story of a dreamer boy who is building a wall a round his heart and an adventurous girl who reaches out to him. Its beautifully shot with fantastic animals and lush green forests. The kids act real enough to be convincing. The only thing that I did not like was the way the ending was done it was heavy handed, and like a sucker punch got you while you weren't looking. My son watched it with me and we both were surprised at the movies ending. Overall I recomend it, but you may want too explain some parts to your children.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>Terebithia was a magical land which took shape after Leslie Burke moved to yet another school where she didn't fit in. Prettier than the popular cheerleaders, but too different to be accepted, she'd had to live in a fantasy world all ehr own as no one had ever had the time to listen. She was harassed by the nasty girls who would turn into people like the agitator at the last movie. She observed that her neighbor was treated badly by the bullies on the playground and on their school bus. She sat beside him so they'd leave him alone.<br /><br />There's nothing like first love as they transformed an old tree house out in the woods into a magical kingdom of which Leslie was the leader. Both ran like Forrest Gump as they departed the real world of violence on the school bus. The bridge was a hanging rope which they used a la Tarzan on his jungle vines. I wondered how the dog PT got across the flooded creek.<br /><br />As time went by, they became good friends but one day he took a field trip to a museum in the city without letting Leslie know. It was an unexpected treat, an opportunity he could not turn down. Though they were now close emotionally, he kept the trip secret like males tend to do, and he wasn't there when fate played its dirty trick.<br /><br />The founder of Terebithia went alone to their playground but the "bridge" broke. Jess felt guilty because he'd been too selfish to invite her along. Had fate been different, he would have taken her to the museum to show off his knowledge and experience. The oen time he wasn't there at a critical moment, she slipped and drown; when Zach took us to see the circus in Huntsville, Alabama, a friend of mine slipped away into oblivion and her mean daughter pulled the plug. Jess went into denial and missed her constantly. She'd been his sunshine and inspiration, and he just could not "let go."<br /><br />When an unexpected death hits us, it helps to remembe the good about the person who now is gone. My tribute to Bob Lobertine prompted by a callous state trooper's critical remark -- a letter to the Nashville Tennessean saying we should remember the good about a prominent person and let the bad die with him. Hold on to your loved one's specialness to keep it alive. The music throughout was delightful, shades of Star Wars (soundtrack is out and is fantastic).</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>There's more than one bridge that is lacking in BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. Trying to ascertain who this movie is targeted at is one that many parents won't be able to cross, as well as gaps in almost all the fantasy elements.<br /><br />Teasers and trailers would have most potential viewers believe it to be on-par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VL0K2">The Lord Of The Rings</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">Narnia</a>.  Perhaps not in production standards but at least in the story's fantasy elements. Not so. The screenplay and direction seemed to be at odds with the story, trying to infuse more childlike wonder and imagination but being stymied by coherency and some very shabby acting and dialogue.<br /><br />Bridge To Terabithia is based on Katherine Patterson's Newberry Award winning children's book by the same name. Given a wobbly structure by picture standards rather than anything approaching a solid children's story, the film fails not only in entertaining visuals but also in that the themes that run through Patterson's books are never given their comeuppance. We can see them more than feel them, which is a bummer considering how important some of the issues Patterson covers in her novels.<br /><br />Josh Hutcherson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DBHX4M">Zathura</a>) stars as Jesse Aarons, a middle school boy with adult responsibilities on his parents' farm. Living in the boondocks, Jesse is the [...] of bullies and jokesters at his school. Finding comfort in his drawings, Jesse immerses himself in them, trying to escape life's cruel realities. He's a loner even amongst his family, where his sisters and parents rarely acknowledge his existence. Then one day a young girl arrives at his school and opens Jesse's mind to the unseen. AnnaSophia Robb is Leslie Burk (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BB1MI2">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>), the daughter to fiction writers who takes a liking to Jesse. Running into the backwoods near their homes, Jesse and Leslie form a friendship based on escapism and fantasy. But the worlds begin colliding as Jesse and Leslie take their made-up world and incorporate its sense of right and wrong on the real one. The results are no big surprise. The bullying stops. Respect is achieved. Toughness grows.<br /><br />The largest problem with the story is that its target audience is a complete mystery. The dialogue is junior enough to be in league with films such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3D4">Labyrinth</a> but the themes are often adult, including extrapolations on the need for God and religion as well as how to deal with an emerging sexual attraction for a teacher, and the death of a student. These dichotomies were just too broad to be ...um ...bridged.<br /><br />The other issue is the out-and-out misconception that this is some sort of visually stunning fantasy movie. It isn't. These elements are few and often incongruous with the trailers that littered screens before its release or on parallel DVDs that beg you to rent or buy this film, too.<br /><br />Bridge To Terabithia isn't for young kids and it will bore and/or anger adults to the point where they'll want to banish the DVD posthaste from whence it came.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A perpetual outsider both at home and at school, Jess Aarons just never seems to fit in no matter how hard he tries. When his goal to become the fastest runner in middle school is unexpectedly thwarted by newly arrived classmate Leslie Burke, who enters in an "all boys" race and leaves her competitors in the dust, Jess soon strikes up a friendship with the imaginative outsider. Their bond is soon cemented thanks to Leslie's love for storytelling and Jess' skill as an artist, and the two lonely kids create a secret kingdom called Terabithia that is only accessible by swinging over a stream on a nearby rope. The acting of both the children as well as that of the supporting adult actors and actresses is incredible and the movie has a very good storyline and plot which stays true to the book. Truly excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this is a very good movie the actors are awesome and the story is great this is a good movie i recommend it to everyone</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Basic story of outcast sixth graders bonding, learning and teaching what life is about. The Disney's and Director: Gabor Csupo's version is trying to be more than the book and came up with an artsy film that is better than most of the trash that we feed our kids today. The only problem is that the professional artsy people can do it better and the people that go for mindless graphics and fairy tail endings will not appreciate this film; it is sort of pearls before swine.<br /><br />Trying to be subtle, we get nether graphics enough to make this a moppet movie or the lack of graphic making this a philological escapist story. The images are not confined to Terabithia but to Jess (Josh Hutcherson) himself. Of course Zooey Deschanel can bring out the graphics in any of us; be sure to see her again in "The Tin Man."<br /><br />Bottom line a fairly good formula movie but not designed for the mindless. And there is nothing exceptional or surprising. When Val Lawton had to use titles like "I walked with a Zombie" and made it into a physiological thriller, Csupo snuck a physiologic thriller right under Disney's nose.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Blu-ray does not add or subtract from the movie. Of course you need to watch the extras as they do add value to the story.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010X744G">Tin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Just about every children's book gets turned into movie at least once.  Examples include Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and many Disney tales. Unfortunately, the award-winners do not do so well at either the box office or from the critics.  This list of movie letdowns include The Indian in the Cupboard, The Phantom Tollbooth, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, and Watership Down.  Luckily this is an adaptation.  Based on the classic children's book of the same title, the screenplay of this movie was written by the son of the book's author.  The author had written the book based on the experiences of the son after he lost his best friend, a girl, when he was 8 years old.  Now that boy has turned his mother's book into one of the better family movies this year.  The familiar children's themes are all there; longing, family conflict, busy parents, fitting in, school bullies, first loves, and pain-in-the-ass siblings.  Add in a lot of special effects by the WETA group and you have a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AT7W1EXT0PF2Y.html">AT7W1EXT0PF2Y</a><br/><p>Since the 90s Hollywood's main objective is to make as much money as possible while exerting as little effort as possible, and if the movie happens to be crude and mock tradition and morals-extra points. Unfortunately, they made this film. My only theory is that they figured they would save money since they merely had to hire a hack writer to turn the novel into a screenplay. The only problem was they picked a book that was actually good. While this film isn't perfect, it's one of the few diamonds in the rough of 21sy century American cinema. The characters in this movie go to a school where they do nothing but beat on instruments and sing folk songs. They also have recess sometimes where bullies pretty much have the run of the show, even charging exorbitant fees for using the bathroom facilities. If this was your life, you'd want to live in a fantasy world as well. The movie gets of to a great start by having the hero being forced to wear his sisters pink and white shoes to school. Any guy knows that would be his worst nightmare and we immediately sympathize for the kid. What the movie boils down to is how hard it is to be an intelligent person when 90% of mankind are morons. Some wimpy viewers say the movie is just too sad to be a children's film. They'd rather their kids knew nothing about reality and how hard life can be and watch happy films about ogres passing gas. That's fine for those low lifes. But if you want to raise good children that are responsible and have morals, have them watch films like this. If you don't' God will hate you and send you to hell.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, and Zooey Deschanel are the actors who play the main characters in this movie.  They do a good job with their roles, but I admit I feel a bit misled about this movie.  I was under the impression that their magical world was more tangible and not just a figment of their imaginations.  There is not as much exploration into the fantasy world as I would have liked, and the story moves along a bit slow in places.  That said, it still is a pretty good movie with a couple of life lessons thrown in.  Disney films always make some kind of point.  The moral of the story may be "live life to the fullest, consider others even if they themselves seem inconsiderate, and don't underestimate the power of a good imagination."  I feel a bit bad for the children who starred in this movie because even though they really did a good job with their roles, the storyline was weak and there weren't many significant peaks to make it impactful or connect you strongly to the story.  A little disappointing, but not a complete waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I know absolutely nothing about the young adult novel that this film, "Bridge to Terabithia," is based on.  For this reason, I will only review this film for its contents and not on how well it translates the book to the screen.  With that said, I can claim that "Bridge to Terabithia" is just one more wonderful film that's been produced as of late for youngsters that's based on a book or book series.  Produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures, this film tells the story of Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson of "Zathura"), a boy who lives in poverty but escapes from reality through drawing fantastical creatures and worlds.  When a new neighbor moves in who marches to the beat of a different drum, the two of them combine their imaginations to create the kingdom of Terabithia.  The neighbor is Leslie Burke, and she's played by the likeable and enthusiastic AnnaSophia Robb ("Because of Winn-Dixie," "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory").  She and Jesse take their personal miseries from school and at home and turn them into trolls, evil squirrels, grenade-like pinecones and a whole slew of other creatures.  All of the bad people of Terabithia are lead by the Dark Master, a smoky, phantom-like creature.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, Jesse and Leslie form a strong friendship both in reality and in fantasy.  When Jesse is asked to go to the museum by his music teacher (the excellent Zooey Deschanel), he intentionally leaves Leslie behind.  Why?  Because like any most boys in middle school he happens to have a crush on his music teacher (It's Zooey Deschanel, who wouldn't?).  When a tragedy occurs, Jesse's worlds, real and fantasy, experience dramatic changes.<br /><br />"Bridge to Terabithia" is essentially a coming-of-age tale where kids who aren't quite children but haven't yet reached adulthood come to feel the consequences of reality.  Jesse and Leslie love their fantasy world, but each day brings more reality with it.  The cast is headed up by Hutcherson, Robb, and young Bailee Madison (Jesse's cute little sister, May Belle).  The supporting cast includes Deschanel, the always reliably gruff Robert Patrick ("Terminator 2") and Lauren Clinton.  While the adults play key roles in this film, it's really all about the kids.<br /><br />The special effects are very good, though most pre-teens will pick up on their limitations.  However, the special effects take a backseat to the story, which is always refreshing to see these days.<br /><br />Parents with younger children should know that the tragedy aforemetioned may be very tough for youngsters to take.  I won't go into details, but just know that it's one of the gravest tragedies that can occur in anyone's life.  There are also two instances of strong language.  The "d" word is used repetively in both of them.  One occurs in the back of a truck after church and the other happens in the greenhouse at Jesse's home when he loses his father's keys.  Other than that, there isn't anything in the film that you really need to look out for.<br /><br />As a fantasy tale, "Terabithia" works well.  It works better as a film about a young boy and his friend who come to terms with reality.  I highly recommend this film for families, just be prepared to do some heavy explaining with younger children (under eight) when reality really, really hits home.  Fans of this movie may also enjoy "The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe," the "Harry Potter" films (although as Harry gets older, the movies and books become geared more towards older children), and "The Neverending Story."  Also, even though I haven't read this particular book, I have read plenty of other young adult books in my day.  Pick up "A Wrinkle In Time" by Madeleine L'Engle, any of the "Harry Potter" books, or any other wonderful child and pre-teen fantasy for your children to read if they enjoy this film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I never had the opportunity to read Katherine Paterson's Newberry Award winning children's book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064401847">Bridge to Terabithia</a>" because I was in college by the time it was published, and for some reason that is completely lost in the mists of the past I actually had in my mind that it was a story about the Holocaust, or at least set in Eastern Europe.  But if I have had the wrong idea about the story for the past several decades the trailers that were put out for this film version only served to supplant my original erronous idea with a different ones.  The trailers made me think that I was going to watch something akin to "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>," but of course now that I have seen this 2007 film the obvious point of reference is "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth</a>".  Obviously I am not the only one to notice the quantum gap between what we saw in the trailer and what we got in the film, but I have seen my fair share of stupid ad campaigns for pretty good movies and in the final analysis that is what this film is, so forget the stupid trailers.<br /><br />"Bridge to Terabithia" is not a special effects movie but a movie about a special friendship.  Jesse Arons (Josh Hutcherson, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DBHX4M">Zathura</a>") is taunted, teased, and bullied at school and takes refuge in his drawing, but his family is oblivious to his artistic talents.  Then Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NZ2KG">Because of Winn-Dixie</a>") walks into his life as the new girl in class.  As extroverted as Jess is introverted, Leslie turns out to be a kindred spirit whose talent is for writing.  At first Jess treats her as horribly as everybody else as the new girl assumes the spot at the bottom of the school's pecking order.  But they have too much in common and they become friends, doing everything together, including exploring the woods and finding the special place she named Terabithia where parents and chores, bullies and kid sisters, can be left behind.<br /><br />There is no need to say more because you deserve to discover how this one plays out for yourself.  The cast features Robert Patrick as Jesse's overworked father and Zooey Deschanel as the kid's music teacher, Ms. Edmonds, but this film favors the kids over the adults while making it clear they live in the real world, even with the wonders of Terabithia.  I especially like the way the plotline regarding the schoolyard bully, Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton), plays out, even more than what Josh and Leslie come up with for Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless) and Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) in Terabithia.  My understanding is that the screenplay by David L. Paterson and Jeff Stockwell is quite faithful to the book, although obviously those who have read it would know far better than me.  But at least now I know what the book is about and why it is one of the most beloved children's books of the last thirty years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I'm surprised that the MPAA gave Bridge to Terabithia a PG rating....Not because I think that it should have been given a more restrictive rating, but because the MPAA is so conservative these days with movies for kids that might be "too deep" or might "make a child sad".<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia is indeed a kid's movie, with a couple of kids (Josh Hutcherson & AnnaSophia Robb) turning in a couple of moving performances. My oldest was captivated. My middle-guy thought that it as "awesome". When I asked my youngest if it was a good movie...well...I got a "no". But my youngest was definitely as captivated as my oldest. In fact, this was originally a rental for us, but we picked up the Blu-ray edition after my youngest was so upset when I returned the rental.<br /><br />Here's the thing: They just don't make movies like Bridge to Terabithia for kids anymore; or, if they do, it usually gets smacked with a PG-13. But Bridge to Terabithia is no more frightening or deep than The Wizard of Oz <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ADS63K">The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> , My Girl <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800177991">My Girl</a> or Old Yeller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005RRG4">Old Yeller (Vault Disney Collection)</a> .<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia is much more about childhood issues and dealing with them than fantasy and folklore. It's also a tale of what tweens might do to have fun--use their imagination--in their spare time....They dream of a magic place where they are The King and Queen of Terabithia. (The movie is based on the 1977 children's novel of the same name by Katherine Paterson, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064401847">Bridge to Terabithia</a> .) This movie will also present that life is not always so rosy at times, so if you're the type that wants to hide that fact from your kids then you might be disappointed with Bridge to Terabithia.<br /><br />In the film, one of the kids is even invited by his teacher (Zooey Deschanel) on what ultimately ends up being a private excursion to a museum; and I must say that during the scene my wife and I looked at each other and we were like, "Oh no, what's going on here?" Well...nothing....The female teacher took the young male student (who indeed clearly had a crush on the teacher) to a museum. Nothing else. It just goes to show what a different world we live in today where you (sadly) can't trust a situation like that from the days of Old Yeller where Barney Fife might show up and not arrest the teacher, but instead suggest that they all stop by the local ice cream parlor on the way home.<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia is a very good movie...a family movie...that might frighten at times; it might make a kid think at times; and it might make a kid cry here and there.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>On the surface, the concept for "Bridge to Terabithia" is quite sad: it centers on two adolescents, both of which are lonely and misunderstood. They then bond and create their own fantasy world, one that reinterprets the harsh realities of their daily lives into extraordinary creatures and settings. It's very easy to think that such escapism isn't healthy in a relationship, especially in one that's formed during such a dynamic and turbulent stage of development. But there's so much more going on here, so many different themes, ideas, and commentaries that are at work. This is not a light and airy children's fable of princes and princesses, nor does it attempt to sugarcoat everything that's even remotely unpleasant in this world. This is an incredibly powerful story of friendship, the fortitude of the imagination, and the strength to overcome adversity.<br /><br />The first of the two adolescents is Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson). He doesn't exactly live an ideal life; not only does his family barely live from paycheck to paycheck as farmers, they also virtually ignore him. Going to school is even worse; he hasn't any friends, and he's at the mercy of a couple of school bullies. One sits behind him in class, yelling things like, "Beep! Beep! Beep! That's my loser detector!" Jesse has two forms of escape. One is running, which he hopes to perfect so he can embarrass anyone who gave him a hard time. The other is drawing; he carries a sketchpad wherever he goes, and he frequently fills a page with fantastical creatures of all shapes, sizes, and colors.<br /><br />The second adolescent is Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), a free spirit in every sense. Because she was able to run faster than any of the boys, Jessie initially feels threatened by her. But then the class is asked to write a one-page essay on their favorite hobbies. The teacher asks Leslie to read hers aloud due to her fluid, descriptive language. Both Jessie and the audience immediately understand that the teacher made the right decision; as she reads an incredibly mature and creative essay on scuba diving, he visualizes what she's describing. Fish swim in his eyes. Bubbles exit her mouth and float away. At that point, the connection is made; she expresses herself through language while he does so through art. Both rely heavily on their imaginations. These two were meant to be in each other's lives.<br /><br />In wanting to escape the monotony and pain of the everyday world, the two run into the woods, swing across a rope, and create a world of their own. Leslie calls it Terabithia, a magical kingdom imprisoned by the elusive Dark Master. She and Jessie have been sent to free the Terabithians and restore peace. At first, Jesse has a hard time visualizing this fantastic world. But then Leslie gives him a piece of advice: "Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open." Suddenly, everything becomes clear, not just for Jessie, but for the audience, as well. They incorporate an abandoned tree house and the surrounding trees and animals into their world: the squirrels and birds become minions of the Dark Master (interestingly, these evil creatures say things like "Beep! Beep! Beep!"); the dragonflies become the army sent to protect Jessie and Leslie; the trees become gigantic trolls.<br /><br />They retreat to this world as often as they can, despite the demands of school, family, and everyday living. This is something Jesse's father (Robert Patrick) has a difficult time understanding; while he is at heart a good man, having bills to pay and a family to feed leaves no room for an imagination. He wants his son to get his head out of the clouds and pay attention to his chores, his homework, and the welfare of the family. At one point, Jesse misplaces his father's keys; when they seem to be permanently lost, the only option is to replace them all and buy a new set of locks. This prompts his father to shout, "Why don't you just draw me some money?"<br /><br />Leslie's parents (Latham Gaines and Judy McIntosh) are interesting; like their daughter, they have active imaginations and spend most of their time writing. Surprisingly, having so much in common hasn't brought the three of them together. If anything, it's driving them further apart; her parents are always too absorbed in their work to notice her. This isn't to say that they--or Jessie's parents, for that matter--are bad people; I never once got the sense that they were willfully neglectful, despite not being as attentive as they should be. I saw them as people so wrapped up in everyday life that they've forgotten how to actually live. For this reason, Jessie and Leslie are viewed differently; their minds are transcendent.<br /><br />Truth be told, transcendence is one of the movie's most important themes. Consider the character of Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton); she's initially portrayed as a good-for-nothing bully, pushing everyone around for no reason other than because she can. She steals people's food. She charges admission to the bathroom. She unfairly accuses Jessie of things he didn't do. At first, we're not supposed to care about her. But then Leslie hears her crying in the girls' bathroom. After some coaxing, she finally works up the courage to talk to her. As it turns out, Janice is a deeply hurt soul, the product of an abusive father. I won't say whether or not this appeals to Janice's better nature, but I will say that the willingness to explore such an issue makes for a deeper, more satisfying experience.<br /><br />Despite everything I've been saying, I fear that this review hasn't succeeded in conveying just how amazing "Bridge to Terabithia" is. It's amazing as an examination of the connections certain people make. It's amazing as a testament to the endless possibilities of the imagination. It's amazing as a message to think freely and to not be bogged down. We need this kind of film in our lives, if not for the sake of entertainment, then for the sake of being emotionally rejuvenated. I find myself going back to Leslie's advice: "Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open." Not only do I urge you to see this film, I also urge you to follow that piece of advice as you watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>'Bridge to Terabithia' is a portal to a better life for children and teens.  Not simply a call to exercise one's imagination in an electronic age, 'Bridge...' never goes too far to illustrate kids making best use of their resources, including sifting all the elements of boredom, bullying, and fear that resonate in their lives.  Sort of like 'Pan's Labyrinth' for children, country kids Jesse (Josh Hutcherson) and newcomer Leslie (Anna Sophia Robb) both find a land of enchantment that's only a swing on a rope away across the river.  Mending their lives and making it more meaningful, they both learn to enjoy and draw--pun intended--from their talents and friendship in their ordinary lives.<br /><br />Based on Katherine Patterson's Newbery Award winning novel, 'Bridge to Terabithia' is a list topping family movie that adults will love as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>A well-made, well-envisioned (it's based on a book) adventure family film about growing up and being a kid at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>Based upon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060734019">the award-winning book</a> by Katherine Paterson, Bridge to Terabithia is a touching film about the bond between two children, both of them outcasts, who learn the importance of friendship and the power of imagination. The screenplay was written by Jeff Stockwell and co-written by David Paterson, the author's son, so the film remains quite faithful to the spirit of the book. The director, Gabor Csupo, handles the emotionally charged story with skill and sensitivity, which only heightens the impact of the events therein.<br /><br />Jess Aarons has two passions in life: drawing and running. He draws so that he can escape into a world of his own, so that he can escape the demands of his stern father and constant harassment from his sisters, and the bullying he endures at school. He runs because he wants to be the fastest boy at his school, which in his eyes is the only way to win the respect of his peers and his father. But his dream of being the fastest runner is dashed to pieces when his new next-door neighbor, Leslie Burke, beats him in the race on the first day of school. At first, Jess holds a grudge against Leslie. That changes when he discovers her free-spirited nature, which earns her the reputation of being weird. Together, Jess and Leslie create an imaginary world where they can be themselves without fear of social ostracization. They become the closest of friends and they look out for one another. Still, their friendship differences sometimes cause conflict. Jess' family is large and is struggling financially, while Leslie's family comprises only of her parents and her and they are wealthy, and Jess' family goes to church, but Leslie's doesn't. In spite of these differences their mutual respect and admiration blossoms into innocent, unconditional love. However this time of happiness is intruded upon by a horrible accident, which leaves Jess angry and questioning his faith. He is ultimately strengthened by his friendship with Leslie, and he begins to reach out to other people, even those that he never would have before.<br /><br />It's unfortunate, but when Walt Disney Studios and Walden media advertised this film, they presented it as being a fantasy/adventure film. This is hardly the case. Bridge to Terabithia is a family film about the problems of life and the inevitable and painful lessons we have to learn in order to grow. It's a film about childhood innocence and the loss of that innocence, as we mature into adulthood. But most importantly, the film is about letting your imagination carry you away from your troubles just long enough for you to find the solutions, and about letting your love free you from your fears. Bridge to Terabithia is a film that will move its viewers, both the young and the young at heart.<br />The story is propelled by the talented cast, especially Josh Hutcherson as Jess, AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie, Robert Patrick as Josh's father, Jack and Zooey Deschanel as Josh's teacher, Ms. Edmunds (whose beautifully emotive blue eyes illuminate the screen in every scene she's in).<br /><br />The DVD includes these bonus features: Digital Imagination featurette, Behind the Scenes featurette, Keep Your Mind Wide Open music video by AnnaSophia Robb, two audio commentaries with cast and crew, and previews.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800177991">My Girl</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JG6M">The Indian in the Cupboard</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LK94">Fly Away Home</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428247">The Mighty</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005B4BI">Pay it Forward</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLYQ">Holes</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0WO">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EDOC5Q">The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA6CPE">Charlotte's Web</a></p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region-A<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />Running time: 1:35:31<br />Movie size: 24,41 GB<br />Disc size: 30,24 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 22.63 Mbps<br /><br />LPCM 5.1 6912Kbps 48 Khz/24-bit English<br />DD AC3 5.1 640Kbps English / French / Spanish<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Spanish<br /><br />#Behind the Book: The Themes of Bridge to Terabithia<br />#Digital Imagination: Bringing Terabithia to Life<br />#Music Video: AnnaSophia Robb<br />#Commentary by Director Gaber Csupo, Writer Jeff Stockwell and Producer Hal Lieberman<br />#Commentary with actors Josh Hucherson & AnnaSophia Rubb, who are joined by Producer Lauren Levine</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>Bridge to Terabithia is about 2 kids named Jess and Leslie who, together, build their own magical kingdom in the forest. I bought this movie maybe a year ago and was impressed with it and the moral to it. Basically the moral is that you should appreciate who you are and don't let anybody (bullies) tell you any different. I think that really brought out the story. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb did an excellent job playing the parts of Jess Aarons and Leslie. If you like calm and touching movies, then I recommend Bridge to Terabithia for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Magnificently adapted from the acclaimed Katherine Paterson novel, "Bridge to Terabithia" is an enticingly unique children's fantasy. Outstanding performances by child stars AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson drive the film, which delves into the world of imagination, fantasy and the circumvention of unpleasant realities. The staggeringly tragic elements in the film are almost too morose for younger audiences, but brings with it meaningful lessons in morality, values and acknowledgement for the importance of friendships.<br /><br />The fastest kid in the fifth grade, Jess (Josh Hutcherson), reluctantly befriends the new student Leslie (AnnaSophia) when they realize they are not only neighbors, but comparable outsiders in their class. Encountering the typical struggles of elementary school kids, such as bullies and not fitting in with the "cool" kids, Leslie teaches Jess to use his imagination more frequently to escape whatever unpleasantries he might face. Together they convert a debilitated, abandoned tree-house deep in the forest into their own magical kingdom named Terabithia, and they visit it each day to daydream and live out their fantasies as noble rulers of their realm. When tragic events disrupt their peaceful play, newfound lessons in believing the impossible help them overcome utter heartbreak.<br /><br />The two stars AnnaSophia Robb (who you may recognize from 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and Josh Hutcherson are markedly phenomenal and embody Paterson's characters with such authenticity and sincerity that your eyes will be glued to the screen. You feel for these characters, relate to them and recognize their reasoning. Their adolescent imaginations are inspirational and memorable, as they realize that conceiving a fictitious world to govern is a harmless escape from reality that fuels their creativity and happiness. Several of the other characters, including their classmates and Josh's father (Robert Patrick, the T-1000) are properly stereotypical; we see every familiar niche from school, including the bullies, the cool kids, and the nerds. These patterned figures enhance our understanding for Leslie and Jess, solidify their outsider stances, and justify nearly all of their actions. Zooey Deschanel plays Miss Edmunds, the music teacher, who classically and humorously creates a love triangle for Jess. Entranced by his teacher, and later blaming himself for inconsiderately trying to spend time with her as opposed to Leslie, this innocent crush adds to the realism of the 11-year-old's mindset.<br /><br />In the film, Leslie dubs their imaginary kingdom "Terabithia" which is supposedly a made-up name devised on the spur of the moment. However, one of the aspects the film leaves out, probably to avoid any comparisons to the incredibly popular Chronicles of Narnia, is that Leslie has read and enjoyed Narnia and other C.S. Lewis stories, and designs her kingdom around the ground-rules set forth in those books. One of Lewis' stories contains an island named Terebinthia, which Leslie purportedly would have subconsciously borrowed when naming the magical land. (There is also a tree found in the bible called a terebinth tree, so Lewis may not have been all that original either.)<br /><br />For anyone who has read the novel and enjoyed it, this film is an amazingly faithful adaptation, and will certainly appeal to those existing fans. More interestingly though, will be the reactions of newcomers who are not yet familiar with the events of the story. It's difficult to discuss the film without giving away major plot points, and ironically the filmmakers sent out publications and press kits with written pleas to journalists not to give away those monumental details. The story is well worth reading, and the movie well worth watching, targeting families and more specifically elementary school students. My advice is to simply see the film for yourself, as it is loaded with thought-provoking themes and morals that may be difficult to discuss and easier to watch through the use of this revelatory visual delight.<br /><br />- Mike Massie, [...]</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>This is a strange movie. It's largely realistic, but it has a streak of fantasy that might have been better if it were implied or gauzed over with effects that suggested menace and creatures without really showing them.<br />The plot is familiar. Jesse, a teenage boy, although big and husky enough lets himself get bullied at school. He's an outsider (what else is new?), the butt of jokes; he's a fast runner, and has a gift for art. He is alienated from his mother and father and two of his four sisters. (His two nasty sisters are reminiscent of Cinderella's two caustic step-sisters.) He is close to one little sister. A strange new free soul of a girl, Leslie, comes to school, outraces Jesse, and eventually they become soul mates who discover a fantasy world.<br />The stereotypical schoolyard bullies are in play. Leslie's father is like an empathetic resurrected hippie while Jesse's tough-minded dad takes an awful long time to come around. The movie has a good message to convey, and it holds your interest although some clich&eacute;s and stock characters and time-worn plot devices are in evidence. It's about misfits who triumph. Highly recommended for kids of all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>I've never read the book and based my purchase of the DVD based on the TV ads for the movie. I was expecting a lot of fantasy/ computer generated stuff but found the bulk of the movie to drag on in an almost boring manner. Two depressed, miserable children with few/ no friends who meet and become friends through their shared fantasy world- not much for the little ones in that outline is there?<br />The movie does have many interesting moments but there is very little that would be funny or entertaining for small children, and a little after church discussion that some would not want their children to hear.<br />I found the extras to be the best part of the DVD for me, including the bit with the author saying she supported the movie and her son being a producer- it must be fairly close to the original text of the book wth that then I guess.<br />I won't be watching this one often, but like another reviewer, I'd like to see what the two young stars do in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Parents should be aware that this movie is NOT a fantasy/sci-fi film despite the way it's being marketed. I think the studio decided that most viewers would have read the book before seeing it, and therefore decided that the somewhat-misleading campaign was okay. I'd be very angry if I had watched it with younger children. If you are hoping for a "Chronicles of Narnia" "Wizard of Oz" or "Harry Potter"-type film, STAY AWAY!<br /><br />This movie is entertaining for adults and teens, with its fabulous tales of make-believe and the dilemma we can all relate to - children fleeing bullies and the cruel world that is public school - but tragedy keeps it from being a real family movie. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 12 or 13. I expected to see a fantasy movie, and this was anything but.<br /><br />The best thing about "Bridge to Terabithia" is not its terrific special effects, or even its story, but the fabulous performances from its youthful stars. I hope to see more of them in the future, and hope they don't get lost in Hollywood's child-star mill.<br /><br />But, again, it is NOT a film for children. A friend compared his family's experience to him bringing a puppy home for his kids and then shooting it in front of them. This is most emphatically NOT a movie to share with your children, unless you want to see them cry bitterly - and NOT remember the movie with fondness afterwards.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Ten-year old Jess, bullied at school and ignored at home, meets new girl Leslie, who's also looked upon as a weirdo and outsider.  The two become friends and use their imagination to turn a secret spot in the woods into a beautiful kingdom.  In "Terabithia," they rule over the strange but good creatures and battle the Dark Lord.  Everything is great, until one day when Jess doesn't come to play.<br /><br />This movie could have, and should have been wonderful, with flights of fancy that made me say, "WOW!" and touching moments that left me teary.  Unfortunately, it missed the mark.  The fantasy land the children created wasn't that big of a deal; we only saw fleeting glimpses of it and never had time to be awed by its wonder and wish it were real.  The two young leads, Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, were competent, but not special.  Neither of them had the charisma to own the screen and make me care about them.  Of course, the big culprit was the script, which tried to include too much, ending up with not enough.  We get Jess' poverty, artistic talent, and loneliness, Leslie's quirkiness and pluck, the bullies at school, his crush on his teacher, and the often-annoying cute younger sister, complete with precious lisp; with all this, there wasn't time to make Terabithia seem real or as fantastic as it should have been.  The scene that should have elicited tears was abrupt and completely lacking in drama and power.  So, it's an OK movie if you're stuck watching it on a plane, but not a flick to buy, unless your kids are fans of the book.  2.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>As a movie about the lost powers of the imagination, "Terabithia" is a mixed blessing.  Kids today have a lot of digital and electronic crutches on which to prop up their creative spirit; it's nice for a story to encourage the limitless scope of the human mind.  Fifteen year old Jesse Aarons, an aspiring artist, has a home life that offers little in the way of dream nourishment, so it is no surprise when he quickly befriends the New Girl In School, Leslie Burke, a young naif with a spirit as wholesome and wide-eyed as her cute little face.<br /><br />Jesse and Leslie soon discover their own little paradise in the woods behind their house.  They call this land Terabithia and dress it up with their "wide open" minds.  Disney helps the jaded viewer out by giving us sometimes rich, sometimes ambivalent CGI depictions of their pretend world, but they are rare.  This is just as well; the movie wants us to rediscover the wonder of our own minds, but it leaves very little of the story up to our own imaginations.<br /><br />I have to wonder if the emotion of the film (and it wants to have so much emotion) wouldn't have more impact if there was more humanity to back it up.  It shows us a world of heartless bullies (some misunderstood and hurting; some just plain malicious), pesky but endearing little sisters, and happy vs. struggling homes, and then balances this out with brief moments of care-free, play-land giddiness.  It can't have both, at least not in equal measure.  It sacrifices some of its heart and soul for the kindling flash of its fantasy world, and vice versa.<br /><br />By the time Jesse's absurdly hot music teacher, Ms. Edmonds, offers (out of the blue!) to take him (alone!) to a museum, it's hard to figure out just what is real and what isn't (this movie's world must exist before things like permission slips were invented).  At any rate, this becomes the marker for the movie's last bit of credibility, where Jesse and Leslie's world runs headlong into harsh reality.  What follows are a series of events that pretend to be saturated with import, but which are instead progressively longer and more maudlin.  By the time all was said and done, this reviewer felt cheated.  The flick pretended to be magical, but I could see the rabbits hiding in its hat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Bridge to Terebithia is two movies: a sweet and tender story of friendship based on the classic novel, and an unwieldy CGI creation that sits at right angles to the main story rather than enhancing it; the movie may still appeal to children, but as an adult I found that the special effects dragged on far too long and severely hindered the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>Yes, I get it. Kids are supposed to be imaginative. Okay so why wasn't the story? You have AnnaSophia Robb staring (brilliantly I might add) in a flick about an adolescent with an overactive imagination... yet her imagination is depicted for all of 20 minutes in a 90 minute flick. The creatures are mindless cardboard cutouts, meant to represent real-life characters in their everyday world, but they wind up being boring parodies of themself.<br /><br />The movie had great potential. Lots of area for conflict, what with a controlling "down on his luck" deadbeat dad and all. But in the end, the film would have been better if it had gone unmade. Or perhaps benefitted from about another half hour actually IN Terabithia.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RJXK6KF3LL5R.html">A1RJXK6KF3LL5R</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie.It shows true friendship and how important it is to have friends.A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>This is a sad film that never seems to develop a point or a plot and then the screen writer kills off the character(s) just to end the pain. Actually this is a film with too many plot beginnings but none ever seem to develop or go anywhere.  There is the relationship between the father and son, but that is never given any real motivation, developed in any meaningful way, and ends in a reconciliation without ever offering any rationale.  Then there is the interrelations between the family members that is hinted at but not explored.  Of course there is the almost plot regarding the school bullies, but that is set up and then abandoned as a plot line so it is never brought to any sort of point or conclusion.  Of course there is the relationship between Jess and Leslie which apparently is intended as the plot and it gets the most attention but it never seems to go anywhere which is unfortunate because this could have been a glorious film, but Terribithia appears in only the last two minutes of the film.  So the imagination which should have driven the film was hinted at but never developed.  Then there was the art and the art teacher which was again introduced as a possible subplot but then abandoned.  This entire film consisted of potential plot lines that are never explored leaving the entire film as a hash of directionless and pointless actions.  Then because there was no point and no plot bringing the film to any sort of conclusion required the death, which was again pointless and contributed nothing to the film, other than to stop the action and end the film.<br /><br />I gave the film two stars as a charitable contribution to the actors who did their best with a bad screen play.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>I was not a fan of this movie. I don't really understand who the target audience is supposed to be. It's too childish and slow for most adults and it's too sad for kids, especially younger ones. The storyline and ending are a huge downer. There isn't really anything cute, funny or witty about this movie. It is also billed as a "fantasy" which as other reviwers mentioned is false advertising. This is a DRAMA, not a fantasy movie. Any fantasy scenes are short, probably not even 10 minutes out of the whole movie.<br /><br />The story seems like a ripoff of the movie "My Girl" only the genders of the kids are reversed and there are a few unimpressive fantasy scenes thrown in which do nothing for the plot other than drag it out. The one big difference here= The movie "My Girl" had a plot, had better acting, better character development and it had some humor and realism to balance out the sad ending. I don't mind a sad ending if the story was worth it. The Bridge to Terriblebithia isn't worth it. It is a tragedy of a movie with an equally tragic ending!</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>This review tells a bit about the plot, so stop if you don't want the ending spoiled. This movie is represented as a fantasy adventure; however, it is not. The movie is about two middle school aged children, who develop a friendship and a world of imagination in which to go. The movie changes direction about two-thirds of the way through. These two factors combine to make the climax of the movie very sad indeed. With that being said, the movie was good in its way. A girl teaches a boy to use his imagination not only to have fun and relax, but to face the challenges of life. The girl and the boy become good friends.<br /><br />Thus the movie is about friendship, empathy, family, imagination and loyalty. The acting is good. Josh is a little wooden. Robb is delightful as the girl. The little sister was very good.  The CGI was restrained and well done. The plot is ok.<br /><br />The end is good. It is hard to figure out who this movie is targeted for. I thought it felt too young for an adult. High school kids wouldn't be interested.  One of the major characters dies in the movie. Although the death is off screen, younger children may be disturbed by it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>This would be a great film to show in a college level grief counseling class or a course dealing with Post Traumatic Stress disorders. Nor am I being sarcastic. Bridge to Terabithia is truly a legitimate film to study in a college psychology course dealing with these issues.  It shows the adults  in the story trying their best to help the surviving child cope with an all too common tragedy -  death by drowning of a friend.<br /><br />However, this film is overwhelming with grief.  I have enough in my own personal life, as many of us do, that I don't need to pay to watch it on the big screen, too.  I'm not asking for only mindless entertainment. But when out-of-the-blue, in the middle of the story, in what started off as a delightful fantasy - turns into a gloomy melodrama - then I have a problem reconciling my need for entertainment with the filmmaker's need to demoralize his or her audience!<br /><br />I also want to make it clear this movie is not appropriate for young children, unless you want to expose them to the tragedy of sudden death, and all its raw emotions.<br /><br />Its extremely rare that a film leaves me in such a sour mood. Perhaps it's because, as a young teen, a classmate of mine drowned since he did not know how to swim. A stupid way to die - to put it mildly. So if any lesson can be taken from this movie it is this:  Make sure you teach your children how to swim - along with making them understand & respect the power of water!</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>It's really, really hard to find a truly wonderful "children's movie" these days.  When Hollywood focuses mainly on completely CGI movies that make subtle jokes about marijuana and flatulence, it makes a guy yearn for the movies of the nineties, the ones filled with wonder and heart.  Movies like "Indian in the Cupboard", "Lion King", and "Home Alone."  Movies like "Beethoven",  "The Land Before Time" (the original one), and any other classic that made the eyes well up.<br /><br />"Bridge to Terabithia" does just that--and more.<br /><br />This modest but fantastic movie centers around a young loner named Jess, and his relationship with the eccentric but quirky dreamer, Leslie, who has just moved into the house next to his.  The two of them travel through the woods, using their imagination to see ordinary happenings as magical events.  Together, they see squirrels and bullies as monsters they can defeat through cunning, and they see the woods as the fantastical land of Terabithia.<br /><br />This movie doesn't shy away from the rougher topics.  It gives a realistic portrayal of hardships kids face in school, the impact death has on people both young and old, friendship, imagination, family life, as well as religion.  These young actors, especially Annasophia Robb, who plays Leslie, and the young Bailee Madison, who plays Jess's younger sister May Belle.  Josh Hutcherson is also a standout as Jess, as is the music teacher who he has a crush on, acted perfectly by Zooey Deschanel.  Everything about this movie seems well balanced, perfect.<br /><br />This movie has what most other modern flicks lack, and that's heart.  And that makes this movie truly wonderful.  I'm going to go out and buy the book a-sap.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>Bridge To Terabithia is one of the best children's fantasy films in decades. It's comparable to The Neverending Story and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7O3I">Explorers</a>, a couple of my favorites from the '80s, and in my opinion it's even better than Chronicles of Narnia, though I don't expect many Narnia fans to agree. This one doesn't have too much fantasy, just a few sequences from the imagination of the two child protagonists. But the story around that is profoundly moving with useful lessons for the whole family, including a practical demonstration of a Teddy Roosevelt quotation: "Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing," - and much more.<br /><br />I've seen over 4,000 movies, includig at least 3 or 4 new ones a month, and this is my favorite in years, certainly the best in the past six months (my favorite last year was The Prestige), and I like it more than Harry Potter, because it's more serious. I see other reviewers making much of the fact that a movie has a sad part. But what's sadder is that so many supposedly adult viewers can so thoroughly miss the point of any movie with a message more complicated than "bang," or think children can and should be shielded from the knowledge of death by censoring it from all fiction.  Think of how many wonderful books or movies would be spoiled -<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007M5II">A Dog of Flanders</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800177991">My Girl</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QBA2GA">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008MTY8">The Courtship of Eddie's Father</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z322O">I Remember Mama</a>, Bambi, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416505520">Citizen of the Galaxy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302593360">On Borrowed Time</a> - just to name a few off the top of my head.<br /><br />The cast is terrific too, with the lovely Zooey Deschanel (Elf) as the teacher, and, really getting the point across with exceptional acting, Josh Hutcherson (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ES9E">Little Manhattan</a>), Anna Sophia Robb (Because of Winn-Dixie), and Robert Patrick (The X-Files).  The fact that some critics were so affected by the death in the film is a testament to the effectiveness of the movie, especially Hutcherson's acting, as well as that of Robert Patrick and Anna-Sophia Robb (there's no actual death scene in the film, so it's really Hutcherson's reaction that's so affecting).<br /><br />By the way, if you enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6ES9E">Little Manhattan</a>, this one has some similarities including the same fine acting by Hutcherson and some brief special effects sequences representing the children's imagination -- though this is more serioius and somewhat sadder.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I can only imagine all the little kids in the movie theater crying their eyes out as the sweet little girl cracked her head on a rock and drowned in the river. And did they have to bring religion into it? Since she wasn't a Christian, we can only assume that she is indeed burning in hell. This movie sends out a lot of negative messages to children like, if someone is bullying you, create fake documents to publicly humiliate that person.<br /><br />2 stars for the acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>It is not an innocent Disney-Fantasy. It is a tragedy (tragic play). SPOILER FOLLOWS.<br />There is bullying throughout the movie. Then a teacher dating a student. And to cap it all off a dead leading character girl. It may be a great tragedy-movie. But it is really bad as a Disney-movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>When I was a kid, I wanted the world to work that way. I wanted the trees to talk back, war with imaginary villains, and fly with the birds. I really felt it and so did the main characters of the story.<br /><br />Josh Hutcherson, who is no stranger to acting already, starring in 15 plus films plays quiet and artistic Jesse Aarons who usually finds himself the [...] of jokes by the loud and obnoxious fellow students at his public school. Hutcherson is terrific and such an amazing lead actor in this film. I think kids will love watching him and really relate to his situation and really respect him and follow him. I hope he continued to get some really great roles. Also really terrific is AnnaSophia Robb who plays unique dreamer Leslie Burke who befriends Jesse and together they have incredible adventures together and form a lasting friendship. AnnaSophia is such a sweetheart and really does bring Leslie to life as this carefree, deep thinking, happy, spirited little girl. She really is the perfect Disney girl and probably has a promising career as such ahead of her. Also terrific is 8 year old Bailee Madison who plays the irrepressible and adorable May Belle Aarons who is really heading towards the same fate that Jesse finds himself in, in the real world. Jesse takes her under his wing and shows her the magic world that him and Leslie have created. Robert Patrick is also just terrific as the Aarons' father, Jesse Sr. Patrick's character is not a bad guy at all!! In fact he is desperately trying to provide for his family, and has simply been worn by the world around him. He wants his children to be raised to be strong providers especially his only son. The supporting cast is also terrific with key performances by Zooey Deschanel, Lauren Clinton, and Cameron Wakefield.<br /><br />The movie bounced back and fourth between the friend's school life and their imaginary world. The two loved each other more than anyone could love and didn't even show it with a kiss. This movie should of been longer. 90 minutes seems to be the typical time for a movie but this one probably needed 15 minutes more. I wanted to see more of their world as it showed just a fair amount in my opinion (kind of like how Pan's Labyrith was - great film by the way). Movies are marketed different now a days and some viewers may be disappointed. I saw this movie more as drama than an adventure.<br /><br />I never read the book but I'm hearing Disney kept it very similar to it. I like that a lot as I hear "Eragon" wasn't even close. This isn't a better fantasy film I've seen in years, I just wish they had more but still a movie to see with the kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A8S11VP9Z36D6.html">A8S11VP9Z36D6</a><br/><p>What a treat this film was. Unlike the marketing campaign which makes this film look like a Narnia-style movie, this movie is very simple in its storytelling, with a few fantasy elements thrown in. What makes it so refreshing is that children are shown creating their own world of play, without the spoon-fed creativity killing trappings of an ipod or video game. AnnaSophia Robb is amazing; she lights up the screen with her smile and endearing performance. Warning: this movie is a tearjerker, and especially for young children, can be somewhat intense. However, the themes are handled well and if watched with a supervised adult, the discussion that could follow the watching of this film would be enlightening.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This is a wonderful coming-of-age story that can be enjoyed by all ages.  Though a bitter-sweet ending, it's an enchanting film. The story touches on the struggles of a young boy growing up with three sisters and few friends.  When a new girl moves in with a huge imagination, she helps him open up a brand new world.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>This is a wonderful film for upper elementary/middle school students and up. Though it deals with imagination and fantasy it is definitely not a fantasy movie but a coming of age film that addresses the difficult subject of the sudden death of a young person.  I have to agree  with another poster that the young music teacher showed ridicuously poor judgement in taking Jess to the art museum without any other people present but do not let that spoil this wonderful movie for you.  The two young actors playing Jess and Leslie are amazing and the whole thing is well acted and beautifully executed.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>The story starts in a dismally familiar way - a family with not enough to go around, a school full of bullies, and unique interests that set Jess apart from all the other kids. Then Leslie arrives. The new kid is an outcast too, so Jess and Leslie end up being outcasts together. Leslie has many skills, but one that seems truly magical. She has an overflowing imagination, the kind that envelops everyone around her if they let it. Jess lets himself become part of it, and is suddenly king of a realm filled with giants, winged warriors, and other impossible beings.<br /><br />It's a Disney movie, so it's put together well and it's filled with cute kids and identifiable stereotypes. Special effects are just that - special, used with a light hand until the final scene. The story is easy for kids to understand, but the plot includes a troubling major event from which it never quite seemed to recover. If your little one is at all skittish, you might want to read the book so she's properly prepared for that part of the movie.<br /><br />Only one element of the story looked out of place, where a teacher takes Jess on a Saturday "field trip" alone, and with sketchy parental knowledge. The book is over twenty years old now. Maybe, back then, that could seem as safe and encouraging as it was meant to look. We no longer live in that naive world. Although it was in fact quite innocent, it has a dark, creepy appearance to modern eyes. Any parent of young kids will want to have a long talk about that after the movie, or maybe before, or maybe both.<br /><br />Still, it's an enjoyable flick. The child actors are engaging, and the balance of fantasy with gritty reality comes off well. And, whatever you may think of that tragic defining moment, such things really do happen, and kids have to deal with them. If a kid in your life faces a shock of that kind, there might be value in knowing that other kids faces shocks too, and make it through them.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Bridge to Terabithia is a film that captures the imagination. But behind the imagination, it is a film about being a kid and developing friendships as well as conflicting experiences that children also have to deal with.  And with most Disney films, there is a moral behind the story that is accentuated with the main character Jess Anderson (Josh Hutcherson).<br /><br />Jess is a boy who lives with three sisters and loves to draw.  Throughout the film he draws in his sketchbook, but his father does no understand him.  His world somewhat lightens up during the first day of class when a new girl shows up, Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb), who also happens to live next door to his house, and helps him to see that he is talented.  And straight to the chase, the two become friends and spend time together sharing anecdotes about each of their lives.  One day they venture out into a wooded area where they create a world of their own; they are free to be anything they want, and the world is indeed their oyster.<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia also confronts childhood dilemmas. Who has not been taunted by a bully, a person who tries to dominate one's world?  Janice (Lauren Clinton), an eighth-grader, is the school bully who refuses entry to all who need to use the girl's room, and the only way to pass is to pay her a dollar.  Jess's sister, May Belle (Bailee Anderson), is constantly bullied by Janice in a very childish manner, taking Bailee's twinkie or refusing her entry to the restroom.  But it is surprising to see how the tables are turned on her, and how she is portrayed in Jess and Leslie's forest of imagination.  In addition, the concluding scenes in the film takes on a serious issue that slightly changes the mood of the film.<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia emphasizes kindness and unselfishness toward others.  And for those who remember playing in a tree-house or playing in the woods and enrapturing one's self in a world of pure imagination, this film will definitely conjure up childhood memories.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>As a young boy I often had dreams of flying. The dreams were so vivid that even today I'm not entirely certain that I didn't fly. Disney has created another masterpiece based on a wonderful book. When a young boy living on a farm has only his little sister rooting for him when he foot races, he resigns himself to fantasy in his drawings. Soon new neighbors move in and a girl his own age shows up at school. There is something quite different about her. She writes with the imaginative vision of a great author. As they become close friends and share their dreams of Terabithia, they also grow in their relationships with others. Understand that unfortunately life is not always kind. Disney like they did in "Eight Below" show us that when there is loss of life, we must continue on and remember those we've lost in what we do. I rented this, but I will no doubt buy the DVD now that I have seen it. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Personally, I believe one of the reasons for Terabithia's relative underwhelming box-office was its marketing campaign. From the trailers and the initial buzz, it sounded like it was going to be a sort of spiritual follow-up to Chronicles of Narnia with big effects, action set-pieces and the like. But when a family film with human elements mixed in with creatures now and then came out, people were like "wha? where's all the flashy stuff?" It's too bad since, on occasion the film has a few flaws, this is actually quite an entertaining film even if you don't watch with kids.<br /><br />Jess is one of those kids that grows up with in a hard-working family that struggles to make ends meet (just a suggestion: maybe not have so many kids?). Secondhand clothes and can't even get a new pair of shoes, he's picked on a lot at school. Enter Leslie who is of a more wealthier family but her quirky likes and attitudes gets her much disdain from others also. But with Jess's love for art and Leslie's overactive imagination, the 2 quickly bond and using the woods nearby their houses, they imagine a fantasy world named Terabithia with creatures and various races and start to learn about growing up and making long-lasting friendships.<br /><br />Now, I will admit that the more fantasy aspects of the story might be seen as out of place. If you're putting in effects, why not go full-throttle right? But that's not the point here which uses the Terabithia world to show kids imagining to escape their real lives. Bullies take on the forms of different races in their make-believe world and adults who don't know how to deal with children who are growing older. But it sort of livens up the film by showing the Weta effects since if they were taken out, this thing would be schmaltzy like crazy. It's mainly story-driven which might make it that sort of catch-22 feeling: too character driven for the younger crowd and not enough wonder for the older crowd.<br /><br />It's also great to see that the bulk of the film is focused on 2 actors who are NOT annoying. While not a flashy role, Josh Hutcherson plays that character who's surprised yet down-to-earth about the real world and the fantasy one without overplaying one of them. Getting the more flashier role is AnnaSophia Robb who reminds me of a younger Natalie Portman who has quite a stage presence although her more wilder flights of fancy could be dialed down since she always seems "on". Also kudos for casting the way-too-adorable-to-be-real Zooey Deschanel and Robert Patrick playing Jess's dad.<br /><br />I should mention the ending since that's what got the biggest attention. It follows the book as far as tone and although it's quite a big development in the film, I can understand why people won't like it since kid movies aren't meant to be this "heavy". But considering many of us remember Bambi's mother and watching those kind of films, here it makes sense and handled perfectly.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to kids although I'm not sure what they'll think of it. It's not as visually exciting as Narnia or cool as Harry Potter but for an adult, it's quite enjoyable so at least if your kids don't like it, at least you can.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>I had never read Katherine Paterson's YA novel of the same name and when I came across this DVD at my local library, I was captivated by the synopsis and decided to view it with my seven-year old daughter.<br /><br />The film adaptation is beautifully done, and most of the credit goes to the two young stars who play the central characters. Fifth grader Jesse (Josh Hutcherson, who was also in [[ASIN:B000DBHX4M Zathura (Special Edition)]) lives out in the country with his parents and four siblings (two older sisters who could not give him the time of day, a baby sister, and a very young Bailee Madison playing eight-year-old May Belle). Jesse's family barely scrapes by on the meager wages brought in by his dad (Robert Patrick) who works at a hardware store and also grows vegetables which he then sells to make ends meet. Jesse's relationship with his dad is tense because the older man is strict and consumed by his own financial worries. Jesse is also a loner at school, finding himself without any real friend. Jesse's only solace is his art and portfolio of drawings.<br /><br />Then a new family moves in next door and Jesse's entire perspective on life changes. Leslie (Anna Sophia Robb) is lovely, confident, and possessed of a sunny disposition. There's nothing that fazes this young girl, not the resident school bully, a surly eighth grader, nor anyone else who tries to ruffle her good nature. Soon Leslie befriends Jesse and the pair find they are both blessed with great imagination. The pair find their very own refuge from the outside world in a part of the woods that seems to have been forgotten by the rest of humanity. Here the pair really give free rein to their fantasy and imaginations, creating a hideaway in a magical land they nickname Terabithia.<br /><br />Inevitably, harsh reality intrudes in the form of tragedy, and the rest of the story focuses on how one of the main characters forges ahead despite grief and a sense of loss. This heartwarming, inspiring, and heartbreaking story makes for wonderful family entertainment. My daughter and I had an interesting discussion after the movie ended about some of the themes in the movie such as compassion, empathy, and friendship.

Pretty good, and there are some surprising twists that I wouldn't expect. One review described it as "Chronicles of Narnia" meets an After School Special. Pretty accurate, IMO. Hits a little too hard upon the Bible a couple times for my taste (at least 'Narnia' was more subtle about it), but otherwise an entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>Don't hold your breathe for that nomination, because the category doesn't exist and how sad for the awards ceremony that there is probably an award for best assistant on set. I was really surprised by this film considering the misleading marketing of this film. By the way it begins though, I was saying, "Man, what did I get myself into?" I stuck through it, thinking that I had rented some High School Musical, but then was drawn by the energy of the children acting superbly. This movie all of the sudden pulls the trigger on you and I was left flacid, weak, and sobbing. I never in my wildest dreams would have guessed it. I mean, By the cover of this thing I was hoping for some uppity Chronicles of Narnia or something. I had no idea I was in for some well acted movie that operates on multiple levels, yet never loses sight of its simplistic yet pure messege. This movie was more like Some Robert Redford Film back in the days when he tackled depressed adolescents coping with torturous loss. This movie is an infusion, a gratifying injection of tenacious feel goodness. Thank God that I stumbled upon this, and NO thanks to marketing.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Bridge to Terabithia" is that rare movie about enchantment that really is enchanting.  Based on the novel by Katherine Paterson, this is like a more kid-friendly version of "Pan's Labyrinth," in that both films deal with unhappy children who retreat into a fully realized world of fantasy - the difference being that, in this case at least, it is a world seemingly of their own making.<br /><br />Jesse Aarons, a local farm boy, is a regular target of bullies at school, while Leslie Burke is the new kid in town, never an easy thing to be when you're an underclassman in a school full of obnoxious, belligerent eighth graders who don`t mind showing you who`s boss every time you walk down the hallway or dare to use the lavatory.  The two new friends obviously need a place to get away from their troubles, so in the forest nearby, they create the imaginary kingdom of Terabithia, filled with wondrous creatures and non-threatening ogres, that becomes increasingly actualized as the story goes on.<br /><br />"Bridge to Terabithia" succeeds by  keeping it uncluttered and simple and by focusing more on the daily lives of Jesse and Leslie than on their adventures in the forest.  Fantasy, the film seems to be saying, is for those special times when reality gets to be just a bit too much to handle, but that the real, everyday world is the place we all must inhabit for most of our time here on earth.  The movie is all in favor of childhood imagination, but not at the expense of real world experiences and relationships.<br /><br />The tricky premise  is brought to charming cinematic life by writers Jeff Stockwell and David Paterson, director Gabor Csupo, and the special effects experts who understand that less is often more when it comes to making the fantastical real and believable on screen.  But primary credit goes to the utterly winning performances by Josh Hutcherson, Anna Sophia Robb, and six-year old Bailee Madison, who, as Jesse's adorable kid sister, reminds one of Drew Barrymore in her early "E.T." days.  All three do a lovely job embodying the youthful exuberance and openhearted wonder that are so much a part of the movie's vision and theme.<br /><br />Parents should note that, while the movie may be too emotionally wrenching for very young children (there`s an unusually stark plot development towards the end of the film), it is ideal viewing for slightly older kids and younger teens.  It's great fun, too, for adults not yet too jaded and cynical to tap into the dream.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>so it was sad but that really wasn't a BIG part of the movie. A good family type movie. It deals with death so beware. It was a good movie.<br /><br />Two teens becoming best friends after a friendly foot race. They create a fantasy world to enter when life in the real world gets a bit hectic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>While Bridge To Terabithia is a good effort by any standard, the story itself hardly rises above a typical Hallmark channel offering. Based on the book by Katherine Paterson, it tells the story of two Middle School (then Junior High School) children that are treated like outcasts in their school: Jesse, played by Josh Hutcherson (Zathura), and Leslie, played by AnnaSophia Robb (Charlie And The Chocolate Factory). Add to that the fact that Jesse is alienated from his overly strict dad, played by Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), and his unsympathetic sisters - except for his youngest sister, May Belle, played by Bailee Madison. She almost worships the ground he walks on.<br /><br />To deal with their misery, Jesse and Leslie escape into the woods and into a world of imagination, which Jesse feeds with his artwork and Leslie with her writing. On the other side of the river from their homes, they build a kingdom they call Terabithia. There, they find an abandoned tree house, which they renovate and believe turns into their castle whenever they visit. Every afternoon, they cross the river and, together, rule the Kingdom of Terabithia.<br /><br />As their friendship and imaginations grow, they soon have to confront the residents of their imaginary world: horrible harry birds and giant squirrels that attack them mercilessly. There is also a dark prince, whose shadow they see lurking among the trees from time to time. And there is a giant.<br /><br />Outside of each other, the two kids have few friends, except for their music teacher, Miss Edmonds, played by Zooey Deschanel (Elf), who takes an interest in them and their abilities. One day, Miss Edmonds invites Jesse to take a field trip with her to an art museum. The events of that day change everything in Jesse and Leslie's world. I love the scene between Jesse and his dad in each other's arms in the woods as a result of those events. And I love what Jessie does at the end for his sister, May Belle.<br /><br />It's a good cast, and a good story - but it's not exceptional. Gabor Csupo does a good job directing, and Jeff Stockwell and David Paterson do a fine job adapting the book. While the story is timely, in that it deals with a subject that almost every boy faces at that age - alienation from his dad - and almost every student faces at a new school, it is somehow mundane. You would expect the imaginary world to lift the story to an otherworldly level, but it doesn't. Even with animation by the same people who worked on Chronicles Of Narnia and Lord Of The Rings, there just isn't enough of it to do the trick. We spend far too much time in the real, and sometimes boring, world of Junior High.<br /><br />I love the relationships, especially between Jesse and Leslie, Jesse and May Belle, and Jesse and his dad. That is the best part of the film. I was disappointed when I watched the extra features to learn that the creatures in Terabithia were supposed to be adaptations of different ones of the students who persecuted Jesse and Leslie, because that didn't come across at all. I didn't see any resemblance.<br /><br />This was a good effort, but a modest story.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br></body></html>

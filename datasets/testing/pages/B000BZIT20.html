For its 25th anniversary, Fox Entertainment released a new &quot;director's cut&quot; of the film into theatres. While it didn't do nearly as well as they had hoped, the new two-disc DVD features both the original classic and the new director-approved edition. <p>While &quot;Alien&quot; may not quite be viewed by today's audiences as the landmark suspense film that it was in its day, it is still an exceptionally-done and exciting film. Such moments as John Hurt's &quot;chest-burster&quot; sequence, the Ash robot struggle, and the concluding confrontation between Ripley and the Alien are all so thoroughly well-done. Having the sole survivor of the film be a female is still very rarely seen in films today though most of the film's other major plot twists have been ripped off time and time again by other film-makers over the years. <p>While the &quot;director's cut&quot; does feature some new added scenes, it actually runs a minute shorter than the original as Ridley Scott has also taken out scenes that he feels have not aged well. I actually prefer the older version though a new sequence featuring the infamous &quot;cocoon&quot; scene is worth checking out. Both versions feature a full-length commentary from the cast and crew including Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver. <p>This double-disc edition has even more special features to offer than just both versions of the movie. The featurettes on the making of the film are very intriguing and insightful and offer a glimpse into the potential problems that the crew faced. It's also interesting to learn that this film was actually originally planned as a low-budget Roger Corman picture. There's also so more deleted footage from the film that didn't make the &quot;director's cut&quot; on disc two. <p>If you are even a slight fan of the &quot;Alien&quot; series, this DVD has everything that you could possibly want. You can get this two-disc &quot;special edition&quot; either by itself or as part of the nine-disc &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; boxed set.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>This is a terrific movie! Alien is my second favorite space monster next to Predator, and the scariness and cool fight scenes of this film were terrific, as were the gross parts with blood and acid and  ooze! I thought the Aliens were scary looking and plenty evil and powerful, and it ends in a way you'd never guess! Alien's a very well made and classic movie, and I recommend it to all who enjoy  scary stuff! As I said, it's a terrific movie! See it!</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>&quot;Alien&quot; ranks as one of the movie's most brilliant thrillers.  As Ridley Scott says in the liner notes for the DVD, this &quot;director's cut&quot; just adds some deleted scenes from the original in exchange for some removals; however, the story remains the same and it's still worth viewing. Purists can be satisfied with original, also presented on disc one.<p>The second disc is a treat for every fan or anyone interested in the process of filmmaking.  With insightful commentary and &quot;making of&quot; anecdotes from all the cast (with the exception of Yaphet Kotto), director Scott, special effects wizard Brian Johnson, writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, composer Jerry Goldsmith, and a bevy of other creative talents, everything that one ever wanted to know about the film is here.<p>This DVD has the extras that most skimp on; it is truly a collector's treasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8AO9XASQ15C.html">A1R8AO9XASQ15C</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott's original 1979 film pulsates with dread and menace. Its darkened corridors mask a reptillian horror unmatched by any other in cinema. &quot;Alien&quot; scared the hell out of me when I saw it in its theatrical release, and the other night on DVD, it scared hell out of me again. Forget the sequels. This is one of the best movies of all time.<p>Yes, the story is simple, but that's the whole point. &quot;Alien&quot; is a fundamental horror story, your basic haunted house movie taken to the Nth degree. I love the fact it has only seven characters (OK, nine, if you count Mother and the alien itself ... the space jockey doesn't count). I love its simplicity, its straightforwardness. Aside from being a creepy, blood-curdling horror film (only &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and the original &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; top the chest-burster scene), it is also hard-core science fiction. James Cameron's sequel was an action-thriller (and an excellent one), and the subsequent sequels were just redundant. Scott's movie is the one for the ages.<p>It's about evil in a shape-shifting form. It's about our fear of the dark. It's about the bogeyman. It's about our irrational fear of creepy-crawlies, spiders, worms, snakes. It is by turns subtle and terrifying. It scares us by hiding the alien, revealing it only in bits and snatches (those exploding jaws!). There is surprisingly little blood; &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; was a revolting gore fest. And it's a thoughtful film. It actually pauses to consider what a miracle the alien is on a biological level, which helps reinforce the fear and mystery that surround the creature.<p>In fact, the whole film is soaked in mystery. What is the intent of the beacon that attracts the Nostromo? What is the nature of the alien pilot, its own chest exploded in a gruesome foreshadowing of Kane's fate? What laid those eggs? How long had they been waiting down in the bowels of that awesome ship? Was the full-grown alien male or female? What did it try to do with Brett and Dallas? How exactly does it kill Lambert and Parker? Questions left largely unanswered. Not a problem for me -- I like loose ends, things left to ponder. That's the difference between a &quot;plot&quot; and a &quot;story.&quot;<p>There's a hidden layer -- the fact that a faceless corporation sent those astronauts to their doom, knowingly, in order to extract the ultimate bioweapon. &quot;Alien&quot; is a subtle jab at Corporate America, the creature itself a representation of &quot;the company's&quot; blind, murderous greed.<p>See this movie. I repeat, if you love good movies, great movies, then seen this one. If you haven't already.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>After seeing the disappointing "Prometheus", one can appreciate the qualities of this classic which many regard as a retread of an inferior thriller, "It, the Terror from Space", which suffered from sub-par acting, a low budget and a lousy script. Not so with this film which featured Sigourney Weaver in an astounding debut along with a superb cast which included Tom Skerritt, Yaphett Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, and Ian Holm in roles so well defined that one cares what will happen to them which was missing in "Prometheus" with the exception of two characters. Also Scott wisely used a political message like Verhoven did in "RoboCop" about the individual versus the corporation and what happens when we follow rather than lead.  Another thing that Scott was allow us to know each of these character before the terror begins, slowly building suspense until it's unbearable but I don't mean to disparage his latest effort because despite some flaws it's still heads and tails above what Hollywood nowadays is producing since Noomi Rapace (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Michael Fassbinder (Shame, A Dangerous Method) really redemn the film.  Nevertheless if you like Scott and sci-fi films in general, this one's for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Alien is a science fiction horror film that was made in 1979 and directed by Ridley Scott. It stars Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, John Hurt, and Yaphet Kotto. It's mainly about the crew of spaceship Nostromo who go to answer a distress call of unknown origin on a distant planet before reaching Earth only to be stalked by an extremely aggressive extraterrestrial creature whom we all have come to know as Aliens. The film, itself, has garnered both critical acclaim and box office success, receiving an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Scott, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright, and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, along with numerous other award nominations. The film has spawned books, toys, videogames, and comic books due to its' success and, even today, is still considered one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. In my opinion, that's deservedly so.<br /><br />What makes this movie so great? The fact that it deliberately paces itself and builds up tension in the viewer with a great payoff in the end. Not only that but Director Ridley Scott gives you a visual aspect in the movie that's not seen before this film. The screenplay as well as the cast are rock solid enough that you invest in each of the characters. It's not your normal sci-fi movie, where too much time is spent on special effects and not on storyline.<br /><br />Except for the sequel, Aliens, no other movie in the series(I'm afraid) holds up quite as much as this one does. Don't get me wrong, Sigourney Weaver's performance in all of them are exceptional and each movie is well made but none build up the tension quite as much and hits quite as hard as this movie does. The Amazon reviewer who calls this movie overrated and drawn out is plain silly. Don't believe everything you read, folks...everyone percieves things differently.<br /><br />According to the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, Sigourney Weaver expressed interest in doing a fifth Alien movie with Scott returning to direct. That means we may not have seen the last of Ripley or of the Aliens. Honestly, I would love it if they did. Even though AvP/AvP:Requiem are good movies, they need to continue each series separately to keep anticipation high.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>The attractions in this  "classic" sci-fi film are (1) the incredible suspense; (2)  excellent photography and set design and (3) memorable horror scenes. They didn't overdo the action scenes, either, as is so often the case with modern-day films. In fact, some of this might be too slow-moving for some of today's audience.<br /><br />The suspense, as crew members search for the killer alien, is almost unbearable at times and helps make up for the profane cast, all of whom are low-life people who would never be astronauts in real life.Since this movie came out, in fact, the sequels to this plus many other science fiction films seem to portray astronauts as trashy people which is the opposite of reality and just plain ludicrous.<br /><br />Whatever, Alien a memorable movie to anyone who has seen it. Who can ever forget the alien emerging from John Hurt's chest? That's a scene that stays with you forever. Others have tried to imitate the horror of that scene, but never quite been as successful.<br /><br />The restored DVD gives this 25-year-old film a new appearance. It looks fabulous and really highlights the great cinematography and superb direction by Ridley Scott. This is just great entertainment if you want to spend a night on the edge of your seat. Now, we just wait for a (hopefully) fantastic Blu-Ray edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is an amazing film that has so much suspense and atmosphere it truly pulls the viewer in. There's plenty of shocks which are excellently timed, and when the alien does appear it doesn't disappoint in the least. The cast are all superb and the direction is incredible.<br /><br />A fantastic film.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>First things first.<br />Aliens destroys this one.<br />Ok I'm done.<br />It's actually kind of unfair to compare the two. The directors take such a different approach to the films.<br />Alien is a piece of movie history.<br />Brilliant from start to finish.<br />Masterfully acted and directed.<br />Superbly paced.<br />One of the many movies you simply can not miss and should probably own by now.<br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>Watching Alien last night for the first time in a while, I noticed that there are things that might take away from immersion in the film, just for example my wife mentioned the cheesy music sound-track that seemed like it belonged in a movie even older than Alien (1979) and the computer effects that in 1979 were seemingly state of the art, look a bit hokey by what we are used to today, and of course the film is set in the future.<br /><br />However where the film continues to succeed, is the realistic way the crew interacts, like a real gender mixed factory work team, and the management and non management crew interactions, even though they are Officer ~ Enlisted, this is a commercial ship and really it came off genuine for me.<br /><br />The one great thing that I loved about this movie and the next is the anticipatory anxiety it so expertly draws out by making you think something will happen and then it may or may not, just like in life. In this, I think Ridley Scott, really hits the mark and changes the way we (at least I) think about what makes a good scary movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is so wonderful as the Heroine Ellen Ripley, that I can't praise her enough; she comes across believable, tough and vulnerable, but ultimately tenacious and able to get the job done. I remember reading before that the alien in this film was a metaphor for how cancer can strike at any time etc. I don't know about all that, but what I do know, is this is a movie that requires only a bit of suspension of disbelief to create a thoroughly frightening movie watching experience.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good scare.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Alien' knows how to scare you.  It crawls beneath the surface of your skin and festers, irritating your flesh until you can't take the itch anymore.  It sends shivers down your spine and makes your hair stand on end and whispers the sweet nothings of despair in your ears.  `Alien' understands the human psyche and it exposes it to raw unadulterated fear.<br /><br />As you can probably ascertain; I am in love with this movie.<br /><br />I have seen `Alien' a handful of times and each and every time I am brought to that same secluded place of pure paranoia.  The setting is prime for that feeling of solidarity; the brilliant tagline (`In space no one can hear you scream') says it all.  What makes the film all the more effective is Ridley Scott's masterful pace and direction.  The film may seem slow to many, as if it doesn't want to get started, but that pace is what helps build the tension inside the core of the viewer.<br /><br />Ridley Scott is, in my humble opinion, the finest director working today.  He has a way of understanding the genre in which he is working and mastering it in order to deliver a piece of perfection to the viewer.  No matter what genre he is attempting he does so with effortless precision.<br /><br />How many other directors can claim to have delivered a masterful war film, gangster film, cross country drama, swords-and-sandals epic, sci-fi horror film and so on?<br /><br />In `Alien' Scott beautifully crafts a feeling of dread and terror that stands up even today as one of the purest and most effective horror films of all time.  `Alien' serves as a benchmark for many horror films that follow, so many of them depending on influence from this film to even make a dent in the viewers mind.  `Alien' will always be remembered as one of the scariest films of all time.<br /><br />Another facet of this film that excels is that superb acting by everyone involved.  Who would have ever thought that this film would be Sigourney Weaver's big breakout role but in all actuality it proved to be one of the greatest female performances of all time.  Weaver has never been this magnificent (although there is no denying she has turned out brilliance after brilliance).  Weaver is not the only gem here though.  The entire cast is flawless.  Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto; everyone is on point and compliments one another beautifully.<br /><br />The ship itself is probably the greatest performer in the film though.  It breathes a life all its own; one of terror and misery.  The art direction and set designs are flawless and evoke in the audience a genuine fear.  The mood is marvelously set just by glancing at the creaky ship.<br /><br />As the fated crew answers the supposed `distress call' we cringe because we know what's going to happen to them.  As they are hunted and slaughtered one by one we tense up because we know it's only the beginning.  And then there is the infamous tension building `chestburster' scene that will haunt your dreams and build your nightmares for a long time to come.  We become one with this movie as it cements itself into our minds and slowly, yet effectively, spreads through our souls until we feel nothing except what is purposed for us.  `Alien' is uncanny; a brilliant and flawless example of what cinema is all about.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>I watched AVPR in the theatre recently, and actually enjoyed it (but for nothing more than great creature action and effects).  Unlike the first AVP, it returned (especially with the aliens) to a bit more of a darker, horror film that the original Alien films had (but still overun by action).  Not that AVPR is even comparable, but it put me in the mood to watch the first Alien move again...wow.  It seperates the men from the boys.  Alien is the men.  This is a film in the series that is made with a bit of everything in mind - horror, mystery, acting, characters, story, and exceptional originality and creativity.  In addition, also a great director (Ridley Scott) and score composer (Jerry Goldsmith).  The result is a great movie that has gone down as one of the greatest horror films ever.<br /><br />The movie certainly takes its sweet time to get things rolling, but at the same time creates a great sense of mystery and an atmosphere of fright.  We also get to know the crew, which is a family in their own way.  Things feel like they happen in real time, and the acting feels less of reading from a script and more of improv - resulting in an experience that pits the viewer in the scene that feels less like a movie and more like reality.  Perhaps the most memorable moment from the film, and in cinematic history, is the chest-bursting sequence at the dinner table.  Though the sequals and recent AVP movies have their gory bursting scenes as well, the original is still the most frightening.<br /><br />Unlike Aliens (which is a tremendous sequal) and the AVP movies, we see see very little of the Alien in this film, but that keeps its mystery and the horror up on the scale.  The effects are actually quite fine, and the Alien looks great.  Slowly but surely, like any horror flick, the crew dies one by one, until our main character - Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is faced off against the alien beast.  Her character begins as an average person of the crew, she's not even the captain but her role shines brilliantly as the movie progresses, finally resulting in one of the strongest female roles known in cinematic history (and the Aliens sequal aided that as well).<br /><br />They just don't make them like they used to.  While the newer Alien and Predator films may "look" great, the original Alien is an all around great film.  It takes more than just action and effects to pull it off, and Alien provides what it needs to fullfill this.  Though this is more of a horror film than action - the Aliens sequal becomes more of an actioner and less horror.  If you aren't even a fan of Alien movies, still try the first Alien movie just for a scary good time.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Horror - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>Um! I want to get out of here spoken by actor Tom Skerrit who<br />plays Captain Dallas was ONE of the best scenes in HORROR film<br />history. You can really feel for Tom Skerrit for he is scared<br />and has every right to be. When you have a slender 9 1/2 ft.<br />tall alien after you....YOU BEST BE SCARED!  Alien is ONE of the<br />greatest HORROR (did I type HORROR? But this is SCI/FI...IS IT???)<br />films to be made. It really is a HALLOWEEN in space. The spaceship<br />is the MYERS house the crew are the teenagers and the big bad alien<br />Mike himself. I really loved how Director Ridley Scott built the<br />tension in this movie and gave us great character development as<br />well as SCARES.  This is one of the first TERROR movies to not show<br />the survivor girl not to be a whiney wimp.  If action is what you<br />crave than recommend ALIENS(HUH! Did Clint suggest a sequel??? Hey<br />Aliens is good for a ACTION movie)but if you like slow building<br />heart pounding TERROR! Than Alien is for you my friend. I will<br />def. give this a FRIGHTFUL watch this Oct.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Personally I prefer the original version of Riddley Scott's phenomenal movie. Somehow I liked the fact that Dallas (Tom Skerritt) was never heard from again making his destiny feel all the more horrendous (even though it is bad enough when you actually see it).<br />The real reason to double dip and re-purchase this DVD: the incredible, just incredible documentary. Deep, detailed and always interesting, it alone is worth the cost of this DVD, no matter how many times you have purchased this movie in the past (at least 2 in my case). The most interesting part of the documentary for me was the story of the alien's design by HR Geiger, to learn how afraid he was of his own nightmares and even of the rumors that the skeleton in his home is actually that of his suicidal girlfriend.You can't make this stuff up !</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>I have always enjoyed futuristic Sci-Fi - Do not really remember if it appeared in comic form.<br /><br />Have yet to look at disc 2 -- have thoroughly enjoyed the actors concept of their characters - it is very hard to describe the feelings invocked upon seeing that ugly old Alien Queen - the nasty Company that wanted the Alien alive - no matter who has to die in the meantime.<br /><br />Oh Yeah! those guys were in for the fight of their lives. And the danger even came from one of their own.  A Company man. And a synthetic person.<br /><br />Has become a classic and well worth adding to your collection - for pure entertainment.  This is one to get without believing anyone's comments, good or bad.

You know how sometimes you can watch a movie, and it doesn't matter when it takes place, you can still peg roughly when it was made? that's not the case here. This is a movie that's only slightly younger than I am, and yet it looks and feels as fresh as something that could've been made in the last few years by die-hards who have no interest in CGI.<br /><br />The only thing that to me seemed at all out of place was the smoking. Otherwise, it looked like something recent, rather than something from 1979. It's certainly aged far better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K15VSA">Blade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition)</a> or even the first Star Wars movie.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to attribute this to. Clearly the excellent performances, exceptional writing and incredible directing are a part of it. The sets seem very modern without slipping over into "ultra-modern" and that helps.<br /><br />Also in watching this I became ever more depressed by what the franchise has become. This was a thoughtful, intelligent horror movie. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXAE">Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> was a thoughtful, intelligent action movie. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXB8">Alien 3 (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> and "Alien: Resurection" were... well, movies. The less said about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMZK">AVP - Alien Vs. Predator (Widescreen Edition)</a> the better.<br /><br />This first film, however, was as flawless of a science fiction film as any you'll ever see. Heck, it even makes me want to go back and watch "Blade Runner" again, which I did not care for when I saw it the first time.<br /><br />Roger Ebert has included this movie in his collection of "Great Movies" essays. He puts it into the same areas of greatness as films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC6">Rashomon - Criterion Collection</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RCO1">All About Eve</a>, a judgement I entirely agree with.<br /><br />In short, don't do what I did. Don't watch the other films in the series and miss out on this one. If you haven't watched it, do so. If you have, then go back and see it again. It's worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>The first series of ALIEN is by far a sci-fi classic tale. A small troup of intergalatic travelers on return route from an assignment space mission, have intercepted a beacon signal, and the spaceship called Mother has decided to investigate. This leaves the tired homesick crew with an added adventure horror tale of becoming face to face with pure alien terror. One by one, they meet their doomed fates, and it is Ripley, played with perfect casting of Sigourney Weaver, to make it back home safely.<br /><br />Sigourney has found her niche in the hollywood books of science fiction movies, as one of the most heroic, and startling savvy women of all time. Despite her incredible odds of survival, she personally puts together all the formulative pieces of the jigsaw puzzle concerning the reason behind carrying the alien being on the ship.<br /><br />Excellent effects, and grand atmospheric sound track make this one the ultimate terror from outer space.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>Alien is a timeless movie.

In its wake came "Alien", a film with a much darker tone, featuring characters that are actually from Earth.  Putting a twist on the monster from space story, Ridley Scott's groundbreaking film would produce three sequels (so far), as well as a fair number of imitators.  Now close to twenty-five years old, the film holds up rather well, except for some dated computer technology.  <p>Awakened from deep sleep by the ship's computer nicknamed "Mother", the crew of the transport craft Nostromo is directed to investigate the source of some radio signals, coming from a nearby planet.  A craft is sent down to the planet's surface, and a party sent to investigate.  While exploring, crewmember Kane (John Hurt), encounters some strange "egglike" objects.  A creature springs from one of the eggs and attaches itself to his face.  Kane is placed in the infirmary, and later the creature is found apparently dead.  During a meal, the alien bursts through Kane's chest, and escapes into the ship.  The tiny alien grows to larger than man size, in the space of a few hours.  The mature creature is then ready to seek out prey, and begins to reduce the size of the crew, a member or two at a time.  <p>Editing keeps the views of the creature to a minimum, and we don't actually see what happens to most of the crew, as they become victims.  Our imagination goes to work, and that can create an even deeper feeling fear.  When one of the crew is killed, all we hear is her breathing, and then a strangled scream.  Soon, only Ripley (Sigorney Weaver) and her cat Jones, are left alive.  She manages to escape the mothership just before it self-destructs, unaware that there is a stowaway aboard.  Perhaps the Alien is dazed, for it doesn't seem to be very alert or aggressive.  Ripley succeeds in ushering the creature out of the ship, and treats it to a good old-fashioned deep space barbecue.  <p>Alien takes the traditional monster tale into space.  The story is strong, and features a truly unique and frightening monster.  The Alien creature remains a mysterious terror, which cannot be defeated, only destroyed.  The setup is natural and logical, and the characters behave like real people.  An excellent screenplay keeps the level of suspense high, and the cast all deliver fine performances.  The movie contains some elements common to the horror tradition.  A group, is suddenly facing a horrible unknown danger.  There is one member willing to sacrifice the lives others (Ash), a bubblehead who panics under pressure, costing lives (Lambert), a harmless handyman type (Brett), the sacrificed leader (Dallas), and an unexpected heroine rising to the occasion (Ripley).  <p>Now to that dated computer technology.  Based on the technology of today, anyone would find the presentation in film very unrealistic, perhaps even humorous.  This is not a criticism, just an observation.  In the film, whoever has the command, has access to "Mother", apparently a room sized computer loaded with tiny lights.  This construct is obviously for atmosphere and effect only.  Who believes that a futuristic computer would occupy an entire room and use light bulbs?  Access is via a terminal with an archaic keyboard, where questions are typed in.  Text is displayed on monochromatic monitors located across the room, for "easy" viewing.  In addition there is a sound effect, like an old teletype, as the text slowly scrawls across the screen.  How very quaint!  When was the last time text actually scrolled like that on your display?  In this view of the future, they could make an android that passes for a human, but not modernize the mainframe.  <p>Just poking a little fun at a classic, so don't take offense.  Alien is great movie, and should be part of any science fiction fan's DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A37DLVPKJZGSQF.html">A37DLVPKJZGSQF</a><br/><p>I was not too sure if I was going to like Alien as much as I would've liked to during the first half hour of the movie. It seemed too sci-fi for me somehow. But, about 31 minutes into the movie, I started to get intrigued with the originality of the story. I realised the first 25 or so minutes really needed to be there to give the story some depth, so if I was to watch the movie again, I would not be bored watching those scenes. I couldn't believe the standards of the special effects for a 1979 movie, they are totally stunning and don't look fake at all. The acting is very good, the stress and the strain during the making of the movie truly pays off her with Sigourney's Weaver's stunning go-getter performance as Ripley. But, it's the most hats off that go to Ridley Scott, who directs the film with a positive side, bringing the potentially uninteresting to the horrifyingly memorable. Yes, Alien is horrifying. Most of the suspense comes from the cat Jones. Whenever he's on screen and the characters are trying to capture him, we know the alien is gonna come up and get someone gore-good. Even though you know that person on-screen is alien-baby bait, you still get a hell of a fright watching them get torn to pieces. In short: classic sci-fi horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>&quot;Alien&quot; is one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers to have ever graced the silver screen or the home theater in any format!  It is the film's intensity that provides such an incredible draw to this extraordinary film.  If you're looking for a lot of action, this film is not really what you're looking for; &quot;Aliens&quot; is where the intensity and action comes into play in the line of Alien movies; the whole theme behind &quot;Alien&quot; is to scare to pants off of you with extremely intense scenes and if you've never seen this movie before, it may very well do just that!  Never before in the history of this genre had there been a film of this magnitude and few have matched it in it's intensity since.<p>Now, with this latest release, fans of &quot;Alien&quot; are treated to the best release of this film yet.  The very first thing you'll notice when you put this DVD into your player is that you have the option of playing either the 1979 Theatrical Release or a 2003 Director's Cut.  The 2003 Director's Cut is preceded by an interesting introduction by Ridley Scott himself.  This cut is put together seamlessly and the additions to the film add just that much more flavor to the film, making it that much better.  The only downside to this edition and I believe this just stems from the time in which this film was made, was the audio.  Despite having the options of THX and 5.1 Dolby Surround or 5.1 DTS, the audio playback just isn't what it should be.<p>Copious amounts of credit and accolades go to the incredible cast for this outstanding cinematic treasure!  Although I wouldn't go so far as to say that &quot;Alien&quot; is &quot;the&quot; movie that made Sigourney Weaver a star, I would say that it was the one that made her a superstar!  And since the release of this film and the following three in the Alien legacy, she will forever be known for these roles and probably very few others, except maybe her role in &quot;Ghostbusters.&quot;<p>Director Ridley Scott, who has directed some of the most influential films in just over the past quarter century, deserves high praise and acclaim for &quot;Alien&quot; and the direction he took this film in.  There are several directors out there that may have made as many or more films than he has but few have enjoyed the success he has had and a lot of that success can be directly attributed to the work he did on this film!<p>The Premise:<p>Although never clearly defined as to when, it is the future and America has expanded Earth's atmosphere and is sending mining ships out there...  The Nostromo, a civilian mining vessel is making the return trip home from an expedition and the crew is in cryo-freeze for the trip home but &quot;Mother&quot; the ships computer wakes them up to investigate what appears to be an alien SOS message.<p>As the crew goes through the necessary steps to investigate the signal on a small planetoid, the tension builds right to the moment that Kane (John Hurt) is deep within the bowels of the alien ship and is leaning over what appears to be an egg...<p>What follows from there is most certainly one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers ever to have been brought to the silver screen.  I highly recommend this exceptional film to any and all who're fans of movies in this genre.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>For those that have been waiting for a special edition DVD of &quot;Alien&quot; with all of the bells and whistles, this edition is most assuredly it!<p>-1979 Theatrical Version (Deleted/Extended Scene Index) (Alien Vs.

But while these accusations have more than a little truth, it has been an incredibly influential film--and even today, in the wake of CGI effects, it still holds up extremely, extremely well.<p>The story is well known: the crew of an interstellar craft responds to what seems a distress signal, only to encounter a remarkably lethal alien life form that boards their ship and sets about picking them off one by one.  Some of the special effects are weak (the alien spacecraft and the android "revival" are fairly notorious).  There is little in the way of character development, the film has a fairly slow pace, and the story itself is predictable; you can usually guess who is going to die next.<p>BUT.  The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself (brilliantly envisioned by Giger) is right on the money.  Director Ridley Scott encouraged his cast to ad lib from the script, and the result is a shocking sense of realism--and the somewhat slow pace of the film and the predictablity of the story gives it a sense of relentless and ever-mounting paranoia that is greatly enhanced by the tight sets and camera set-ups.  With its odd mixture of womb-like organics and cold mechanics, ALIEN is a film calculated to send even the most slightly claustrophobic viewer into a fit of hysteria.<p>The entire cast, led by Tom Skerrit and Sigorney Weaver, is very, very good--and the film abounds with memorable images and scenes ranging from John Hurt's encounter with the alien egg to Skerrit's search of the ship air ducts to Weaver's terrifying race against time as the ship counts down to self-destruct.  Seldom has any film been so consistent in design, cast, direction, and out-and-out fear factor, and although certain aspects of ALIEN are open to legitimate criticism the end result is powerful enough to bring it in at a full five stars.  A word of warning, however: you'll need to send the kids to bed for this one.  And you'll probably be up half the night afterward yourself!  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that just stand out above anything else made before it. In essence it is a horror movie, yet it is much more. Anybody can make a slasher flick with some killer picking off the cast. Tons of movies already have been made with that formula. Alien goes way beyond clich&eacute; horror with a truly engaging story and well thought out setting.<br /><br />As a horror movie it is well done. Not a lot of those cheesy horror clich&eacute;s you find so often in many movies of that genre. Sure you have the occasional startling noise or false alarm surprises, but they weren't overdone and succeeded in building the suspense. Also Ridley Scott was smart to keep the alien creature's appearances minimal. It's better to tease the audience with a glance here and there than kill the mystique of the monster by showing too much of it.<br /><br />I have to give kudos to director Ridley Scott and his design team for the meticulous detail done in Alien. I also have to thank Scott for taking the time to show this detail to us with some nice camera sweeps and perspective shots. All the sets and technology mixed well, and H.R. Geiger's designs for all the alien stuff is truly groundbreaking and sets a standard that lasts even today.<br /><br />I like the plot and how it unfolds with details that don't just involve the alien. Makes the movie a lot more interesting to watch. Acting is also top notch. All of the characters acted in the best way I can describe as a documentary style, where you see spontaneous emotion and reactions. I recall hearing that the actors did have room to improvise on some scenes. However the methods, the end results speaks for itself.<br /><br />When I saw Alien in the theatres it scared the snot out of me. When I saw it again on DVD with a big screen and good speakers I still felt some of the old chills. I recommend a decent system to get the most out of this movie. I recall seeing it on a tiny 15" screen about six feet away and not get the same thrills. I suppose if you don't like horror shows then that's the way to see it.<br /><br />The DVD is packed with goodies, which was a pleasant surprise given the kinds of extras you get from DVDs back then. There is an informative director commentary by Ridley Scott that gives a lot of great information. The deleted scenes are cool. Even the ones that aren't fully produced. The outtakes are fun too, but not as much as the deleted scenes. There is also a LOT of production photos and notes as well. No documentaries, but then again you don't need them after you hear Ridley's commentary.<br /><br />This is the movie that started a whole franchise. It deserves all the fame and credit it received. While the new Collector's Edition has a lot more extras this DVD is definitely no slouch and gives you much more than most SpecialExtendedUberFantasticCollectors editions that keep being rehashed. They gave you a great DVD the first time out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>I was expecting quite a bit more from this release and while I can understand Fox's preference for consumers to buy the whole Alien Anthology package which costs a lot more and hence translates to higher revenue for them I think it is also wrong to penalise the fan who is only interested in one or a couple of the installments.  If it is a matter of disc space then I can understand why there are no Special Feature documentaries on the making of the movie are on this as having both the 1979 Theatrical and the 2003 Director's Cut on the same disc is great although I wouldn't have minded something similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001992NW4">The Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] where we get a nice digibook plus 2 discs with the different versions on each disc plus great Special Feature extras.  I still think as far as blu-ray releases go that this one is the best I've seen so far in regards to being as perfect a blu-ray release to satisfy the fan that I've seen to date.<br /><br />Also, for some reason my disc keeps skipping and stopping at key points making me suspect I got a bum disc as so far no one else has complained about it.  When my disc was working correctly though, I thought the picture quality was very good and so was the THX DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround Sound quality as well.  Having watched both versions I personally preferred the 2003 Director's Cut as it speeded things up a little to suit modern tastes and despite the addition of new scenes still ran at about the same length as the 1979 version.  Truth be told though I thought both versions were very good.  I liked the homage Ridley Scott clearly paid to one of my all time favourite films <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66J1M">2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray</a>] and it certainly had a very Stanley Kubrick feel about it.  The theme of greedy big corporations putting profits ahead of human life seeking to implement weapons of mass destruction is sadly still relevant today whether it is biological as it is here or financial as in real life.  Can Corporate Social Responsibility really be embedded into the culture of powerful corporations or is it just a construct to keep us happy while the boards of directors laugh at us behind their closed-door meetings?<br /><br />Overall, this release was a mixed bag for me as it could have been a lot better and not just an afterthought when compared to the complete anthology version.  Even the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00319ECGK">The Matrix [Blu-ray</a>] release was decent for those who didn't want to get the entire trilogy.  Instead I get the feeling I'm being punished by Fox for not getting the entire Anthology with a pretty pitiful release of "Alien" on blu-ray.<br /><br />Verdict: wait for a better release.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>+++++<br /><br />This is a science fiction movie (occurring in the year 2037) that turns into one of horror.<br /><br />The movie begins with the following printout with a spaceship in the background:<br /><br />"Commercial towing [space] vehicle 'The Nostromo'<br /><br />Crew: seven [actually six and a cat]<br /><br />Cargo: refinery processing 20,000,000 tons of mineral ore<br /><br />Course: returning to Earth"<br /><br />After this, there is no talking for about seven minutes as the viewer is shown interior shots of the spaceship.<br /><br />Then, we learn the names of the crew:<br /><br />(1) Commander Dallas (Tom Skerritt)<br /><br />(2) Second in Command, Kane (John Hurt)<br /><br />(3) Third in Command, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver)<br /><br />(4) Navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright)<br /><br />(5) Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm)<br /><br />(6) Ship Engineer Parker (Yaphet Kotto)<br /><br />(7) Ship Mechanic Brett (Harry D. Stanton)<br /><br />(8) The cat, Jones<br /><br />The ship's computer "Mother" detects "a transmission of unknown origin" that seems to be a distress signal.  So the ship has automatically changed course to check it out, bringing the ship to a mysterious planet.  Some of the crew check out the signal on the planet and unintentionally bring back an organism.  (It is at this time that the remaining crew onboard learns that the signal is actually a warning signal.)<br /><br />Eventually the science officer says to the others these chilling words:<br /><br />"You still don't know what you're dealing with, do you?  The perfect organism.  Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility."<br /><br />With that said, the crew has to defend itself from this hostile alien organism.<br /><br />This movie has richly detailed sets, an ominous atmosphere, and relentless suspense.  Much of the dialogue is improvised adding to the movie's realism.  The background music adds to each scene.<br /><br />Much of the imagery is unforgettable.  Here are my three favorite images:<br /><br />(1) The alien "facehugger"<br /><br />(2) The alien "chestburster"<br /><br />(3) The frightening and suspenseful conclusion.<br /><br />The DVD released in 1999 has many interesting extras including ten short scenes that didn't make it into the movie.<br /><br />At this point, I should mention that there is another more expensive version of this movie ("The Director's Cut") that was released in 2003 and incorporates some of this 1999 DVD's deleted scenes.  Note that the 2003 version is a minute longer than this (the original, released in theatres) version.  As well, the director said that the original movie released in theaters was "his perfect vision of this film."  Thus, I don't see the point of buying the 2003 version unless you want to spend more money on a few more extras.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  If you've seen this movie at the theatre, this DVD will only enhance your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is truly a landmark of science fiction and horror that can be watched over and over again!!<br /><br />(1979;  1 hr, 56 min;  widescreen; 20 scenes;  rated `R')<br /><br />+++++</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Alien is an old, though somewhat scary horror movie.  While most of the horror comes in the form of building up suspense *very* slowly, I think you'll be rewarded for your patience if you are able to sit on the chair and wait for the action scenes to come.  I can imagine people being frightened by the alien back in 1979 because it was designed quite creatively.  It simply looks convincingly scary.  There weren't a whole lot of movies released before this one that contained the same level of fear and suspense, so Alien is definitely a classic movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece of darkness, fear, and dread. This "Director's Cut" is actually a minute shorter than the theatrical release. There's a cool restored scene where we get to see Dallas and Brett coccooned against the wall! It's an eerie sequence with a high shudder-factor! We're all familiar with the story. The crew of the mining ship Nostromo is heading home, when a "distress" call forces them out of deep-space hibernation. The seven crew members are Dallas (Tom Skerett), Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Kane (John Hurt), Ash (Ian Holm), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Parker (Yaphet Kotto), and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton). The signal is coming from a nearby planet, so our heroes land and investigate. A wrecked spacecraft is found, containing an area filled with large, pulsating eggs. One of them hatches and springs open to unleash a hideous spidery creature that attaches itself to Kane's face! Back aboard the Nostromo, the creature seems to die and fall off. Unfortunately, it has left a little gift inside of Kane's body! The rest is a monster movie of nail-biting drama and fantastic special FX (no CGI here). The full-grown alien (one of H.R. Giger's best nightmare creations) is unlike any monster to ever ooze, slither, or creep across the screen! Though commonly known today, in 1979 it was quite a shocker! The shape of it's eyeless, over-sized head, it's drooling mouth-within-a-mouth, the mechanoid-reptilian body, all combine to make one tall glass of icy terror! ALIEN stands alongside JAWS, HALLOWEEN, THE THING, and other classics of jolting horror. Sigourney Weaver re-made the female action hero in her image! Beautiful, intelligent, resourceful, and lethal when necessary, she is a true survivor! ALIEN belongs in every DVD collection! This DIRECTOR'S CUT has very few changes since Ridley Scott himself prefers the theatrical release, seeing little need for alterations. Both versions are included here...</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>one sick twisted, amuzing movie. glad my dad let me watch it with him when I was 12. it lives up to its name. it shocks and amuses all at once. it's worth watching again and again. from beginning to end. truly a horrifying horror movie with very creative sci fi plot and cinematics. the whole cast is great. glad I have this on dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>What can I say about the pioneer Sci-Fi movie of our time?

This is the first (not counting the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LAIHY0">Prometheus (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy)</a> prequel) in Alien franchise, followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE29PO">Aliens [Blu-ray</a>]. The Alien movies are generally well done, exciting, and well acted, making them standout from others in the genre.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The crew of a deep space "towing vessel" hauling mining ore is awakened from cryogenic sleep ahead of schedule to investigate a signal of unknown origin. The movie creates a great creepy, industrial feel that greatly adds to the realism and suspense. There is fairly good character development, which is actually much better than most movies in the genre. Sigourney Weaver stands out playing Ripley with a very strong performance and the supporting cast is also generally very good. The special effects are good for the time the movie was made and contribute to the believability.<br /><br />This is one of those movies I can watch whenever it comes on and we occasionally have an "Alien" marathon once a year or so where we watch all of the movies in row over a weekend.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>A long with the likes of such movies as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RE29PO">Aliens [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L16FAE">Predator (Ultimate Hunter Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RIY4WE">Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], and various others...this is one of the best sci-fi action movies ever in my opinion.  Even before Aliens, which is probably the best of the movies in the Alien series of course, this movie came first and was simply a groundbreaking sci-fi movie.  The 3rd and 4th Alien movies were okay, but this and the 2nd movie have stood the test of time and are just awesome...both are movies that I upgrade everytime they come out on a new format, and I am stoked to now have them on Blu-Ray!

The acting is very good, and I love the realism that each actor shows, making Alien a terrifying film to watch. I wouldn't go far to say that one of them stood out the most as I thought all of the players did equally well. One wonderful aspect about Alien is its cinematography, and it's visually pleasant. The biggest problem of Alien is its pacing which can be slow and boring at times. I know it's attributable to the suspense factor, but it's an area that requires a masterful skill. Considering the films Ridley Scott had made over the years, Alien is the best work of his career, and it's worthy of any top ten list when it comes to science fiction and horror movies. Some scenes are quite scary but not in macabre or grotesque way...just real terror. It's a rare accomplishment though. One more thing that I found problematic in Alien is the overuse of flashing lights. That was needlessly too much and overdone. If that was reduced while some fixing up of the pace, Alien would have earned a `10' in my book. Looking at the underlying aspects of Alien, I loved how the feminism is played out, especially when Sigourney Weaver's character is asserting the need of adherence to militarism protocol to ensure safety of everyone on the ship. Of course, when that was ignored, Alien the movie began. The way everybody acted is right on the money and is perfect; when I think of the crew members of Jason X and of Alien, there is a superb chasm of difference what makes a movie great. Alien is 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers in And Then There Were None fashion with a different kind of a creature thrown in. Before there was The Thing and before there was Predator, Alien appeared. The idea of a female hero is unique when Alien was made, and it's a turning point. All in all, Alien is a must-see sci-fic horror classic that is almost a masterpiece and is stunning in all accounts. The rating of `9' stays the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>The crew of the spaceship Nostromo is forced to investigate a crashed alien craft on an unknown planet. Something seems to have killed the alien pilot. Something strange...something terrible....and *very* lethal...<br /><br />"Alien" isn't just a classic horror movie. It's also the only horror movie that actually scared me. OK, "Poltergeist" might have scared me when I was a child, but that doesn't count! I found "Alien" scary even when I saw it a second time, with commercial breaks.<br /><br />Clearly, there is something very special about this movie...<br /><br />The monster, sometimes known as the xenomorph, was designed by a Swiss surrealist painter, a certain H. G. Giger (who looks quite scary himself, by the way). This could explain a thing or two. "Alien" probably conjures up our deepest fears about parasites, non-human predators and claustrophobia. The all-powerful company with its callous disregard for human life is a more down-to-earth nightmare. And then there's Ash, who turns out to be a robot! Another archetype? Some people seem to believe that the alien archetypes are sexual in nature. If so, I must have missed them. There is virtually no sex whatsoever in this production.<br /><br />Today, I'm no longer scared by "Alien", for rather obvious reasons. Still, the movie is worth watching, after all these years. And yes, Sigourney Weaver *is* Ripley.<br /><br />The sequels aren't bad either, no mean accomplishment, since sequels are usually bunk. From the top of my head, I'd say my favourite is "Alien 3" where Ripley is stranded on a quasi-religious prison colony in outer space, naturally together with a couple of xenomorphs. More weird are the comic books based on the Alien movies, with their alternative and somewhat confusing storylines. As for "Alien vs. Predator", in contrast to many Alien fans, I found it quite entertaining, although (of course!) not a "real" Alien movie.<br /><br />Be that as it may, the original is still the best, and deserves every one of its five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I can't believe that this came out 30 years ago, so I just had to watch it again and see if I enjoyed it as much as the first time.<br /><br />There is no doubt that this is a very strong sci-fi monster flick for a number of reasons.  The atmospherics, from the cluttered ship to Geiger's eerie designs, are absolutely first rate.  Just by looking at it, you get a feeling for the story, a mixture of fear and fascination that all good sci-fi horror should evoke.  Then there are the characters, all superlatively acted by relative unknowns, including the star-making performance by Weaver.  There are very few sci-fi films that have such fully believable people, so that marks this one in my mind as equal to, say, the Day the Earth Stood Still.  Even the ominous corporation, acting through Mother and Ash, is a sinister presence.  Finally, there is the alien itself, also a wonderful creation that is utterly weird and completely believable in an immediate emotional sense - you just feel the fear, you don't ever have to try to forget that someone made it up.<br /><br />As a sci-fi fan, I love the way that the alien became part of my imagination, more as questions than anything one can know.  Was it brought onto the first ship as an infection that evolved into a more sophisticated organism as it exchanged DNA with the unlucky voyagers?  Or was it some kind a invader, part of some plan that was moving through the universe?  How much did the corporation know about it before the crew went and what did they want from it?  How intelligent was the alien - just to survive or as a hive mind that was in touch with its cohorts?  Even with the subsequent films, you can't really answer these questions, which is a mark of how fertile a product of imagination the film is.  It is completely cogent, much like Close Encounters.<br /><br />On the critical side, I did not enjoy the blood-curdling stuff all that much.  It is gross and graphic.  Also, I did find a lot of the suspense akin to horror house antics and feel that they could have used the alien for more subtle terror.  That means that the first watch is the best, even if it meets the test of multiple watchings.<br /><br />I have a special connection to this film.  WHen I arrived in London fresh out of college, I ran into Tom Skerritt on the street and recognized him form MASH.  He told me he had just made the movie, ALIEN, which he said with his eyes wide open in mock fear.  I have loved the series ever since.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>The first time I saw Alien it kinda freaked me out.

Often copied but never equaled, this tale of survival manages to be outlandish, creepy, deathly serious, scary and somehow within the boundaries of nightmarish believability.<br /><br />In the cold depths of space, Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a crew of six other members man the mining ship Nostromo, a horrifyingly beautiful spacecraft housing shadowy corridors and claustrophobic ingresses. When a distress signal is picked up from a nearby planet, the crew is awoken from hypersleep to investigate. A small search party examines the dilapidated remains of an alien vessel, resulting in Kane (John Hurt) being unwittingly attacked by a spider-like parasite that affixes itself to his face. He is returned to the ship for examination, resulting in one of the most memorable and gut-wrenching scenes ever filmed. As shocking as the shower scene in Psycho, an alien creature tears its way out of his rib cage, spewing blood and viscera across an appalled dinner table of crew members. Attempting to catch the tiny snakelike creature, the dwindling group is slowly picked off one by one as the alien grows rapidly in size and deadliness.<br /><br />One of the most unique aspects of the film is the maturity of its characters. While slasher flicks make use of screaming teens that run frantically from a deranged killer, Alien instead features a crew of adults. Perhaps unintentionally, the older crew has a hardened, experienced feel about them, creating a more mature and realistic sense to the game of cat and mouse. Few films have been able to genuinely capture the immediacy and seriousness of fictional and outlandish alien situations. Director Ridley Scott miraculously managed to create two of the most important and influential science-fiction films of all time with Alien and later Blade Runner. The scares and terror that surmount are stunning in their simplicity and yet carefully executed with fascinatingly eerie sets, biomechanical alien designs and an overabundance of steam and slime.<br /><br />H.R. Giger, a famous Swiss surrealist was assigned the daunting task of creating the ultimate alien life form. His design is flawless due to the ingenious reproductive cycle he envisioned, as well as the biomechanical design of the horrifying adults. James Cameron would later alter the cycle by creating the Alien Queen in the first of several sequels, but the main idea of an egg bearing a parasitic facehugger which lays another egg in the victim's chest, remained the same. After bursting out of the body, the worm-like chestburster would grow to a bipedal monstrosity complete with a banana-shaped head and a tongue lined with teeth. In the original blueprints, the alien drone would be capable of mutating human bodies into in an egg to start the process again.<br /><br />Rivaled in suspense by its sequel Aliens, but not in sheer terror, Alien is perhaps the greatest science-fiction horror film ever made, and has certainly introduced us to one of the most terrifyingly formidable screen villains of all time.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Alien is one of the best movies off all time, no matter how you view it (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDD">Alien: 20th Anniversary Edition [Award Series</a>]).

The Transfer is exceptional and the movie has never looked better. There are more than a few good scares in this well made Sci-Fi Horror story and like a low boiling pot the film just slowly intensifies! The acting is also well above average for such Saturday afternoon fare and Weaver is perfectly cast as Ripley. Alien is really a remake of a 50's Sci-Fi film "It The Terror From Beyond Space", but only takes a great idea to another level. The Box set is incredible and a worthy purchase for fans of the series. If you are not a fan of the entire series then buy the two disc set of the first two films.

Alien has always been one of my personal favorite movies for many reasons, which I would fail to summarize in the span of this review, but I certainly can try my best to fill out details on my casual view on what's the best way to enjoy the film.<br /><br />Alien is a haunted house if you could put the feeling of a well-done haunted house on screen. A fusion of various sci-fi elements (think `2001: A Space Odyssey' with a dash of `Star Wars') and some horror (`The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and `Jaws') is a winning decision in Director Ridley Scott's dark vision of the future.<br /><br />I'm sure that most of you are familiar with the plot of this "truckers in space" horror that launched the career of actress Sigourney Weaver and placed Swedish artist, H.R. Giger's sexual monster in the nightmares of millions filmgoers the world over.<br /><br />A crew aboard a commercial towing vessel entitled the Nostromo is hauling a refinery and its metal ore back to Earth when suddenly the computer (known simply as "Mother") sets them on a new course. The blue-collared crew is awoken to find themselves far off course and are given news of a distress signal. Corporation protocols dictate that they must stop, investigate, and, if possible, rescue any survivors. Upon completing this mission they soon come to realize they have brought something aboard unlike anything mankind has ever faced before.<br /><br />What follows is one of the greatest horror films in movie history. Ridley Scott and his technical crew weave together a gothic, sexual nightmare the likes of which has never been recreated. Unlike its sequels, Alien is a visually engaging movie that puts aside characters in the place of atmosphere. This film is a beauty to behold, but most importantly is the monster itself. Now, I love James Cameron's Aliens, but his representation of the aliens was dumb, simple-minded insects. RIDLEY SCOTT'S ALIEN on the other hand is a curious, sentient killer that is in no way human, but at the same time is clearly far from a mindless animal. From its first appearance to the end of the film the creature is kept in shadow making full use of "What you don't see" to create its suspense. This incarnation of the creature is likely to be my favorite movie monster of all time. Not to discredit future films such as the superb Aliens, but this Alien's creature is simply in a league of its own.<br /><br />In short, Alien is a real testament of quality filmmaking. I believe Alien belongs among the ranks of such classics as Psycho and Jaws as being one of the best horror/suspense pictures of all time.<br /><br />Now, to conclude this review I'm going to fill you all in on how you can come to own this gem. There are currently (in-circulation) two DVD versions of Alien. I have owned both and shall now summarize them the two of them for potential buyers from a fan standpoint, and as a consumer.<br /><br />The single-disc 20th Anniversary edition originally a part of the Alien Legacy box set is the common version you'll find at most stores. For an early DVD this comes with a buffet of features that will satisfy any but the sternest of viewers. It comes with fully animated menus and such features as a full-length director's commentary by Sir Ridley Scott along with deleted scenes.<br /><br />Alien: The Director's Cut is a two-disc collector's edition of the film that contains both the theatrical cut and director's cut. There are added features, most notably (at least for me) is the joint commentary between both Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver.<br /><br />I currently own the Director's Cut seeing as I own the Quadrilogy set, but don't take that as a full-on recommendation for the 2-disc set. It may seem extreme, but I do not enjoy the "Director's Cut" and I'll explain why.<br /><br />Ridley Scott already considered the theatrical cut the definitive edition of the film. The Director's Cut in actuality is more of a "Fan Cut." In my mind you get absolutely nothing from seeing this version since you could already view these deleted/extended scenes on the 20th anniversary edition. As Scott himself has noted initially the deleted scenes are entertaining, but ruin the pacing of the final product, especially when Ripley must escape the ship.<br /><br />The Director's Cut does have some good special features and the picture may be a tad better, but if you aren't a huge fan of Alien or don't watch many special features I would suggest keeping to the single-disc release of the film. It just has more bang for your buck. BUT, if you really, really, REALLY must see everything there is to see about Alien you will probably go with the 2-disc set.<br /><br />Just one note before I conclude this review: At home everyone can hear you scream. So try to tone it down.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>This is still one of my favorite sci-fi horror flicks, even after a quarter of a century.  It has spawned so many imitations that newcomers may feel that it is a bit commonplace.  But, at the time, it literally created a new genre.  Alien still sets the bar where science fiction meets both suspense and splatter.  It's easy to be hockey, but Ridley Scott proved that in the chambers of a spaceship, there is no escape.<br /><br />When the crew of the Nostromo answers a mysterious beacon, they find and ancient spaceship, the ruined body of its pilot, and a cluster of eggs.  One of these attacks a crewmember and succeeds in implanting a nearly unkillable embryo in its victim.  The crew returns to the Nostromo, the alien tears its way out of its victim's body and, in the dark of space, humans become the prey in a deadly hunt.  Sigourney Weaver, as Lt. Ripley, sees crew members die and disappear around her as finds that there is more to this than an inadvertent run in with a bad alien and the discovery drives her to desperate action.<br /><br />I don't think I will ever forget the alien's debut as a bloody jack-in-the-human-box.  It still is a jarring moment, as Kane (John Hurt) becomes the first in a string of grim deaths.  Ash's (Ian Holm) confrontation with Ripley is another memorable scene, and the final sequence is outstanding.  Needless to say, I also was impressed by Ripley's bikini underwear but that has little to do with the plot.<br /><br />In watching the film this time I finally realized that the fatal flaw that creates the nightmare isn't the deadly creature or a secret plot, but everyone's failure to realize that the Alien was not a simple monster, but a deadly and intelligent artifact of war.  This message is as timely today as it was in 1979.  Failing to respect your opposition is a fatal mistake.<br /><br />For all purposes this was Sigourney Weaver's debut (does anyone remember her bit part in Woody Allen's Annie Hall?).  Managing to convey a strong personality and overwhelming terror is no simple task and Weaver manages to create a believable personality in an unbelievable situation.  Yaphet Kotto also does an excellent job, and nearly steals some scenes from Weaver.  All of the acting is well orchestrated and focused.  It is this, not the creepy monster and the spooky sets, it what makes Alien work.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>That tagline accompanied "you've-just-GOT-to-see-this-movie" word of mouth and brought millions of viewers into darkened cinemas in the summer of 1979 where Ridley Scott's Horrific Space movie scared the pants off us!<br /><br />While clearly paying homage to Hawks "Thing" and a whole generation of gotcha-thrillers, "Alien" made some indelible marks on the history of film - in particular on science-fiction thrillers.<br /><br />Scott follows the example of Spielberg in "Jaws" by giving us only brief intermittent glimpses of the horrific monster after taking time to establish characters that we identify with and don't particularly want to see eaten.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver would have had a notable film career if the Alien franchise were the only thing on her resume, and in Alien she is only part of a superb ensemble cast that includes John Hurt, Ian Holm, Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright.<br /><br />The skeleton of a plot should be well-known to even an "Alien" novice - a space cargo ship is returning with tons of iron ore when it is redirected to a planet where it picks up an extremely unwanted visitor.<br /><br />Fear and dread and tension build in the movie until it is as thick as pea soup.  Scott takes his time establishing the characters and the setting of the ship before unleashing the alien, and the deliberate pacing in the first hour pays great dividends as the shocks of the final two-thirds of the film escalate.  The movie contains many scenes so famous as to be icons in film history - consider Mel Brooks' parody Spaceballs, and I won't add anything discussing scenes such as the one around the dining table or Ian Holm's last scene.  But I would like to take a moment to praise the ending.  A plan is finally devised to blow up the entire ship - killing the alien as well - and making escape in a small shuttle.  The editing and pacing of this scene escalate the tension to our limits as the voice of the ship calmly announces at periodic intervals "5 minutes to ship destruction", etc.<br /><br />A thrilling roller-coaster ride of a movie.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>Alien is a top notch sci-fi film, filled with suspense.<br /><br /> It's about this mining ship with seven people in it:Dallas, Ripley, Ash, Parker, Lambert, Brett, and Kane.

It ranks up there with such films as Hitchcock's Psycho and Tod Browning's Dracula (1931). Alien is pretty much a classic haunted house film, but instead of an old, spooky Victorian-era manse we have an old, dingy, massive space-freighter and the endless darkness of space itself.<br /><br />Alien rises above its B-movie credentials --- this film is really a B-movie at heart --- with a very taut and intelligent script, and exceptional direction from Ridley Scott. From the long opening sequence of the Nostromo filling the screen, the audience knows its going to be treated to an exceptionally shot film. Ridley Scott has always been known for his art direction and the biomechanical look of the sets in Alien helps add to the sense of dread and horror. It helps that Scott and his crew decided to hire renowned Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger to design the look of the sets and the creatures. Anyone who has seen Giger's work can easily see his influence in the set design for Alien. Giger's final design for the main creature itself will go down as one of the best creations in film history. By now, everyone knows what to picture in their head when someone mentions the words Alien and film together.<br /><br />The group of actors picked for the film is excellent from top to bottom. Tom Skerritt's Capt. Dallas is a strong foundation upon which the rest of the characters revolve around. Veronica Cartwright's character's slow descent into hysteria --- wholly appropriate with the situation she and the rest of her crewmates are faced with --- is like a barometer to the increasing dread that permeates throughout the film from beginning to the end. The stand-out of the cast has to be Sigourney Weaver. The fact that this was her first major film role bodes well for what audiences could expect from her as her career exploded. Her character of Lt. Ellen Ripley is pretty much the antithesis of Cartwright's Lambert. Where Lambert slowly descended into a paralyzing hysterics, Ripley slowly took control of the situation and became the de facto leader after Dallas.<br /><br />The overall tone of the film does owe alot to past scifi horror/thrillers. But instead of constant scares and red herrings, Scott slowly built up the tension and dread with long slow shots of empty corridors and cargo holds. For a film that's considered one of the best horror films ever made, Alien doesn't have alot of dark areas where the monster suddenly jumps out. The monster will jump out from well-lit and spacious areas. Scott also used Spielberg's trick of keeping the monster-creature from being on-screen for no longer than quick glimpses. Its not until close to the very end do we see Giger's Alien creature in all its glory.<br /><br />This newest of the many Alien dvd editions has finally come with re-edited scenes that adds some more shock and horror to the film. I have to agree with Scott's reasoning for deleting the scenes themsevles. It does slow down the rollercoaster, beat-the-clock pace in the latter part of the film. But in the comforts of one's own home theater, these re-edited scenes are easier to take in. The look of both the original theatrical and director's cut of the film has been remastered and looks great, especially when seen on a progressive-scan capable dvd player and a dedicated widescreen HDTV. The sound and music have also been given a 4-star remastering treatment to make better use of the home theater systems that are growing in numbers.<br /><br />Alien is the most superior entry in the Alien Quadrilogy, even though Aliens is a more exciting film. Alien takes the scifi horror genre and sets a standard that many have still to reach to this day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>Although it took some time for me to appreciate it, today I can easily agree with many that 1979's "Alien" is one of the greatest science fiction/ horror movies that has ever been made. <p> A team on board a deep space ship called Nostromo is returning to earth after a deep sleep but then while returning to Earth, receives a mysterious distress signal on a distant planet and are sent in to investigate the source of the signal. During that time, one of them discovers large objects with movement within them. It turns out that these `objects' are actually organic alien eggs and when one of them hatches, one of the crew is attacked and is brought back to the ship to have the `alien' removed but the `blood' of this alien is in fact a super strong molecular acid that eats through almost anything it touches. Even worse, the crew are being hunted and killed one by one by an extremely dangerous alien creature and now they must try to destroy the creature and escape with their lives before it's too late.<p> While nowhere near as action-packed as it's 1986 sequel "Aliens", this movie however is equally intense as the sequel but in a totally different way. While the sequel benefits from it's tons of action sequences, "Alien" is every bit as intense by it's extremely suspenseful tone and while it may be slow at times, when the intense parts come, they'll make you jump right out of your seat. This movie does not rely so much on action for intensity as it does on immense suspense, tension, and disturbingly quiet tone and then the alien jumps right out into the screen! While "Alien" is slow-paced a lot of the time the pace leads up to terrifying confrontations with the creature as it kills the crew members one by one. Perhaps it's most famous scene of all time is the frighteningly vile scene where one of the crew members who was previously attacked by the `baby' alien goes into violent convulsions and culminating when a `baby' alien bursts right out of the mans chest killing him instantly. That scene is perhaps the most famous sci-fi horror scenes ever filmed. I had nightmares for many years after seeing that and even now with a stomach made of titanium steel, I still get very queasy at that scene but it is one of the most original sequences ever filmed to this day. <p>Ridley Scott's directing is absolutely phenomenal. Being that this was a low budget movie of only 11 Million dollars, Scott and the crew have used the limited resources to create a really stunningly beautiful yet terrifying epic that has been virtually unrivalled to this day. The sets are incredible and the special effects are really awesome. Even then the film shows it's age in some places such as some extremely dated special effects, a few of which are ancient even by early 1980s standards but overall, this film is one of the greatest examples of using the limited budget to an efficient degree and the result is not only a terrifying Sci-Fi horror movie but also one of the greatest landmark achievements in these two genres. <p> The cast is absolutely spectacular. The career of a then unknown Sigourney Weaver would literally take off right through the roof with her playing the main protagonist character Ellen Ripley. Ripley's character is one of the best woman protagonists that I've ever seen in any movie especially towards the latter half of this movie. It was this that made Weaver into a superstar. She's even better in the 1986 James Cameron directed sequel "Aliens". Perhaps another favorite `actor' of mines in this movie surprisingly enough is the cat Jones. I absolutely love the scenes where he like hisses at the guy in the storage unit and literally walks away when the alien grabs him and makes a meal out of him. <p> This "Collector's Edition" two disk set is a massive treat. The first disc alone is a vast improvement on both the VHS and the 1999 "Special Edition" DVD. The picture and sound quality of the original movie was not all that great but this "Collector's Edition" gives this movie a much needed clean-up job on a phenomenal classic and the picture quality is now crystal clear and the sound quality is also vastly improved too and I no longer have to turn the volume up to eardrum bursting levels to hear the movie clearly enough. The first disc contains the original theatrical version untouched for the `purists' who don't want anything done to it. Disc One also comes with the "Director's Cut" edition where some footage that Scott didn't feel to happy with is removed but is replaced with some newly incorporated footage that wasn't on the original. The result is the movie being only a minute longer but gives the movie a different light. <p>The second disc contains an excellent `making of' documentary and you can witness some ego battles between some of the members of the cast especially between Yaphet Kotto and the actor who played the `Alien' and how they edited it to make their tensions work in the movie itself. It also has tons of other amazing extras that I don't want to point out, out of fear of spoiling the fun of this DVD. <p>Most horror movies to me are nothing but vile gore fests with little to no plot behind them but "Alien" is one of the best horror movies of all time. It was groundbreaking back in 1979 when it was released and now 25 years later (at the time of writing this review), it is an absolutely classic today. I strongly recommend that you buy this today and get this DVD. This is one of the most smartly assembled DVDs that I've had in recent years and it is on the border of being flawless.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>This may be the definitive "scary space-monster" movie. There have been lots of horror movies before and since, space movies, and movies based on evil beings with varyin amounts of blood-lust. There have been combinations of those two or three. When it came out, Alien combined all three in the best mix to that point, and maybe since.<br /><br />Pacing is part of what makes this work so well. It gets off to a slow start, making clear just how tedious life can be in those months between solar systems. The pace picks up over the course of the movie, and tension just keeps building. Somehow, just when you thought Ripley was safe, the Alien appears again. This happens over and over, and Scott's direction makes it a new shock each time. The last scenes, with Ripley in her underwear, just reinforced the vulnerable mood. (Somehow, and I like this, Weaver looked good wearing not a lot, but the scene completely lacked in sexual overtones.)<br /><br />Just about everything in this movie works. H. R. Giger's Alien is unforgettable. Sigourney Weaver's "Ripley" is one one my all-time favorite characters. In fact, I like Ripley even better because of the great job Weaver did in Galaxy Quest. There, she played another character almost identical, except all the ways she was Ripley's opposite. The later part of the Alien movie is a blatant assualt on the senses - aggressive, but it helps keep the audience on edge, and was very effective in the big-screen environment.<br /><br />It was also interesting to see how much Scott carried forward from this movie, especially into Blade Runner. Alien has an earlier and cleaner form of the Tech Noir environment, man-made but somehow lacking in places for humans to fit in. Blade Runner toned down the flashing distractions, but made them into a kind of background that never allowed a truly quiet moment.<br /><br />This movie works in a lot of ways: by itself, in its genre, and in the careers of Scott and Weaver. Even though effects technology has changed in the last 25 years, this movie still carries itself well.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>"Alien" is Ridley Scott&#8217;s masterful &#8220;haunted house in outer space&#8221; movie, the one where tall and incredibly gorgeous Sigourney Weaver meets the relentless space monsters for the first time....<br /><p>Yes, this is a scary movie, but another word for it would be &#8220;funky.&#8221; From the lived-in look of the Nostromo (the space tug Weaver&#8217;s first mate on) to the grubby jumpsuits and tennis shoes the crew wears, this movie has a very grungy ambience. Add H.R. Giger&#8217;s insane insect creatures and exploding eggs, and you&#8217;ve got the birth of a franchise- and source material for an infinite series of rip-offs set everywhere from outer space to under the sea. When this came out (1979), it looked like nothing else. Now, you&#8217;ll notice how it looks like EVERYTHING else, which just goes to show you the genius involved here.<br /><p>It's far more than just a stylistic exercise, though; this movie&#8217;s got quirky characters galore. Weaver&#8217;s the tough, no-nonsense lieutenant, Tom Skerrit is the not-so forceful captain, Yaphett Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton are the ultra-working class stiffs of a blue collar bunch, and Veronica Cartwright is sort of shrill, but compassionate. Brits John Hurt and Ian Holm round out the crew: Hurt is the poor schlep who gets impregnated by the nastiest crab outside bad seafood buffet and Holm is the creepy, milk-drinking science officer with a secret agenda.<br /><p> "Alien" has a simple plot, with scares of every kind... mounting tension, the old jump-at-the camera trick, the false-sense-of-security ending and more.  The DVD features a wide-screen, crisp print and incredible sound, plus a snazzy animated menu based on the "Mother" computer from the film. It gives the whole experience an immersive quality.

The level of detail in this film is amazing, a bounty for the eyes. Ridley Scott created a &quot;real&quot; environment in this film, a place where one could see people living and working. Giger's alien was the most original one in film history. Although not original, the story cotained enough thrills and chills to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Great movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A8M4WE1MT4R4O.html">A8M4WE1MT4R4O</a><br/><p>The thing that amazes me  most about &quot;Alien&quot; is there are no signs of it being made in 1978!  I first saw this when I was 8 years old, and to this day, it remains one of my all time favourite movies.  The sets  are outrageous and literally out of this world.  True art!  Dark and  dreary, spooky and altogher ookey, The Alien Family! (couldn't  resist!).<p>And am i the only one who thinks this is really, the only  &quot;good&quot; Alien movie?  What is the deal with &quot;Aliens&quot;?  I  thought the sequel was totally lame.  &quot;Alien&quot; was more thought  provocking and deep.  It was also more artistic and meaningful, on an  intellectual standpoint.  It drew you more inward. It raised questions  about space and beyond, the uncertainity of darkness, our future.  The  acting was also top notch, totally believable.  The fear was so real, you  felt it, you saw it.  Perspiration drenched fear.  The psychology of  &quot;Alien&quot; and the mystery of outer space give this film a haunting  edge over the other sequels. The mystery and intruigue, the quietness,  except for the humming of the spacecraft cast an eerie gloom, delving you  further into the realm of space, drawing you nearer to the Alien!  Suspenseful and glorious.</p></br><a href="../users/A238M34Z3X2IBD.html">A238M34Z3X2IBD</a><br/><p>When done right, buying a DVD is more than just buying a movie, but more like buying a library... and ALIEN is a library of pure entertainment (on a scale of one to ten on FIDDLE FACTOR - i.e. how many bells, whistles and  switches to play with... ALIEN get's a ten... you'll spend an hour or two  just flipping through features having fun).  Packed with extras, you can't  go wrong with this first in the ALIEN series.  Original posters, concept  art, original alien design, plus a crisp, clean film transfer... you can't  go wrong with this.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>This film features one of the greatest scenes of all time starring one of the greatest actors of all times...Jones the cat!<p>Jonesy is adorable, yet so devious! I'm sure Sigourney Weaver was equally impressed with his plethora of feline talents. <p>Who can forget Jones leading Harry Dean Stanton to his death and then looking expressionless into the camera as we hear Stanton screaming in mortal pain! Sly, lil devil that Jonesy is! Or how about that fabulous scene where we see Jones emote great fear as the Alien stares at him in his futuristic cat carrier! <p>I'm no one to fantasize too much, but I like to believe Jones tipped off the Alien as to the location of Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright, thus sparing his own life in return. <p>In Aliens we saw the return of Jones, only this time with a different cat...and we could tell! This faux-Jones let loose with a half-hearted hiss, but the fans knew he was nothing but a cheap knock-off!</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>I'm a fan of the old Ridley Scott, which was ironically the young Ridley Scott. Back in his youth he made some great films and Alien is one of his crowning achievements. But let's ignore the film for just a second.<br /><br />You see the Scott Brothers (Ridley and Tony) had a highly visual sense of film-making that used the widescreen frame to its fullest potential. From quite early on they were made best pals of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and they made their reputations with such films like Beverly Hills Cop 2, Blade Runner and Top Gun. In the early 90's their careers briefly faltered and a hack called Michael Bay went into business. Michael Bay ripped off everything he possible could from the Scotts. So much so that in recent years Ridley and Tony have had to exaggerate their style in an effort to distance themselves from this man. The result has been films that look more like agonising, drawn-out epileptic seizures (Man on Fire, Black Hawk Down, Domino) than works of art.<br /><br />Now let's get back to Alien. A beautifully paced, shot and cut fright machine with perfectly timed scares, meaningful subtext and an iron-grip on the audience. How far removed from the work of the Scott Brothers today. The franchise went to hell in 2004 with the awful Alien vs Predator movie but in its beginning the Alien films were a thing of greatness.<br /><br />If you can, see the director's cut. I saw this film twice in the cinema (original cut, then director's cut) and while they're both good the director's cut is a bit faster and has a couple real cool extra scenes and shot of the creature. And of course, widescreen is how this film MUST be seen.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a brilliant DTS 5.1 soundtrack and ZILLIONS of extras to keep you happy.</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>Are you afraid of the dark? This movie is the science fiction masterpiece. The look, the sound, the simplicity, the terror. Great film all around. "In space no one can hear you scream."</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Alien is a great Sci-Fi film with Suspense thrown in there, I like the cast and the effects despite the gross parts. Looking at the movie now in Hindsight one can appreciate it more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P2JXU9JEYNV3.html">A2P2JXU9JEYNV3</a><br/><p>"Alien" is controversial in a number of ways. It was the first truly scary film that did not use the time-honored way of frightening filmgoers (eerie music reaching a crescendo, glimpses and/or sounds of the "creature", carefully timed screams, or other devices). There is debate on whether or not it was the precursor of all these Hacker/Slasher films, such as "Friday The 13th", Halloween, etc. I believe it was, because those films did not exist before "Alien" was released.<br /><br />It was also the first Sci-fi/Horror film that had a totally believable and sinister Antagonist. Imagine seeing a species of alien that had more than one incarnation (think of Moths and Butterfies). Each stage of the alien's growth cycle is revealed, showing a predatory penchant for it to progress to the next cycle.<br /><br />Place into the mix, the crew of an interstellar ore refinery, that for all intents and purposes, act like a somewhat dysfunctional family, rather than a group of professionals. All through the film, you find yourself saying (even if it's only to yourself) things like, "No, don't go in THERE!", or "Knucklehead! don't do THAT!!".<br /><br />Even the refinery takes on the trappings of a Haunted House! Nooks and crannies EVERYWHERE! This is made even more painfully obvious with system failures going on, and a general look of disarray. Light and shadow work in this area is remeniscent of the old black and white horror films of the fifties.<br /><br />That a woman was the only survivor after a draining escape and evasion sequence throughout the ship with the creature, is also a first. In the past, it was the Handsome Hero saving some screaming, frightful mouse frozen with fear, but not "Alien". Oh, no! We see Sigourney Weaver transform into a representation of the creature, itself, to survive.<br /><br />There is much to recommend this film, outside of the points outlined above, as a must-see for any true horror film fan.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Someone once said, "There's a thin line between brilliance and absurdity."  More than any other film, Ridley Scott's "Alien" supports that statement.  It began as a low-budget project for notorious schlock producer Roger Corman, then titled "Star Beast," but somehow, along the way, everything just came together.  If anyone but the great Mr. Scott had directed the film, if Sigourney Weaver had not received her breakthrough role as feminist icon Ellen Ripley, if the film had come together any other way, it might have been just what it began as: a turgid, $3-admission grindhouse flick.  Instead, "Alien" wound up as one of the finest films in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Released at the peak of audiences' fascination with sci-fi films at the end of the 70s, the plotline behind "Alien" is classic: a mining ship, drifting through space in the far future, reluctantly responds to an S.O.S. from a distant planet.  They land on the planet and find a downed spacecraft, the fossilized body of a gigantic non-human lifeform, and within the spacecraft legions of what appear to be eggs.  One foolish crew member decides to stick his face into one of the eggs, and so begins the horror of "Alien," as one-by-one the crew is picked off by an alien lifeform perfectly designed to kill.  Most of the cast received their starmaking roles in this film, most notably Weaver, who is arguably the most iconic female in cinematic history.  Ian Holm delivers a delectably devious performance as Ash, the ship's scientist, who isn't who he seems.  The most menacing character nevers appear on-screen: the corporation for which the crew works, referred to simply as "the Company."  (It appeared more prominently in the sequels, where it was given a name: Weyland-Yutani.)<br /><br />Ridley Scott is the driving force behind the picture. He's made many great films, two which are among the best ever made (the other being his brilliant sci-fi neo-noir "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HC2LIK">Blade Runner</a>"), but "Alien" is his greatest masterpiece.  Through dark lighting, claustrophobic sets and camerawork, and seamless editing, not to mention some of the most realistic performances ever in a sci-fi film, Scott fashions what may well be the most suspenseful, horrific film ever made.  That's why "Alien" stands above all its sequels: more than a sci-fi thriller, it's an artful, unsurpassably tense picture which captures fear like no other.  It's a testament to the timelessness of the film that "Alien" remains so damned scary to this day, nearly thirty years after its release.  To add the tension, there's not a lot of music in the film when compared to others like it.  The score is composed by Jerry Goldsmith, and when it does appear in the film, Goldsmith's music is wonderful, at once in tune with the film and with a winningly classic sound to it.<br /><br />Of course, the film wouldn't be anywhere near so scary if the titular alien was the most chilling, ghastly creature ever to grace the screen.  It's truly an ingenious concoction, thanks to the brilliant and twisted mind of H.R. Giger, who designed the beast.  The fact that it's simply a man in a suit doesn't matter at all - in fact, that makes it all the more frighteningly real.  The final touch is the stunningly intricate, spotlessly designed, and flawlessly detailed production design by Michael Seymour.<br /><br />Those who appreciate film and have put off watching "Alien," because it's a sci-fi movie, because it sounds silly, or for whatever other reason, are making an immense mistake.  "Alien" is one of the great cinematic masterpieces, classic in style (one scene feels like it was taken straight out of a Hitchcock film) "and timeless in the pantheon of movie masterworks.  Though its numerous are worth nothing as well (particularly James Cameron's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXAE">Aliens</a>," a film which ranks just behind Scott's original), none rivaled the legendary original.  The film is flawless and a classic, including at least two unforgettable scenes (the ending and the infamous "chestburster" scene) to match an unforgettable, truly remarkable film.  In space, no one can hear you scream - a good thing for our astronauts, because Ridley Scott's masterpiece has garnered many a scream, and no doubt shall continue to do so for ages to come.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Alien must be seen in widescreen and heard in Dolby. It was one of the original widescreen video releases that did good quality stereo. There is just so much in the design element to Alien that Scott launched his career out of it as a major Hollywood player plus adding a female action hero even defined a whole new generation of film making thought. It was even more interesting that it came of the back of an idea penned by John Carpenter's buddy Dan O'Bannon, called "Star Beast."<br /><br />The poster is one of the most interesting of all time. It is just so suggestive and that tag line "In space no one can hear you scream" spells a new genre of science-fiction/horror and Alien is exactly that and then some more. The deep space opening sequence is perfectly slow, the crew coming out of their hyper-sleep, the inside design of the ship, Scott's background talent in art-design coming to the forefront of the movie within the first frame, realism in science-fiction movie characters!, the challenging dialogue, Hollywood mainstream this is not. The crashed UFO can barely be seen or made out on the full screen tape, but in widescreen you just see so much more and on DVD it is cleaner even still. A whole new movie is right here.<br /><br />The infamous chest-busting sequence still has all the impact that it originally had, the surprise twist in the story coming after various members of the ships crew go missing, is likewise a surprise, the alien hunt in the shafts and the closing of the vents like nails on a chalkboard means now we also get to hear the re-mastered sound on DVD, and the movie Alien has some of the best sound effects ever for a film.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine that a film this perfect can actually be topped by its sequel. Alien is one of the scariest films ever made. Its sequel, Aliens, happens to be a lot scarier but still the best in the series are the first two movies and let's leave it at that.<br /><br />Why box set?</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>When Ridley Scott's Alien was first released in the summer of 1979, I was too young to see it, but it still held a certain fascination for me. I remember that scary image of the egg with unholy green light creeping out through a crack and the tagline -- "In space no one can hear you scream."<br /><br />Alien came at a good time in American cinema, when studios were spending big bucks to ramp up the old genre films and make new epics out of them; what West Side Story did for musicals and The Godfather did for gangster films, Alien (along with The Exorcist) did for horror films.<br /><br />Studios would have welcomed yet another Star Wars rip-off to cash in on the still-rampant sci-fi fever, but Scott turned in an Alien that's about as anti-Star Wars as you can get.<br /><br />At the same time, the studios still gambled on bravery. A huge summer blockbuster could actually be made without a thundering soundtrack, a stupid romantic subplot, or brain-dead one-liners. A film could move at a snail's pace, using atmosphere, sound effects, silences, adult dialogue and great acting to build interest. These days, such films (Soderbergh's Solaris or Van Sant's Gerry) are treated with a warmth usually reserved for invasive garden slugs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Alien also invented a ton of cliches that, in the ensuing 24 years, have become all too familiar.<br /><br />And so watching this classic on the big screen today in a new "director's cut," elicits four different emotions: nostalgia, suspense, boredom and frustration.<br /><br />The plot, for those who missed it the first time, consists of seven astronauts hauling several thousand tons of ore across deep space. During their long hypersleep, they're awakened to investigate a mysterious signal and danger ensues.<br /><br />After visiting a stormy planet, Kane (John Hurt) comes back with an alien stuck to his face. The little bugger gets loose, grows and begins killing off the entire crew: science officer Ash (Ian Holm), Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) and engine room operators Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton).<br /><br />The cool Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) survives and goes on to make three sequels.<br /><br />Jonesy the cat is also spared to cause some of the film's biggest problems. He exists only for two purposes: either to suddenly jump out of the dark, causing a false scare, or to cause crew members to walk around the ship searching for him so that they can accidentally run into the alien.<br /><br />The monster itself is still one of the flat-out scariest ever designed for the movies. That it was played by a man in a suit works mainly because -- unlike computer effects -- we can sense that the characters and the monster are physically in the room together.<br /><br />But the sheer starkness of the filmmaking, Scott's brutal, inventive use of light, space and sound, and the stripped-down storytelling make this a classic nonetheless. Nearly every shot is lit from either behind or beneath, making it look like everyone's sitting around a campfire telling horror stories with the flashlight held just below their chin.<br /><br />Scott was also smart enough not to show all of the creature at once, concentrating instead on bits and pieces. In this way, it seems bigger, more unreal and more menacing because it exists mostly in our imagination.<br /><br />As for the "director's cut," fans will find about four new minutes scattered here and there: a brief catfight between Ripley and Lambert, a new death scene for Brett and a spooky scene that was later borrowed for the excellent sequel Aliens (1986).</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>Ridley's Scotts 1979 masterpiece has proved once again, you don't need to see the evil to put a scare into your bones. Dark, pulsating and quick when it needs to be. Like Hitchcock, it is more scary to see less then what you should. Jerry Goldsmiths music is penetrating and yet resourceful, you know whats going on when you hear it. A landmark film for letting the lead person be a woman, while in other horror films they fail. Sigourney kicks some serious ass in this. Singnature scene, dinner table, with the un-invited guest, unbelievable, shocking, disturbing, but we don't turn away.  No need to see the alien, the music and tenseness is as good as it gets. When we do see him, I about sh#t my pants, the best alien ever on film, period. This film is awesome, watch to the end, I promise, you will want to watch again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Alien' is a film that has stood the test of time remarkably well.<br /><br />Following a crew on a large mining space ship, we see what happens to them when they pick up a distress signal and encounter an alien life form. Despite the age of this film the special effects are still remarkably creepy and at times could still rival films of today. The sets are the parts of this film that seem the most dated, but even these add a certain kitschy charm. This film spawned a movie franchise that went on for decades, but this is the one that held the most suspense, despite later ones having more gore and violence. Re-watching it today I was surprised just how creepy and eerie it was compared to what I remembered.<br /><br />This is acted and directed well and the alien effects are still impressive and coupled with a good storyline this makes for one superb sci-fi/horror film. A classic that should be watched at least once in your lifetime.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KLP39OKXD5P.html">A5KLP39OKXD5P</a><br/><p>I am usually not much into Sci-fi fiction or  Action oriented movies. When I first came across the movie 'Alien', I didn't have much expectations from the movie at all. I anticipated the movie to be just another cheap sci fi movie, but I was wrong.

Excellent performences by John Hurt, Veronica Catwright, Sigourney Weaver and almost every one. This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat and will keep you wondering what will happen next. Also proves, classics are classics afterall.</p></br><a href="../users/AE42JLYPXUI45.html">AE42JLYPXUI45</a><br/><p>In 1979, Ridley Scott had given us a film that is considered to be the scariest film in Science Fiction history. That film is entitled, ALIEN. ALIEN has been a favorite with so many people around the world. It is the film that set the stage for three sequels that are worthy to this original film. The film also features a Sigourney Weaver in her first starring role.<br /><br />On their way back to Earth, a crew of seven people aboard the space craft, The Nostromo, are ready to fight for their lives against a creature that is perfectly evolved to clearly wipe out mankind. In this crew, there is CAPTAIN DALLAS (played by Tom Skerritt), LT. RIPLEY (played by Sigourney Weaver), LAMBERT (played by Veronica Cartwright), BRETT (played by Harry Dean Stanton), KANE (played by John Hurt), ASH (played by Ian Holm), & PARKER (played by Yaphet Kotto). As they learn that they are half-way back to Earth, they receive a signal from a nearby planet called LV-426. They mistake the signal for an S.O.S. They land on LV-426, but crashing the ship just a bit. The ship can easily be repaired. Dallas, Kane, and Lambert are set to investigate what is on this planet. Kane finds dozens of eggs lying around. One particular egg hatches, but Kan does not have a chance to look at what is inside, for some sort of organism, known as the face-hugger, jumps out and attaches itself to Kane's face. Back on board, Ash and Dallas get Kane out of his space suit and helmet. They are shocked to see the face-hugger. They try taking the face-hugger off, but the face-hugger bleeds concentrated acid. They decide that it may kill Kane if they try prying it off, so they leave it alone. About an hour or two later, Dallas, Ripley, and Ash find that the face-hugger is off of Kane's face. The face-hugger has died, and Kane has now awaken. They all sit down to have dinner, but Kane never gets a chance to eat, for a little creature bursts through Kane's chest. The little creature is an alien that will soon grow into a gigantic killing machine.<br /><br />Parker, Brett, and Ripley head out to find the little alien. Instead, they find Ripley's frightened cat, Jones. Brett goes after Jones, but finds that the alien has shed his skin and is now a gigantic killing machine. He finds Jones, but even before he can grab him, Brett turns around to find the alien that was once a small little creature standing behind in front of him. Brett sees the end of his life. Dallas has a plan to get rid of it, but he dies in the process. One by one, every crew member is slain, until Ripley is left. She sets a self-destruct bomb on the ship, grabs Jones, and gets safely in the shuttle. As the shuttle pulls away from The Nostromo, Ripley watches The Nostromo blow into nothing with the alien inside. As Ripley prepares to go into hypersleep, she finds the alien aboard the shuttle with her. She blows the alien out of the airlock, finally killing it. She finally gets into hypersleep, while waiting for the network to find her in the next six weeks.<br /><br />ALIEN is definitely the best film in all of Science Fiction history. It is an award-winning film that set the stage for its three stunning sequels that were well on their way. If you have not seen ALIEN, well, now's your chance. So buy a copy for yourselves, sit back, and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>The first installment in the &quot;Alien&quot; series, is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made; the claustrophobic environment of the Nostromo spaceship and an almost invincible Alien creature victimizing one by one the other passengers, make this film a must-see for any movie fan. Even if &quot;Alien&quot; was released in 1979, this sci-fi film remains as one of the best thrillers that you can find; by the time when Sigourney Weaver (Lt. Ripley) meets the monster for the final battle, your attention will be focused only in the screen.<br /><br /> As Ellen Ripley, Sigourney Weaver set the standard for the movie heroines to come, and the rest of the cast made a great job as well. The film hasn't dated a bit, it still feels futuristic and disturbing every time you see it. If you are sick of teenager slashing flicks that instead of making you feel horror, make you laugh out loud, check this one, &quot;Alien&quot; is a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Ridley Scott<br />Cast:  Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphett Koto, Veronica Cartwright.<br />Running Time:  116 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<p>Not too often does a film come along that changes the course of a genre such as &quot;Alien&quot;.  While &quot;Halloween&quot; transformed the slasher film category from an underground gimmick to the mainstream, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; made demonic cinema not only appalling by Oscar-worthy, and &quot;Jaws&quot; set the tone for all future summer blockbusters, &quot;Alien&quot; slipped under the radar and eventually become one of the most acclaimed science-fiction/horror films of all time.<p>The principle is basic (and used hundreds of times since its release in 1979):  a space crew has to emergency land on an unknown planet due to a ship malfunction.  While they are fixing up their craft on this mysterious world of LV-426, they encounter strange-looking parasites, yet think nothing of it.  One of the parasites latches onto a crew member and discharges a horrific creature inside--which bursts from the chest and proceeds to feast on the rest of the crew members.  Sigourney Weaver is brilliant as the unsuspected heroine, battling the acid-spitting, face-for-a-tongue monster with all of her grit and might.<p>Director Ripley Scott uses a gloriously constructed set to develop a tense, terrifying film that has lasted the tests of time to still be considered one of the best.  Weaver's performance was not only a chance to showcase her acting ability, but also a metaphorical stange for the entire female industry--proclaiming that men do not always have to be the heroes in film.  Good special effects, a passable script, and fine performances throughout.  Has lost its effectiveness over the years and was outdone by the stupendous sequel &quot;Aliens&quot;, but the original is still a master work of terror and is just as important as any film in the late 1970s.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'Alien' is still good after all these years.

I knew that I was going to get a chance to witness one of the most atmospheric and thrilling films of all time--with added footage. Fans who picked up the DVD (now out of print to make way for the new &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot;) may have already seen a few of the deleted segments, while other fans who didn't, and are waiting on the promised quadrilogy to be released next year, will be enthralled. This film doesn't feature a wealth of new footage such as &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux,&quot; scenes that could damage its flow, but instead gives us scenes that click together a bit more. One of these is when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) finds Dallas (Tom Skerritt) attached to the wall with alien mucus seen later in &quot;Aliens.&quot; It doesn't make sense to feature it in the original cut, and director Ridley Scott was smart for deleting it when the film hit theaters back in 1979. It doesn't really make much sense, and stops the gripping flow of the ending when Ripley is racing to get to the escape shuttle. It causes people to think, What? and then they start letting their minds wander. But now that we have seen &quot;Aliens,&quot; and understand the significance of the mucus (sounds funny, huh?), it makes complete sense. This is the fan's version.<p>Plus, it's fun to get to see the movie on the big screen for those who didn't twenty-four years ago.<p>The plot (as if you didn't know it by now): A mining ship in the future named the Nostromo, carrying seven passengers back to earth, stops in its course to locate an SOS beacon on a distant planet, which may, or may not, actually be a warning signal as opposed to a distress beacon--too late to find out, since they land on the planet and one of the investigating crew members, Kane (John Hurt), gets attacked by a strange alien creature that attaches itself to his face and doesn't let go.<p>The ship's captain, Dallas, hauls him into the ship's lab, where he is looked over by the ship's scientist, Ash (Ian Holm), who takes an odd affection to the creature that bothers Ripley, the second in command. The technician, Parker (Yaphet Kotto), doesn't like any of this either, and their suspicions reach a maximum when Kane wakes up from his sleep, the alien unattached from his face, and proceeds to eat irregularly. Later that night, back in their course to earth, a small alien bursts from Kane's stomach at dinner. The alien escapes into the depths of the ship. Search parties commence but the alien starts to grow more fierce and terrifying as the film treads on--soon it's a man-eating set of teeth bent on killing the lot of them.<p>Atmosphere is part of what makes &quot;Alien&quot; the terrifying nail-biter it is. This isn't a routine horror flick that jumps through all the hoops--it's original to a certain degree. Its inspiration comes from earlier films but it improves upon them all for the most part. From its opening shots to its final, it is eerie, moody, and scary. To show millions of aliens abounding from hidden crevices would be typical--the fear of &quot;Alien&quot; lies in the anticipation of the jump, or the startle. We wait, and wait, and suddenly something leaps at the screen. It's not the alien. The alien is in front of the thing that jumped. Our heart stops and then jolts again. Forget pumping volts of electricity through dead people--place them in front of this and their hearts will pound once again.<p>James Cameron's sequel &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986) is often considered the better of the series, in terms of excitement and aliens themselves. But &quot;Alien,&quot; like the movie &quot;Signs&quot; (2002), isn't really about aliens. The film &quot;Aliens&quot; is terrific--but so is &quot;Alien,&quot; as its central idea is too unnerve the audience through bumps and jolts. Not through blood and guts. Depends on what your personal preferences are--startles or explosions? I appreciate and enjoy both.<p>Ridley Scott knows how to evoke wonder and magnificence from his shots. The opening sequence that shows the exterior of the Nostromo and then dissolves to the interior, crawling along the shafts as we wait for something scary to happen and then forget as we are wowed by the movement and visuals, is a fine example of the art of filmmaking and not the filmmaking itself. Cameron is one of my favorite directors. Scott, when given the right material, can turn out wonders. &quot;Alien&quot; is his crowning achievement alongside the dark 1982 classic &quot;Bladerunner,&quot; another sci-fi feast for the eyes and mind. I wasn't a fan of &quot;Gladiator,&quot; but let's not bring that up, shall we?<p>&quot;Alien&quot; may seem tame by today's standards. But this isn't a film that wants to be another mindless blood and guts extravaganza. This is a smart horror film, one that is as involving as it visually magnificent, one that is as amazing as it is terrifying. This is horror at its finest. And if you didn't get to see it on the big screen last time around, now is your chance to get a glance at what you've been missing all these years.<p>Notes: The new &quot;Alien: Director's Cut&quot; version features over three minutes of never-before-seen sequences, as well as restored prints and a newly remixed surround-sound track. Attached to the director's release of the film is also the first teaser trailer for next year's &quot;Alien vs. Predator.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A13RM1AWD1C5ZR.html">A13RM1AWD1C5ZR</a><br/><p>Alien is one of the great sci-fi/horror films ever made.  Hitting theatres back in 1979, it created a true and new type of science-fiction.  I was fortunate to see the re-released in October of 2003 in theatres, and it is a great opportunity, one which shouldn't be missed.  Alien a film which made Director Ridley Scott, and actors Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm as well as others into stars.<br />  The film takes place in space, where a group of explorers have embarked upon a true, fascinating discovery.  Huge eggs, which cannot be explained.  What they are, where'd they came from, how's they evolved?  What they discover soon becomes the ultimate horror.  A killing machine, stalking and taunting its victim one by one.  The film offers quite a few scary and chilling moments.  Director Ridley Scott, who has made many critically acclaimed movies (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Thelma &amp; Louise, Hannibal,  and the recent Matchstick Men) makes one of the best films of our generation.<br />  Alien: The Director's Cut, does feature new footage, about several minutes.  Alien came out on Halloween (10-31-03), and it would make sense as to why.  A great film, especially to view on the big screen if you haven't yet.<br />  Alien is rated R for Science Fiction Violence/Gore and Language.  The film has one fairly bloody sequence as well as alien attacks.  The profanity is moderate.  All in all, an entertaining movie worth seeing.  Own the DVD or Video.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Alien follows a group of six explorers who were basically duped into thinking they served some other purpose than to obtain the ultimate weapon. This weapon is a vile form of alien life that simply kills and breeds.  It's blood is molecular acid, it's body is one organic weapon after another and it grows extremely fast after taking another life that had been it's host.<br /><br />Alien is the purest of the sci-fi/horror genre.  It is also one of the first of it's kind and truely the pinnacle of it's kind.  It is all downhill from here, but the standard was so high we don't care to acknowledge this decline.  Alien is not only one of my favorite films of all time but it is also unquestionably one of the greatest films of all time and the few who disagree will have a tough view to spin.  The script is compelling with it's fiction and ideas of an ambiguous future setting that places the film in an unnerving microcosmic isolation.  There is enough to satisfy everyone, from space fans who want to hear about the atmosphere on the Alien's planetoid  and the horror fans who want to be scared by shock or spooky subtleties.  At it's heart, Alien is old school gothic horror in the setting of space.<br /><br />Some horror films are fortunate enough to have one scene that is memorable and will be praised for generations.  Then there are the horror elite that have more than that and are unforgettable from beginning to end.  The Exorcist, The Shining, Psycho, Jaws and Halloween are such films...and so is Alien.  Whether it be the slow-paced questioning of John Hurt's character's fate in the quarantined room with a parasite attached to his face keeping him alive, the scene with Tom Skerritt's character in the air shaft waiting for the Alien to come to him or the scene where we actually wait as the Alien burrows it's way through Hurt's character's body and out to eventually wreak havoc on the rest of the crew, Alien is without a doubt unforgettable. It is a staple in both the science fiction and horror genres and a must-have for fans of either.<br /><br />The most outstanding part about Alien to me is the fact that it is handled meticulously.  The scene when that Alien bursts out of Hurt's stomach is fairly layered and foreshadows Ash's (Ian Holm) real intentions but not enough where you know what is happening exactly, although maybe enough where you suspect something.  He is of course an android that takes the crew off course to obtain this life form and study it.  The scene has Holm studying Hurt as he is about die with a face that spells "Hmmm, let's see what this thing can actually do".  I credit Holm just as much as Scott for this example but Ridley Scott is without question an impeccable filmmaker.  Scott is also one of the most versatile filmmakers around.  He is almost on the same plateau as Spielberg for me.<br /><br />Finally, Alien is also groundbreaking for it's characters and mostly of course the character of Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver in what has to among the earliest portrayals of a women emerging as the protagonist in a film like this. Her emergence from the rest of the cast by the way is an extremely effective device in which too many films that have followed Alien have forgot to apply.  Even in good horror films we know full well who is going to survive all of the horrors before the credits even begin.  In Alien we really have no idea.  Weaver's character is given absolutely no special treatment by the script whatsoever.  She is simply Ripley, one of the two female crew members that by chance and wit has survived this horrifying encounter.  It also makes the horror of it far better because we might actually think for a minute that Skerritt's character is going to survive that ballsy plunge into the air vents.  This point is precisely why all of the sequels are just not as good as Alien is.  Although Jim Cameron knew what he had to do and opted to create a quality film of sci-fi action chaos with all the mysteries revealed by it's predecessor and although I'm running against popular opinion here, David Fincher's Alien 3 deserves some credit too.  The four installment is sort of a waste.<br /><br />Horror without mystery is simply madness and madness is not nearly as frightening as it is shocking.  This is why so few horror films are praised by critics.  Alien is not just original and innovative; it is sharpened, sophisticated and finer than the great majority of all films.  The fact that it provokes fear and excitement as well as thought makes it even more exceptional.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Nostromo, a spaceship returning to Earth with a mineral load, suddenly changes course automatically to investigate a distress call, originating from an unknown planet. This is the beginning to a frightening meeting with an alien showing no mercy to other races.<br /><br />Having seen this film recently reminds me that it's quite possibly one of the 5 best science fiction films of all time. The atmospheric feel of the movie is incredibly realistic, which only adds to the movie's suspense. Even if you have seen the un-cut version of the movie, this novelization adds so much more to the story.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott has become one of the most respected men within movie-making today. With films like `Alien,' `Bladerunner' and `1492: Conquest of Paradise,' he has shown that visually stunning films with deep suspense have much to offer. `Alien' was his first and best movie, with its dark and terrifying atmosphere it showed the unknown side of space.<br /><br />In the Academy award it won for its impressive visual effects. `Star Trek: The Motion Picture' lost its nominations in the same category. Other than that, all die hard Sci- Fi fans should already have this unless you are unto your second copy, as for the rest it's a must have.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>After 4 Alien films, this is still my favorite.  A case can be made for Aliens, but to me Aliens is a straight out action film.  Alien however is a brilliant combination of horror and sci fi.  It is very creepy, but also has some intense action.  I would pick up the box set with all the bells and whistles.  While the 3rd and 4th part has some flaws, they are all worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>After seeing "Prometheus" earlier it seemed appropriate to catch this classic again.  Some of the shots of computer visuals and sounds are quaint, given the technology advances since 1979.  Putting that aside, "Alien" holds up as one of the great science fiction/horror films of all time.  It is also director Ridley Scott's earliest masterpiece.<br /><br />Returning on a routine cargo hauling mission, the 7 man crew of the Nostromo is woken up from hibernation with a directive to investigate a signal coming from a nearby moon. Lead by Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), they investigate and find the remains of a huge humanoid figure at the controls of an unusual space ship.  They also discover a slimy substance oozing from a cluster of pod-like elements.  One attaches to the face plate of the second in command, Kane (John Hurt).<br /><br />Once back at the ship, efforts to remove the creature are stymied but it soon disappears only to reappear bursting out Kane in the now iconic scene.  The remainder of the film focuses on the crew's efforts to jettison the creature.  Scott takes great pains to inject chair-gripping suspense as the now growing creature remains mostly hidden from view.  As one of the great film characters, Sigourney Weaver catapults to stardom (and 3 sequels) as Ripley, 3rd in command.  After watching this movie countless times, the tension remains even having memorized the scenes.  Truly one of my favorite films.<br /><br />This film was seen as part of the Blu ray "Alien Anthology" collection.  The film has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is transferred in 1080p.  The soundtrack is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The video is an improvement over the DVD, but does retain the grain of the original film.  It is sharp, has appropriate color saturation and hues.  Excellent.  The sound is demo quality.  Perfect.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>This double DVD box set is a must addition for any collector of science fiction films. The second DVD in the set describes how the plot was first conceived by a couple of unknown writers, developed, rewritten by competant studio writers and then skillfully crafted into a great work by Ridley Scott. Although the scenario which produced this film may have resulted from a favorable combination of random events, the excellent direction the movie received was no accident. Ultimately, everything came together to produce a really outstanding film.<br /><br />The documentary which describes the evolution of the alien saga is worth the price of the box set alone.  The original and relatively unknown writers were permitted to comment and contribute to the film production by director Ridley Scott.  The writers tale of this long arduous journey which culminates in the opening of the film gives insight to the satisfaction of witnessing the realization of an original screen vision.<br /><br />Based on Amazon's published statistics above Alien needs no further endorsement from me. I just wish to say "amen" to everything good that has been said and comment on my movie going experience and the effect it had on me and the audience in the year it came out.<br /><br />I went to see this film as a 30 year old man who was breast fed on horror and science fiction movies. I acquired a taste for horror by watching these movies since my very early years when my older brother "permitted" me stay up to watch late night TV. I, like so many others, became a die-hard fan of classic horror and sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From its suspenseful and well paced opening to its thrilling conclusion we in the audience knew we were watching something brilliant. The film immediately allowed us to suspend disbelief and become totally immersed in the plot. The credible and very elaborate sets, costumes, suspenseful music, and deliberately controlled pace all made for the sci-fi experience of a lifetime.<br /><br />The two surprising scenes of the "chestburster" and the beheading of the robot Ash had an effect on the audience made up of both younger and older people who were shocked into animated discussion. The audience continued their nervous discussions as the film progressed comparing ideas of where the film would go next while still trying to follow the story. When the movie ended the audience rose in unison to their feet cheering and clapping for the absent makers of the movie. We all realized that we had witnessed something very special.<br /><br />I did not realize until I tried to go to sleep that night that for the first time in perhaps 20 years I would have a difficult time. It took me an unusually long time to drop off, as I stirred under the blankets occasionally peeking around the dark room in dread of seeing Giger's Alien and the doomed crew of the NOSTROMO.<br /><br />As an aside, I really enjoyed the computer voice effects for MOTHER, who did appear to possess a personality as well as AI in the final action packed scenes</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7.html">A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7</a><br/><p>This is the best movie with aliens in it!!!!! Great for any horror, space, or alien movie fan!!!! This is about some people<br />who are travilng into space. One day, this little baby alien burst out of a man stomic. The alien later grows up and stats killing the space crew!!! This was a great movie. The acting was great along with the cool alien. This movie is a classic!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Whenever my mother describes her first experience seeing "The Exorcist", she always says that its a movie that was supposed to be viewed on a large screen with a powerful sound system (like in a movie theater).  She saw it on TV, and so it was smaller, quieter, and had many things cut out.  She wasn't too scared.  Anyway, I saw Alien for the first time on TV as well, but it was on a movie channel, so nothing was cut out.  Still, it wasn't the horror film that I had heard it to be.<br /><br />The plot deals with the crew of an interstellar towing ship called the Nostromo.  The seven people work for "the company", and they are returning to Earth with a shipment of ore.  On the way home, the ship receives a sigal, which awakens the crew from hyper-sleep.  Their contracts say that any SOS must be checked out, so they do, for they believe the signal to be an SOS.  Except for one person on the ship, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver).  Three crew members explore the planet's surface, and they find a big cavernous room that houses hundreds of weird egg-like objects.  When one of the eggs hatches, a small creature emerges, and attatches itself to Kane's (John Hurt) face.  This is why it is known to many as the "face-hugger".  The trio defies quarantine procedure and returns to the ship in an attempt to save Kane.  They try to cut the face-hugger off, but its blood is acidic.  It appears to be at least 10 times as acidic as hydrochloric acid, one of the most powerful acids known to man.  Eventually, the face-hugger dies, and Kane is revived.  Soon however, a new creature bursts out of his chest (i.e. the "chest-burster"), and runs away.  It very quickly grows into a man-sized monster with large claws, acidic blood, a mouth full of teeth, and a smaller head filled with teeth inside its mouth.  One by one, it kills of the crew, until only one remains.<br /><br />For 1979, the special effects were pretty good.  The acting was fairly strong, and the story was interesting.  There was only one major plot twist but it was a good one.<br /><br />Finally, I must say that the description of the alien as a "perfect creature" is almost true.  It has an amazing defense mechanism, the acid-blood.  Unless one kills it without piercing its skin, the killer probably won't last too long either.  It can adapt to nearly any environment, even a vacuum.  Finally, even the way it breeds is deadly to its enemies.  First, there is an egg.  The egg hatches and a face-hugger is born.  The face-hugger finds a host and attatches itself to its mouth and nose.  It keeps the host alive and deposits and fertilizes a chest-burster embryo in the host's midsection.  The face-hugger then dies and falls off.  The chest-burster gestates in the host's chest, then kills the host as it emerges.  If the chest-burster turns out to be a queen, it lays eggs, and the cycle begins anew.<br /><br />Finally, I have often heard that this is a very scary movie, but my heart-rate only increased once during the movie.  It was at the end, and it didn't have to do with the alien.  Oh well, it was still a pretty good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Alien from 1979 a really well done effective simple movie made on a budget of $8 million which was of course all done in 1 location which I do like these type of movies. It was based of a script called Star Beast by Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett. But later called Alien & later rewritten by David Giler & Walter Hill. Directed by Ridley Scott who would go on to direct Blade Runner amoung many other good movies. Stars Yalpe Kotto as Parker Tom Skeritt as Dallas, Veronica Cartwright as Lambert, John Hurt as Kane Harry Dean Stanton as Brett Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley & Ian Holm as Ash. You open up to a goup of delivery people sort to speak or truckers in space. There coming back to Earth when they respond to a destress call from a downed space craft. Crew members Kane, Dallas & Lambert respond this would become known as Boneship. Kane finds these eggs then this creature jumps right out of it & of couurse this creature would become known as the Facehugger. The Facehugger attaches itself to Kane they try to bring him back Ripley says no it that it could infect the crew there is also a deleted scene where Ripley & Lambert get into a bit of a fight in the special edition version. Dallas & Ash try to get The Facehugger off Ash acts very weird during this scene. After The Facehugger does it's "work" it dies you do goet a lttle jumpscare when the dead Facehugger falls on Ripley's shoulder which it is a jumpscare this Kane wakes up later while there eating this is where we get the famous Chestburster scene that great gore effect along with Veronica Cartwright while she's almost in tears is well done. There going after The Alien Brett instead finds Ripley's cat but The Alien is right behind him & The Alien grew at a rapid rate & then Brett is killed. Dallas & Lambert try to track it down Dallas goes down to the ventalation shaft where The Alien has been hiding this scene is great Lambert is like get out of there I'm thinking the same thing like get out of there. But He is killed. Ripley is going throug the files on Mother & finds out what Ash is up to & of course this is the big rveeal that Ash is an Android & Androids would be through out the series & Ash's smile unnerving. Yalpet Kotto's reaction is pricless "Ash is a Go  d d  a  m n Robot!" Ripley is going to set the detination device Lambert & Parker are killed while getting supplies. Also in the special edition you find out that Dallas wasn't killed he is cacooned which shows that The Aliens have another way around making the eggs. The added scenes are cool but I'm going to stick with the theatricla cut. She goes after her cat which was crazy she makes her way to The Docking Bay The Alien made it there too she opens the air lock The Alien blown out it dies that's pretty much the movie. The movie runs at a slow pace but you had great charcaters that kept me involved great creature by HR Giger good direction by Ridley Scott & good atmostphere. Of course Sigourney Weaver would go on to be in the rest of the series. Tom Skerritt Yalpet Kotto Harry Dean Satanton Veronica Cartwright John Hurt Ian Holm were all good. Next I'll review my favorite of the series next time it's WAR!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I don't see what is so amazing about "Alien."  I was convinced to watch this film after so many people bragged on it in the reviews of "Alien Vs. Predator."  Perhaps it is the fact that I saw both of the "Predator" films before any of the "Alien" franchise, but I don't see where this particular series of films is much better than a lot of other moderately good sci-fi cinema.  Honestly, I would much rather watch the original "Predator" film than either of the "Alien" movies I've watched(I've seen the original and "Resurrection").<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this film is okay, but to declare it one of the greatest, most suspenseful sci-fi flicks of all time seems to be a stretch to me.  First of all, the movie drags on forever.  I have no problem with a film taking a little time setting up the story, but please, speed this puppy up.  Secondly, where is all of the suspense that supposedly had audiences on the edge of their seats?  The only time that was truly suspenseful to me was when one of the characters goes after the ship's cat and has a run in with the Alien.  Other than that, the story was pretty predictable.<br /><br />The film is shot rather dark, but that is expected in a film of this caliber.  Much like other sci-fi and action flicks that have less than stellar special effects, "Alien" uses the darkness and close-ups to cover up its shortcomings.  I understand that this was the late 70's, so exceptional effects were still a few years away, but at least films like "Star Wars" relished in their hokey effects.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, the entire cast does a good job.  Tom Skerritt was my favorite in this flick.  The beloved Ripley character never really grabs at me like she seems to have clutched at others.  Yaphet Kotto's character is fun to watch.<br /><br />The alien creature in itself is a nice work of art.  It has that scary protruding jaw, but that gets run into the ground by excessive close-ups.  The "chestburster" was pretty cool to watch, but nothing too scary to me.  The "facehugger" wasn't anything to call home about either.<br /><br />I know I'll probably get hacked for giving such a poor review of such a beloved film, but I just cannot see what's so brilliant about this flick.  Call me what you want, but at least I'm honest.  Thanks for reading my review, and please be gentle with those helpful/not helpful votes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C7BWPATO40VA.html">A1C7BWPATO40VA</a><br/><p>I'm an old time Aliens fan. I use to sit in class and draw aliens on a piece of paper, the aliens found in this movie, not those little green men. Everyone thought I was nuts, but I sure fooled them, I'm crazy not nuts ha!<p>Read further down to have an overall fast rating if you want to watch the rest of the Aliens Trilogy set. This movie is one of the worst in the whole Trilogy. Why? They use about half of the movie to introduce the setting and object and characters of the movie. The action is rare and it is usually exciting for about a couple of moments, than it goes back to being suspense and talking.<p>However, don't be too upset. Aliens, which is part two where they just add an s, which I must say is very clever, is the best in the Trilogy. The action goes from mild, to medium, to a lot, and intense, and also introduces you to the massive alien queen. The graphics is awesome by the way, very impressed. Part 3 or Aliens 111 is plan weak, more or less like the first part, but watch it once and get ready for Aliens Ressurrection and Aliens VS. Predator coming out soon. If AvP sucks I'm no longer their Fan, blah!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>Captain Dallas is the most miserable man in the galaxy. His catchphrase is "knock it off!" This despite the fact that the crew never does anything remotely knock-off-able. Well, they do accuse engineer Brett of being a parrot. "KNOCK IT OFF! KNOCK IT OFF!!!!" Yells Dallas and flings himself around the space cabin in apoplexy. Goodness, isn't he getting enough? Sleep, I mean. Apart from months in hypersleep, of course. "Thrill me" Dallas then sneers at crewman Lambert. I wish she would. Anything to cheer the shabby old misanthrope up. He's about as much fun as finding yourself trapped in a lift with a carnivorous alien life form. Which, curiously enough, sums up the plot. But the alien has not reared it's ugly head yet, so why is Dallas making with the negative waves all the time? Upping the ante, he tells Parker that he doesn't want to see any heroics out of him. But he hasn't so far as Parker didn't even want to land on the ruddy planet in the first place. Unlike Dallas, who couldn't wait to get down to the surface. It's such a miserable place, who better than Dallas to acquire real estate at drop down prices? Dallas then abdicates his captain's duty of plunging the crew into a state of clinical depression every twelve minutes by going into the shuttle to listen to classical music. Will the crew lock him in for the duration? Knock it off. When the alien does finally appear, Dallas treats it as an annoying distraction from his life long mission to be as grouchy as possible with a loud beard. So he announces to the crew that he intends to go into the duct to tell the alien to knock it off. Curiously, nobody objects.<p>Ridley Scott does the commentary. I wish he'd knock it off. For instance, he suggests Ash's odd reaction to Ripley's assault on him was due to the fact that he'd never seen anyone cry before. What about Lambert in the previous scene? Mr Scott, I don't want to see any heroics out of you. In future, just thrill me, will ya?</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>In 1979, this became THE sci-fi horror film of the century.  It also launched the stellar career of Sigourney Weaver, who embodies the perfect female battling machine as Ripley.  What's amazing is that the second in the series, ALIENS, is even better.  But there's not much wrong with this trendsetting flick.  The movie has several classic scenes including the "facehugger", the "chestbuster" and the final confrontation in the shuttle.  Director Ridley Scott keeps everything threatening and ominous, and was wise to redo the movie to give it more light.  When I saw it in the theaters, it was so dark it was hard to tell what was going on at times, but this revision sparkles with clarity without losing the darkness of the film.  Giger's creation of the alien is truly one of the most terrifying in film history and everyone in the cast is superb:  Ian Holm as the android Ash; Tom Skerritt as the stalwart Captain Dallas; Yaphet Kotto as blustery Parker; Veronica Cartwright (originally supposed to play Ripley) as the whiny Lambert; John Hurt as the doomed Kane; and Harry Dean Stanton as common man Brett.  ALIEN certainly set a standard which hundreds of movies have tried to copy, but the first two in this series have been untouched.  A classic film.</p></br><a href="../users/A39VJRIW7HC5C0.html">A39VJRIW7HC5C0</a><br/><p>Although I must concede that I prefer the theatrical release to the Director's cut, this is still a very good movie that hasn't aged over time and remains as good as it ever was.<br /><br />Seven ordinary people, blue collar workers who happen to be in a spaceship, are travelling with their payload of mineral ore back to Earth. Dallas is the captain, Kane is second-in-command, Ripley is the warrant officer, Lambert is the navigator, Ash is the science officer, and Brett and Parker do the grunt work.  They are awakened 10 months early to investigate a distress signal on an uncharted planet.  However, only after Kane, Lambert, and Dallas go to the source of the signal does Ripley realize that it is in fact not an SOS at all, it's a warning.<br /><br />Kane returns with an alien life-form attached to his face, and soon a fully-grown, seven-foot tall Alien is stalking the crew-members and picking them off one at a time.<br /><br />Everything about this film is superlative: the subtle and moody score, the sets on the utilitarian Nostromo are effective and original, the direction is brilliant, the acting uniformly solid and the creature effects very good.  Equal accolades go to HR Giger for the creature effects and for Ridley Scott for keeping the creature hidden for most of the movie.<br /><br />See the original over the director's cut when possible, the new scenes are interesting to see once, but contradict elements of the alien life-cycle introduced in the sequal and make the fil less well-paced:<br /><br />Original Film: 9.5/10<br /><br />Director's Cut: 8.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>In 1977 we watched "Star Wars" and were impressed.  It appeared that science fiction had been significantly reinvigorated by new technology.  We watched "Jaws" a few years earlier, and it similarly reinvigorated the monster genre.  "Alien" brought the two genres back together.<br /><br />"Alien" commercials showing in 1979 and 1980 were bizarre; a black screen where portions of the title slowly revealed themselves.  The commercials promised something new and different and horrific.  The commercials were hardly sufficient.<br /><br />Space freighter Nostromo was carrying its cargo on a return trip home whenever the spaceship received a signal that caused the ship to wake its crew.  The crew journeys to a nearby planet to discover that the signal is from a derelict ship that may have crash landed centuries earlier.  As the crew explores the ship they encounter a room filled with strange pods.  One of the crew members, Kane (John Hurt), looks into the pod, only to have thing come flying out of the pod and attach itself to his face.  The crew on the ground packs Kane back into their shuttlecraft and return to the Nostromo.<br /><br />Once Kane is in the Nostromo's sick bay the crew removes his space suit and attempts to remove the thing attached to his face.  However, it is evident that the thing will kill Kane if the crew tries to remove it.  The crew awaits further developments.  A routine check of sick bay reveals the thing is off Kane's face, and Kane soon rouses, seemingly as good as ever, and hungry!  The crew also finds the thing, dead, and Ash (Ian Holm), the ship's android, examines the thing.  Kane begins to eat breakfast, only to discover some really, really extreme gastric distress.<br /><br />After a relatively small alien takes its leave of Kane in one of the most disturbing and memorable scenes in the history of film, the crew try to track down the alien.  However, they soon find that the little alien is now a huge monstrosity with an exoskeleton and acid for blood, and a seemingly endless appetite.  They also discover that the alien is extremely intelligent, apparently inheriting substantial knowledge.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie is an incredible cat and mouse game between the crew and the alien, with each and every encounter more chilling and frightening than the last, as the crew tries to deal with a creature outside anyone's experience.  The end of the movie remains a powerful testimony to Ridley Scott's directing abilities.  Those who saw the movie more than once in the theater or have the movie on DVD can easily see the alien well in advance of Ripley, allowing us to feel the fear of the impending encounter in advance of Ripley.<br /><br />This movie featured a cast of well-known actors and soon-to-be stars, most notably Tom Skerritt as Dallas and Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.  Ripley dominates this movie as the type-A leader who fights the alien every step of the way, all the way to the end.  Yaphet Kotto, Veronica Cartwright and Harry Dean Stanton round out the human crew.<br /><br />This movie set a new standard for monster movies and for science fiction.  The characters were believable and three dimensional.  The sets were superb; incredibly fantastic visions including the art of H.R. Giger.  The music contained substantial sub-woofer, making the listener feel intensely uncomfortable to enhance the more intense scenes.  The traditional haunted house or creepy village was replaced by a spaceship from which there was no escape.  Spicing up the plot is a subplot involving Ash and the company that owns the Nostromo.<br /><br />Take your blood pressure medicine before watching this one on your big screen with home theater sound.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>This is trully a total classic!!!! I've seen this movie more than 15 times in my life, and it's still relevant...For 79, the year where it's made, this got amazing special effects!! The space, the ship and even the alien are really very well done! what can i say...this is one of my favorite movies and it's the first of many many many movies with aliens!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Alien (1979)<br />Science Fiction, Horror, 117 minutes<br />Directed by Ridley Scott<br />Starring Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm and Tom Skerritt<br /><br />I first saw Alien during its original theatrical run in 1979 and appreciated it even more on the big screen. The first half of the movie is the best part. It's dark and atmospheric and there is an element of mystery. We are introduced to the crew of the mining ship and learn the relationships and personalities involved.<br /><br />The computer screens on the ship seem dated now, but the overall effect of the movie is just as powerful. The story gathers pace when some of the crew investigate the surface of a moon and find a ship from an unknown species. The way this sequence unfolds is almost worthy of Hitchcock.<br /><br />The purpose of the mission isn't immediately clear, but I won't reveal the details in case you haven't seen the movie. This is essentially a story of survival. While an actual encounter with an alien race might involve peaceful interaction, Alien never suggests for a moment that peace is possible. The creature is a killer and pursues the crew one at a time. Eventually, the battle focuses on Ripley (Weaver) and the alien. The second half of the movie doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first because most of the mystery is gone, but it's still a gripping story.<br /><br />Like many movies featuring unknown creatures, we rarely see shots of the whole creature. We are shown glimpses as it evolves and our imagination fills in the gaps. When we are eventually shown the whole thing, it adds to the effect and comes as quite a shock as we realize its strength and resilience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Alien  DVD<br /><br />When I first watched Alien in the 1970's, I thought it was the scariest, most plausible  horror movie that I had ever seen.  Not that I thought that particular creature would ever be real, but something that Mankind had never met up with might be out there.  Heck HIV Aids was barely heard from then.  It came from Africa.  Who knows what might be lurking in space.<br /><br />Anyhow Sigourney was "hot", the action fast and furious. A true delight to watch.  I'd invite people over to the house just to watch the movie and get their reaction.<br /><br />Alien is, quite simply, one of the best movies ever made in both the sci-fi and horror genres.<br /><br />The film hasn't aged a bit since it came out in the 1970's. The DVD is great too, with excellent picture quality and a really great commentary track<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Science Fiction, horror movies and horror classics.<br /><br />Gunner January, 2007</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In the older days (some would call golden days) of cinema, monster movies were huge with moviegoers both young and somewhat older, but especially with teenagers who were out on dates.  Where the guys were looking for a good scare to get their girls to snuggle up close for the duration of the film, so they could show how romantic and caring they were.  Generally speaking these monster movies featured creatures that were merely actors dressed in shoddy costumes because visual effects hadn't advanced enough as yet, though at the time they were the best around so everyone thought they looked good.  The movies weren't really all that scary or even all that good if you really stopped to think about it, but that wasn't what the target audience was really interested in after all.  In 1979, director Ridley Scott ("Gladiator" and "Hannibal") released his groundbreaking, science-fiction/monster film "Alien", forever changing the dynamic of monster movies and audiences expectations of them.<br /><br />"Alien" is the story of the doomed crew of the spaceship Nostromo, who were heading back to Earth when a distress signal caused them to detour to a nearby planet.  When the crew searches the location of the signal, they stumble upon a field of what appears to be eggs.  One of the eggs releases its contents, which latches on to one of the crew.  Believing they can simply remove the life-form from the crew member's face without trouble, the remaining crew of the Nostromo makes the mistake of bringing the contaminated crew member back on board ship.  Though all efforts to remove the object failed, after a short while the life-form simply detaches from the crew member leaving him alive and seemingly healthy.  Believing all is well, they set course once more for Earth; however, appearances can be deceiving and the consequences of their actions brings about a horrifyingly deadly reality, as the creature that had latched onto their friend's face was only the beginning, and what it left behind will leave them all running for their lives.<br /><br />So, what's the difference between "Alien" and all of those other monster movies of the past, you might ask.  One major difference would be in the quality of the practical effects and costumes used in this movie.  Yes, the creature was still just a man in a suit, but this was different from all the other times this method was used.  The practical effects and costumes had greatly advanced beyond those early monster movies, so that when you saw the creature on screen you thought you were really looking at a living alien monster intent on killing you.<br /><br />In addition to the costumes and effects employed in the film, the story for "Alien" was so well-written, and the suspense was so palpable that you couldn't stand to wait to see what would happen next.  The direction by Ridley Scott was excellent for this type of movie, as he chose to create an ominous atmosphere, relying heavily on shadows, to serve as the main source for ratcheting up the anxiety factor that great horror films feed off of, rather than going simply for the cheap thrill achieved via blood and guts and jump scenes.  So when the audience does see the alien it is only brief glimpses, leaving the viewer to wonder just what exactly the alien looks like, which increases the anxiousness and fun of the entire experience even further.  Another excellent choice on the part of the director was not showing too much of the death scenes, by having the pain inflicted by the monster be mostly conveyed through the various characters screams of torture and agony, causing the audiences minds to create situations and scenarios far worse than any director could come up with, a method made famous by Alfred Hitchcock.  Speaking of the actors, every single one of them turned in excellent, first-rate performances, which is a true rarity in horror or science fiction films, which aided the film in becoming one of the true classics in the monster genre, setting the standard by which all other monster films should be judged.  The cast member that truly shined was Sigourney Weaver, who became an instant star and one of Hollywood's most popular movie heroines, and her character is the only one to be featured in every single `Alien' movie throughout the franchise.<br /><br />The movie "Alien" is by far one of the best in the horror or science fiction genre (it actually belongs to both categories), and the fact that it is still so popular with moviegoers is a testament to how excellent the film is, even to this day.<br /><br />"Alien" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>'Alien' is what horror is all about.  It takes its sweet time gettting going, no doubt about it, but the cumulative effect is nothing short of astonishing.  Goldsmith's eerie, textured score, the creeping, endless exterior shots of the ship, the ugly, empty corridors within and the slow descent into the nightmarish alien ship.  All very effective and all before we're introduced to the Alien, which happens to be the finest film-monster of all-time.  The sense of reality of the whole operations is superior to just about any other sci-fi I've ever seen, and infinitely more realistic than the overblown, blindingly shiny and artificial CGI worlds of modern SF.  The Star Wars films may have brought SF into the mainstream and the A-movie class, but 'Alien' brought it down to earth.<br /><br />Performances are all first rate even if the characterization are a bit thin. (Well, Veronica Cartwright is pretty damned annoying, but she's believably annoying, anyway.)  Holm is especially good as secretive science officer Ashe.  'Alien' brings real world blue-collar workers into sci-fi and horror, and adds a greater weight and believability the the two genres by doing so.  On the downside, the film arguably lacks a strong protagonist, as Ripley is too cold to be excessively sympathetic, but the actual horrific elements are so good that the lack of audience identification with the characters doesn't much matter.<br /><br />A few minor concerns:  The alien is amazing... except for in his chest burster form.  Giger never had a final design for it, and you can tell.  As it is, the things kinda cute, and his scampering out of the  room is, shall we say, less than convincing.  Also, (SPOILERS) I've always been irritated by the shot of the Alien as he's about to grab Dallas, with his arms extended for too long.  Looks like he's leaping out at him at the beginning of a surprise party, not trying capture him and drag him away.  Finally, I don't like that Ripley goes back to get the cat.  I don't think it's sexist, as some sillier critics do, but it's a pretty damn inane complication, and frankly, I just don't buy it.  If she's gonna leave Cain to die out on the wind-swept planet surface just because he *might* be infected with something that *might* hurt them all, she sure ain't gonna face up to giant the monster that slaughtered the rest of the crew just to go get a cat.  She seems a lot more practical than that.  Still, that's it as far as flaws go.  It's pretty much perfect otherwise.<br /><br />As for the DVD, it looks amazing.  About as good as any film you'll ever see from the 70's.  Also, as you probably already know, the so called Director's Cut isn't really a director's cut.  Studio just wanted a new version to release, and so the original is both more correct to Scott's vision, and just better.  Still, it's worth watching once, just out of curiosity.<br /><br />Yeah, a brilliant movie, all in all.  Seen it probably 10-12 times over the years, and it still has a real effect.  It's got a certain shock effect that carries it the first time or two, but repeated viewings allow the sheer craftsmanship of the whole endeavour to display itself fully.  If you've ever enjoyed a horror movie, check out 'Alien'.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>Alien is a classic, but it is hard to pin down as what kind - sci-fi or horror or is it set apart from the rest of the movies, a original that set itself higher, above any of the other films, before or after.<br /><br />The Nostromo and her crew are gritty, realistic people, not just characters.  Even the ship is a character in its down right, from the dripping walls, the shaking chains and main computer.<br /><br />Tons of extras and a very interesting commentary from Ridley Scott, who directed it.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is sexy and strong all at the same time.  A must for any Sci-Fi library, right up there with Outland or Silent Running.</p></br></body></html>

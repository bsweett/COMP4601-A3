Mulligan's 1962 film and you will see why it (unlike many of today's contenders) is a true American masterpiece. <p>Based on Harper Lee's novel of the same name, this film narrates the realities of growing up in the south during the depression while watching her father defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. <p>The difficult subjects of racism and the legal system are addressed in a timeless response that does not fade despite comparatively more advanced filming techniques or altering legal realities. <p>As the Anglo protagonist Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck delivers one of the most excellent character performances of his film career. His task in the throes of segregation is a gloomy prospect (with judges and jurors predisposed to bias against your client from day one) but Finch trudges stoically on throughout the screenplay. <p>This imparts to his children the importance of standing up for what you believe in and being an open minded person that tries to treat everybody fairly. Certainly the family faces retribution from narrow-minded community members, but the children learn those attacks are a small price to pay for the greater good of a society without bias and injustice. It is better to place yourself on the line for your principles than to say/do nothing and let things continue as they had always occurred. <p>That in itself would be a powerful statement for a film produced during resurrection of the American civil rights movement, but it also tackles the biases surrounding people with disabilities in the character of Boo Radley.  <p>As the town "idiot", he is an enigma to the local children--who spend a considerable amount of time in the film fascinated by the rumors surrounding this man---until he becomes the one who saves Scout from vicious attack related to her father's case.  Like Jim, he represents the "Mockingbird"-entities who do not harm anything else and therefore should be treated with kindness. <p>Finally, Scout's proto-feminism in wondering why she would be treated differently than her younger brother foreshadows the resurrection of the feminist movement in America. Despite Atticus's comparatively progressive stance on race issues, he unwittingly bought into sexist assumptions about gender roles.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Harper Lee must have loved her Daddy and big brother.  Her warm fictional remembrance of them as Atticus and Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird is filled with respect and love.  She had a story to tell of race and hatred and tolerance and understanding, but underpinning all of it is her love of the two central males of her childhood, her kind and wise father, and her loving, protective brother.  This is the heart of her book, and it is the heart of this faithfully adapted film of that book.  <p>In an age that usually draws males and females in broad caricatures, depicting brutishness and carnality as the norm, and crassness and &quot;in-your-face&quot; as the only form of honesty, the characters in Mockingbird are not only refreshing, they are a revelation.<p>The book and the film is largely about decency.  Simple human decency.  The characters in this story of childhood adventures, awakenings and surprises, with the trial of an innocent black man in the South of the 30's at its center, are by and large decent people.<p>  From Scout's father, Atticus, sincerely defending the man, to the Judge wanting a fair trial and result, to the defendant Tom and his family, to Cal the housekeeper, to the lady next door, to the Reverend, to the simple and plain but honest Sheriff, and even the farmer momentarily caught up in the lynch mob mentality....all are essentially decent people struggling within their society's preconceived assumptions and intolerances to do what's right. And, of course, there is Boo.<p>Yes, the world has its share of ignorant, cowardly, and hate-filled Bob Ewells.  But, they do not define the world, so long as there are good men and women striving to do the right thing.<p>This flawlessly cast movie is a masterpiece.  It captures the innocense and wonder of childhood, and the sometimes tragedy &amp; struggle of adulthood without preaching. The performances are first rate down to the smallest role.  Robert Mulligan manages to capture the world from a child's perspective without belaboring it.<p>The world has spun around a few times since I saw this movie on it's release when I was little more than a child myself.  It captured and moved me then.  It moves me now.  It's simple truths and humanity are timeless.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Talk about the legacy of acting legend Gregory Peck.  This compelling actor played two of the most iconic characters in all of cinematic lore--<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AUKA">Captain Ahab</a> and Atticus Finch.  (And Peck played both roles in his own unique, creative style.)  With respect to Atticus Finch, Peck merely enhances an extraordinarily good film, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based on Harper Lee's phenomenal and timeless <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061120081">novel</a>.  I've read the book and seen the movie, many times; experiencing both are extremely rewarding.  In particular, the film works marvelously, for several reasons.<br /><br />For openers, Horton Foote penned a riveting screenplay, while director Robert Mulligan brings Lee's novel to vivid life.  The film is blessed with very believable child actors in Mary Badham (Scout) and Phillip Alford (Jem), who both made their silver screen debuts.  The supporting cast is spectacular, including a grisly, disheveled James Anderson playing villain Bob Ewell and a very young Robert Duvall playing reclusive Boo Radley.  Add to that Peck's commanding performance as a widowed lawyer and father of two children in the Jim Crow South during the Great Depression, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a movie for the ages.  Highly recommended for all movie collectors and cinema buffs.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch is one of those great film performances that one can never get enough of. A film that never get's old, because it tells of a time when America was at its crossroads. This film brings memories of continuous viewing whenever shown on TV. Brock Peters play's the black defendant, falsely accused of raping a white woman. The atmosphere gives a real feel of southern Americana at its worst. A time of dispare for blacks, as evidenced by the jury of his all white "peers." But along with the bad, were the extremely good individuals like Atticus and his family, that stood-up for justice and equality for all. Some of the best child actors ever seen on screen as well. And what has to be the best portrayal of a single father to date. One of the all-time best films on any list. See if you can spot Robert Duvall in his film debut.</p></br><a href="../users/AMMEMPM9MPS55.html">AMMEMPM9MPS55</a><br/><p>Robert Mulligan hardly directed any films of note, which is what makes To Kill a Mockingbird such a pleasant surprise. It is a stunning film, a fable of fear and prejudice told with striking visual flair. The haunting shadows and eerie hues of Russell Harlan's camerawork evoke the myths and nocturnal fears of childhood, and Elmer Bernstein's quintessentially American score supplements the imagery well, creating a film laden with atmosphere.<p>Harper Lee's story follows a lawyer (Atticus Finch) who puts himself on the line to defend a black man accused of rape in the 1930s deep south, told through the eyes of his two children, who are on a journey of their own to overcome some lesser prejudices of their own. The young Mary Badham and Philip Alford give excellent performances.<p>The subject matter is bold for the time, and there is little evidence of the kind of bowdlerization that plagued many other films of the same, and an earlier, era. The heart of the film is very simple: It wants very earnestly to show us that prejudice and bigotry are nothing but those childhood fears, borne of ignorance, and resolved by those brave enough to step beyond the barriers, confronting their fears, and, in so doing, finding that differences are nothing to be scared of.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>I bought this movie on recommendation, never having seen it.  I watched it twice in one sitting.  It's that good.<p>This may be one of the finest films ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>I show this movie in its entirety to my business classes. I wheel it out when we deal with 'leadership' and the need to be willing to stand up for certain principles. We all won't be given the chance Attorney Atticus Finch is given to defend Tom Robinson 70 years after slavery ended in segregationist Alabama, but Gregory Peck in the defining role of his career points us in the right direction.<br /><br />That it is a 45 year old film doesn't really matter. The ideas are timeless. Atticus says to his son upon being asked why he took the Tom Robinson case, 'because I couldn't hold my head up if I said no.'<br /><br />Timeless stuff. Great family film. Pretty good for teenagers too if you can tie them down. 5 stars.

You MUST!"). Bought this Legacy edition (was then the "latest/greatest" release of film), and oh yes, total agreement with her opinion. Strangely enough, she never acquired a copy herself, so when she recently retired, I gave her my copy (tri-fold, with lobby cards: a LOVELY set). Went shopping for replacement, saw glowing reviews for new blu, but (for my 1st time ever), opted to just replace the original Legacy copy, ONLY due to it's cover/overall packaging. BEFORE you start bashing, read DVD reviews going back to '98 release: they are uniformly excellent for quality (and extras). I do not care for Universal's new packaging art, but I suppose they really could not improve on the Legacy (nor could they reproduce it for a new release). If quality of packaging is no big deal, consider the new release; if having an exquisite TRULY "Collector's Ed." (what an overused term in dvd market) in your library is paramount -or to give as gift- I would recommend the Legacy. (please note, the 2nd used copy I just bought has only a bi-fold case, and no lobby cards. Still pleased with, and my friend DID get those added items!). Bottom line: an absolute film treasure, get whatever copy you can get your hands on!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>"To Kill A Mockingbird" premiered in U.S. theaters on Christmas Day 1962. Those who were lucky enough to see this movie on the big screen that December 25th came out of the theater with another Yuletide gift of sorts -- they had just watched one of the finest motion pictures ever produced (IMHO).<br /><br />There probably aren't enough glowing adjectives in the dictionary to describe the loveliness of this film. A truly fabulous piece of American cinema -- all the way through -- with a tender and bittersweet ending that always leaves one of those "trying to hold it back" lumps in the ol' throat.<br /><br />The cast is ideal, with each actor seemingly molded for each of their individual roles. There's "Scout" (Mary Badham), "Jem" (Phillip Alford), "Dill" (John Megna), "Boo Radley" (Robert Duvall), and "Tom Robinson" (Brock Peters).<br /><br />And "Atticus Finch" (Gregory Peck), one of the truly most memorable characters ever brought to the screen. And it's hard to think of how Mr. Peck's Academy Award-winning portrayal of that southern lawyer and father could have possibly been any better than we see it here. Peck always seems to have that "controlled" quality in his movie performances that are always a pleasure to watch. And never more so than as the low-key "Atticus" in this film. I doubt that it's possible to watch this movie and NOT admire the strength of character and unwillingness to stoop to such levels of vulgarity after Atticus is spat upon by "Bob Ewell". It's one of several scenes in the film that illustrates the type of man Atticus is, and the type of example he's setting for his young children. Some might be apt to call Atticus a coward in that scene. But they'd be wrong.<br /><br />This film offers up many highly-memorable moments indeed --- Atticus sitting in front of the jail reading by the light of his living-room stand lamp. .... The mystery of Jem's ripped pants. .... Boo Radley's spooky house. .... Atticus impressing his children when he shoots the rabid dog. .... That old hollowed-out tree that keeps filling itself up with all kinds of cool stuff. .... "Stand up, your father's passing". .... Plus, that beautiful and stirring Elmer Bernstein music score. Utter magic.<br /><br />There's also a good deal of humor residing in this screenplay. I always get a good healthy laugh when viewing the scene which has Dill drenching his dinner in syrup, to the shock and dismay of Scout ("Look, Atticus! He's gone and drown-ded his dinner in syrup and now he's pourin' it all over!"). A true LOL moment that's always good for at least two replays. :-)<br /><br />And possibly the most memorable quote comes at the end of the film, when Atticus says to Scout: "Miss Jean Louise -- Mister Arthur Radley". With these few words, Scout's fears of "Boo" vanish forever. The dignity with which Atticus "introduces" Arthur ("Boo") to Scout is what makes this quote memorable for me.<br /><br />Universal Studios Home Video, on September 6, 2005, issued a beautiful-looking new Two-Disc DVD version of "To Kill A Mockingbird", which comes with a bountiful helping of bonus supplements, as well as the very first "enhanced" (Anamorphic) Widescreen transfer of the film on DVD.<br /><br />Packaged under its "Legacy Series" banner, this 2-Disc Set sparkles in virtually all respects, especially the video quality of this iconic black-and-white film. It looks very nearly perfect to my eyes. Very few distracting artifacts can be observed during the running of this 130-minute main feature (which is presented in its intended 1.85:1 Widescreen framing here). And the nighttime scenes are rendered in fine fashion, with next to no video annoyances visible at all. The film passes the "Freeze Frame" test as well -- i.e.: you can "pause"/"still" an image on screen in virtual perfect clarity, without the image blurring at all, which I usually take as a pretty good sign that what I'm seeing is a darn-good transfer of the material to DVD.<br /><br />There's a choice of five separate audio options for the feature film on Disc 1 -- with one of the five being a Commentary Track with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula, which was recorded for the first DVD edition of "TKAM" in 1998. Tragically, Pakula was killed in a freak auto accident in November of 1998, not too long after he recorded the commentary track for the DVD. He was 70 years old.<br /><br />Other audio options for this two-disc edition include the original English Mono (in 2.0 Dolby Digital), a French 2.0 DD Mono track, and two newly-created multi-channel 5.1 Surround audio tracks (a Dolby Digital 5.1 plus a DTS 5.1). The DTS track isn't listed in the specs on the packaging, however. But it IS on here.<br /><br />Audio tracks cannot be changed "on the fly" (as the saying goes) while watching the movie (unfortunately). You must go to the "Languages" Sub-Menu to switch the audio. To switch to the Commentary Track, you must access the "Bonus Features" Menu on Disc 1. There's no "Commentary" option available from the "Languages" Menu (for some reason).<br /><br />Subtitle options: English, French, and Spanish. .... These subtitle choices are also ALL available when viewing any of the Bonus Features throughout this two-disc DVD set (including even the movie's trailer).<br /><br />A bonus item that was originally scheduled to be a part of this set, but was ultimately not included, is a replica of Gregory Peck's "working script" (with handwritten notes by Peck). That bonus was evidently replaced by the 11 "Theatrical Poster Reproductions" that are included here. These poster art copies are very nice, being re-printed on high-quality paperboard stock, which have a glossy look to them. Included are a few USA poster copies, plus several from foreign nations, like Argentina, Japan, Italy, Poland, among others. The artwork's country of origin is printed on the back of each of these reproduction prints. A well-done extra bonus, IMO. (Although I would have loved to have had Mr. Peck's working TKAM script too. But, oh well.)<br /><br />Also in the envelope with the 11 poster re-prints is a signed message from "To Kill A Mockingbird" author Harper Lee.<br /><br />Let's have a look at the DVD Bonus Features.............<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />> Gregory Peck's acceptance speech after he won the Oscar trophy as "Best Actor 1962" (the only Oscar statue he was ever to take home, amazingly enough). This vintage 1963 B&W video clip runs for 1:28.<br /><br />> Excerpt from the "Academy Tribute To Gregory Peck", with Gregory's daughter Cecilia. This is a 10-minute bonus item.<br /><br />> "American Film Institute Life Achievement Award" presented to Gregory Peck. Run Time: 10 minutes.<br /><br />> "Scout Remembers", which is a 1999 NBC-TV interview with "Scout" herself (Mary Badham). This bonus runs 12 minutes. .... Mary Badham, for those who may not know it, is the sister of John Badham, who directed such motion pictures as "WarGames" (in 1983) and the enormously-popular and successful John Travolta film "Saturday Night Fever" (in 1977).<br /><br />> The Original Theatrical Trailer for "To Kill A Mockingbird" (Length: 2:53). The trailer is in Full Frame (1.33:1) format. Excellent sound quality too. Video quality is lacking a bit, but it's not too bad.<br /><br />> Production Notes. (Text screens only.)<br /><br />The only thing missing here are the "Cast And Filmmaker" bio text pieces that were included on the '98 disc. Too bad, too, because those biography notes were quite good (and extensive), and covered several of the various TKAM players and execs.<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />There are two first-rate documentaries on the second disc of this set. These two extra DVD programs amount to 3 hours and 7 minutes of added "Mockingbird" entertainment, pretty much the equivalent of two entire additional movies.<br /><br />The Disc-Two programs are:<br /><br />> "Fearful Symmetry: The Making Of 'To Kill A Mockingbird'" (90 minutes; B&W; Non-Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 24 Chapter Stops). .... This is the same feature-length, behind-the-scenes documentary that was also included on the earlier DVD release of "To Kill A Mockingbird". Wonderful stuff here. Lots of interesting details about how this classic film got to the screen. Includes many on-camera comments by Gregory Peck. Produced in 1998.<br /><br />-- And: --<br /><br />> "A Conversation With Gregory Peck" (97 minutes; Color & B&W; Full Frame 1.33:1 Video; 2.0 DD Stereo Audio; 18 Chapter Stops). .... This sensational movie-length documentary was produced by Gregory Peck's daughter (Cecilia) in 1999. It is a very nicely-constructed presentation, with a good music score too, which delves in great depth into the personal side of the great Gregory Peck, who proves here that he was still more than capable of holding an audience's undivided attention at age 83.<br /><br />This documentary could very easily have been called "Gregory Peck's Life: In His Own Words". It's quite literally a biography on the personal life and movie career of Mr. Peck. It's certainly one of the best "bio" pieces I've ever seen on the life of any actor.<br /><br />This "docu-bio" contains video clips of many of Peck's films, plus old home movies, several talk-show clips featuring Gregory, and lots of other interesting stuff that help to give even more insight into the life of this amazing American actor (who was born in California on April 5, 1916).<br /><br />Gregory Peck takes center stage during portions of the program (literally), as he talks and jokes with large audiences around the United States, and conducts various Q&A sessions.<br /><br />There's lots of candid footage of Peck (and family) here too, including some impressive shots taken at Niagara Falls. And in Paris, too. And Ireland. And in Washington, D.C., as Gregory gets an award from then-President Bill Clinton.<br /><br />Near the end of this thoroughly-engaging bio/"Conversation", we see proud granddaddy Gregory holding his just-born grandson (who was named "Harper", after TKAM author Harper Lee). The scenes of Little Harper will make you want to reach into your TV and scoop up this adorable munchkin. He's one of the cutest little tykes I've ever laid eyes on. It's no wonder Gregory looks so proud here. These tender scenes with Gregory and his new grandson add the perfect sweet and sentimental finishing touches to the whole documentary.<br /><br />This "Conversation" bonus is a genuinely unique program. It was produced with an obvious large dose of love and affection by Mr. Peck's daughter (and all others who were involved in putting it together). After viewing it, you can't help but feel like you know (and admire) a man named Eldred Gregory Peck quite a bit better than you did just ninety-seven minutes earlier. And that might be the best compliment I can pay this very special and heart-warming documentary.<br /><br />Mr. Peck passed away in June of 2003, four years after he filmed this program. He was 87. He will be missed forever by multiple generations of movie fans who loved his work in the cinema for many decades. His talent is one that we'll likely not run across again, until we reach heaven. But thank goodness for fabulous documentaries like this one, plus all of his cherished films as well, which enable fans to retouch the magic and greatness that will forever be associated with Mr. Gregory Peck.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />The packaging for this "Legacy Series" edition has a very solid and collectible feel to it. It's a three-panel folding "Digipak" type of a case, which sports an attractive "leathery" texture on the outside of the case. Unfortunately, there's no outer slipcase box (sleeve) included here, which will probably displease some collectors who wish to display this set "face out". That'll pose a small problem, because the case always wants to "spring" back open (due to the lack of a restraining outer slipcase). An outer box would certainly have been useful, but even without one, this package stands out as a "classy" DVD item on the shelf.<br /><br />Additional Packaging Note -- This "Mockingbird" set is not packaged the same as "The Sting" (another Universal 2-Disc Legacy set). "The Sting", which is also worthy of a purchase IMO, comes in a two-panel "book-like" pack, which "snaps" firmly closed on the outside -- just like the "Lawrence Of Arabia" 2-Disc Limited-Edition DVD release, which came out in April 2001.<br /><br />For continuity sake, I would have preferred the "Sting" type of closeable Digipak for the TKAM release. The two sets would look better side-by-side if they'd been packed the same. But, no big deal really.<br /><br />Both the "TKAM" and "Sting" Legacy versions lack any Chapter List inserts or paper enclosures (which is a bit of a debit). However, if you own the previously-released single-disc DVD "Collector's Edition" of "Mockingbird", I'd recommend hanging on to the excellent multi-page fold-out insert that came with that disc. It can be used with this new DVD set as well. It has a complete Chapter Selection listing for both the movie and the "Fearful Symmetry" documentary, and the chapter breaks are in the exact same spots on this newer Legacy version, with the same chapter titles used as well (39 total Scenes/Chapters for the Main Feature). There are also some interesting Production Notes and photographs printed on that 1998 TKAM insert.<br /><br />Also -- Make sure to disregard the "Color" notation marked on the loose piece of paper on the back of the DVD case that lists this "Legacy" set's contents. The film is in B&W, not color. That's obviously just a misprint.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />A Final Glowing Blurb.......<br /><br />"To Kill A Mockingbird" is a masterpiece of personally-felt moods and memories. Who among us doesn't have at least one childhood memory that can be rekindled through the actions of Scout, Jem, or Dill? This is a motion picture you can watch again and again -- and each time take away something different when that incomparable final act fades to black (usually something that requires yet another hard swallow with which to combat that ever-present lump in the throat that this movie masterfully induces each and every time it's watched).<br /><br />Any DVD collection of great American motion pictures is unquestionably incomplete if "To Kill A Mockingbird" does not occupy a prominent position on the shelf reserved for such magnificent movie treasures.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan and Horton Foote have made an absolutely terrific movie of one of the greatest books in contemporary fiction.  The three years covered in the book are compressed into one year in the movie,  and almost everything of importance is kept in the film version.<br /><br />Shooting the movie in black and white was inspired.  It symbolizes the stark reality of black vs. white that is at the core of the novel. The acting is extraordinary across the board.  Of Gregory Peck, so much has been said that further praise is redundant; suffice to say that after Peck's performance, no one else will ever be able to play Atticus Finch.  The children are wonderful, so real that they hardly seem to be acting at all.  Mary Badham is absolutely perfect as Scout.  Phillip Alford is excellent as Jem, and John Megna is fine as Dill.  The lesser actors live up to the lead roles.  I especially liked Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell; James Anderson brings out all the ugliness and cowardice in Bob Ewell, and Alice Ghostley is a funny and wacky Stephanie Crawford.<br /><br />The three characters who didn't live up to their counterparts in the book were Miss Maudie, Calpurnia, and Tom Robinson.  Ms. Maudie is a very intriguing character in the novel, a ditzy, wise, funny woman of bedrock integrity; in the movie, she comes across as just another next door neighbor.  Calpurnia's part was far too small in the movie; in the book she plays a major role in the family, almost like a surrogate parent.  Estelle Evans is a fine actress and deserved a bigger role to give her talent more scope.  And Tom Robinson is almost too saintly to be believed in the film version, over-acted by Brock Peters.  But Robert Duvall in a non-speaking movie debut is just right as Boo Radley, and Scout's recognition of her formerly scary neighbor, with her tentative smile followed by 'Hey Boo', is one of the most affecting moments in the picture.<br /><br />I still remember when Peck won the Oscar for best actor; in his acceptance speech, his first words were 'Thank you, Harper  Lee.'  The movie 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a labor of love of bringing a timeless classic to the screen, and Harper Lee must have been very gratified at the results.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>It started with the gift of Harper Lee's magical book, a gift to literature., indeed. Then came the movie, a gift to cinema that withstands the test of time. <p>Just look at the opening credits, quite possibly one of the most ingenious and modern looking segments in cinema over the last forty years. It's simplicity absolutely captures the film, while setting the magical mystery on its course, the world of children in a box.<p>Then move on to Gregory Peck's most moving, strong, amazing performance; it's quite possibly the perfect match with role, actor, screenplay. His dignity shines through a dignified role.<p>And then there are the kids, two unknowns, who do their best acting by just being themselves. Mary Badham is absolutely charming and stunning in her innocent portrayal of a terribly difficult role.<p>But what shines most is the story... the story of a black man unjustly accused of a hideous act, the story of a spooky man who lives a life of hiding, ultimately, how we judge others is how we are judged. <p>And that is the lasting gift of this movie, and this DVD.<p>Note: the bonus documentary on the DVD is amazing, long, and very informative, worth all of your time.</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>It's easy to think &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is older than it is. Released in 1962, the same year James Bond was immortalised in &quot;Dr. No,&quot; director Robert Mulligan chose to film in black &amp; white, despite Hollywood's rush to adopt the new Kodachrome II color film. Since the story is set in the 1930's, the classic look of the film adds weight to its historic reality.<p>Adapted from Harper Lee's only book, which won a Pulitzer prize, the script itself won an academy award. Added to this is a stellar cast who manage to hold their own against the amazing performance given by, Gregory Peck, an actor at the peak of his abilities. For those who also enjoy Robert Duvall's huge body of work, it may be interesting to note this film as his first, in a non-speaking but pivotal role as Boo Radley.<p>It would be easy to dismiss an old film that deals with the race issue in Alabama. Some might think this topic has been done to death and, to an extent, they are right. But To Kill a Mockingbird is not solely about racism. It deals with honesty, justice, fear, childhood, quick judgements and parenthood. Even the race card is dealt with fairly, without blowing things out to sensational proportions. It shows that minor, selfish decisions, which rely on the racism in others, can breed larger evils.<p>An adult Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch narrates much of the story but it is her father, Atticus, around which the narrative hinges. Played with subtle dignity by Peck, Atticus is a small town Lawyer who agrees to defend Tom Robinson against charges of Rape. He agrees, in the full knowledge that many of his neighbours will hate him for defending a black man and still others will expect him to put up only a token effort. Instead, Atticus does what we know he will... his best.<p>There is an interesting contrast between what we see of Atticus and how his two children describe him. Apparently he's too old to do anything, like play ball, and they are a bit embarrassed by his quite ways. The trial and its associated moral battles put their father squarely in the spotlight and not in a good way. He and they are attacked and ridiculed but in the end Scout and Jem see a different picture of their old Pop. A man who is strong enough to stand against hatred, and brave enough to highlight the weaknesses of flawed white girl against the strengths of an honest black man.<p>The name of the film is taken from one of Attcus's rules relating to using a rifle. Jem relates his father's instruction &quot;to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird...Well, I reckon because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncribs, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us.&quot;<p>There are several Mockingbirds in this movie; the misunderstood Boo Radley, Tom Robins and even Atticus. For me though, the film is defined when Reverend Sykes asks Scout to stand up in the court gallery, after a failed defence, saying &quot;Miss Jean Louise, stand up.

Good and evil are clearly drawn, and the values of justice and humanity portrayed with rare and memorable strength.<br />Reading Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel had a huge impact on me as a teenager...I never forgot, as Atticus says to Scout, that you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.<p>Horton Foote won an Oscar for his screenplay, which is so faithful to the book. Set in depression era Alabama, it's seen through the eyes of 8 year old Scout, beautifully played by Mary Badham, and the sensitivity of director Mulligan's vision is remarkable.<p>Prejudice is the theme that runs through the story, from the harrowing court case of Tom (an amazing performance by Brock Peters), falsely accused of rape, to the demonization of Boo  (played by Robert Duvall, in his screen debut...he's intensely moving as this innocent and silent man).<br />Russell Harlan's superb cinematography should be seen in the widescreen version to be fully appreciated, and Elmer Bernstein's Americana style score adds so much to the film.<p>Gregory Peck's Oscar winning performance is magnificent. His Atticus is a hero of immense proportions, with compassion, integrity, and humility...and it's one of the many reasons I think this powerful classic deserves to be in every video library.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>What can you say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  Gregory Peck offers what may be his definitive role (he won the Best-Actor Oscar for it after four fruitless nominations) and, perhaps, the most famous dad in film; as various critics have said, not even Peck himself was as good a father as Atticus Finch, but Atticus is probably what every dad wants to be.  Though slow in pace, the movie is never boring, and the picture it presents of the Deep South (Maycomb Co., Ala.) in the days before Martin Luther King is both fascinating and disturbing.  If, like me, you find yourself puzzled over why the Ewells faked a rape and accused Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) of the crime, your best bet is to read the book To Kill a Mockingbird, which also provides a lot of background about the Finches and their neighbors.  Robert Duvall, today one of our most respected actors, makes his first credited big-screen appearance (with never a word of dialogue) as "Boo" Radley, the mysterious and believed-insane neighbor of the Finches.  This is a movie every child should see and every adult should know.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent novel, and this is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent adaptation. Almost everything about this film is flawless. From the script and the acting, to the cinematography to the music, it deserves its status as a classic monumental film. There's no doubt that Gregory Peck reveals his timeless acting abilities as Atticus Finch. It's a stunning performance, and this performance alone will never become extinct in the legacies of motion pictures. Like the book, this film teaches a very important lesson on racism old and new. Some changes had been made, but I hope readers won't mind, since this IS a film adaptation.<br /><br />To Kill A Mockingbird stands on its own as a classic film. Mixed with dark humor and very fierce drama, this is a film that will never be lost in the shadows.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Gregory Peck never stood taller than in this quiet, powerful, supremely beautiful film based on Harper Lee's magnificent classic about racism, and integrity in the face of injustice. Mulligan's direction is flawless, and lovingly illuminates the Finch family, and the southern town they live in. Horton Foote's screenplay, and Elmer Berstein's expressive score capture the essence of the book marvelously. No serious film collector should be without TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.<br /><br />The interviews with the cast, and crew are also quite enlightening. It's fun to see the actors that played Scout, and Jem, grown up, and looking back on their roles.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>2008 marks 45 years when this movie came to theatres everywhere. 45 years later the movie still stands the test of time for its acting, its story and proving once and for all there are lots of great movies and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of them! Gregory Peck delivered a first class role as Atticus Finch. The DVD also has some wonderful extras including Mary Badham with her relationship with Gregory Peck during the filming. This movie is definitely a classic for everyone to watch!!</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The racism `s argument monopolized the whole attention, specially in the Sixties. To be fair, we should take a glimpse around several essential films in the recent past which depicted with notable crudeness this sensible theme; among the most important we should name Defiant ones and The edge of city in the Fifties.<br /><br />But undoubtedly, the four most important thematic cycles  had reached its task in the movie industry: The Noir Film, The Science Fiction, The War memories and the lightweight comedies (Wilder, Hawks); an important and relatively recent current had born in the world: The French New Wave and the strong transcendence of the Italian Neo Realism permeated the vision of most of screen writers obligating them to make a true inward gaze in the deepest regions of the American social body. If there would be another weight reason to confirm this statement, examine carefully the work of Alfred Hitchcock from "To catch a thief" until "Marnie". You may realize how every one of the included pictures included these two concern about a dislocated state of mind, and the suspense is generated in the hidden caverns of the unconscious.<br /><br />In this sense this film had to shock the conscience of many viewers at that moment, when a small town layer assumes the hazardous task to defend a black man accused of rape. The allusive metaphors to nocturnal and spectral visions are eloquent testimonies of the tenseness at the verge of the boiling point.<br /><br />The bitter taste you experience even several elapsed weeks and months don 't leave any shadow of doubt about the grandness of this bold film that inspired future films in that decade, such as Patch of Blue, To Sir with love, Guess who is coming to dinner, In the heat of the night (it' s not a mere casualty all of them starred by Poitier) and nourished the inspired of another independent filmmakers such as Samuel Fuller with two somber and terrible films (Shock corridor and The naked kiss). Of course, there would be a striking picture as "The chase", but this speech would be out of context.<br /><br />Go for this little gem that portraits the thundering reality of the early Sixties.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This movie shows the truth of life and the unfair things that can happen. Gregory Peck plays the #1 hero of all time, Atticus Finch, who is on a mission to do what is right whatever the costs may be. He faces many hindrances along the way, but takes them like a man and refuses to give up. By defending a black man, Tom Robinson, wrongly accused of rape, he does what no other attorney in Maycomb has the courage to do. Atticus' acts also have a deep effect on his children, Jem and Scout who remember his incrdible bravery forever. I love how this film shows that people don't have to succeed to be heroes. Good things can come from the effort, too.You are crazy if you do not at least like this film. It is an American classic that cannot be forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The word "classic" is liberally applied to just about any film that made any list or won any award over the past 100 years of cinema. It's a word that has been cheapened by its overuse in marketing. "To Kill a Mockingbird" defines the word classic. It's not because of the top notch production although that's part of it. This film belongs to an era when craftsmanship was an important part of storytelling. In our world of rapid fire cutting where bodies pile up faster than the credits pass by, we've lost touch with the sensibility that informs this classic film. Robert Mulligan's sensitive direction, Gregory Peck's iconographic performance and a literate, intelligent script by Horton Foote ("Lonesome Dove") that doesn't pander to the audience makes "To Kill a Mockingbird" one of those rare films that deserve the term classic and also deserves to be  on every best list for films made during the 20th century.<br /><br />Based on Harper Lee's popular novel, "Mockingbird" tells the story of widower Atticas Finch (Peck) a small town  southern attorney who tackles the difficult defense of African American Tom Robinson (the late Brock peters) accused of raping the Caucasian daughter of a racist father (James Anderson). The film doesn't just focus on the rape trial though as it also chronicles the little things in Atticas' life that go right and wrong; his daughter Scout (Mary Badham) faces criticism at school for defending an African American and also her shift from tomboy to young lady. She and her brother Jem (Philip Alford) tell tales of the local bogeyman Boo (Robert Duvall)who lives down the lane and sharing their views on the adult world that passes them by. The film is informed with the southern atmosphere but ironically was shot entirely on Universal's backlot in Southern California. It would have been very easy to portray Atticas as a paragon of virtue. He's well meaning but just as flawed as everybody else in the town and that includes missing cues during the trial that could prove Tom's innocence early on. The fact that everyone-from the children to the adults-all treated with respect as to their view of the world makes "Mockingbird" an enduring classic that aged incredibly well. Like the best wines the rich themes in this film continue to resonate and intoxicate an audience nearly fifty years after the film was made. That's a testament to great filmmaking. While director Mulligan and producer Pakula would make a number of other notable and powerful films, this is the first pillar in their long careers and because of its strength the rest of their best films could be made.<br /><br />Universal has taken a lot hard knocks lately about the quality of their DVD releases and lack of extras. They should also be recognized for the exceptional job they've done with this re-release. The black and white images are truly startling with rich fine detail, an exceptional gray scale and sharp image quality. The soundtrack is equally good with a top notch 5.1 new transfer as well as the original 2.0 mono soundtrack..<br /><br />The features on disc one include Peck's acceptance speech for his Academy Award for the role of Finch, Peck's remarks at the American Film Institute Award ceremony honoring him. There's also an excerpt from the Academy tribute to Peck with Cecilia Peck remarking on the passing of her father. Finally there's "Scott Remembers" an interview with Mary Badham about working with Peck as a child actor.<br /><br />The second disc features the bulk of the extras with two marvelous documentaries one of them brand new to this edition. "A Conversation with Gregory Peck" directed by Barbara Kopple and produced by Peck's daughter isn't the usual intimate one-on-one chats were used to seeing. Instead, Kopple films an appearance by Peck in Boston to discuss his work as an opportunity to look at his life and career. Peck comes across with his usual sense of sincerity and is engaging. The documentary "Fearful Symmetry" about the making of the film was available on the previous DVD. Director Charles Kiselyak interviews everyone from director Mulligan to the now adult child actors that appeared in the film discussing not only Lee's world but how it was reflective of the world they grew up and lived in when the film was made. Interweaving that footage with location interviews with the people of the town that Lee wrote about in the book (where she herself grew up) , it's a fascinating glimpse into the fantasy vs. reality of Lee's world and how they intersect. We also get reproductions of the original posters for the film as part of the package from its exhibition around the world. Universal has done a truly spectacular job with this re-release to commemorate this classic film.<br /><br />Luckily Mulligan and Pakula (both now deceased) did a commentary for an earlier edition of the film. That commentary appears yet again on this edition. While there's long passages of silence, that's OK; neither man blabbers on instead making very focused precise comments about the making of the film and their intent.<br /><br />A truly outstanding release from Universal, I'd highly recommend "To Kill a Mockingbird" for purchase. If you have the earlier edition, this edition does offer the advantage of a new documentary, the lobby cards as well as a brilliant transfer of the classic film while retaining most of the extras from the previous edition. It's well worth visting with Atticas Finch and his family again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>To Kill a Mockingbird is certainly destined to be a classic of both American literature and American film-making, if it is not already. I would like to first discuss the novel from which the film was adapted. Then I will discuss the award winning film which can be obtained on DVD. Finally I will discuss the continued question about this work, which is whether it is a book for children or adults.<br /><br />Harper Lee's novel continues to stimulate debate. Whereas the debate was about morality and racial relationships when the novel was written, the debate of late is centered on whether Harper Lee wrote a book for adults written through the eyes of a child or whether her intention was to write a book for children/young adults. I know I read the book when I was in the eighth grade and found it to be wonderful.But maybe it was fantastic because I was 14 years old and the moral clarity and wise heroism of Atticus Finch seems very right to my adolescent sense of justice. The re-claiming of Bo Radley back into the world of the living also gives a message about rejection, acceptance, reclaiming the lost, and affection. The novel is full of wonderful experience and moral commentary as presented through the eyes of a 7 year old tom-boy, a technique Mark Twain used in many of his novels. Twain recommended this style in fact pointing out that the hypocracy and odd motives of adults can be commented upon through nieve eyes with a sense of wonder and delightful humor.<br /><br />The film, which captures poor rural Alabama perfectly, also was fantastic. Gegory Peck was outstanding, as were all the actors. The screen play is penetrating and tight, never letting the characters become cute country hicks. The black and white format with austere depression era sets compliments the actions, turning a residential street in a poor Alabama town into a microcosm of the world of good, bad, and misunderstood forces.<br /><br />But is it for children or adults?  Flannery O'Connor, the great writer, said that it amazed her that most adult readers didn't realize it was a children's book. This debate is re-introduced in the recent film "Capote" where a New York literary character asks Nelle Harper Lee at a cocktail party about the 'children's book' she had written and published. After a recent reviewing of the book and film, I find that the work actually has vast appeal to children, young adults, and adults. I don't mean this to be avoidance of answering the question, but the work has multiple levels of depth and moral instruction relevant to any age. The criticism that it is a children's book is usually based on the lack of moral ambiguity in the strong forceful wise character of Atticus Finch. However, he is surrounded by adults with quivering morality, including the county sherrif and a town full of persuadable white establishment. It may in fact be very realistic to portray a character with clear moral bearings such as Atticus Finch, since such persons do in fact live in reality and I have been lucky enough in my life to know many such fine persons and I personally aspire to such moral character and strength. I don't think this makes me childlike for I recognize character is long in developing,often tested, and always remains an unfinished work of art within us.  This is the appeal of the adult reader/viewer for this classic work of American literature and film-making for in the end it calls upon all of us, child or adult, to aspire to our own strength of character and courage for the sake of justice.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>This film has such an evocative title sequence we're amazed to learn that Saul Bass didn't do it. It almost threatens to overpower the film, as the Bass titles for "A Walk on the Wild Side" primed us for something that film did not deliver. "Mockingbird" begins delivering in narrative, performance and craftsmanship soon enough, and it does so in beautiful black-and-white cinematography stunningly restored in this DVD transfer.<br /><br />It also delivers a small emotional wallop following the black man's rape trial, when his white attorney (Gregory Peck) leaves a courtroom in defeat and empty save for the blacks packed into the upper gallery. As they rise to their feet, one says to the little girl beside him, "Stand up, child, your father's leaving the coutroom." Their tribute to the white man who defended a black one in a losing cause is unexpectedly moving. That could be said for the film itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M3FG82ZE1J8I.html">A3M3FG82ZE1J8I</a><br/><p>I think most people reading the reviews for To Kill a Mockingbird have already seen this classic film and/or read the novel.  Suffice it to say, there is little need to indulge in any lengthy film synopsis other than to  say that this film represents one of but a handful of times when a film  truly captures the essence and warmth of the novel on which it is based.  Though I only saw this film once as a child, its memory stuck in my mind  for a long time, and when I heard that the film had been released on DVD, I  quickly purchased a copy.  My memories did not betray me, for this is just  as enchanting and moving a film as I remembered it to be.  Furthermore, the  DVD transfer is excellent.  The picture quality is sparkling and the sound  is crystal clear.  Plus, there is a good commentary track and very in-depth  cast and bio notes.  However, the best extra is the documentary  &quot;Fearful Symmetry.&quot;  Unlike most documentary nowadays, which tend  to focus on self-propaganda and promotion and special effects, this long  (practically feature-length!) documentary uses the film as a starting point  from which to discuss the background era in which the film is set; it  focuses on real people and real locales which find their parallel in the  movie.  In sort, this is quite a remarkable documentary and is, in my  opinion, the best one I've seen on any DVD by a long shot.<p>So, you  already know how great this film is and how great Gregory Peck is in it.  This DVD does the film justice, and I applaud Universal for producing such  a high-quality DVD.  A 5 star effort all the way!</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>NOTE: This review is based on the 2012 Blu-ray Collectors' Edition Combo. Amazon has an odd policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions of a movie that is released on home video. So, to make the most use of the hundreds of reviews listed for TKAM, click on the "show all reviews" link and then sort by "Newest First". Then look at date of the review. Now on to my review:<br /><br />First off, I've always loved this film and it was the story, acting and the photography that always captured me since I saw the film when it was released. It was in black and white (and growing up we only had a black and white TV, so I was used to this). The film looked "okay" on VHS and then, in 1998 Universal released it on DVD in a Collector's Edition. This included the film plus a full length commentary and the (then) new feature-length documentary. This was great.. but the film had not been "restored".<br /><br />Now Universal has restored it and the print is great. They brought back the above noted bonus features and added more! The bonuses amount to more viewing time than the feature film (almost four times!). The DVD version of the new release contains all the featurettes while the Blu-ray combo pack Collectors' Edition ads the book with rare photos etc and high-def of the special features. So if you don't have a BD player yet you won't miss out on the wonderful special features. And if you have not seen the documentary before, it will blow you away. (By the way, after you've absorbed ALL the featurettes on this set, seek out the new documentary, "Hey Boo, Harper Lee and To Kill a Mockingbird" which I reviewed last year. Both of these DVDs belong in every home.<br /><br />For all the material on this marvelous set from Universal, a copy belongs in every home - especially one with pre-teen and teenage children. And with a selling price on Amazon as low as it is, there is no reason not to buy a copy now! Thank you Universal for going the extra mile.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Having just read Charles Shields' biography of Harper Lee, "Mockingbird", and re-read her classic (and only) novel for at least the third time, I was able recently to watch Robert Mulligan's 1962 classic film adaptation with fresh eyes, and the 2005 Legacy Series Edition DVD fortunately contains a pristine print transfer and a bundle of extras that make repeated viewings more than worthwhile. Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance. Set in the Deep South of Lee's childhood in the fictional town of Maycomb in 1932, the story, adapted by writer Horton Foote, focuses on six-year old Scout, the tomboy, motherless daughter of lawyer Atticus Finch.<br /><br />Along with her four-years older brother Jem, Scout regales the new neighbor boy Dill with horror stories about the bleak-looking Radley house and its chief occupant, "Boo", whom they believe has been locked up in the basement. Finch, in the meantime, has been given the unenviable task of defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella, the cry-wolf daughter of a white trash racist farmer, Bob Ewell. The two stories meld seamlessly with the model behavior of Finch, who tries to teach his children not to come to judgment based on hearsay and perception. Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing. Because of the town's pervasive racism, Finch loses the case, and tragic consequences ensue. However, life lessons for the children emerge as well as "Boo" in an unexpected heroic act.<br /><br />Gregory Peck gives his career-best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human-sized dimensions to a most honorable man. It's inspiring work from a great screen legend. Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem. Brock Peters plays Tom with palpable dignity, while James Anderson dexterously handles the unenviable task of playing the disturbingly vile Ewell. An almost-albino-looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as "Boo" Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful. I did not know that the remarkable Kim Stanley is the one who provides the voiceover for the grown-up Scout ne&eacute; Jean Louise. Elmer Bernstein composed the sparse but resonate musical score, and Russell Harlan's black-and-white cinematography is effectively evocative. This masterwork is as good as family films get.<br /><br />The two-disc DVD set has a superb package of extras for any fan of the film and the book. Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J. Pakula, a superb director in his own right. There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom-seen Badham, and the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The second disc offers a fascinating, ninety-minute 1998 documentary, "Fearful Symmetry", filmed effectively in black-and-white, which goes well beyond the standard making-of featurette. It includes interviews with Peck, Badham, Alford, Pakula, Mulligan, Foote and Bernstein, and paints a remarkably penetrating story of the production. There is a second feature, 1999's "A Conversation with Gregory Peck", directed by famed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, which is actually a full-blown feature about the actor as he prepares for an onstage tribute. Providing revealing glimpses of the private man, it originally aired on PBS's "American Masters" series.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>I first saw this wonderful movie after rushing out to buy the novel to read before the movie finally came out later in the summer. I was just a teenager still in high school, but immediately loved the movie, which I  have seen countless times since. Gregory Peck is probably the single  greatest reason for the movie's smashing success, although the entire cast  does a terrific job in bringing this momentous story to the screen.  In  today's complex world one tends to lose perspective as to how explosive,  provocative, and sensational the issues of cross-race rape was in the early  1960s when the movie hit the screens. Yet despite the sizzling if subdued  sexual content and the divisive issues surrounding the movie, it quickly  became the movie of the year, winning Peck the Oscar for his incredible  portrayal of rural southern lawyer Atticus Finch. <p>No doubt it is the  character of Atticus Finch who deserves most of the credit for the novel's  enduring popularity. Seldom has such a quietly heroic figure been so  favorably and memorably described in such loving detail in an American  novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the highly principled and somewhat  befuddled widower-lawyer trying his level best to raise his two young  children alone in the midst of the deep South during the early years of the  Depression. As daughter Scout remembers, there was little that Atticus  couldn't charm or talk his way out of. And, as played by Gregory Peck,  this thoughtful, moral, and courageous man became a model of modern  American manhood for all who read or watched his story unfold. Of course,  the other characters are also lovingly and carefully drawn and described,  and the way in which the importance and relevance of the mockingbird  parable is sown into the web of the story at a number of different levels  with a number of different characters is also one of the enduring treasures  found within the pages of this book. <p>Whether considering Tom Robinson,  Boo Radley, Scout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we all come to better  understand the ways in which all the individuals' stories and fate are  intricately and inextricably interwoven with each other and into the fabric  of a particular time and place. Indeed, we watch with growing affection as  Atticus increasingly relies and depends on their black governess, and are  amazed by the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well. On  the other hand, we watch as Bob Ewell acts despicably to mistreat people of  color. There are volumes of wisdom herein regarding the treatment of human  beings and the problems associated with trying to live in any particular  place at any specific time. So well and accurately drawn are the characters  of this fable of the life and times of Scout Finch in &quot;To Kill A  Mockingbird&quot;, that one can only hope it continues to be widely seen  and appreciated as a modern American classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>I was surprised at how well all the elements came together for this film. Obviously the main cohesion is centered on Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his relationship with his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford). I would classify this as one of Gregory peck's best movies. It almost had to be shot in black and whit to have the feel needed in the all but black and white movie.<br /><br />Scout and Jem know very little about their neighbor `Boo' (Robert Duvall.) They have heard and made up strange stories. They spend time daring each other and their summer friend, to go up to the neighbor house as it holds some mysterious crazed person. Through the movie many odd things happen such as a tree that mysteriously offers a series of objects from marbles to a watch, among other things. What do we really know about our neighbors?  Watch as the mystery unfolds. Moreover, what will they find out in this slice of life in the Depression-era South.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060935464">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>Having read the book twice and now watching the film, it's nice to see that the film has actually done justice to the book in that it's successful in bringing out the actual message of innocence lost and about the difference between right and wrong, good and evil as seen from the point of view of 3 children and specifically the little girl Scout.  People tend to hate and seek to destroy that which they don't understand just because it scares them and the children learn at the end that the best way to overcome this fear is to face it head on and to seek to learn and understand rather than to judge and destroy.  At the end, this is what Scout does as she befriends the feared Boo who saves her brother's life.  We all naturally love to support the underdog and this film tells the story of Atticus fighting for justice and teaching his kids as he does so by his actions as well as his words.<br /><br />This dvd has an excellent documentary about the film as well as good interviews with the cast and crew as they look back at their experiences while making the film.  The picture quality is okay but not perfect and could do with another restoration job although the 2-channel mono sound quality is okay but a 5.1 surround option would have been much appreciated.  Overall, this is a well-crafted film with excellent acting and an excellent screenplay.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>This film is an excellent black and white adaptation of Harper Lee's book of the same name. The acting, particularly by Gregory Peck (and a cameo by a young Robert Duval), brings out all the pathos, bathos and grit of small town Southern life in the 1930's. The story itself is an unusual combination, narrated by Peck's film daughter (and presumably Lee herself), of a stage of the coming of age story that we are fairly familiar with and the question of race and sex in the Deep South (and not only there) with which we were (at the time of the film's debut in 1962) only vaguely familiar. That dramatic tension, muted as it was by the cinematic and social conventions of the time, nevertheless made a strong statement about the underlying tensions of this society at a time when the Southern black civil rights struggle movement was coming in focus in the national consciousness.<br /><br />The name Atticus Finch (Peck's role) as the liberal (for that southern locale) lawyer committed to the rule of law had a certain currency in the 1960's as a symbol for those southern whites who saw that Jim Crow had to go. Here Finch is the appointed lawyer for a black man accused of raping a white women of low origin- the classic `white trash' depicted in many a film and novel. Finch earnestly, no, passionately in his understated manner, attempts to defend this man, a brave act in itself under the circumstances.<br /><br />Needless to say an all white jury of that black man's `peers' nevertheless convicts him out of hand. In the end the black man tries to escape and is killed in the process. In an earlier scenario Finch is pressed into guard duty at the jailhouse in order to head off a posse of `white trash' elements who are bend on doing `justice' their way- hanging him from a lynching tree. On a mere false accusation of a white woman this black man is doomed whichever way he turns. Sound familiar?<br /><br />The other part of the story concerns the reactions by Finch's motherless son and tomboyish daughter to the realities of social life, Southern style. That part is in some ways, particularly when the children watch the trial from the "Negro" balcony section of the courtroom, the least successful of the film. What is entirely believable and gives some relief from the travesty that is unfolding are the pranks, pitfalls and antics of the kids. The tensions between brother and sister, the protective role of the older brother, the attempt by the sister to assert her own identity, the sense of adventure and mystery of what lies beyond the immediate household that is the hallmark of youth all get a work out here. But in the end it is the quiet dignity of solid old Atticus and the bewildered dignity of a doomed black man that hold this whole thing together. Bravo Peck. Kudos to Harper Lee.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I've been intrigued by the idea of `To Kill a Mockingbird' for some time now.  Knowing that it is rendered one of the finest cinematic accomplishments of all time had perked my interest early on but it became the movie I wanted to see but never got around to.  It's hard to find this little treasure in any rental place, but recently our library received a copy and so I snatched it up the second it was available.  Now I must say that I have not read the novel yet.  It's on my VERY LONG LIST of `must reads' but I just have yet to reach it.  After watching this film though I may have to reach that book a little quicker than anticipated.<br /><br />I guess the first thing I should say is that everything you've heard about this film is true, all the praise it received was well deserved and every second of it's running time is well worth it.  I was absorbed in this film from start to finish.<br /><br />`To Kill a Mockingbird' broaches the subject of racism in the South during the depression but it's overlaying message of equality and acceptance are what we should all be taking away from this masterpiece.  The film revolves around a count case involving a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is the man selected to represent him.  The story is told through the eyes of Atticus' children, mostly his daughter Scout.  As Scout and her brother Jem battle their own quote-unquote prejudices with a neighborhood boy named Boo Radley they watch their father work to free a man he knows is innocent.  Atticus, a widower, works equally hard to instill good morals in his two children and raise them right and this is reflected in their ability to reason on situations, some even too big for them to fully understand.<br /><br />`To Kill a Mockingbird' has been labeled a classic, and you don't call them classics for nothing.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' truly is a downright perfect film.  The acting is superb, which is something I never truly expected.  I have watched a fair share of older films and have always found that the acting never truly stacks up to the great actors of today, but the performances by Gregory Peck especially rival those of today.  Gregory Peck (who won the Oscar for this performance) comes across so natural, so organic here.  He reacts as a father would, with subtleties when necessary as well as force.  His performance is understandably tempered and it helps aid the message of the film along.<br /><br />The two young children as well, Mary Badham and Philip Alford, are excellent here.  For young actors they grasped their characters exceptionally well.  Brock Peters is convincing as Tom Robinson, the black man on trial, and James Anderson is deliciously evil as Robert Ewell, the man accusing him of the crime (against his daughter).<br /><br />It was also interesting to see a young Robert Duvall here in a very small yet very powerful role.  He was truly commanding and played a key part in making this film's message a universal one.<br /><br />In the end I don't think there are enough good things to be said about `To Kill a Mockingbird'.  It's brilliantly scripted, acted and directed and stands the test of time, for while it was released in 1962 it still means something today, 45 years later.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' is a film that everyone should see in order to appreciate and one that I highly recommend to anyone with the slightest interest.  Don't wait any longer for `To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of those rare films that is actually WORTH the wait!</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>In his later years, Peck acknowledged that Atticus Finch was his favorite role among many such as Frank Savage in Twelve O'Clock High and Phil Green in Gentleman's Agreement. Peck was the perfect choice to play Finch and received an Academy Award for best actor for that performance. Finch is the central character in Harper Lee's autobiographical novel. A widower with two young children, he supports himself and his family as an attorney in a small town in Alabama during the Great Depression. When Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) is accused of rape, Finch agrees to represent the young black man. This decision antagonizes several of the town's racist whites. <p>The action is seen through Lee's persona, "Scout" (Mary Badham), the younger of the two Finch children. The trial becomes the focal point of the narrative, with the courtroom becoming Finch's pulpit. His eloquent appeals for justice and racial tolerance are directed to everyone in the town, not only to members of the jury. As directed by Robert Mulligan, all members of the cast perform brilliantly. Of special interest is the screen debut of Robert Duvall as Boo Radley, a mysterious recluse who eventually becomes significantly involved in the plot. Thanks to Peck's skills under Mulligan's direction, this is not a "preachy" film. Finch is as credible to those who see this film as he is to those in the town in which he and his children live. When making word associations with the name Gregory Peck, intelligence, integrity, and dignity immediately come to mind. All three describe Finch. Credit must also be given to Horton Foote who wrote the highly literate screenplay based on Lee's autobiographical novel. This is a great film primarily because it contains a great performance by Peck and because (through Finch) it makes a power appeal to the best that is within us, whatever the color of our skin may be.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this was a best seller on paperback by harper lee.it is considered a classic both on paper and in film.theres these 2 kids scout and gem who are growing up in the south long ago.there neighbor was boo radley who was crazy and never came outside.they say he killed someone with scissors.one summer,a black guy was accused of raping this chick.now at this time,blacks werent considered to be any better than in 1870.to make matters worse,there father was a lawyer and got the undesirable job of defending him.this sends the small racist town into an uproar.problem is,the black guy is crippled as one arm is fully one foot or more shorter than the other.but,they were going to hang him anyway.id better stop here before i take it too far!the writers did an excellent job mastering this enchanting tale which is a true classic!if not for the rape element,this would be an excellent show for kids.i think this is one of those rare movies that is likeable by everyone.its good beginning to end also.they should make a new version.the rape victim is the closest thing to pretty here and shes a clueless inbred hick.it is actualy very much consistent with the book,with only very minor differences.the important message is dont drink too much and reason can win over terror if properly applied.the trial is pretty intense and the closing scenes too.a great great great GREAT movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![just buy it,damn!]</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>If you want to see great acting, watch this movie.  Gregory Peck's pressence in this film is awe inspiring.  This is his greatest role in one of the best movies ever made.  I honestly think this was one movie that made a difference in changing the course in the Civil Rights of all people at that time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>Released in 1962, To Kill a Mockingbird ranks #34 on the AFI top 100 movie list and shows clearly just how powerful a classic movie can be. Where many movies fade and wither in time, To Kill a Mockingbird remains just as powerful, just as memorable as when it was first filmed. In other movies the characters can feel dated. The acting can seem shoddy. People make excuses about "well, it was only the 1960s. What can you expect." THIS is what you can expect. The dialogue is stellar. The acting is superb. Even in black and white, even with the limited technology available, you get sucked in, immersed, and feel the full reality of what is going on. This is what high quality movie making is all about.<br /><br />The movie is a perfect window into events which were all too familiar during the Great Depression. People struggled to get by. They had to try to pay their bills with crops grown in their back yard. People with mental illness were treated little better than dogs. Women were beaten. Into all of this comes young Scout, a girl growing up with her older brother and widowed father. She is a tomboy, eager to speak out and fight for her cause. The worst thing her brother can accuse her of is acting like a "girl". She has strong ideals and is not afraid to voice them.<br /><br />Her father, a lawyer, is tapped to represent a local black man who has been accused of raping a white woman. Most of the town wants to lynch the poor accused man, although some townsfolk see the injustice of it. Scout leaps into fights with her schoolmates to defend the honor of her father. And ironically, when her father is threatened, it is her willingness to speak up and say what she feels that helps to soothe the situation.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this film. Gregory Peck is incredible. He gives just the right touch to so many scenes. You can see in his eyes the mix of emotions as he stands strong on the steps before the mob. When his son is hurt, and he's standing outside the window trying desperately to figure out what to do, my heart ached for him. His strength in the courtroom, and his tenderness with his kids is just stunning.<br /><br />I have seen this movie many times, and I look forward to seeing it many more. Every time someone tries to make a case for a shoddy movie from the 60s or 50s, claiming "well it's just how movies were made back then", I point to this one. THIS is how fine movies were made in this time period. This shows great acting, great dialogue, and a mix of characters who are authentic and interesting and respectful of their origins. The mentally ill man is not treated as a joke. He is a real human being. The drunkard father, the lying daughter, and the plight of the black members of the community are all shown with clarity and realism.<br /><br />It is a minor, interesting note, that despite the movie seeming to revolve around women, they never talk with each other! It's all about how men impact their lives. Scout is central but she is primarily talked to by her father and brother. Those are the influences she cares about. Only briefly does the nanny character talk with her. Similarly, the lying daughter is another key character but she is only ever talked to / at by the lawyer and her father. The movie is about how the women are handled / guided by men. I think the only time a female really talks to any of these women is when the nanny scolds Scout for how she behaves to a guest. That's the one instance in the entire film.<br /><br />Highly recommended in the strongest possible words. Everyone should see this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>To Kill a Mockingbird is a Hollywood classic.

It's about a Southern lawyer (Peck) who defends a black man who has been wrongfully accused of raping a white woman.  A true masterpiece that should be required reading by ever high school literature department in the Nation.<br /><br />Highly recommended for everyone old enough to understand its message.<br /><br />Gunner April, 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>I was surprised at how well all the elements came together for this film. Obviously the main cohesion is centered on Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his relationship with his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford). I would classify this as one of Gregory peck's best movies. It almost had to be shot in black and whit to have the feel needed in the all but black and white movie.<br /><br />Scout and Jem know very little about their neighbor `Boo' (Robert Duvall.) They have heard and made up strange stories. They spend time daring each other and their summer friend, to go up to the neighbor house as it holds some mysterious crazed person. Through the movie many odd things happen such as a tree that mysteriously offers a series of objects from marbles to a watch, among other things. What do we really know about our neighbors?  Watch as the mystery unfolds.

For me, as a Canadian, this film has always embodied the best and worst of what exemplifies southern American culture. It deals with children, with racial issues, with the persistent matter of &quot;differentness&quot; that lies at the heart of every person's most significant issues. To be &quot;different&quot; is to be isolated; it's an issue that embraces personality, ethnicity, skin color, economic level--everything, really. And this film deals with that matter on several levels. It is, to my mind Gregory Peck's more memorable performance, embodying as he does the ideals by which we can only try to live. And it was Robert Duvall's debut film performance as the spooky, seldom-seen, but everpresent Boo Radley. This is, in the truest sense, an American classic: affecting, powerful, and wonderfully faithful to the book.</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>After reading the 1960 book I wanted to watch the movie, so our class watched it.

The actors did very well. enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>To Kill a Mockingbird, as other reviewers have noted, is probably not only one of the significant novels of our time, but also one of the most important movies. It is easy to see why this film resonates with the vast majority who see it, and why it consistently gets mentioned with being one of the 100 best films of all time. It is a rarity to have a film live up to a book, not only in its adaptation, but also how we visualize the story taking place. Producer (Alan J. Pakula) and director (Robert Mulligan) put together a perfect version of Harper Lee's novel, from the mood, music score, cinematography, and cast, who all personify the characters in the book. Gregory Peck was a perfect fit for Atticus Finch, as his taciturn manner, his stoic mood, and his unflinching attitude towards his principles is depicted with such precision. The young children cast as Scout and Jem also give fine performances.<br /><br />The film itself explores the theme of racial injustice and conflict in the South, but also the essence of believing and doing something because it is the right thing to do, and sticking with it until the end. In this case, Atticus Finch is the lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson, a black man charged with rape, knowing full well that it isn't the popular decision in the Maycomb community, and that ultimately, he and his children will have to pay for it through insults, gossip and general Southern "inhospitality". Still, Atticus sticks to his guns, and doesn't let this get the best of him, a lesson that Jem and Scout learn as the film progresses. Gossiping neighbors whisper, not approving of what Atticus is doing. Atticus Finch has several conflicts with Bob Ewell, a trashy member of the community whose prejudice is evidenced when he spits on Atticus, calls him a derogatory term, and then seeks revenge later. As a result of Atticus' strong principles, Jem, his son, and Scout, his daughter, see the world through realistic viewpoints (albeit the ugliness of society's views on race becomes apparent). The children endure taunts from classmates and even relatives about their father defending Tom Robinson and, as the trail unfolds, the ugliness of class and racial injustice surfaces. Jem and Scout experience a coming of age; their innocent world view is contradicted by these unsettling events. The subplot of To Kill a Mockingbird concerns Boo Radley, a recluse who lives nearby, but has not been seen in years. Rumors swirl about Boo, usually involving something to do with his apparent "craziness", but there is no real proof, and Jem and Scout are left to their own imaginings. However, a significant event changes their perception of him and the world; they are able, as Atticus puts, see things from another person's perspective.<br /><br />This DVD is a wonderful tool also for any teacher who teaches the novel in high school, as the film is faithful to the book, including many essential scenes, so it is easy to read parts of the novel and then follow these with the film. Also included is a fantastic documentary which examines the making of the film, as well as interviews with several of the actors, such as Gregory Peck. All in all, this is one of the best films ever made, and a fantastic DVD to own.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>Outstanding family-oriented drama featuring a lazy southern town that suffers from more than summer heat as a young brother and sister learn how quickly the innocence of childhood is lost.<p>Very highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>{The only reason I gave it a mere four stars is that the book got five.}<br /><br />My earlier review of the book amounted to little more than "rah rah rah, go read this!" Now let me go into some more detail. The story is excellent on many levels, and it's a bit more complex than a retelling of the plot would indicate. "Black man accused of raping white girl in the Depression era." That's the court case that drives some of Harper Lee's novel. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of attorney Atticus Finch, one of literature's most memorable characters. And yet, in the novel, Atticus isn't the main character. This book is about his daughter Scout and his son Jem. Scout is our narrator, and what we see (and don't see) comes from her.<br /><br />So how did this translate to the big screen? Quite well. The child actors, both newcomers, were excellent in their roles. Ditto on the boy who portrayed Dill, whose part was far larger in the novel but which is good in the film as well. The book had a large number of plots and subplots, so the filmmakers had to strip some away to make it work as a movie. They chose well. The results are still as complex and multi-textured as life itself.<br /><br />I watched this maybe a month after reading it, so I remembered 90% of what would happen, along with much of what was deleted. I doubt the movie could have been done much better than it was, and I'll watch it again. I'm aware of all the "deep dark Southern secrets" from the novel, those that were in the film and those that weren't. I got a strong sense that the actors were equally aware, and that's cool. Nobody could fit them all into a film that lasts under 2 hours, so they only chose the most relevant. This is how it should be. I very love this film, as we say in China, and it'll probably be in my DVD collection until I die.<br /><br />Oh, and this is purely coincidental. Later in this newsletter you'll see "The One-Plot Wonder," which I wrote over a year ago but chose to rerun. I made this decision long before watching TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. But this book, and this movie, are a fantastic example of what I'm talking about. It has many plots.

The setting has a charged undercurrent of racism, which I am sure must've been very poignant during the movie's release. Yes, it's a great movie, especially on the digitally mastered DVD. <p>But it is not the magnum opus that people never seem to get enough of raving about. Perhaps it just hasn't aged that well. <p>The story is set in Alabama during the Great Depression. It follows the life of Scout Finch, a little girl growing up in those wretched times. Basically, it's about what's going on with the town and what's going on with Scout and her family throughout her growth, leading to different storylines of events that happens to Scout and the rest of the Finch's.<p>Probably the only storyline I really appreciated was the story of Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus (Scout's father) was defending Tom in a rape case, and since Tom was black, this was taboo in Maycomb. This pithily showed unfairness and how cruel prejudice and hate can be. Maybe if the movie was only centered around that story instead of throwing in aspects like Boo Radley, Dill, and others, I would consider calling this movie a classic. It didn't really help that Scout, who is supposed to be an innocent unknowing little girl, actually comes off as an annoying, loud, obnoxious brat that you'd want to slap throughout the entire movie. <p>There's some good acting  although Gregory Peck's wooden oh-so-conscientious face was nowhere near Oscar worthy, had it not been for the controversial theme. In the end, the courtroom scenes are perhaps the only engaging bit I would recommend this movie for.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Much like the book, I didn't like this movie because it was just so boring and unexciting. The characters are as uncompelling as they were in the book and I really felt no compassion for the social injustice tragedies that were in the story because of how boring this movie and the book are. There is almost no excitement to be derived from this shamefully bad movie, the storyline is just groan-worthy, the characters are groan-worthy, the premise is boring, the fight scene at the end was lame, and just about everything else was lame, just like the terrible book. This isn't one of the worst of the worst films I've ever seen (That distinction is for Happy Feet and Like Mike). If you think I'm some kind of racist because I hate the book and movie (Much how people think I'm atheist because of my review for The Bible Game) you're wrong, because I'm not. This movie just sucks along with the book because they're just so freaking boring! Avoid this movie please, if you truly like movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film begins with a child opening a box with toys that dates this story to the 1930s. The lawyer takes his payment in goods, cash is scarce. This little girl seems to be a tomboy. The kids are warned about the local maniac chained in his house. There is an old lady who is cranky. We hear the family history. People don't dress for the hot weather. The Judge asks Atticus Finch to represent a defendant. These kids just wander around (to present a view of life). Does anyone watch them? That lady does not wear a hat and gloves. "Scout" seems to have a behavior problem. Atticus tells about his first gun. He tells "Scout" about the need for proper deportment in school.<br /><br />Then a mad dog appears in the street. Atticus returns to shoot it, he is known as a good shot. Later he meets the wife of the defendant. A man shows up for a scary scene. Jem finds a trinket. "Scout" has more behavior problems. Atticus explains his legal work. A man patches a hole in a tree. Jem found things in that hole. At night some cars arrive at the jail. Atticus bars the door, he defends it with moral strength. His daughter's presence turns the men back. [Believable?] The courtroom is packed solid, but there is room on the second floor. The trial begins with testimony from Sheriff Tait. Mr. Ewell tells what he saw. Lawyer Finch shows Ewell is left-handed. May Ellen testifies about what happened. Finch questions her.<br /><br />Defendant Robinson tells how his left arm was lamed due to an accident on the job when he was twelve years old. [No child labor laws?] May Ellen repeats her claim. [You can judge her credibility.] Mr Robinson takes the stand and tells what happened. Will he be believed? He felt sorry for her? Lawyer Finch said there was no physical evidence for the crime. The defendant has a lame left arm. Was this crime due to the violation of society's rules. Can the word of a Negro be taken against two white people? Finch asks for justice for his client. The jury takes two hours to decide on guilty. Later Finch learns that Robinson was shot while trying to escape.<br /><br />Jem and Tina May walk home in the dark for a final dramatic scene. They are attacked by a strange man. Jem is hurt. Mr. Ewell is found dead. Who rescued Jem? [Is the ending believable?] Sheriff Tait decides that Ewell fell on his knife. This case is closed. An example of poetic justice? [Would Atticus want his child to be friends with a grown man who has emotional problems? This ending damages the story.] I wonder if "Scout" will have problems as an adult?</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>Gregory Peck was entirely deserving of the recognition that he got for playing Atticus Finch (including the Oscar for Best Actor), the strongest role in the movie was actually that of Scout (played by Mary Badham).  Badham was nominated for an Academy Award, and I feel that it is on the strength of Scout that this movie was carried.  While Peck may have been the moral backbone of the movie, it is Badham that is the heart of the movie and whom the film truly does revolve around.  <p>To Kill a Mockingbird is the film adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same title.  The story deals with racism and morality in a very humanistic way.  When a black man is accused of raping a white woman, Atticus Finch takes the case to defend Tom Robinson (the man accused).  This is a story about race relations as well as community relations and in the end, about doing the right thing.  The house next to the Finch home is the Radley house.  There are stories and rumors and prejudices against the hidden Radley boy, Boo Radley (the screen debut of Robert Duvall).  Somehow, the stories about the Radley home come together with the trial of Tom Robinson and the moment where Scout gently says, "hey Boo" is truly a beautiful moment.  <p>I could probably heap praise on this movie until my fingers can't type anymore, but I am simply going to end by saying this is a movie than anybody who wants to watch a great movie needs to see this.  Both the book and the movie are truly American classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>I read two books the summer I turned fourteen, this was one of them. It moved me, for the first time, very deeply, and haunted me with it's quiet and unflinching look at racism, seen through the eyes of the purest of us all, children. I identified with Jem and Scout and Dill and wished I could go with them on the heart-stopping excursions to Boo's house; I felt the broad spectrum of emotion that this classic evokes in me to this day, and when it was brought to the screen, there was nothing missing; it is a complete, intact translation into cinema and is, in my opinion, the best performance of Gregory Peck's career. I hated Mayella Ewell for a long time, until I realized what her life was truly like and the real villain here is her father. I felt so bad for Brock Peters, and I felt his hopelessness so keenly, it was hard to watch, much harder than it was to read, and the pain and resignation on his face still conjures up all the hate crimes that continue to this day, and reminds me, uncomfortably, of the truck dragging death in Texas. The setting is wonderful, the gifts in the tree from Boo are touching, and the feeling of sorrow when Mr. Radley fills up the hole is profound. Dill, the character drawn directly from Truman Capote, is one of my favorite characters, the old-young wisdom and mature vocabulary are a joy to watch. Calpurnia is solid and comforting in the fast-changing world of the Finch household, and you are glad she is there. The court-room scene is riveting, as is the byplay in the balcony, where Jem, Dill and Scout sneak in and watch the proceedings. The Reverend, when the trial is over, cautions the children to "Stand up, your father is passing.." so thankful is he that Atticus, although losing the case, has nevertheless made a strong statement by virtue of the fact that he kept the jury out so long...and of course, the end, when the children are attacked on their way home from a Halloween party at the school by none other than Tom Ewell. Boo saves their lives, and when Atticus agrees with the Sheriff to let it be, and leave Boo alone, Scout says, "I understand...it would be like killing a mockingbird." And Atticus sits up all night in Jem's room, and as Scout says, "Atticus stayed there all night, and would be there when Jem waked up in the morning..."</p></br><a href="../users/A35XMSURGM0L1N.html">A35XMSURGM0L1N</a><br/><p>'To Kill A Mockingbird' is of course the movie adaptation of Harper Lee's movie with the same title. Gregory Peck is a lawyer in rural Mississippi who is asked to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.<p>The movie starts however with a seemingly unrelated event, the lives of Atticus Finch's two children. His daughter is a tomboy and his son is trying to keep her from getting into more trouble. The stumble upon some strange items and look at the house of a strange man called Boo Radley.<p>Then the movie goes into the court case. It is of course very obvious that the black man is innocent, but this is 1930's South with an all white jury...<p>Then the two parts of the movie come back together again...<p>The acting in this movie (in black and white) is superb. I recall that Gregory Pecks perfomance was voted the best of the century. Even the little girl is superb, she even got a nominatation for an oscar. Boo Radley is played by Robert Duvall, though he says next to nothing and is only in the movie for a few minutes. He of course 10 years later would play Tom Hayden in The Godfather. For Star Trek fans: Tom Robinson, the black man accused, is Sisko's Father of DS9</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>The setting for this movie is a dusty southern town in Alabama during the depression and is shot through the perspective of a child's eye. Mr. Gregory Peck does a superb job of playing a southern lawyer who defends a black man who is accused of rape by a white woman and her father. There is no question as you watch the movie of two things; the outcome of the trial and the fact the man is obviously innocent.<br /><br />In this movie we have a great example of a man, Gregory Pecks character, setting a good example of a parent and of being a good member of a community. He instills good values in his children, shows tremendous courage and strength of character. He teaches that you cannot judge a person until you can see the world through their eyes. He is a peerless man, in that everyone is his peer. This is a film whole families should watch together.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Harper Lee wrote a semi-autobiographical novel about memories she made growing up in small town Alabama during that time between the Civil War and World War II, when blacks had been emancipated, but many whites, especially in the South, were reluctant to acknowledge blacks as equals.  The setting of this story preceded Martin Luther King, Jr's work by two decades. The novel "To Kill A Mockingbird" is one of the most important, passionate, beloved, spiritual and moral works in the English language.  It rightfully was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, and if only one had been awarded for the entire 20th century, it would still get my vote.<br /><br />Rightfully so, Harper Lee was hesitant to see her beloved story turned over to "Hollywood".  She needn't have worried.<br /><br />"To Kill a Mockingbird", the film, has become as beloved as Harper Lee's book.  When the American Film Institute came out with their many "100 Greatest..." lists at the turn of the century Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch came out at #1 on the list of "Greatest Screen Heroes", ahead of such screen icons as Indiana Jones, James Bond and Rick from "Casablanca".  The film itself ranked as #34 of Greatest Films of history.  I would personally rank it in the top 2.<br /><br />The story is relatively simple.  A black man, Tom Robinson (in a noble performance by Brock Peters) is accused of raping a young woman from a "white trash" family.  The guilt of the black man is a foregone conclusion in this predominantly white southern town, but the Judge knows the only man in town with a chance to defend Tom.  The Judge asks Atticus Finch.  Atticus Finch is a widower, raising his two children on the salary of a small-town southern lawyer, frequently taking livestock and vegetables in trade for his services.  Atticus has many friends in town, and everyone who knows Mr. Finch knows that he is a man of saint-like honor.  Atticus never brags and much of what his own children learn about him comes from other adults who have known him for years.<br /><br />Wisely approaching the movie from the same perspective as Harper Lee's original narrative, Robert Mulligan tells the story from the perspective of the Finch children: Mary Badham as daughter Scout (who seems about 10) and slightly older brother Phillip Alford as Jem.  Scout and Jem do the things that children do.  They play hide and seek.  They tell ghost stories.  They roll tires down the street.  And, most importantly, they watch their father defend an innocent man who is sometimes an inch away from being lynched.<br /><br />The courtroom scenes are taut, with racial conflict simmering away like a pot threatening to boil over at any moment.  Atticus Finch keeps the lid on that pot.  The courtroom scenes here have not been matched by any film before or since.  Gregory Peck confided to Director Mulligan that he had won the Academy Award for him in just the scene at the end of the trial where Atticus silently packs up his papers and walks out of the courtroom.  If you haven't seen the film before - watch for this moment and you'll know what he meant.<br /><br />Supporting performances perfectly compliment the transcendant one by Mr. Peck.  Robert Duvall makes an impressive screen debut in an important role that doesn't appear until the final moments.  Collin Wilcox Paxton captures the pitiful "victim" of the alleged rape, Mayella Ewell.  James Anderson is terrifying as Mayella's spitefully prejudiced father, Bob Ewell.  Estelle Evans plays Calpurnia, who mothers the motherless Finch children when Atticus must be away.  Frank Overton is authoritative and one of the only professional friends Atticus has as Sheriff Tate.  Paul Fix presides over the famous courtroom scenes, in addition to asking Atticus to carry the unbearable load of defending the case that can't be defended in that town at that time.<br /><br />In America (and, dare I say, other parts of the world) issues of prejudice and racism have not completely subsided.  But the days of Emmitt Till seem long ago and far away.  It took something to change the minds or racist Southerners not that many generations away from slavery.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" has done as much to advance the principles of fairness and justice as any single work of history.  It's that important.</p></br></body></html>

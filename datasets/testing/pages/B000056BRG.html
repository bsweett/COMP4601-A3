Warner Bros has really done a superb job. The picture, color, clarity and sound could not be any better if this film was made yesterday. It is presented in the original anamorphic widescreen, and what a view. You won't miss a bit of the academy award winning cinematography. The chariot race, the sea battle,the splendors of Rome and all the glorious and immense sets will just have you in awe. The wonderful technicolor on this DVD is a stand out compared to some others of this era(there were a couple of occasions where there was some sort of greenish tint, but in the background and did not interfer with the view). The sound is enhanced in Dolby Dig  Surround 5.1 and is just excellent. The music, dialouge and all surrounding sounds are crystal clear.<br /><br />The film runs about 3 1/2 hours(you need to flip the disc at about the 2:20 mark, a good time to raid the fridge!), and includes the original overture and intermission music. And if you can't get enough, the DVD also includes some fabulous features. There is audio commentary by Charlton Heston, screen tests, a photo gallery,career highlights, subtitles in English, French(it may also be viewed in French) Spanish and Portuguese.<br />There is also an hour long behind-the-scenes documentary "BEN-HUR: The Making of an Epic". This feature not only goes  into depth in the making of this version, but also gives some great information on the 1925 version with Ramon Novarro, and even has some footage of the very first celluloid attempt of the story(which ran 15 min) from 1907, and background information on the book and it's author. There are some great interviews with cast and crew(from both of these huge films).<br /><br />"BEN-HUR", the story of a Jewish Prince who's life paralells that of Christ,is an epic saga that takes him from a nobleman, to a galley slave to a hero. The film won a record breaking 11 Acamedy Awards in 1959, including Best Picture, Best Director(William Wyler), Best Cinematography, Best Actor(Charlton Heston) and Best Supporting Actor(Hugh Griffith). This record was unmatched for nealy 40 years, when in 1997  "Titantic" burst onto the scene.<br /><br />It is a wonderful story, and has something for everyone. The cast includes some of the greats from the 50's. Look for Jack Hawkins as Quinas Arrius the Roman whose life is saved by Judah Ben-Hur, Stephen Boyd as Messala, Judah's boyhood friend who turns on him,Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell as his beloved mother and sister, and Haya Harareet as Esther, the woman he loves.<br /><br />If you have never seen this film before, keep reading some of the other terrific and informative reviews here that delve more into the story, and trust me this is one great story! For those that have seen it, you will fall in love all over with this film on this excellent DVD. There is another edition for sale as well, the "Limited Edition Collector Set". It looks like it comes with lots of goodies for the serious collector, but is quite a bit more expensive. The studio of release on that one is not Warner Bros though.<br /><br />Bravo Warner Bros and Thank You!<br /><br />also available in great 3 pack:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087EYC">Best Picture Collection - Epic Dramas (Casablanca/Gone With the Wind/Ben-Hur)</a>(check for best deals available)<br /><br />enjoy....Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"Ben-Hur 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition" is a lavish Blu-ray packaging of the 1959 Best Picture Academy Award winner.  "Ben-Hur" is a Biblical epic that stands far above other movies of the genre, primarily because it doesn't moralize and treat its characters as saints.  The characters are not perfect, not immune to temptation and vengeance, and not one-dimensional.  The film also had the benefit of veteran director William Wyler, balancing the film's action sequences with the personal story of Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), a member of the family of Judea, who rebels against their state of virtual slavery under Roman rule.<br /><br />Based on Lew Wallace's best-selling novel, Karl Tunberg's screenplay presented flesh-and-blood characters and plenty of melodrama to keep viewers involved.  Heston, who won the Best Actor Academy Award, dominates the three-and-a-half hour epic as Ben-Hur wins the love of Hebrew maiden Esther (Haya Harareet), is adopted by Roman consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), and becomes a slave of a sheik (Hugh Griffith) who matches Ben-Hur in a chariot race against his former friend, now enemy -- the cruel and ambitious Roman, Messala (Stephen Boyd).<br /><br />"Ben-Hur" required 100,000 costumes, 15,000 extras and a $15 million budget -- the costliest in MGM's history.  The movie was filmed in a process known as MGM Camera 65, one of the widest prints ever made, with a width almost three times its height.  This allowed for spectacular panoramic shots and exciting action sequences.<br /><br />The chariot race sequence in the Circus Maximus is breathtaking.  It was constructed on over 18 acres of backlot space at Cinecitta Studios outside Rome, and the filming took five weeks.  With the exception of two of the most spectacular stunts, Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did all their own chariot driving in the meticulously choreographed sequence.<br /><br />"Ben-Hur" won 11 Academy Awards, a record that held for 38 years until "Titanic" won a similar number.  The three-disc Blu-ray box set contains a newly remastered and restored print, the 1925 silent version of "Ben-Hur," screen tests, vintage newsreels, 64-page production art book, replica of Heston's journal and sketches, one-hour making-of featurette, highlights from the 1960 Academy awards ceremony, and the new documentary, "Charlton Heston & Ben-Hur: A Personal Journey."</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>I was reading some reviews of "The Quiet Man" earlier this year. And a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time, entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children, grandchildren and I imagine great grandchildren.<br /><br />In that league of the timeless you have to put Ben-Hur, a story of love, redemtion, compassion, revenge, retribution, foregiveness and tranquility, in an epic truly larger than life. If we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago, then certainly William Wyler's third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view.<br /><br />For me, seeing it again and again, I am always startled by Mr. Heston's skills as an actor, often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence. Here the antagonist is Stephen Boyd, Judah Ben-Hur's best friend from childhood, now addicted to the narcotic of power. The two will clash; this is the time of Christ's ministry. Christ is seen as a rabble rouser and Rome, an international giant the world had never seen, seeks to thwart that message by girding up Jerusalem. So they send the now goal oriented and vicious Messala to the home of Ben-Hur.<br /><br />Heston is also supported ably by Jack Hawkins, a brilliant actor in his prime, as the Roman Counsel Quintus Arrius. Judah Ben-Hur, sentenced to virtual death on the Roman Galleys, survives a battle with the Macedonians to only save Quintus Arius.<br /><br />I say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene, the arrival of Quintus Arrius in Rome, a hero, with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman, Judah Ben-Hur. William Wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as Jack Hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before Ceasar there must be 100 steps! And the camera back away to see Hawkins in his magenta robe, draped over the pure white stairs, climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire. In "Spartacus," also a fine movie a few years later, the script tells you about the size of the Roman empire. Here in this one scene, Wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word.<br /><br />At the same time, Judah Ben-Hur, remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs, looks around and in that one expression on Heston's face of awe and the size and the power of 1st century Rome, he amplifies the scene of Hawkins climbing the staircase.<br /><br />A great, great move. Well worth your time if you have never seen it. Well worth your time again if you have. 5 stars.

Well, it was wrong before, and it's still wrong now. But pop this Blu-Ray disc in your player, and no one will ever suspect it is true again.<br /><br />Ben-Hur is presented in a two-disc edition that basically includes just the movie and commentary, split across two discs. This is a nice alternative to paying forty plus for an edition that includes all kinds of "collectors" junk and a giant box that won't fit on your shelf anyway. The movie is of course a classic, and I find it to be pretty absorbing and entertaining. Heston gives some of his most nuanced work, and the supporting cast is all good.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the transfer itself, it has many high points:<br />-Very strong detail across the entire range, large and small, near and far. Faces show tiny beads of sweat, cloth shows realistic texture, foliage and stones pop with realism.<br />-Very light film grain is evident, whereas no DNR or EE is evident.<br />-Very strong colors, especially the reds of the Roman uniforms. Flesh tones are pleasingly realistic.<br />-Good dimensionality in bright shots, less so in dark shots.<br />-Excellent and solid black levels, with a good amount of detail near black.<br />-Very few shots besides process shots show some degradation of the film elements. I counted two dropped frames, and about ten seconds worth of print damage manifesting itself in some wavering colors.<br /><br />Basically, in every way except special effects and lighting choices (that is, many interior shots are realistically lit, and thus look somewhat dark to an eye trained by the likes of Michael Bay), this transfer is competitive with any on the market today, and stands as probably the single best 65mm transfer available. It is WAY better than the unfortunate botched transfer job on "Spartacus," and it is a terrific companion piece to "The Ten Commandments," also on Blu-Ray. Between these two classic epics, there should no longer be any doubt that classic films can look superb in HD. Any film fan should buy this right away, especially at this reduced price!<br /><br />By the way, if you are interested in getting the third disc from the bigger set, I suggest importing from Amazon.co.uk. There is a 3-disc edition with none of the superfluous stuff from the box. It will cost you more than the 2 disc set, but still much less than the big box. The Blu-Ray itself is region free, so it will play in any American player. Don't ask me why WB insists on giving the US market an all-or-nothing choice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>William Wyler's Ben-Hur is actually the third version of the film to appear.  It was first done as a silent film, then remade in the 1920's and then tackled in this epic version.  The film literally employed a cast of thousands and at the time of its release in 1959 was a technical marvel.  Forty years later the film still stands up and the DVD version perfectly captures the grandeur of the film.  The chariot race is one of the most famous scenes in movie history and despite all the technological advances has yet to be duplicated or surpassed.  Charlton Heston won his only Oscar in the title role and he's at his bombastic, self-righteous and over-emoting best.  Jack Hawkins is excellent as his one-time best friend turned rival and Hugh Griffith is delightful as the sheik who supplies Ben Hur with the horses for the chariot race.  Mr. Griffith also won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor and Mr. Wyler won his third Best Director award as the film went on to win an unprecedented 11 awards (including Best Picture).  That was record that stood until 1997 when Titanic matched it.  One complaint about an otherwise superb DVD release is that instead of putting the almost four hour film along with all the extra material onto two disks, they made one double-sided disk.  The lettering distinguishing the two sides is extremely small and difficult to figure out and it is a nuisance to get up during the film to flip the disk over.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>You read it right, folks. Not one, but TWO splendid film versions of General Lew Wallace's timeless story of a Prince Of Judea and his encounters with the Prince Of Peace are included in this epic collection. The first is the one we all know and love...the 1959 version starring Charlton Heston. Winner of 11 Academy Awards (a record which has been tied twice [once, I think, unfairly, in 1997] but hopefully will never be surpassed), William Wyler's epic blockbuster combines spectacle with the human drama of a man fighting for revenge and receiving redemption in the process. Every Oscar the movie won, it most definitely earned. I grew up watching the 1959 movie, and it's one of my favourites. Besides the well-known chariot race scene in Part II, the best scene is the one where Esther sees Miriam and Tirzah as they prepare to go to the Valley Of The Lepers. Just a heart-wrenching scene, and Mr. Rozsa's haunting score for the scene makes it all the more profound. The second version may be less well-known, but it's a classic, and the one that spawned the 1959 remake...the 1925 silent film version, now with restored Technicolor sequences and a score by Carl Davis recorded in 1990. I highly recommend both film versions. Miklos Rozsa's score for the 1959 film is well-done, and rightfully beloved, but the score for the 1925 film (especially Track 8-"The Chariot Race") is equally impressive, and well-done. This 4 disc set also include two documentaries, screen tests, trailers, footage from the 1959 Academy Awards and more. You can't go wrong with "Ben-Hur." One of the greatest novels of all time is now TWO major motion pictures, and for the first time, both of them are available together. My only complaint (which is fairly minor) is that when you click on one of the menus, there's a screenshot of a deleted scene. The scene is not included as a bonus feature, and I'm curious to know why it was cut from the film and if the scene still exists. Rated G.<br /><br />The unauthorized 1907 silent film of "Ben-Hur" is available on YouTube for viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>Recently I have been watching some movies that were big in the year I was born...1959. This one is definitely in the top 10! A story of redemption, betrayal,anger and oh yes,a chariot race! Charlton Heston was first rate in this classic William Wyler movie. 212 minutes of classic cinema. After 50 years Ben Hur has stood as a monument to great movie making! Bravo! :)</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston of Ten Commandments fame) was raised up with his best Roman buddy Messala (Stephen Boyd). Little did they know at the time that they would grow up become adversaries, and as a result this would lead to may adventures. In the process Judah leads many different lives that parallels and crosses the life of Jesus.<br /><br />We see Judah in the mines, on the galleys, and even adopted by a roman Noble man as young Arrius. Mean time back at home his family is incarcerated by Messala leading to trials and tribulation that only Jesus can correct.<br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A lot of time and money went into this MGM production that netted 11 Academy Awards, along with many others such as BAFAT, David di Donatello, Directors Guild of America, Golden Globes, Laurel, Writers Guild of America, ...etc.<br /><br />You will be so intrigued that you may not notice the 212+ minutes depending on the version.<br /><br />One highlight, the chariot race was reproduced many times in various forms.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934648205">Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Definitely a great epic and one of my personal favorites, Ben Hur, brings to the screen such heavyweights as Charlton Heston and Jack Hawkins in a tale set during the times of the Roman Empire.  There are no words to describe this multiple (11) Oscar winning movie. The acting, the chariot races (!!!) and the costumes are all wonderful! It is simply amazing how a movie made in 1959 surpasses by far most movies that have been made in later years.  Ben Hur is about honor, bravery, and heroes from a time long gone.<br />Together with Spartacus, The 300 Spartans, Cleopatra, and the Fall of the Roman Empire, Ben Hur makes my list of Top 5 classics of all times.<br />A great marvel indeed!</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>As religious epics go, Ben-Hur is one of the best.  I mean, who can forget that chariot race!  Even by today's CGI standards, the shear epic quality of Ben-Hur leaves you breathless at times.  Of course, it's also a great story of redemption and faith; and one of the few instances in which Charlton Heston's performance is not utterly over the top.  Along with Heston's other great religious epic, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur is a must-have for any collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GB5CG77LGQRB.html">A2GB5CG77LGQRB</a><br/><p>Ben-Hur<p>Score: 95/100<p>If you haven't seen it, or at least not heard about it, where have you been for the past century? Ben-Hur is one of the most globally acclaimed films of our time, and it won a record-shattering 11 Oscar's! It's hard to fault this classic, and if you have not yet seen it, go and do so now and thank me later.<p>Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) lives as a rich Jewish prince and merchant in Jerusalem at the beginning of the 1st century. Together with the new governor his old friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) arrives as commanding officer of the Roman legions. At first they are happy to meet after a long time but their different politic views separate them. During the welcome parade a brick falls down from Judah's house and barely misses the governor. Although Messala knows that they are not guilty he sends Judah to the galleys and throws his mother and sister into prison. But Judah swears to come back and take revenge.<p>Ben-Hur is an endlessly indulgent and involving movie that gets more famous, more brilliant every time you watch it. There is not a fault in the acting: Charlton Heston pulls off a legendary turn as Ben-Hur, winning himself an Oscar, and Stephen Boyd captures the evil nature of his comedy and really makes you hate his character, but not his acting skill. William Wyler's focused direction and Karl Tunberg's script only make it more recommendable, while the thunderous score, delicious set design and breathtaking cinematography make this film non-stop entertaining until the exhilirating last acts.<p>Absorbing, excellent and cinematically brilliant, Ben-Hur is the masterpiece that has changed cinema history forever. It is quite simply one of the finest epic movies that has been bought to our screen.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>William Wyler's Oscar-winning BEN-HUR (1959), produced by Sam Zimbalist (who died of a heart attack near the end of filming) and based on a best-selling late 19th Century novel by Lew Wallace, is one hell of a movie experience.  Watching a brand-new, pristine camera negative copy, I could not believe that the opening Nativity scene and the Resurrection finale were the same movie.  There is just so much here.  This remake of the 1925 silent epic, runs 3 hours and 45 minutes, including powerful roadshow bookend music by Miklos Rozsa.  It takes its leisurely time in telling the story of a Jew (Charlton Heston) and a Roman (Stephen Boyd), raised as best friends, who become bitter enemies in the Holy Land of Jesus Christ's life.  Director Wyler was always known as a painstaking perfectionist who would exhaust cast and crew by doing take after take after take of every scene.  But the result for the audience is enthralling.<br /><br />Wyler had never made a Biblical epic before and wanted to work in every genre; his BEN-HUR is the one with a literate brain.  It is hard to believe it had major writing problems, multiple writers, and scenes written the night before they would be filmed.  It flows beautifully and is continually engrossing, despite its near four hour length.  The cast is impeccable, including Martha Scott, Cathy O'Donnell, Jack Hawkins, lovely Haya Harareet, and Oscar winner Hugh Griffith.<br /><br />If you are looking for the sea battle (directed by Andrew Marton), it is about 70 minutes into part one.  If you are seeking out the greatest chariot race in movie history (choreographed and directed by Yakima Canutt), it is about ten minutes after the intermission.  The Christ scenes are handled with taste and subtlety; we see only his back or his hand and never hear his voice.  In fact, non-Christians might have a difficult time understanding what is going on in those scenes with Jesus, including an impressive Sermon on the Mount near the movie's end.  The art direction and costumes are absolutely gorgeous, and Robert Surtees' use of ultra wide-screen Camera 65 is masterful.  Most of all, Miklos Rozsa contributes the music score of a lifetime.  Everyone won Oscars for their distinguished work.  No wonder this BEN-HUR won eleven Oscars the same year as SOME LIKE IT HOT, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and ANATOMY OF A MURDER.  It is a masterpiece.  The audio commentary, by scholar and author Gene Hatcher and Mr. Heston, is thoughtful and insightful.<br /><br />The 1925 silent version, starring Ramon Novarro as Ben-Hur and Francis X. Bushman as Messala, is on disk three of the new and magnificent  four disk set.  In some ways it is even more impressive than the remake.  Novarro and Bushman give performances of a lifetime, the 143 minute length is a good 75 minutes shorter than the 1959 version, the color tinting is very beautiful, the sea battle and chariot race are sensationally good by any standards, and the silent version has far more Jesus Christ scenes and in two-color Technicolor.  Carl Davis' orchestra score is outstanding, as always.<br /><br />The disk four bonuses include two major documentaries, one for the 1994 tape version and one brand-new for this 2005 DVD restoration.  We also get "BEN-HUR: A JOURNEY THROUGH PICTURES", several 1959 movie theatrical trailers, and a gallery of vintage newsreels heralding the arrival and covering the premiere of the lavish remake in 1959.  This $40 DVD set is a work of art and deserves a place in every library, even if it takes you a while to see all four disks of material.  Amazon.com has it for $30, not much more than the cost of a family of four going out to a new movie at night.  With both the 1925 and 1959 versions included in flawless prints, this DVD set gets my highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1URXSRV6WDHVY.html">A1URXSRV6WDHVY</a><br/><p>I WOULD GIVE THIS RELEASE 10 STARS if Amazon allowed me to!<br /><br />Ben-Hur is one of my all time favorite films.  It is probably the single greatest performance ever given by Charlton Heston and the greatest epic ever filmed until the Lord of the Rings trilogy came along but still it holds it's head high and remains a timeless classic, just as good as it ever was, maybe better today!<br /><br />Much has been written about the film itself, so my review will just cover the actual Blu Ray presentation and the included extras.<br /><br />Many sets have been released with much ballyhoo and assorted trinkets and swag included in the box. Much of it is useless stuff you look at once, then put away and never see again. This is NOT the case with the Ben-Hur boxed set. Everything you get in this box set is of high quality and compliments the film itself.  Speaking of the box itself, it is a very VERY nice embossed keepsake box that is protected by an outer covering and when opened reveals the film along with two books. The three included discs are housed in a nice glossy fold out container with full color high quality printed photographs both inside and outside. The presentation is gorgeous, a real head turner.<br /><br />You get the film, Ben-Hur spread over two BD 50GB discs for maximum quality and zero compression artifacts and presented in it's original aspect ratio of 2.76:1. This is basically the widest of the wide screen formats, filmed in luscious 70mm with 65mm used for picture information and the remaining 5% used for the original 6 track magnetic soundtrack.  Ben-Hur was painstakingly restored, in fact it took them so much time that the actual 50th Anniversary of Ben-Hur was missed by a few years in order to provide us with the BEST picture and sound possible. Yes, we have all heard those words before, but in this case it is REALLY true!<br /><br />I have owned Ben-Hur on VHS and then all the various DVD releases. It has always lacked in the video quality department and I am happy to say that is no longer the case. This Blu Ray release of Ben-Hur gives us Bold  and Crisp NATURAL color (NO TEAL tint anyway in sight), NO signs of DNR, NO signs of edge enhancement , beautifully lush and focused cinematography that may even perhaps afford the home theater enthusiast with a better visual presentation than most theater goers got back in 1959.<br /><br />It is a 1959 film to be sure, but is is ALSO reference quality in every sense of the word. This is what REAL film looks like, no digital enhanced crapola! This is a beautifully filmed epic and the Blu Ray transfer faithfully represents the finished product from 1959, looking more like something filmed recently. The investment in both money and time by Warner Home Video was well worth it, showing all of us what Blu Ray releases COULD look like, if the proper care was shown prepping and transferring the original film elements.<br /><br />The time and money spent on restoring and rescanning Ben-Hur is obvious from the very beginning of the film. The resulting transfer is a singular achievement in home video entertainment. I have only a few negatives to mention, namely a few places that exhibit 'jump cuts' where a very small number of frames in a scene are missing or were damaged beyond repair and needed to be discarded to keep from spoiling the mostly pristine look of the rest of the film. At one point during the start of the big race I noticed a few white blips or print tear marks and an actual hair on the left side of the screen. I thought I imagined it so I went back and watched in slow motion. Yeah, they were there alright, but they were gone very quickly, never to return.  Luckily the audio does NOT suffer in these instances and there are very few OF them. This is NOT a transfer that in any way requires an apology (such as The Godfather, pt.1) or needs to be prefaced by saying "It looks good for the films age".  This IS a classic film from the tail end of Hollywood's Golden age, and as such has the look of a classic film. The color timing and lighting choices, the types of special effects used (no CGI back then) and the sometimes very noticeable dialogue looping are all byproducts of the way films were made then.  I guess what I am trying to say is this is NOT 100% perfect, but then again, no film is or ever was.  The only way Ben-Hur could look any better is to print this new scan at it's full resolution and then project it the old fashioned way.<br /><br />Even with a few missing frames I easily give Ben-Hur on Blu Ray 10 stars for the video quality alone!!!!<br />As a nice bonus this disc is NOT Java encumbered and as such your 'disc resume' feature WILL work, which is a boon for a title of this length if you can't sit still for the entire run time and need a few breaks.<br /><br />The audio is pretty much just as great as the picture. Presented in DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 , this might be the very best Ben-Hur has EVER sounded, then or now. Nothing gimmicky about the surrounds, the dialogue is perfectly rendered, no clicks, pops or blatant flaws, no screechy sounding music. During the big race the crowd sound effects coming from my rear surrounds were distorted a bit. This might have been how they were originally recorded but as the race progresses some elements of the audio mix suffer a bit, the louder things get, the more certain sounds break up. It isn't my system, I can blast the LOTR trilogy with no ill effects. You need a good ear and decent speakers to notice this, but for those that are picky I will admit that it is there.<br /><br />Also, for those with 'Golden Ears' you WILL hear the occasional hiss that the digital noise reduction didn't get rid of and you will also hear a bit of low frequency hum and rumble at times which sounds mechanical in nature to me but it is on the track and on the disc.  Most people will never notice it, but I tend to watch and listen with critical eyes and ears the first time around. All in all it is simply a stunning job of remixing and remastering the original magnetic sound elements.  Put this together with almost perfectly restored picture quality and you have an epic presentation of an epic film.  The good far outweighs the bad in regards to the sound.<br /><br />The Bonus features are superlative.  A keepsake quality book of glossy production photographs, an exact reproduction of Charlton Heston's personal production diary, two full length documentaries, screen tests, original movie trailers, a wonderful 'Music Only' track that highlights Miklos Rozsa's beautiful Oscar wining score , Newsreel footage and even Oscar Highlights from 1960 when Ben-Hur swept the awards with a record 11 Oscars, not topped EVER and not equaled until Titanic and then Lord of the Rings. Add to all this the original Silent version of Ben-Hur from 1925 and you have enough bonus features to fill all the chariots in the big race.<br /><br />This Ben-Hur Boxed set totally exceeded any and all my highest expectations.  The best presentation imaginable for one of the best films ever made. Ben-Hur (50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition) is a MUST OWN for all classic film lovers and fans of Charlton Heston.  I think it is THE BEST Blu Ray release of this year, easily outshining Star Wars and even the LOTR trilogy.  I cannot recommend it highly enough!<br /><br />WORD OF WARNING!!(contains spoilers)----  Make sure you hit the STOP button on your Blu Ray player IMMEDIATELY following the "The End" title card , otherwise you will be inexplicably treated to a censors approval screen from India and then directly into the FBI threatening to put you in prison if you bootleg or share your discs. It REALLY spoiled the mood I was in after such a wonderful movie and just a beautiful ending.  Judah Ben-Hur has his Mother and Sister back and Leprosy free, he got the girl, Masala was ripped apart and Judah Ben-Hur has just been converted to Christianity by Jesus (In Person!!),  The music swells to a crescendo and it says "The End" ..  Great! Then less than 10 seconds later you get this other weird stuff and I can't for the life of me figure out how this got past the disc authoring stage and onto my disc! GRRR!

Brimming with amazing performances, dazzling set pieces, and an incredibly well written storyline, "Ben-Hur" has stood the test of time to become a defining moment in cinema.<br /><br />Most reviewers have gone over the plot in great detail, so I will skip over that. I will say that Charlton Heston, one of the legends of filmdom, has never been better than in his role as Judah Ben-Hur. Great actors like Paul Newman, Burt Lancaster and Rock Hudson were all offered a chance to play this character, and while all of them would've no doubt done a fine job, no one could possibly beat Heston in the part. He plays it an unforgettable and one a kind manner that's very difficult to put into words. The supporting cast is top notch, specifically Stephen Boyd, who as Messala creates an unforgettable amount of tension between him and Heston. Both Heston & Boyd received Oscars (this film won 11 out of 12 nominations), and deservedly so.<br /><br />The directing by Wyler is incredible, especially the chariot race, which is one of a kind and one of the best scenes in the history of the movies. If made today, that sequence would've been entirely done in CGI, and while it would've looked cool no doubt, it wouldn't hold the same excitement, danger, substance and believability that it does with real actors.<br /><br />I love that Jesus's face is never actually shown throughout the movie. It makes his presence in the movie all the more real and emotional. The crucifixion sequence at the end is heartwrenching to watch. The actor who played Jesus was an opera singer named Claude Heater (this was the only movie he ever did), and he's simply amazing.<br /><br />What's so great about "Ben-Hur" is that despite the religious themes spread throughout the plot, you don't need to be religious at all to enjoy it (I myself am a Catholic who is firm in my belief in God). I know atheists who told me how great they thought "Ben-Hur" was. It goes to show just how great and how powerful this movie truly is.<br /><br />The special features on this dvd are great (though I still need to update to the four disc edition), as is the sound and picture quality. This is a motion picture that truly belongs in everyone's dvd collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>The 1959 adaptation of Lew Wallace's famous novel is the pinnacle of filming achiement: rightfully winning 11 Academy Awards for, among other things, its spectacular sets, brilliant acting, great direction, and beautiful score.<br /><br />Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a respected merchant in Judea whose people are under the yoke of Roman rule.  He soon breaks ties with his life-long Roman friend Messala (Stephen Boyd)after his family and livelihood fall victim to Roman injustice.  Condemened as a traitor to serve in the galleys under the command of Quintus Arius (Jack Hawkins), Judah Ben Hur keeps faith in his Lord and vows revenge against Messala.  Our hero is soon taken to fight Macedonian pirates and to impress the crowds in Rome's Circus Maximus.  Finally free, he returns to Judea to exact his revenge.  His woes and hatred go unabatated until the Resurrection.<br /><br />The film's theme is similar to Job's story in The Old Testament.  A devout man's faith is tested by God's taking away of all that makes him human: his family, his wealth, his sense of self.  All that remains to test in him is his faith. God will not stop plaguing Judah with woes until he's convinced of his undying faith.  The story is epic and well adapted as a film with one of Miklos Rosza's most memorable musical scores.  Although the film is rather heavy handed with its evangelical theme (Jesus scenes with choir intruductions, divine miracles, the resurrection, salvation etc.) that's the theme of the book as intended by its author and is therefore unavoidable. Despite the often overpowering biblical theme: I find the the story to be a moving epic regardless.  My favorite part is when Quintus Arius descends in to the rowers' benches in the Roman Galleys and exclaims:<br /><br />"...that's good, hate keeps a man alive: it gives him strength!  Now listen to me all of you! You are all condemned men whose purpose is to serve this ship, should you fail you will sink with this ship chained to your oar: row well and live!"<br /><br />Although his muscular anglo-saxon build hardly met the physical requirements for the role, Charlton Heston's persona as Ben Hur brings a commanding figure and presence to the story.  His acting style is consistent with the other loin-cloth characters he played in other films before and after (i.e. Moses in 'The Ten Commandments' and Taylor in 'Planet of the Apes'.)  Jack Hawkins (Bridge on the River Kwai; Zulu) as Quintus Arius also brings a commanding presence with his theatrical background as the cynical consul.  Stephen Boyd as Messala plays one of the most memorable roles especially in the part where he affirms his hatred of Judah at the end of the chariot race: one of the most memorable performances in Hollywood history.  The worst performance in the film is without a doubt that of Haya Harareet as Esther: utterly unattractive and barely proficient in English, her vapid expressions and forced acting undermined the intensity of every scene she appeared in.  Being Palestinian,  the main reason for her casting in the role was most likely political instead of being based on any standard of competence: done so to demonstrate a spirit of cooperation between the Israeli government and Palestinian authorities at the time.<br /><br />This is truly one of the greatest films ever made.  Director William Wyler did an outstanding job with this staggering film production.  The 20+ minute chariot race was a real event and it's still to this day an unprecedented spectacle in film: it involved no CGIs or studio shots of an actor riding a fake chariot with a moving backdrop.  Even for those who, like myself, don't care much for the evangelical themes that mark this story, this film presents a moving epic on injustice and a man's spiritual triumphs for which one doesn't need to be a devout Christian to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Absolutely one of the best films ever made with one of the best action sequences (the chariot race) in film history. Ben Hur is betrayed throughout the film by his supposed best friend and overcomes all odds to regain his humanity and with the help of Jesus, save his sister and mother. <p>Along with The Ten Commandments, this is what made Heston a household name!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Since my birth in 1951 I have seen probably at least a thousand movies. This one is the best. If I was told I could only have one movie to take with me on a desert island, in space, etc. this would have to be it. As so many people have said it's the compilation of so many things that make it outstanding. The acting is super. No doubt in my mind this was Hestons best work. The effects have aged well. I dare anyone to find fault with a chariot race or a sea battle for that matter that even today make us believe they could have been filmed as they occured in ancient Roman times. Althouth I love the music from Gladiator, Star Wars, and others I still think that more emotions are touched by Ben Hur's musical score. I have to assume we are telling you kids to see this because any adult that has not seen it and loved it had to be on an island with no TVs for about 40 years.</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>This Heston classic never looked and sounded better! The DVD version also includes some rare footage screen test with Leslie Nielson as Masala! Ben Hur is a great film. Like its counterpart TEN COMMANDMENTS(which I actually like better), Ben Hur is hollywood splendor in use of sets, special effects, and cast of a thousands(LITERALLY!) Hopefully, a new generation will experience Ben Hur due to the success of GLADIATOR.  Ben Hur is not just a tale of the Christ. This is a story of one's loyalty tested in tumultous times. The story of Hur and Masala take place during the time of Christ, and that is what makes the film so powerful. While the Roman Empire is at its height, and the conquered Judea is made to be colonial subjects of this empire all the while Christ is walking the earth and &quot;doing his work....&quot;  Soundtrack by Miklos Roza works well on DVD version, and they did leave in the Overture and En'tracte. The old VHS version and some tv versions used to letterbox only the chariot race sequence. I will admit that at times film can be somewhat poky and pretentious, but why carp? This is a brilliant picture with all the epic splendor of a Cecil B. Demille masterpiece(even though he had nothing to do with this !!)I highly recommend this dvd version as it adds to excitement and power to an already incredible piece of cinema(WINNER OF 11 well deserved OSCARS).</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; tells many stories which weave into one another to create the most gorgeous Biblical epic of our time, vividly retelling the story of the time in which Christ lived and died. These events are seen through the eyes of Judah Ben-Hur, the title character whose interaction with the unrest and confusion of these times becomes a sumptuous and highly emotional human drama from which I was unable to hold back tears. The movie's grand scale and moving storytelling, under the superb direction of William Wyler, are just the icing on this multi-faceted an breathtaking view of the time of Jesus. <p>Our main character, Judah Ben-Hur, is deeply unsettled by the intent of the Romans to take over the small town of Judea and convert its Jewish citizens into Roman citizens, which would mean their swearing of allegiance and worship to the Emporer of Rome. His unrest is further complicated by his friendship with the tribune of the Roman Army, Messala, whom he has known since childhood. Messala hopes he can rely on Judah's support, and that his friend's influence will make for an easier transition, while the armies of the Roman empire begin filling up the city. <p>Through sheer fate, an accident involving Judah and the new governor lands he and his family, his mother Mirriam and sister Tirzah, in the Roman prison, where Messala, who was earlier spurned by Judah in his request for support, sentences Judah to the galleys, with fates unknown for his family. Judah is forced to leave behind his family, his home, and a budding romance with his former servant Hester, with whom he visited before his arrest. His experiences in the galleys will lead him to become the adopted son of a council, a formidable rival against his nemesis in a grueling chariot race, and a strong and bold man whose devotion to his family and his love for Esther will drive him to survive any situation. <p>The fictional aspect of this story is set against the life of Christ, which begins the movie in a glorious opening depicting His birth. We are given a small glimpse of the Three Wisemen, who will appear later in the film to interact with Judah in his return to Judea. Judah will also come to see Christ face-to-face on numerous occasions, providing us a small glimpse of the power He held over people and the good deeds he gave unto them. On a small side note, I particularly liked the way in which Christ's is never seen, adding an air of mystery to a man whose life is enshrouded in it. <p>The history and the fiction never outweigh one another, but instead have a special way of working with one another so that we become enamored by both. Judah's experiences with Christ will further lead to his will to survive, and his segue from hardened feelings of hatred for his enemies to love for all those around him. The inevitable crucifiction, which comes in the last half hour, is a mesmerizing experience which will show the death of Christ as well as the cleansing of the world's impurities through the healing of Judah's mother and sister, who were stricken with leprocy while in prison. And the Roman empire is seen a magnificent light, especially once Judah is accepted into their circles when he saves the council's life. <p>Human depth and emotion is also very important to this epic, and it achieves this aspect in every way possible. The relationship between Judah and his family is intensified by his fight to survive in hopes that he might, one day, be able to free them again. Once stricken with the shamed disease, the two women decide never to see him again, allowing him to think them dead. Their decision is utterly gutwrenching, so don't try holding back tears. The romance between Judah and Esther shows not only their love but their hardships and troubles, which makes it all the more convincing and enticing to watch. The interaction between Judah and Messala is intense and provides much of the movie's conflicts, and we must question why Messala would do such things to an old friend. We can relate to these characters on many levels, which allows us to identify with the movie itself. <p>Director William Wyler sought out to make an epic out of this story, and his success in achieving this goal is spectacular and marvelous to look at. The movie's 300 grand and ominous set designs contribute to the vast and perplexing beauty of this period in time, while luxurious costumes, which were reported to be in excess of over 100,000 outfits for 8,000 extras, are meticulous and exact in detail and authenticity. The need for action is also present, which is met with a splendid sequence aboard a Roman sea vessel, which leads to a water battle, and the ever-popular chariot race which set a new standard in movie special effects in its day. To this day, this scene is intense and overflows with suspense, even when watched more than once. Music is also important, overflowing with sadness and uplifting chords which all sweep us into the movie's high-level emotion. <p>The cast is extremely likeable and easy on the eyes, while giving us performances that breach the limits of human depth. Charlton Heston, who played Moses in another Biblical epic, really outdoes himself here with this role, bringing out all of Judah Ben-Hur's emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. Here is a very complex character whose interactions with his surroundings change his life in new and unforeseen ways, perhaps the most complex movie character in history. His nemesis, Messala, is played masterfully by Stephen Boyd, who makes Messala a perfectly crafty, pompous and deceptive enemy to match Judah. Esther is portrayed by Haya Harareet, who is subtly enticing, allowing her deep wisdom and powerful insight into Judah's actions and mind to shine through her intense physical beauty. Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell are Mirriam and Tirzah, on whom a major portion of the emotional depth relies on. Their performances are extremely moving and deep, as is the rest of this fabulous ensemble cast. <p>Being one of the most incredible epics ever put to the screen, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; defies all the obstacles and comes out unflawed. The story has everything going for it, and it meets all its goals through its dramatic storytelling, its powerhouse performances and epic scale and grandeur. I love movies like this, which continue to impress after multiple viewings, while also reaching for the heart and giving it a nice emotional tug. Judah is a hero for the ages, embodying everything we want in a character whose survival we wish for.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>For those like me who like this film but not to the extent of getting the full-blown collectors' version we get here a truly stripped-down but mostly satisfying version of one of the great epic films.  No expense was spared in what would probably cost a fraction to produce what with CGI today but clearly was a tremendous undertaking in 1959.  There are many memorable scenes here such as the battle at sea and the chariot race but also the less exciting tender scenes among Ben-Hur and his family showcase just how good the quality of the cast is.  For a 53-year old film the 1080p transfer represents the best picture transfer of the film to date; while certainly not reference quality it is still a worthy effort for the most part.  The sound quality though is more impressive with an excellent job done in this DTS-HD MA transfer which ranks among the best I've ever heard and comes closer to reference quality for Blu-ray.<br /><br />As this is a stripped-down version the special features aren't that special with just trailers, a music-only track and a commentary the only items on offer here.  Still for me personally I am satisfied with the film in a lower-cost version without the frills.<br /><br />Good picture quality, great sound quality and a great epic movie makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1XN6MBYDBTX16.html">A1XN6MBYDBTX16</a><br/><p>I really love this film.

It's a very moving film.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I am reviewing the UK version of this:  Ben-Hur - Ultimate Collector's Edition [1959] [Blu-ray][Region Free] (3-disc set).<br /><br />The video quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent.  I give it a 9.98 on a 10.0 scale.  It looks perfect, except for some very, very fine grain that is barely noticeable in some scenes (mostly the sky).  I sit about 7 feet away from a 52" LCD, and I could hardly even see it.  You can pretty much say that there is no grain in this Blu-Ray movie.  Colors are fantastic.  Sometimes faces seemed a little soft.  But I am being very picky with these criticisms.  Blacks are black, without grain, and without any distortion.  This is the best video quality I've ever seen in an older movie, and I cannot remember any newer movie looking better.<br /><br />Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is adequate at most times, very good during a few instances.  Mostly there is no surround sound, but when you hear it, it is subtle.  Except at the end, when surround sound is strong.  There could have been more surround sound during the chariot race.<br /><br />Aspect ratio is wider than the usual 2.35:1.  I think it is listed as 2.76:1, but it looked more like 2.5:1 to me.<br /><br />This is a very long movie, on two discs.  The movie lasts 2 hours and 22 minutes on the first disc, and an hour and 20 minutes on the second disc, for a total of 222 minutes (3 hours and 42 minutes).  The first disc ends with an intermission.  At the beginning there is an Overture that last for several minutes.  There are no credits at the end.<br /><br />I did not look at the special features on the third disc.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is nothing short of a spectacular deal:  with the images newly crisp, beautiful sound, and plenty of extras, I think this is the best bluray that I have ever purchased.<br /><br />I have nothing to add about the quality of the film's theme and plot.  You identify with Ben-Hur as he goes through an extraordinary journey, both physical and spiritual; it is so emotionally real that I must struggle to keep from weeping every single time I see it.  There is action, big ideas, and psychological and spiritual growth.  No other film does this for me - I am an atheist, or a non-believing christian, if you will.<br /><br />SO far as the film print version goes, I think it is the best available.  The transfer is better than all previous versions.  The extras are fun, in particular the complete 1925 silent version that has many basic differences from the 1959 version, e.g. Simonides, Ben-Hur's loyal slave, is afraid to recognize him in the earlier version, as it will enslave his daughter Esther.  While I tire of the self-congratulatory documentaries, which are softball papp of the genre, "oh, everyone was so wonderful and talented", but there is interesting info in them as well.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  Interestingly, I got the British version, which was the equivalent of $15. (With 3 disks, I am not certain that this one has all the things that the American version does, but it has commentaries, music only tracks, outtakes, etc.  The essential, of course, is the film.  It is region 2, I believe.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ.html">A1V3PCKVCJ3TTZ</a><br/><p>If you enjoy the movie and the story, you must own this version.

MGM and company unintentionally created a work of popular art that could only be fully appreciated in its original, pristine print, 70mm, super widescreen glory. It is no longer possible to make a film like Ben-Hur. Oh, George Lucas tries with all his computerized graphics, but this is a REAL spectacle, not some virtual one. 8,000 extras, tens of thousands of costumes, a $15 million budget (in the 1950's!), massive sets depict the power of Rome on the grandest possible scale. It took six years to complete production. Yet, its focus remains sharply on the detail, the private human experience of it all. The story doesn't get lost in the enormous vision of the work.<br /><br />Ben-Hur is a drama at its best. It's the story of a family that had it all, was destroyed and then given their lives back. Ben Hur depicts both the best and worst of the Roman Empire, its glory and progress and the oppression of the less fortunate who lived under its rule.<br /><br />There are two action scenes that really get my heart pounding each time this. First, the scene on the galley where the slaves are put through a grueling, forced rowing of their ship under the eye of General Quintus Arrius. The way that scene builds with the alternating of the camera from the slaves to the drums to the general, all the while picking up the pace, is quite riveting. Second, the chariot race. Some of the best action ever produced by Hollywood. The race itself keeps people on the edge of their seats. It appears to have been put together close to real time, which makes it all the greater.<br /><br />Although the movie slows down after the race I am still moved by what happens later. The movie follows up with how Judah dealt with the festering anger inside him and what happens to his mother and sister. His love, Esther, helps the family and tries to console Judah. I really like the character of Esther that is portrayed.<br /><br />Most of all, the greatest character of all in this movie is that of Christ. In Christ we see someone suffering without the hatred and vengeance that is so shown by Judah. A favorite scene of mine is when Christ gives Judah water to drink. The Roman commander orders him to stop. Jesus looks at him and the soldier is speechless. That says it all.<br /><br />Charlton Heston has said that this movie could not be made today because of the prohibitive budget that would be required.  Heston gives a sensitive and intelligent performance, as does most of the supporting cast. Ben-Hur's 11 Oscar nominations has been equaled by very few films. There have been similar efforts in the past (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNESNA">The Ten Commandments (50th Anniversary Collection)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BZISSU">Cleopatra</a>, etc.) but nothing matches the dramatic intimacy balanced with the epic extravagance of Ben-Hur. Truly a film in a class by itself and an actor that will be miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This is a spectacular edition of 2 of the greatest epics that Hollywood produced.  They can serve as a reminder that not everything Hollywood put out was garbage, and that remakes can be better if they can improve on the original.  The 1925 version is spectacular enough, costing an unprecedented 4 million at the time, and while not as good as the 1959 version, it's worth seeing and it's one of the best examples of silent film.  The 1959 version is brilliant.  Despite the film being almost 4 hours, it is never boring, even after the chariot race (contrary to rumour, the film doesn't end with the chariot race).  The narrative arc of the story is so well done that it more than keeps your interest.  Charlton Heston won an Oscar for his excellent performance, and Stephen Boyd and Jack Hawkins are superlative as well.  The chariot race is amazing to watch.  It goes on for quite some time, and there is not one word of dialogue spoken throughout it.  Today, Heston and Boyd would be makin' snarky wisecracks at each other, and it would all be CGI.  Knowing that the chariots, horses, racetrack, and actors are all real, makes this sequence even more gripping.  Word to current filmmakers.  The 1959 version of Ben-Hur is why you should remake something.  First, the new version is in colour, it has sound, and it's shot in widescreen.  These are great improvements over the 1925 version.  There was a real valid reason to remake it (screw that "reimagning" rubbish), instead of a bald faced attempt to make money.  Cecil B. DeMille was originally scheduled to direct this, but died before any pre-production work started.  It was taken over by William Wyler, one of Hollywood's neglected directors.  This film was shot in 2.75:1, the widest aspect ratio ever used.  Only a handful of films were shot that way (The Greatest Story Ever Told was a notable one).  It's truly spectacular, one of those brilliant epics that the old studio system cranked out quite prolifically.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>If you're a film fan, like me, you already own a DVD of the 1959 "Ben-Hur", with additional features, and you may, initially, be reluctant to shell out for the new four-disc set. But this is as close to an 'ultimate' edition as we'll ever see, and the MANY 'extras' it offers makes this THE copy to keep!<br /><br />Among the many exciting bonuses:<br /><br />A newly-restored print, with a 'Music Only' track, allowing you to savor one of Miklos Rozsa's greatest scores...<br /><br />The long-awaited DVD release of MGM's 1925 silent version of "Ben-Hur", with Ramon Novarro in the lead, and beefy Francis X. Bushman as Messala. Arguably the greatest silent film of the 20s (it established MGM as the premier movie studio), it holds its own VERY well against the sound version, with a terrific sea battle and chariot race, two-strip Technicolor in key scenes, and a fabulous 'new' score, composed by Carl Davis. If you've never seen it, you're in for a real treat!<br /><br />PLUS...<br /><br />"Ben-Hur: A Journey Through Pictures", which uses preproduction storyboards and sketches to show the metamorphosis of the film from concept to reality. Peter Jackson's "Rings" trilogy 'Bonus Features' really pioneered this concept, but the new "Ben-Hur" edition has taken it to a whole new level, and it shouldn't be missed...<br /><br />Not one, but TWO documentaries on the making of the epic; the excellent 1994 Christopher Plummer-narrated piece (which was included in the previous "Ben-Hur" release), plus a brand-new documentary, offering insights by modern directors, cinematographers, and other production people on how the film influenced their work; George Lucas (who tends to be a bit dry) acknowledged that the "Ben-Hur" chariot race did influence the pod race in "Star Wars I", and Ridley Scott admitted he watched "Fall of the Roman Empire" and "Ben-Hur" for inspiration, prior to making "Gladiator"...One of the contributors is Charlton Heston's son, Frasier, a gifted filmmaker himself, who offers his own memories of the 'shoot'.<br /><br />A very enjoyable documentary on the life and career of William Wyler, from 1984, full of home movies, 'behind-the-scene' photos and his last interview before his death...<br /><br />AND all the extras from the previous release, including trailers, newsreels, screen tests (Leslie Nielson, so serious, is fascinating!), costume and make-up tests, and other goodies.<br /><br />Finally, commentary by Gene Hatcher, film historian, and scene-specific comments by Charlton Heston, himself...while this 'extra' isn't 'new', Heston's failing health gives his words, recorded for the last "Ben-Hur" edition, a bittersweet quality...When he passes, an era will truly be gone forever...<br /><br />See why THIS is the DVD edition to own?</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>This is one of the great "big" movies from film history.  A wonderful story about a Judean man named Ben Hur who ends up being accused of plotting against the Romans and comes out on top only to be a witness to the crucifixion of Christ.  Not overly religious nor secular, gets the tone right so it can be enjoyed by everyone.  This version topped the original and the chariot race is a major highlight of the film  Charelton Heston is Ben Hur and plays it straight.  That's Ok, the film needed a guy like him.  Wonderful movie.  Even better in the movie theatre.</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>BEN-HUR isn't really a film about Jesus, or rather it's a film in which Jesus is the main character, but he's never seen except in partial glimpses, never heard. Rather he is the character around whom the life and fortunes of the Jewish prince, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) revolves, though he doesn't know it until quite late in the film.<br /><br />I haven't read the 1880 novel by General Lew Wallace, and I hadn't seen either the 1907 1-reeler or the 1925 Fred Niblo version, also a long and expensive epic, before re-watching this recently. But William Wyler's film is fascinating to me in part because of this absence of Jesus - and the absence of religion from much of Ben Hur's life in the film, though not from his thoughts. The basic story is really quite simple: Ben Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to Judeah after years in Rome, now a tribune and second in command to the military governor or prefect. Though the two seem overjoyed to see each other we quickly learn that Messala both have ulterior motives in renewing their friendship - Messala to help crush opposition through Ben Hur's help, and the Jewish prince to accomplish the exact opposite. This is not a friendship made to last. In short order, Ben Hur is accused of a crime he didn't commit and sent to the galleys; after years of rowing in chains, he saves the life of a Roman consul during a naval battle, for which he is freed and eventually becomes the consul's adoptive son, all the while earning a name for himself as the greatest charioteer in Rome. But his heart belongs to his homeland, and as quickly as he can he returns to take vengeance on Messala, who has also imprisoned his mother and daughter. Messala, also a great chariot driver, will eventually face him in the justly famed chariot race where no rules apply and each man plans to seek the other's death. This 9-minute action sequence really is as thrilling as I remembered it from years ago and is deserving of all the praise it gets; it has a "real time" you-are-there feel to it that I've never seen in any other historical epic.<br /><br />But in the background is always the young rabbi, roughly the same age as Ben Hur, who gave the then-slave a drink of water as he was about to be shipped off to the galleys, and who the now-freed son of both Rome and Judeah feels compelled to offer the same favor as the Crucifixion draws nigh. Jesus appears in long-shot or in partial view for perhaps 5-10 minutes out of the 3 1/2 hour running time here, but his presence lingers throughout; the biggest problem I had with the film, in fact, was in the last half hour as the rather cheesy-looking scene on Cavalry translates is intercut with the healing of Ben Hur's now-leprous mother and sister and his own conversion - it all seems to obvious and simplistic; but I guess that for a believer it must work. Too, it seems that Ben Hur is able to have his cake and eat it too: achieving his vengeance, getting his fortune and family back, finding the love of the onetime slave girl who had been promised to another. Sure, he suffered, but at the end his worldly happiness seems more obvious than any spiritual redemption.<br /><br />This isn't a huge flaw for me, however, as I realize how difficult such a dramatization is, and in particular when filmed by believing Jews and Christians and intended for an audience that had not yet tired of such simple homilies and the grand scale that the film does, at least, still impress with. The acting is all pretty much what one expects in such a thing - lots of declamations and stagy, overly dramatic glances, hands thrown up at the site of lepers, etc. The photography is quite beautiful if completely unrealistic - this never really looks like the holy land, never really even looks like the real world, with a lot of dreamy overlit closeups, deep shadows when deemed dramatically necessary, interior lighting that is sometimes indistinguishable from exteriors -- none of it matters really, if you accept that this is "big scale Hollywood Biblical melodrama" and look at it in terms of its success as a genre piece. I like a lot of the actors in smaller roles, particularly Frank Thring as a somewhat sympathetic, realistic Pontius Pilate whose words of wisdom Ben Hur rejects in one of the best scenes in a film that is really dominated by intimate character interludes despite its reputation for spectacle.<br /><br />On the whole, it works for me, Wyler is a fluid enough storyteller to keep things moving despite the immense length and the extremely wide format is rarely a distraction, if rarely necessary either. It's easy to see why this was such an immense hit, earning the equivalent of over $700 million today theatrically; it's also to see why it marked the peak of the genre and why it all went downhill rather quickly, as it was such a grueling production that few filmmakers would want to tackle such a thing again even with the potential of very large returns. By 1966 or so (John Huston's THE BIBLE) the genre was effectively dead, at least on such a large scale.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Yes, this movie was made forty-plus years ago, so it contains an uncomfortable amount of silly overacting so prevalent in dramatic films of that period.  Yes, the film is rife with stereotypical depictions of Romans, Jews, and Arabs, and offers a very sanitized version of a leper colony.  And yes, the movie has a religious theme, which makes it almost unworthy in today's politically correct culture.  Despite all of the above, director William Wyler gave the world an engrossing, beautiful film, complete with stunning cinematography, a compelling story, moving musical score, and perhaps the most famous racing scene in the history of moviemaking.<p>I first saw BEN-HUR as a young boy at a theater; I was captivated throughout the three hours, thoroughly entertained and in awe of the majesty on the big screen.  The film instantly became one of my favorites, and remains so to this day.  Few things do I enjoy more than watching a beautifully crafted, well made movie, and my appreciation certainly was not unique, as the film won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1959.<p>The story is familiar to us all:  Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a young nobleman from a prominent Jewish family reunited with his childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who returns to Judea as a Roman tribune.  There is genuine warmth and friendship between the two men, yet the clash of their cultures drives a wedge between them--a wedge that becomes a chasm as Messala banishes Judah to the slave galleys and sends his mother and his sister to prison.  Thus Judah's life becomes a quest:  a quest to survive, a quest for vengeance.  Judah survives the galleys to become the adopted son of a Roman general (Jack Hawkins), and his triumphant return to Judea permits him to challenge and subsequently confront Messala in a chariot race--a breathtaking sequence of spellbinding, unforgettable scenes. <p>And although Judah's heart is twisted with anger, BEN-HUR is also the story of love, redemption, foregiveness--all depicted under the shadow of the crucifixion of Christ.  And in the aftermath of the crucifixion we witness a miracle, a wondrous event that makes this movie so compelling.  <p>A sweeping, extraordinary epic, BEN-HUR is highly recommended and well worth three hours of anyone's time.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Ben-Hur is one of those sword and sandal epics that, like The Ten Commandments or Spartacus, is a good film, well acted, well directed, but ultimately, is just a good excuse to eat junk food, for there's nothing of any real depth to it. In many ways, it is sort of Part Two of Charlton Heston's three part `religious epic', which started with The Ten Commandments and ended with El Cid (a bit better of a film than the two others).  The difference is that this is the least religious of the trio, despite its subtitle being A Story Of The Christ.<br /><br />  The film has a few standout scenes, excluding the justly famed chariot sequence (which includes the accidental flip of Hur over the chariot- done by a stuntman, of course), including the two exchanges of water between Christ and Hur, and the dialogue between Hur and Arrius, before their connection is formed, wherein both men counter-taunt each other with words; Heston seeming to make a career over ironic taunts, which would reach its apogee in The Planet Of The Apes. But, mostly, Ben-Hur is good old fashioned moviemaking; an epic that has few weaknesses and a number of strengths, even if it is barren of anything of depth. Believe me, there are many worse ways to spend an afternoon than watching Charlton Heston kick ass on the past.</p></br><a href="../users/A82R4WKX62LEK.html">A82R4WKX62LEK</a><br/><p>WATCH IT.

IT COULD BE THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE.</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>From the opening act to the surprising and stunning chariot race at the climax, it was as if I were reading a book that I simply could not put down! The characters were extremely well-developed, and their interactions were intensely emotional.<br /><br />Charlton Heston plays the title character, Judah Ben-Hur, a rich Jewish Prince living in Jerusalem. He's best friends with Messala (Stephen Boyd), who becomes the new governor and commander of the Roman Legion. Messala, tries to persuade Judah to thwart any Jewish uprisings in Judea and fearing that he is a conspirator toward Rome, he sends Ben-Hur to a slave ship where he is forced to row with the slaves and imprisons his mother (Martha Scott) and sister (Cathy O'Donnell . After enduring years of pain and punishment, Ben is freed by Roman General Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) for saving his life at sea, becomes his chariot racer and surrogate son, and is later freed to do what he will. Ben tracks down Messala and threatens to beat the crap out of him if he doesn't release his family and if they're dead, then he's as good as gone also.<br /><br />His girlfriend finds out that his mom and sister have the plague, lies to Judah and tells him that they're dead so Judah becomes enraged and does the only thing an angry man can do: he destroys his friend- turned arch foe in the grand Chariot Race.<br /><br />Stephen Boyd's black-hearted Messala made for an interesting character and Jack Hawkins was brilliant as Judah's slave master turned savior.<br /><br />This movie won the awards for Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), Art-Direction, Cinematography, Costume Design, Special Effects, Editing, Score, and Sound. It only lost the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>There are many things to like about BEN HUR.  I agree with other reviewers when they say that it is, by far, the best biblical epic of its time.  The story of Judah Ben Hur is an engaging one and it has been duplicated in several films since: one can see the influence it has had on films such as GLADIATOR, SPARTACUS, and even the Sondheim musical SWEENEY TODD.  It is the tale of a man betrayed by his friend, banished from his homeland, only to return a prince.<br /><br />Despite its deserved accomplishments, I was not completely enthralled with BEN HUR.  For one thing, it is too long.  Now, I am not against watching a four hour movie (in principle).  But I am against redundancy and unnecessary length.  After watching BEN HUR for an hour, I felt as if the plot had only advanced fifteen minutes or so.  It is a testament to the film that it manages to stay engaging throughout most of its length.  But regardless of its interest, I found that several of the scenes could have been drastically shortened.  For example, there is a terribly long scene in which the ship (Ben Hur is imprisoned as a rower) is forced to "go through the paces" so that the commander can test the mettle of Hur and his companions.  The scene takes several minutes as the commander slowly increases the pace of the rowing.  On the one hand, watching the entire scene allows you to see the full measure of the men, but the same point could have been communicated in a single minute.<br /><br />Secondly, I also felt that the "Christ" story is tacked on.  Of course, the role of Jesus in Ben Hur's life is important because Jesus gives him water (and with it hope) and because it is Jesus' Passion that finally allows Ben Hur to put his hatred behind him and seek life instead of death.  Yet, despite this importance, the film drags on in its final hour.  After the breathtaking chariot sequence, the film should (for all intensive purposes) be over.  But, instead, it drags on for about an hour and the film decides to narrate much of the Passion sequence (something that could have been its own movie).  Once again, I feel that Ben Hur's redemption could have been communicated in a much more efficient manner, instead of reconstructing a forty five minute "Christ" sequence.<br /><br />But let us not focus on the bad.  I mentioned the "chariot" sequence before and everyone else does as well.  All I can say is: there's a reason.  The chariot sequence was magnificent.  I was shocked.  I would not be hesitant to say that it is one of the best action sequences that has ever been caught on camera.  There is not a single dull moment in its seven-odd-minutes of glory.  The task of filming it must have been monumental, but the payoff is well worth it.  It is, by far, the climax of the entire movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's BEN HUR, folks.  You have to see it at least once, if for no other reason than to say you have.  Of all the biblical epics, I would endorse this one the most.  Try it out.  The sheer scale of the film alone will impress you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>In the late 1950's MGM was in trouble financially.  They desperately needed a hit that would put the studio back in the black and re-establish it as a major player.  They decided to bet the ranch on Ben-Hur.  They brought in William Wyler ("Wuthering Heights", "The Best Years of Our Lives", "Roman Holiday") to direct and gave him carte blanche to spend whatever it took to make the film successful.  The result was the most expensive film made to that date at $50 Million (equivalent to $300 Million in today's dollars).  Many of the sets took over a year to build.  <p>It was lucky the film ever was finished at all.  After six months in production, they still didn't have a cast and the script by Karl Tunberg was deemed unacceptable by Wyler.  Wyler brought in Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson ("All Quiet on the Western Front", "Death Takes a Holiday", "Key Largo") to rewrite the screenplay and they frequently were doing desperate rewrites the night before shooting.  Producer Sam Zimbalist died during production.  The roman ships they built for the naval battle were top heavy and capsized, so they had to build a special tank where the ships were guided by wires and held upright.  An expensive 65mm camera was destroyed in a collision with a chariot. <p>Numerous leading men were reported to have turned down the part of Ben-Hur, most notably Paul Newman, who said he didn't have the legs to appear in a tunic.  Others who were considered were Rock Hudson, Burt Lancaster, and Kirk Douglas.  Wyler couldn't find the right actor for the lead, so he turned to Charlton Heston, with whom he had done the film "The Big Country", the year before.  Heston accepted the part and the rest is history.<p>Despite all its production problems, the film is brilliantly done and stands as an archetype of film epics.  The sets and costumes are glorious, the direction superb and the acting compelling.  The chariot race is an outstanding orchestration of set construction, stunt work and filming that is superlative even by today's standards.  Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did almost all their own chariot driving, using stuntmen for only the most dangerous stunts.  This lent greater realism to the scenes, allowing more close-ups during the intense action.  <p>Somehow, despite all the rewrites using three different writers, the story flowed smoothly to its final resolution.  The bitter rivalry between Judah and Messala, boyhood friends turned enemies by Messala's ambition, is well conceived and creates a sense of purpose that makes the ultimate confrontation as powerful as it is inevitable.<p>The entire cast is terrific.  Charlton Heston gives a career performance as Judah Ben-Hur.  His combination of strength, courage, compassion and perseverance creates an attractive and heroic character that few in film history have been able to equal.  Stephen Boyd is also fantastic as Messala, with a ruthless ambition and a cold heart that stamps out lifelong friendships for personal gain.  Jack Hawkins and Hugh Griffith lead a wonderful supporting cast.<p>This film is one of the most honored epics ever made.  It was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won 11 including Best Picture, Best Actor (Charlton Heston), Best Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), Best Director (William Wyler), and Best Music.  It is number 72 on AFI's top 100 of the century.  The chariot race is one of the most exciting sequences ever filmed.  I rated it a 10/10.  They don't come much better than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>What is the greatest story ever told? Well it's not Ben-Hur, but this story does come very close. On the other hand Ben-Hur is arguably the most epic film ever made. This is a tour de force led by Charlton Heston in his prime. If you ever doubted that Heston was one of the greatest, watch this and you will leave the experience convinced of his skills. Also if you disagree with this film's legacy take note that it went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, a feat equaled only by Titanic in 1997 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2003. This film was directed by William Wyler. Charlton Heston plays Prince Judah Ben-Hur. At no point in this film does it appear as if Heston's character is not 100% convinced that the events taking place are total reality. When watching Ben-Hur the viewer is transported to a different place and time. The dedication, belief, and skill Heston put into the role won him the Academy Award for best actor. Judah Ben-Hur is a wealthy merchant that accidentally catches the blame for threatening the life of a Roman general. This does not go over well and he is promptly sentenced to to serve time as galley slave. After a tough run as a slave rower he returns after saving the life of of a Roman commander. Upon his return he is granted freedom and adopted by the commander. He then goes on to be a great charioteer and the rest in cinematic golden history. Coincidentally it is also the history of the world. Ben-Hur has, and will, stand the test of time as a great chapter in the history of film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 4/05, 4/06, 7/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />4/05: Ben-Hur is a magnificent epic picture that is so deftly directed by William Wyler. Highly budgeted picture amassing thousands (over 15,000!) of extras, so glorious Rome is depicted. Ben-Hur deserves lots of praise. The great climax comes at the chariot race. Stephen Boyd garners a great respect from me for his role as Messala. I am dismayed to learn afterwards that Stephen Boyd wasn't acknowledged for his finest supporting work. What a surprise (!!!) that Hugh Griffith (who played the Sheik) instead got the overrated praise. That is a huge mistake there. The terrific villainous line from Messala is, "There's still enough of a man here for you to hate!" The dazzling speed in that chariot race awes me. Although the race is the highlight of Ben-Hur, the movie is much more than that. It is interesting to note how the rise of Jesus Christ overshadowed the apparent elements portrayed in the movie and diminished the memory of sufferings each character had undergone. That is what makes Ben-Hur so great. When I think of it, an intriguing comparison is evoked when reflecting back on Gone with the Wind. Ben-Hur never overstays its presence, only to shine in its length of the greatest of that era that was once the high and the mighty power of the Roman Empire. The setup and the landscape of Rome are mind-blowing in its rich colors. Overall, Ben-Hur is a must-see spectacle. It is a lost art of epic films, indeed!<br /><br />4/06: An absolutely magnificent picture. Fantastic! Thrilling! Mind blowing! Spectacular! A true epic in every sense of the word, Ben-Hur is so breathtaking that its trivia is even more breathtaking than the film per se. Moreover, Ben-Hur will never be equalized again in its sheer grandness and brilliance. Forget the stupid, contrived computer graphics made films that aim to cheat its way around. Watch Ben-Hur and notice the difference of how and the way movies are supposed to be made. Outstanding all-around performances are throughout the picture. If Judah Ben-Hur is the biggest figure of Ben-Hur, Jesus Christ of Nazareth is way even bigger. The shadow he throws on Ben-Hur is so omnipotent that Ben-Hur becomes a secondary legend. What makes Ben-Hur great is the test of values, loyalty, honor, and principles. One of the greatest screen scenes is the famous, awe-inspiring Chariot Race in the most spectacular fashion of Rome's Circus. Nothing defies the thrill of the screen like Ben-Hur does.<br /><br />7/11: Still an incredible picture to this day. It has no equal.</p></br><a href="../users/AK61LQI92GTCH.html">AK61LQI92GTCH</a><br/><p>Grand.  Opulent.  Epic.  BEN-HUR is a wide-screen extravaganza that saves all its serious paint for the action scenes.  The plot may be thin, the characters shallow and the acting majestically wooden, but director William Wyler really knew how to paint in the wide screen corners.  The famous chariot race is one of the greatest action scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />  How big?  Consider this - of the eleven Academy Awards won by this one, the Supporting Actor winner Hugh Griffith didn't even first appear until an hour and forty minutes into the movie, a time when most good movies have gone to bed.<br /><br />  This movie really needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can put it on.  The actors' nostril should be as big as hubcaps when they're shot in close-up.  Even in its original 2:76-1 aspect ratio BEN-HUR loses a bit of its punch the smaller it's shown.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>Recently, I watched Ben-Hur for my first time on DVD The movie got off to a slow start and there are quite a few minutes I would have considered editing out (The overture alone is six minutes). But, after about half and hour or so, this movie really got going. The story revolves around Jonah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince who is arrested for attempting to murder a roman governor (Which was untrue. It was a mere accident) and forced into slavery. Ben-Hur is portrayed in an Academy Award winning performance by Charlton Heston. Some critics have complained in the years following the film's release that Heston is wooden in his role. While his performance isn't brilliant and does have some poor moments, he is excellent nonetheless. The rest of the cast is also good. The sets, cinematography and special effects are also excellent, which is probably why they won among the film's Eleven Academy Awards, a tally that wouldn't be equaled until 1997's Titanic.  <p>I though at first that the opening scene of the film (The birth of Jesus Christ) had nothing to do with the movie. But Jesus was a main part in Ben-Hur's life, at least in his Hollywood life. He encouraged him to continue moving on when Jonah was a slave and also baptized him. When Jesus was dying at the cross, he performed one last miracle on the Hur family by curing Jonah's mother and sister of leprosy. <p>There is in this movie what is among the ten most celebrated action scenes in motion pictures: The chariot race. After more than forty years, the sequence has not lost its original excitement and is still inspiring directors today (See the pod race in Star Wars Episode One). What makes it so good is the way it was filmed. Sometimes, the camera angle makes it look as if we are spectators at the race. In other shots, we are chasing the chariots or even feel as though we are sitting in the driver's chair. The fact it was filmed in the 1950's before such a scene could be computer generated or filmed in front of a blue screen makes us appreciate it more because of the risks the producers took in filming it. Would such a scene be as great and realistic if filmed today? <p>The presentation on the DVD is Widescreen Anamorphic. The transfer is excellent with hardly any nicks or scratches. The extras are even more excellent. There is a superb documentary about the making of Ben-Hur, covering the book, stage productions, the 1907 short, the 1926 silent movies and of course the much celebrated 1959 movie. This documentary also shows revealing look at the making of the movie, exposing secrets of some of the special effects (One interesting tidbit: William Wyler, who directed the 1959 Ben-Hur, was an assistant director on the 1926 silent version).  There are also two theatrical trailers, screen tests and commentary from star Charlton Heston. The only major complaint I have is how you have to turn the disc over during the playing of the movie after the intermission to watch the rest of it. Taking the disc out of the box is also difficult as well.  <p>Three-hour epics such as Ben-Hur are what can be considered an acquired taste. They are long and slow at times and often with unnecessary scenes. But this doesn't mean they aren't worth watching. If you want to learn about the Roman Empire or if you just feel like watching a good movie, Ben-Hur is highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>?Ben-Hur? is the story of Jewish nobleman, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), who is imprisoned by his one-time boyhood friend, now the Roman tribune, Messalah (Stephen Boyd). Judah's path to God and Messalah's road to ruin parallel the Christ story. Made in 1959, at a time when the studio system, like ancient Rome, was crumbling, ?Ben-Hur? is a masterfully paced, fully realized and intense ?religious? experience. This is by far the greatest of the Bible-fiction epics. It is told with such sweep and scope that one can only sit back and marvel at William Wyler direction, which rightfully placed the emphasis on the human drama and relationships set against the massive pageantry that one comes to expect from such film fare. The production values never overshadow the story. The climactic chariot race is fifteen minutes of pure adrenaline-infused exhilaration, topped off by the fact that both Heston and Boyd did their own stunt work, which must have been a harrowing experience! On Oscar night this movie topped out with 13 nominations and 11 wins including BEST PICTURE, the most Oscars ever awarded any movie until James Cameron's &quot;Titanic&quot; tied it some fifty years later. <p>Warner Home Video has done an outstanding job on this transfer. Albeit, they have cropped the image to the more widely accepted 2:35:1 aspect ratio (MGM Camera 65 presented the film originally as 2:70:1) this is a dazzling anamorphic transfer, full of rich colors, fine detail and stunning clarity. Only in the darkest scenes does the disc falter slightly and lose its otherwise pristine image quality. No pixelization, edge enhancement, aliasing or fine detail shimmering is present. Extras include a thorough documentary with interviews from surviving principle cast and crew. The film itself is split across two sides of a flipper disc but is separated at the intermission half way mark - a forgivable stop. The 5.1 remix is stirring, powerful and engaging, particularly with Miklos Roza's brilliant score that fills the expanse and raises the hair on the back of one's neck. This is a must have for anyone who love Hollywood epics. Sadly, ?Ben-Hur? also represents one of the last enduring masterpiece to emerge from Hollywood?s greatest studio ? Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. I miss MGM! Thankfully, films like &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; endure.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Ben-Hur is one of cinema history's most renowned and expensive titles that swept the house at the Oscars in 1960.  The only nomination it did not win was the best-adapted screenplay, which went to Room at the Top (1959), but it successfully claimed eleven other Oscars, including best film and best actor.  Charlton Heston brought the agonizing struggles of the Jewish prince Ben-Hur to life through his excruciating search to find an outlet for his internalized pain brought upon him by the Roman oppression.  Compared to contemporary performances by Hollywood actors such a Sean Penn or Tim Robbins, Heston appears stiff and rigid in his performance.  However, Heston's inflexibility in front of the camera is a perfect match for the character, as Ben-Hur suffers a tragic journey of endless loss and grief.<br /><br />A map and the voice of the narrator (Finlay Currie) help clarify the major historical aspects of the Roman Empire and the importance of Jesus Christ's birth at the time.  It is an intriguingly multifaceted opening that presents immensely detailed background of the two major characters Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd).  The tale of Ben-Hur rests on a foundation based on General Lew Wallace's novel that runs parallel to the life of Jesus Christ, which also intertwines the existence of Ben-Hur and Jesus.  Through the infusion of Jesus into the story, it also provides a meaningful perspective of Christian philosophy.  The moral message in the film, heavily applies the great injustice and difficulty that Ben-Hur has to endure, which leaves the audience with several notions to ponder.<br /><br />Ben-Hur and Messala, once childhood friends, discover that that life has come to a crossroads where both have decided on their own path.  However, before they part they reunite when the Roman Messala returns to the Judea, as the new garrison commander for the Roman Empire in Judea.  When Messala commands his friend Ben-Hur to give up the names of some Jews that are resisting the Roman Empire, their friendship ends, as Ben-Hur decides on the righteous path while keeping the names a secret.  Further predicaments emerge when the new governor arrives, as Ben-Hur's mother and sister are put under arrest while he finds himself being sentenced to a life as a rower on one of the Roman galleys.  Unaware of his family's fate and several painful years behind the oar Ben-Hur's hate grows stronger for the Roman Empire, which is responsible of his agonizing destiny.<br /><br />Through Ben-Hur's existence and struggle director William Wyler creates a visual journey where emotions runs free and passionate anger feeds the hate of the protagonist.  However, Ben-Hur will find a moment for the vengeance he is seeking through luck, or maybe with the help of God. In either case, it will have a profound affect on Ben-Hur, as he will cross his path with the Christian philosophy.  This leaves the audience with a remarkable adventure of unfortunate luck and numerous moral thoughts to contemplate.<br /><br />Ben-Hur was at the time, the most expensive film of all times produced by MGM, which was facing bankruptcy when the film was made.  However, this epic spiritual journey of Ben-Hur helped save the Hollywood company out of financial abyss, as the film grossed record amounts of money.  Together with several aspects of filmmaking Wyler directed a film that has an unforgettable score, awesome cinematography, terrific mise-en-scene, and an excellent chariot scene that will go down as one of the best races in film history.  Besides these cinematic facets, an excellent cast dynamically enhances the intriguing elements in the film and will leave the audience thoroughly entertained and deep in thoughts.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>This masterful movie epic is based on a novel by General Lew Wallace. The movie mostly revolves around the fictional Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), a wealthy; well-respected; prominent member of the Jewish community; and exiled Prince in Judea at the time of Christ. Ben-Hur's life is parralled by that of Jesus, the two were born at approximately the same time and they briefly meet at crucial time's in their lives. <p>Judea has a new Tribune and a new governor. The new Tribune,  Messala, is an old friend of Judah's and he is excited to visit his childhood companion again. However, the two soon discover that they have grown into very different men with very different views of the world. Messala wishes Judah to betray some of his countrymen who have made hated remarks against Rome. Judah refuses and their friendship is quickly disolved. Not long after, a freak accident leads to Judah's arrest and the imprisonment of his mother and sister. Judah swears revenege as he is condemned to death in the slave galleys.<p>BEN-HUR won 11 Academy Awards and it is not difficult to understand why. Over forty years after it's initial release the movie is still amazing and spectaclar to watch. William Wyler won his third Best Director Oscar with BEN-HUR and rightly so: the blending of all the various elements from costume to makeup to acting to action sequences to scenery to sets is perfect, all without any CGI.<p>Charlton Heston has always been one of my favorite actors (I guess I enjoy his overemoting, that's usually better than no emotion at all) and he pulls off the performance of his career as Judah Ben-Hur. He never could quite pull of a performance that matched his work in BEN-HUR. And as a side note the rest of the cast is just as interesting to watch.<p>The movie runs for an incredible time of almost 3 and 1/2 hours. Yet, not once during that time does the film drag. It moves carefully from one point of the story to the next without ever losing continuity.<p>Judah's conversion to Christianity isn't as blatant as it is in the novel and other versions of the film. Yet, that in no way distracts from the power of the movie. In fact, Judah's conversion in this BEN-HUR seems much more believable and realistic. Not every Christian has a dramatic conversion experience.<p>BEN-HUR is a great movie. It's a tale of humanity told through the life of one man. It's filled with adventure, romance, revenege, action, drama, and even a little comedy. The action scenes are thrilling and the chariot scene has had a profound impact upon filmmaking (anyone see the pod race in THE PHANTOM MENACE). Movies don't get much better than that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The chariot race sequence is just as spectacular and amazing as you've heard, but the rest of the movie is sluggish and weighted with its own greatness; long and self-important, Ben-Hur is a movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon, not a Friday night.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>If I told you what I paid for the deluxe set (with a collectible Roman-soldier figurine, yet!) on Black Friday at a famous consumer-electronics store -- you'd plotz.<br /><br />This HD transfer is far superior to any I've seen. It's supposedly from the camera negative, and the extreme sharpnss and detail support this. There is no apparent grain reduction, as you can see huge amounts of grain in areas of blue sky (a surprising amount for a film shot in 65mm).<br /><br />The best thing, though, is that the flat, vulgar color of earlier editions is gone. Though no one would mistake "Ben-Hur" for a "modern" film, one can finally appreciate the really beautiful cinematography, especially in the darker scenes shot on studio sets.<br /><br />I get the feeling we're /finally/ seeing the sea battle correctly. In particular, it's much darker than previous versions, consistent with the cloudy skies of the backdrop. (Much of it was shot in a tank, if it's not obvious. Arnold Gillespie's miniatures hold up very well, even after 50 years.)<br /><br />I used to consider Charlton Heston's totally-unjustified-for-an-Oscar-nomination performance as wooden or stilted. Looking at it for perhaps the seventh time, I realize that the problem is that Heston had difficulty modulating his delivery. If he's happy, he's very happy. If angry, very angry. And no one will ever convince me that his clench-jawed butchering of "I see no enemy" in any way reflects how Judah truly felt at that moment.<br /><br />As in "Spartacus", the British actors generally deliver better performances than the Americans. Hugh Griffith, in particular, gets a plum role as sheik Ilderan, the "goofy Arab" version of the "crazy Mexican" Eli Wallach perfected. Griffith is so heavily painted down that it looks as if the makeup department went through many cans of Kiwi mahogany.<br /><br />The supplemental material is pretty good. A hard-back book appears to duplicate the written contents of the roadshow souvenir book, and adds additional photos and press releases. Another, smaller, hardback includes about 100 pages from the journal Heston kept during the production.<br /><br />The most-interesting supplement is a 75m film about Heston and "Ben-Hur". It's almost a hagiography, but Heston convincingly comes across as a kind, modest person who put his family first and was generous to and well-liked by almost all who met him. (This is consistent with the impression I got when Sandy Gross interviewed him a few years ago.) Would that he had been as good an actor as he was a human being.<br /><br />Strongly recommended, if you can tolerate Heston's unsubtle performance. I do have to wonder, though, why, given the things that can be done with digital transfers, his eye color wasn't changed to brown.<br /><br />PS: Just to set the record straight... Miklos Rozsa's "best-ever" score is rarely more than cornball tripe. In particular, the passage where the Star of Bethlehem moves over the manger (switching from widebeam to spotlight) is the musical equivalent of a Thomas Kinkade painting.</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>First released in 1959, "Ben Hur" is one the grandest, if not the most courageous exploration of sublimated hoe-more-sect-chew-all love between men. <p>The film takes place in Judea during Jesus Christ's lifetime. It begins when boyhood friends, Messala (Stephen Boyd) and Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) are reunited in Jerusalem as young men. Messala is now a Tribune in command of the Roman legions that occupy Judea and Judah is both a prince and a wealthy merchant who objects to the Roman occupation in principle but does not overtly oppose it. Under the pretext of discharging his duty as a Roman soldier, Messala urges Judah to inform on any friends or acquaintances that refuse to accept Roman rule. When Judah refuses to comply with this request, Messala turns it into a demand stating that Judah is either for him or against him.<p>In reality, Messala is sublimating his repressed sect-chew-all desire for Judah and expressing it in consciously acceptable terms. Messala and Judah spent their boyhood together until the age of fourteen when Messala was sent to Rome. Undoubtedly the separation was difficult for both boys but for obvious reasons it traumatized Messala much more. In the first place, Messala was separated from Judah during the advent of his sect-chew-all maturity and before he could resolve any burgeoning sect-chew-all feelings for him. But at the same time, Messala was also transposed from an environment in which he enjoyed relative physical and personal freedom (He and Judah hunted together, and men in Judea are cool about crying when they are upset.) to one in which he underwent rigorous, depersonalizing indoctrination as both a Roman citizen and as a military officer. <p>Few things could have produced a more disastrous result since Messala now not only repressed his feelings for Judah, but also lacked adequate emotional tools in which to resolve them. As a result, instead of returning to the lost paradise of youth (One he references when he asks Judah if he still hunts jackals and wolves.) Messala attempts to indoctrinate Judah in the same way that he was. On the surface Messala is commanding Judah, but on an emotional level he is actually pleading with him, essentially saying "Look, I can't go back to what we were so let's love each other by having you become what I am." If Judah could properly identify the emotional process at work then he could possibly avert disaster. For example, he could say, "Forget about all this governing Judea stuff, let's talk about you and me." But because Judah fails to recognize the emotional process at work, he inadvertently rejects Messala's emotional advances with catastrophic results. Messala's identity is now trapped in an in-between state since he cannot return to his youthful past and Judah will not join him in his adult present. As a result, in order to prevent his own psychic annihilation, Messala must now destroy Judah-not so much because he rejected him but because his continued presence reminds him of what he has lost forever. For this reason, Messala has Judah condemned as a galley slave and imprisons his mother and sister in the local dungeon where all three face certain death.<p>After three years in the galleys, Judah is partially freed by a Roman Consul who identifies him with his own dead son. Judah subsequently saves the Consul's life and as a result, the Consul adopts him and trains him to race horses in the Roman circus. <p>The Consul's relationship with Judah is partly paternalistic and partly sect-chew-all-iced. In liberating Judah and training him to ride in the circus, the Consul unconsciously provides him with the sect-chew-all mentoring he requires to resolve his conflict with Messala. After all, in order to race in the Roman games, Judah must think and behave as a Roman, which means that he has now become indoctrinated in the same manner as Messala. This is apparent when Judah returns to Judea and confronts Messala, who can barely conceal his pleasure toward the fact that Judah has come back not as a Jewish prince or galley slave, but as a Roman aristocrat. <p>The sect-chew-all conflict between the two men is ultimately resolved during the film's climactic chariot race whose sect-chew-all symbolism is all too apparent.  The chariot race takes place in a public arena in which men dressed in scanty, flashy costumes drive powerful horses from chariots mounted behind them. <p>At first Messala dominates this conflict in several manners. Messala has won this race during all the years of Judah's imprisonment and exile, which means that in a sense he has publicly declared his hoe-more-sect-chew-alit-E. Judah is popular as a hometown boy, but his racing skills (in other words, his sect-chew-all prowess) are unknown here although, ironically, they are well known in Rome. Messala acknowledges this during the start of the race when he smiles at Judah and says, "Hail Jupiter, grant me victory today." In doing this, Messala references the fact that they are now competing together in a Roman environment. In this sense, they have fulfilled Messala's original wish that, having lost their childhood bond, they at least become the same type of man. In referencing Jupiter, Messala subtly reminds Judah that the chariot race is a pagan conflict that recreates their lost youth. Messala is saying to Judah, "Good, you're finally here, let's play."<p>As the race progresses, Messala realizes that he cannot defeat Judah and begins to whip him furiously, which is essentially an open expression of his sect-chew-all feelings toward Judah. At first Judah is indignant, but then he seizes the whip and lashes back at Messala for the first time acknowledging his own sect-chew-all feelings toward him. This sect-chew-all expression literally overpowers Messala who is mortally injured. Shortly before his demise, however, Messala attempts to destroy Judah's hope of finding his imprisoned mother and sister (and thus of returning to their pre-sect-chew-all past). In the throes of death, Messala declares to Judah that "the race" (their sect-chew-all dance) "goes on."</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>This is one of the few films shot in MGM Camera 65 (later known as Ultra Panavision). Now generally I dislike anything to do with the Bible or religious nonsense, but there are some make-believe / fantasy films which define this genre that are entertaining to watch (the Ten Commandments, for example). The spectacular images inside the 2.76:1 widescreen aspect are amazing to take in; you will want to view this film on a screen 36" or larger, otherwise you'll be sitting REALLY close to the set. It's a shame films today aren't composed inside extremely wide frames like this one. I suppose its near-equivalent now would be anything in IMAX, but that format will likely never be used as a primary method for anything but specialty features. The commentary included does NOT run throughout the film. Heston is heard only during select scenes. Warner Bros. screwed that up. They could have easily hired a notable film historian for added value, but no.<br /><br />Note: a four disc deluxe edition is forthcoming with gobs more features.</p></br><a href="../users/AFMUUJT7J32LN.html">AFMUUJT7J32LN</a><br/><p>It has a good plot and is absorbing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>Certainly not a bad movie, certainly not worth 11 oscars, i guess nothing better came out that year, because this movies so long they could only make this.  At almost 4 hours making it to the end without skipping some scenes is impossible, but there is definetly some quality stuff here.  The chariot  race (i dont call it the finale because it happens an hour before the end of the movie) is incredible, the camera work is excellent and the race is pretty brutal with guys getting crushed by flipped chariots, horses trampling men, and juda takes a dive over the front of the chariot (it was actually kinda funny to see this guy flip over the chariot so quickly but its real).  There is a battle on a slave ship which is pretty violent for a G rated movie because it shows slaves with cut off hands and feet with bone sticking out and blood.  Those two sequences and the crucificxion are the only real events that occur however, as with many other old films this is a huge flaw, the film is entirely too long with way too much irrelevant dialogue.  Its definetly not worth 11 oscars maybe 4, if Ridley Scott were to remake it i could see it winning 11 oscars because it is a good story to work off of.  Overall its a fairly average film, good, not great, for its time it was very good, but now its nothing special.  People who are 50 watch this, people born after this movie was made watch LOTR.  6 out of a 10.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies where you don't have to be religious to enjoy a story with religious intentions.<br /><br />Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Moses.  Every good story has a great hero, so why not Ben-Hur?<br /><br />And, of course, every good story has a common enemy.  Nazis, Al-Qaeda, The Riddler, and even Darth Vader.  So here, Ben-Hur had to compete with the sinister Roman named Masala, to protect his God fearing people, and to even prove his innocence of a misfortunate event that evidently lead to persecute himself and his mother and sister.<br /><br />But, I couldn't believe how expensive this Blu-ray release was for Ben-Hur this time around.  And now that I've received it from Amazon, I'm rather overwhelmed by the packaging of the film.  This box is a shelf-consuming Monstrosity!<br /><br />This big-a$$ box has three discs, one of which is full of special features that I'd probably only watch once. Plus it comes with two books.  Who needs these stupid books?  I scanned through one of them and found that it's just a bunch of written breakdowns of the days of filming.  How freakin' boring!  And, this whole big box weighs about 6 pounds and I don't know where to put it in my Blu-Ray collection.  It's a huge eye-sore!  I hope they'll release this movie as ONLY the movie at a much reduced price, and that it fits in with my other BD discs.  Or, if I just keep this huge box, I can just use it as a door stop, or a support block to hold my window open, or if I stand it upside, this could be used as an extra seat at the dinner table when I have company.<br /><br />What a bunch of unnecessary info-stock fodder that I got stuck with, that I had to pay for, when all I wanted was just the movie itself in Blu-ray.  I'm surprised that this box didn't also include an imitation leather whip with Masala's name on it, which I'm sure some hardcore movie collector would cherish and hang on their wall above their TV set, or just keep it in its original wrapper and keep the whole box set honorably intact, and displayed on some mantle.<br /><br />Now, I'm hearing from people that this movie is available as a single disc version at Best Buy.  So, I guess I ordered this movie too soon from Amazon.<br /><br />Oh well, live and learn.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" has a storied history.  Its production was the stuff of legend - years of preparation, an enormous budget for its time, and the talents of a famed director.  The end result was eleven Academy Awards.<br /><br />Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to Judea as the new tribune of the Roman province and meets with Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), a boyhood friend who is now a wealthy member of the Jewish ruling class.  The bond between the two men deteriorates after Ben-Hur refuses Messala's request for help in restoring order to Judea.  After his family is arrested and he himself is sent to the galleys, fate intervenes when Ben-Hur saves the life of Admiral Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins).  Arrius frees him from servitude and Ben-Hur soon returns home to settle matters with Messala and find his mother and sister.<br /><br />"Ben-Hur" is indeed a spectacle.  This is epic filmmaking on the highest order.  Every inch of the screen is filled with lush and vibrant images and Heston delivers a powerful performance that anchors the film.  However, for all its grandeur, "Ben Hur" is also bloated and languid.  It seems that the film is more concerned at times with showing off its impressive production design than telling a coherent story.  The only time when "Ben-Hur" does come to energetic life is during the stunning chariot race sequence which deserves every accolade it has received over the years.  However, this one sequence is not enough to save the film.  The rest of the "Ben-Hur" is plagued with underdeveloped characters and a narrative filled with rough and awkward transitions.  Most fatal is the final act which feels like it belongs in another film.  Yet, it must be pointed out once more that Heston is spectacular.  He has undeniable screen presence and he commands your attention every time he speaks.  Too bad the other aspects of the film could not complement his tour-de-force performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>"Ben-Hur, A Tale of the Christ" by General Lew Wallace, as the credits bill it, is a typical example of what Hollywood can do when it wants to fake piety (remember "The Robe?"), make a lot of money, win some awards, and tell a tale that reinforces the Bible stories and myths that greet us on Christmas and Easter cards. The mission and crucifixion of Jesus provide the context for a fictional narrative ending with a miracle that comes none too soon. This nearly four-hour marathon has long overture and intermission music but (God is merciful) no exit music. Warners' deluxe reissue on four discs includes the original silent movie and a disc of extra features.<br /><br />While the familiar passion of Christ unfolds as the characters encounter it, but not as Mel Gibson reinterpreted it, General Wallace tells of two childhood friends, a Jewish prince (Charlton Heston) and a Roman tribune (Stephen Boyd), who as adults clash over allegiances. The Jew is betrayed by the Roman and sent into slavery, where during a sea battle he rescues a Roman consul (the wonderful Jack Hawkins) who adopts him. He returns to Judea a rich charioteer to challenge his nemesis, who is killed in the ensuing race. He has a couple of encounters with Jesus and a former slave girl he loves, and he accepts Christ when after His death a miracle cures his mother and sister, who have become lepers.<br /><br />There are some marvelous performances in this movie, starting with those by Hawkins and Boyd as the ambitious Roman who really loves his Jewish chum (he was secretly told to play it that way). Hugh Griffith steals his every scene (and won a supporting actor Oscar) as a conniving trader with four Arabian horses to whom Heston whispers. To give the film stature, William Wyler was hired to direct; but he didn't direct its most famous sequence, the exciting chariot race, a triumph of editing and cinematography. And there's a thundering Miklos Rozsa score to match the movie.<br /><br />"Ben-Hur" by today's standards ("Troy," "Alexander," Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" and "Kingdom of Heaven") is a solemn and ponderous epic shot mostly on backlots and soundstages where even outdoor voices and noises echo. The costumes look like new clothes worn for the first time. Some of the acting is overcooked (Heston) or underdone (Haya Haraeet, his love interest.) Yes, the acerbic (and uncredited) Gore Vidal did indeed try to doctor the reverential script. "Ben-Hur" was state of the art in 1959 so we should show some Christian charity and try to stay awake. It did take home a record eleven Academy Awards.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>The first film version of Ben-Hur was a 15-minute unauthorized version in 1907. This lead to a law suit by author Lew Wallace that set the precedent for future book-to-movie copyright cases. Eventually, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights, and produced the first legitimate adaptation in 1925. It was silent, 35 mm black-and-white (1.33:1 ratio) with some tinting and a few 2-strip Technicolor scenes. Fred Niblo directed Ramon Novarro as Ben-Hur, Francis X. Bushman as Messala and May McAvoy as Esther in an outstanding production. But it was plagued with many problems, including a sea battle shot in Italy, in which one of the ships actually caught fire, sending the extras into the sea, some of which may have drowned. In the famous chariot race, which was shot in LA, there was a big pile-up of chariots that injured numerous drivers and killed quite a few horses. All of these scenes were left in the final cut.<br /><br />In 1959, William Wyler directed a second Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production of the book, this time with sound, in 65 mm Panavision (2.76:1 ratio) and in Technicolor. MGM was on the verge of bankruptcy; so, in one bold move, they invested everything they had in the film - and it paid off, making top box office for that year. Charlton Heston, who had worked with Wyler in The Big Country the previous year, played the title role and won an Oscar for it. Stephen Boyd, who would again drive a chariot in The Fall Of The Roman Empire (1965), played Messala. Haya Harareet, the only native Palestinian in the cast, played Esther. All the Romans were played by British actors, including Jack Hawkins,as Quintus Arrius. Hugh Griffith won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as the wonderful Sheik Ilderim, owner of the four white Arabians that pull Ben-Hur's chariot.<br /><br />There were 11 Oscars won in all - still the most ever, sharing honors with Titanic (1997) and The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King (2003). The other Oscars won by Ben-Hur were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography for a Color Film, Best Art Direction-Set Direction for a Color Film, Best Costume Design for a Color Film, Best Effects-Special Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Music-Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, and Best Sound. The only one it was nominated for that it didn't win was Best Writing-Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.<br /><br />I found the novel by Lew Wallace to be more charming and less "big" than the 1959 film. Even the characters were more life-size. I pictured a Robert Taylor in the role of Ben-Hur rather than Charlton Heston. The only actor from the film that seemed to fit the novel was Finlay Currie as Balthasar, the wise man from Egypt. He was perfect. Currie also narrates the film.<br /><br />There is far more focus on Christ in the novel, the 1900 stage play (in which he is played by a beam of light) and the 1925 film than in the 1959 version. The book wrestles with the question of whether He will be an earthly King or a Savior of souls. Ben-Hur, who is a Sadducee, hopes he will be an earthly King, and actually trains three legions of Galileeans in preparation to help Him overthrow the occupying Romans. But Balthasar is convinced Christ will be a Savior of souls, and tries to convince Ben-Hur of the same. It is not until the miraculous events at the end that he accepts that fact, and accepts Christ as his Savior.<br /><br />To date, Ben-Hur is still the greatest Christian novel ever written, and the greatest Christian film ever produced, as well as one of the all-time great classics. I don't agree with the AFI ranking of Ben-Hur at #100. I believe it, and the silent version, should share a position in the top 40 at least. There will never be another Ben-Hur, the 2003 animated version notwithstanding. It has been estimated that to reproduce Ben-Hur as it was produced in 1959, it would cost over a quarter of a billion dollars. That just isn't going to happen. And CGI won't cut it. You can't reproduce a live chariot race like the one in Ben-Hur in CGI and catch anyone's breath. So, this is a classic that will live as long as films are made. And, in my opinion, beyond that.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The  film that has become a by-word for the genre and the biggest of the roadshow movies of the fifties and sixties, 1959's Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ is from an audience point-of-view still a great movie, and considerably more intelligent than many modern critics would like to believe.<br /><br />The best of the redemption epics of the Fifties, where suffering in the likes of The Robe or Quo Vadis  makes  their protagonists better in the creepily smug way that passes for movie righteousness, it turns its hero, Judah Ben-Hur, into a right s**t. Corrupted by revenge, he rejects Christ and turns away from passive resistance. Mistaken for Christ, he is himself betrayed by a friend and returns from his certain death (in this case the galleys) "like a returning faith," in the words of one of his faithful servants, but he has no faith himself. Having initially rejected Messala's overtures to "look to the west, look to Rome", indirectly the cause of his misfortunes, he becomes Romanised and a mirror image of his betrayer. The character exists in a constant state of flux and torment, journeying from slave-owning Jew to Roman slave to Roman citizen to symbol of resistance, never regaining his peace until the finale.<br /><br />There was never an actor more at home in the genre than Heston, and he is in strong form here, although much of his thunder is stolen by Stephen Boyd as Messala (the role Heston was pencilled in for before Rock Hudson turned down the lead) whose intelligent portrayal of ambition is far more Oscar-worthy than Hugh Griffiths' hammily enjoyable Sheik Ilderim. Jack Hawkins and the remainder of the cast perfectly judge their roles, with Wyler's adept direction achieving a perfect balance between the religious, political and human elements of the story.<br /><br />While making the most of the spectacle, he also ensures that it is often the quieter moments that most impress. An assistant director on the 1926 version's chariot race sequence, his sensitivity with actors ensures the film is driven more by emotions than events, and certainly the scenes dealing with his return to Judea are often genuinely moving without seeming so overtly manipulative as they doubtless would have in other hands.<br /><br />Miklos Rozsa's score is one of the greatest ever written for any motion picture and is remarkably sensitive to the needs of the film (although Wyler did reputedly want to use Silent Night for the Nativity sequence!). The stunning ten-minute chariot race, played in real-time, has and needs no music, relying instead on the infinitely more effective roar of the crowd and thunder of hooves. The sequence also shows canny production design: the arena is suitably high-walled to limit the number of extras needed for the three-month shoot of the scene.<br /><br />Ben-Hur is a film which still somewhat defies television in all its formats - the cinema is really the place to see this, the bigger the screen, the better. At an extra-wide 2.76:1 widescreen, it's not quite SuperTohoScope, but it's close, but the lack of picture area that was a major problem with definition and colour balance in the old letterboxed video releases is no problem for the DVD transfer, though it's still not recommended viewing on a small-screen TV. The film is not paced for TV but for the giant screen, inevitably draining some of its effect. Nonetheless, this is a great value-for-money special edition that may not be able to replicate the cinema experience, but does a good job of reminding you of it.<br /><br />Shot under huge pressure - MGM made it clear that the future of the studio depended on the picture - the resulting stress contributed to producer Sam Zimbalist's fatal heart attack before the film was completed, and the tortuous route to the screen is well documented in this four disc set through documentaries and even screen tests for Haya Hayareet, Cesare Danova and Leslie Nielson! Even the popular stage production, which ran throughout the US for a decade grossing an astonishing $10m. In case you're wondering, diagrams are provided of how the chariot race was staged with real horses and carts!<br /><br />Sadly, although extracts from the notorious unauthorised one-reel 1911 Kalem version are included on the 50-minute documentary about the making of the film, the full short - shot during a beach party, with the camera never straying from the finish line during the chariot race - is not included. The make-or-break MGM 1925 silent version is, in the Thames Silents version lovingly restored by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, and makes an interesting comparison. An even more famously chaotic production than the remake that saw several actors die during the sea battle and dozens of horses put down in the chariot race, it takes a very different approach to the story for much of its running time. Never is that more apparent than in the end, which sees Judah Ben-Hur raising an army and marching on Jerusalem to save Christ from the cross!<br /><br />There's also a selection of original and widescreen trailers on the DVD are splendid examples of the classic Hollywood selling technique, hyping the film in several languages.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>What else can I add to the virtues of this film?

Combining powerful acting performances, unique set design, colorful costumes, and unrivaled visual effects for its day, Ben-Hur is a pleasure to watch. Like Lawrence Of Arabia, it's one of those rare films from yesteryear which remains a top-tier film to this day (i.e. the film itself doesn't seem old, nor do the special effects look amateurish). If you enjoy classic films like Spartacus, Cleopatra, or Casablanca, then Ben-Hur is a definite must-see for your list. Like Gladiator (2000), Ben-Hur manages to bring the Roman Empire into vivid display on the big screen...<br /><br />Charlton Heston plays the title role of Judah Ben-Hur, an Israelite prince during the reign of Tiberius. Young and wealthy, Ben-Hur enjoys the finer aspects of life in the era of Pax Romana. When his old friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) arrives in Jerusalem to serve as the Roman Governor, the two are reunited and enjoy each other's company. However, the two quickly find that their political views have created divisions between them, and when a brick falls from the house of Ben-Hur during a parade (almost killing Messala), Ben-Hur and his family face the wrath of the Roman governor.<br /><br />Intent on sending a message to the Jews that he will have zero tolerance for rebellious behavior, Messala jails Ben-Hur's mother and sister and sells Ben-Hur into slavery. As Ben-Hur is taken away from his native land, he plots his escape and eventual return to exact vengeance on his sworn enemy... Ben-Hur's arrival in Jerusalem coincides with the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth...<br /><br />Charlton Heston makes quite an impression in his title role of Ben-Hur, following up well on the heals of his mesmerizing performance as Moses in the equally successful film, The Ten Commandments. Heston's resounding voice bodes well for hero characters pulled from the myths of ancient times. His larger-than-life persona conjures images of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but without the accent. Heston's performance is complimented by a series of action sequences which set the tone for its designation as an epic film. One such series involves a battle between the slave ship on which Ben-Hur resides and another ship which attacks it. The other, and most memorable, scene from the film is when Ben-Hur engages Messala in a chariot race (which even if you haven't seen the movie, you've probably seen this part).<br /><br />Overall, Ben-Hur lives up to its hype as an Oscar Award-winning blockbuster (it still holds the record for most Academy Awards, although the record has since been tied). However, the film itself is beginning to show its age in that modern epics such as Gladiator are far better in terms of entertainment value. The length of Ben-Hur is probably an hour to an hour-and-a-half longer than it should be. The plot can be slow and droning at times. Nevertheless, Ben-Hur remains a Hollywood classic and a definite must-see movie...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Wow, what can you say about a film that won 11 Academy Awards back in the days where the best films actually were honored, not the garbage they salute today?<br /><br />In other words, this film lives up to its reputation and has to be ranked as one of the most memorable movies of all time. Nobody who ever saw this film ever forgot the chariot race, for instance, perhaps the greatest action scene filmed without special effects.<br /><br />This can be a very sad film as well. I doubt if I've ever watched this without a few tears in my eyes at certain points. The scenes with hero's mother and sister suffering with leprosy are still some of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever witnessed on film. They can just tear you apart.<br /><br />The combination of drama, action and romance, along with very involving storyline is aided by an incredible soundtrack, once again one of the best ever put on film. The more one hears this music, the more was is moved by it.<br /><br />To fully appreciate  all of the above, including the wonderful cinematography in this film, I recommend you purchase this 4-disc DVD special edition which also includes the first rendition of this story, the silent movie "Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ." That was name of the book, by the way, the second part of the title being left off the 1959 movie as Hollywood slowly began deemphasizing Christianity in films.  The restoration job here on that' 59 film, by the way, is fantastic. Ben-Hur has never looked better.<br /><br />Both versions are outstanding. In summary, this is about as good an example as ever found of what is labeled an "epic" movie. It's an incredible story transferred memorably on screen.....and it's never looked nor sounded better than on this DVD version.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>There have been hundreds of reviews that have covered the plot of William Wyler's 1959 epic Ben-Hur. I will attempt to limite my review to the Four Disc Collector's Edition released by Warner Brothers Video.<br /><br />The first two discs present the epic film. The transfer is excellent and the letterboxed widescreen do justice to the Camera 65 original negative. The print quality on this edition is flawless and the Dolby 5.1 mix is very responsive on a good home theatre system.<br /><br />The film discs also contain a commentary by film historian and author T. Gene Hatcher with additional pre recorded comments by Charlton Heston. The commentary is well worth listening to with Hatcher going over the production process and Heston filling in anecdotes on the filming and on his relationship with Wyler and the cast. There is also a music only track which showcases Miklos Rozsa's Academy Award winning score.<br /><br />The third disc contains the 1925 silent version of Ben-Hur directed by Fred Niblo. This version was one of the most seen films of its time. Far from being difficult to watch the film is excellently restored and features a new score by Carl Davis. This film is the equal to the 1959 version and in some ways I think that I may perfer it.<br /><br />The fourth disc contains more standard bonus type features. There are two hour long featurettes on the production of the film: Ben-Hur: The Making of an Epic from 1994 and Ben-Hur: The Epic That Changed Cinema from 2005. Both are excellent features and give some useful information on both the making of the film and its lasting influences on a new generation of filmmakers. There are also stills galleries, screen tests, news reels and trailers.<br /><br />This is the definitive presentation of this classic film and is well worth the purchase price.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>One of MGM's finest widescreen spectacles, involving thousands of extras, over 300 sets (including a life-size replica of a Roman hippodrome) and a cadre of stunt coordinators, this massive production nearly bankrupted the studio when first produced. But the payoff was equally grand: Heston's Oscar-winning performance and a hefty box-office gross validated the costs of operating on such a vast canvas. It is also epic filmmaking at its best, featuring a mesmerizing escape at sea and the most thrilling, heart-poundingly authentic chariot race ever seen on film--at 20 minutes, no less! Majestic in scale, yet sensitive in its portrayal of a vengeful man touched by his encounters with Christ, "Ben-Hur" is a monumental entertainment directed with unwavering commitment and faultless taste by old pro William Wyler.</p></br></body></html>

There is more missing in this film than Alfred Hitchcock's brilliance. I had great expectations, especially after the movie's excellent beginning. Creepy opening shots of a criminal mug shot, bizarre childlike drawings, photographs of female murder victims, with voice-overs of a psychiatrist interviewing a very disturbed person, backed by eerie music and a very strange poem, all seemed promising.<p>Then...on a stormy night in the Nevada desert a group of people, stranded by the flooded highway and surrounding roads, converge on a lonely motel in the middle of nowhere. (sound familiar?) There's Ed (John Cusack), an ex-cop turned limo driver from LA, and his has-been actress passenger (Rebecca DeMornay); a Mom, Pop and kid who have much more than road problems; a gorgeous hooker; a recently married couple; a very sinister motel owner; and a cop, (Ray Liotta), accompanying a dangerous convict in chains. My initial feeling that the film was doomed was when I noticed that the convict was a cross between Freddy Krueger and Frankenstein. He is ugly, yes, but too funny looking to be really scary. Then I noticed that 3 of the 4 women were all stunning, sexy, wore miniskirts and showed lots of clevage...more credibility lost. I may sound picky, but if the film is really scary, then one doesn't notice these things.<p>Anyway, to cut to the chase, the murders begin, and just like in the film &quot;And Then There Were None,&quot; the motel guests are knocked off one by one, in descending order of their room numbers, with their keys placed next to the bodies. It soon becomes clear that every possible suspect is being eliminated. So, who is the murderer?? This is when a major plot twist kicks in, but even with the new turn of events the film does not become more credible, nor do the characters.<p>The plot is hackneyed, even with the 21st century rewrite and surprise ending - most of this has been done before, many times. The dialogue is inane, peppered with four-letter words, although there are a few quips by the motel owner that are kind of funny. He is asked to guard the convict who has just been recaptured after a very violent escape. He says, &quot;I don't know if I feel comfortable with guard duty, per se.&quot; That's as good as it gets. The characters are flat - absolutely no depth. Now some may say there's a reason for this, and there may be. However one still has to sit through an entire film watching cardboard characters running aimlessly around in the pouring rain, mouthing inane dialogue - just to see an unusual ending. This does not make for an entertaining film.<p>The premise is good. But good premises do not always make good movies. This one's a loser. You may get a few scares during the film's run time, but you might leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. I sure did.<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>IDENTITY DVD: Last night I popped in this DVD, first I was givin' the option of WIDESCREEN or FULLSCREEN. I choose WIDESCREEN. Second I was givin' the option of THEATRICAL CUT or EXTENDED VERSION. I choose EXTENDED. It would be nice if all DVD's had these options. Director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted &amp; Copland) whips up the perfect crowed pleaser for horror/suspense fans. The movie delivers a chilling atmoshere. It's dark and rainy, a motel setting in an abandoned area. Eventually the cast comes together at the motel, where one by one they are found murdered and evenually they disappear. It's part slasher film, part who-done-it. Basically IDENTITY is a horror movie with a psycological twist. And by my star rating above you can see I enjoyed it. I did however wonder why the DVD isn't in DTS?? IDENTITY stars: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Pruitt Taylor Vance, &amp; Rebecca DeMornay. DVD INCLUDES: Widescreen or Fullscreen / Alternative Ending and Additional scene / Commentary / Deleted Scenes / On the set of IDENTITY / Filmographies / &amp; more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>With some big name stars such as John Cusack, Rebecca De Mornay, Amanda Peete and Ray Liotta, Identity is a thriller which takes on the premise of Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None. In this novel, ten people, who all share a secret, are all invited to an island, and one by one they begin to die until the killer is revealed. In similar fashion, in Identity ten people by chance find themselves at a desolate hotel on a stormy night. It seems that strange luck has brought them all together, but, once there, one by one they begin to die. All the characters have vastly different personalities, so you begin to question who the killer is. Meanwhile, while the mystery at the hotel builds, the story flashes to a deranged criminal being questioned by a psychologist about brutal murders. The two stories fuse together, but it may not be as clearly defined as someone thinks.<br /><br />I'll admit that the first time I saw the film; I didn't really understand it or like it. I thought the ending was a little too far-fetched and silly, and felt cheated that much of the other parts of the film "didn't matter" or were rendered insignificant because of those events. However, after watching the film again, I believe there are several aspects that make Identity worthwhile. It is a film that draws you in because just when you are recovering from one mystery, there is another one which enters the scene. Events happen so rapidly that you might find yourself wanting to stop it (just to catch up and mentally take note). Another great aspect about Identity is that it makes you contemplate each scene; you can't really take any moment or scene off mentally, or you may miss something. In this way, it really is a smart thriller. Unlike some thrillers that explain everything away, this is a thriller that does the exact opposite (well, until the end), leaving you to put together all the clues.<br /><br />Whether you like this movie or not, or find it an effective thriller/psychological mystery will depend on whether you "buy" the ending. Things aren't really what they seem, and you have to view the film in terms of two distinct plot lines that only at the end of the film tie together. Those who despise Identity will take the ending to be a stunt; those who enjoy it may see it as a clever technique. We have often seen the thriller and await the twist, hoping to be able to predict it. I must say that Identity is a film that offers two puzzles. At the very least, Identity takes a different course to get to its conclusion, and separates itself in a good way from many of the predictable (blah) thrillers out there. The extra include a few deleted scenes, director commentary, and an on the set documentary.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile thriller to check out.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>"Identity" is the kind of film where you need to pay attention the entire time. There are moments in the film that you will need to remember in order to understand what is happening.<br /><br />"Identity" is about 10 people that get stuck at a motel during a bad storm. One by one each of the 10 people are turing up dead. Meanwhile, in a place that is unknown a psychiatrist is trying to prove a man innocent convicted of murder. Without spoiling the film, this is all I can say about the plot.<br /><br />"Identity" is a great film that keeps you guessing to the very end. This is the way a great thriller film is made.<br />Also, John Crusack and Ray Liotta did a great job!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>I think there are two basic types of movie watchers. The first goes into each film trying to figure it out. That's the whole goal. If they succeed, then the movie is "predictable" and "stupid". If not, then the "plot made no sense" or "whole thing was just so boring" and other comments. No way to win.<p>The second type of movie watcher sees the film to enjoy the movie and does not make guessing the twists or the endings the whole goal. This is me. Because of this, I was truly able to enjoy "Identity", especially when the story took its turn. <p>You see, anyone remotely familiar with great stories in the last hundred years has heard of Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None" where one by one people die at the hand of some unknown killer on site, since leaving the scene is impossible. The killer must be one of them. For the first hour, this appears to be a retread of this classic tale.<p>At this point in the movie, either you are in category 1 and you hate the film, or you are in category 2 and you love it because it will challenge you and it will hit you hard. Even if you are able to see the surprise coming, you have to admit that looking through the story it does not cheat. It stays faithful to the parameters it has set and that's all you can ask.<p>Yes, the acting is good and the screenplay is well executed and editing and all that, but this film does not depend on the actors. It works well as fiction and I think you could have replaced the actors with other capable performers and not lost much. Very few people I have spoken with have been real concerned with Cusack's or Liotta's performances.<p>I will admit that the very end seems a little tacked on. Hollywood seems to have a formula they have to follow and one is an ending like this one. It works, but it is unnecessary. The movie actually twists twice and it does not have to. <p>Just look at the comments throughout these reviews. Most are either love or hate. I think some people get mad when movies put one over on them... not me! I was first in line to get the DVD when it came out. This is simply one of the most effective horror movies I have ever seen. It's Hitchcock meets Christie meets Steven King. I hope you enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Ten strangers are trapped in a hotel on a dark and stormy night.  One by one they begin to die and each body is accompanied by a room key, counting down from 10 to 1.  The atmosphere is suitably spooky and the action is intense.  The ensemble cast, led by John Cusack and Ray Liotta, does a good job of portraying a random bunch of people, from an actress to a convicted murderer.  Gradually the pieces begin to fall into place and the viewer begins to understand the tangled web of this psychological drama.  It makes for an entertaining evening, but sometimes less is better, as in the case of the original book &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; by Agatha Christie.  Still, this movie is well-done and worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Imagine ten characters mostly unknown to each other, and they are trapped in a local motel because of the hard rain falling.  Then suddenly, they start to vanish one after another leaving only a room key numbered 10, 9, 8....  Is this a clue, or a message.  If message, from whom?<p>These travellers include John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay.  One is a policeman; another a chauffer; another his employer (and a has-been star).  Inspite of their varied personal background, they seem to have something in common, which is to be revealed sooner or later.  <p>If you are a total stranger to the genre, you might not notice it, but this idea is clearly borrowed from Agatha Christie novels.  But &quot;Identity&quot; gives an unexpected twist ... which is provided by the 11th character.  That is a crucial point, but some of you will detect the plot device, one of the pivotical point of &quot;Identity,&quot; in the middle of the story.  If so, just keep on watching, because another big surprise is waiting for you.<p>And that is also the weakness of the film, too.  As the plot unravels, the mysterious atmosphere gets thinner.  That is inevitable, considering the nature of the film.  Still, if you see the opening of the film which has a tense, sinister feeling all around, you might well regret the loss of it.  <p>Director James Mangold's foray into thriller is pretty successful, even though what he does is actually recycled from old classic films of the genre.  But he does it very competently, and it is certain that you get thrills especially from the first part of the film. <p>But the most memorable contribution to &quot;Identity&quot; is done from its production designer Mark Friedberg and its photographer Phedon Papamichael.  And like his previous &quot;Girl, Interrupted,&quot; James Mangold is endowed with talented cast.  Kudos to these great cast and crew, and &quot;Identity&quot; is a fairly good thriller though we ALMOST want to see it again to check in this motel.  Shame that there is no Norman here.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Ten strangers, a chauffeur, an actress past her prime, a call-girl, a cop who is transporting a killer, a pair of newlyweds, and a family in emergency are stranded at an isolated motel during a wicked rainstorm.  It appears that they all have something that they attempt to hide, however, their secrets begins to unravel as they are killed one by one.  Their only key to survival seems be related to their their secrets, which they have to reveal if they want to stay alive.  Identity is an intriguing film with a clever plot based on an Agatha Christie novel, and like all of Agatha Christie's novels there are several clues for the audience to try to figure out who the killer is.  Nevertheless, Identity brings a dark story to the audience that can cause puzzlement and bewilderment, which in the end offers a fine cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>Just think of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Negroes, Hitchcock's Psycho,and add Raising Cain to the mould and what you get is one of the most intelligent suspense thrillers I have seen in a long while, with a twist at the end that will truly shock you.<br />However these comparisons are more related to the mood, setting and atmosphere of the film rather than the content or style ,for James Mangold (Girls Interrupted, Copland) manages to direct  Michael Cooney's original script with his own undeniable touch.<br />I will not write a lot about the story of the film, since it is the kind that the viewer should watch with a degree of ignorance in order to discover it all by him/herself, and any hints might very well ruin the explosive end:<br />Save to say that during a violent storm a group of people become stranded in a remote motel,and soon enough they start dropping dead one by one in mysterious and sinister circumstances.Of course, nothing is really what it seems, and there lies a secret behind these deaths that unless you are a brightest of your local Mensa group,it will come totally unexpected.(Thank God I am not, and the ending blew my mind)<br />Mangold is an able director, and he manages successfully to create the right mood for his film from the very start and keep the suspense till the very end, with the help of spot on editing.<br />One aspect of Cooney's script which I found very well covered, is the fact that despite the relatively large number of characters in the film,each one (in varying degress of course), gets enough treatment to make him/her much more interesting.(Suspense/horror thrillers with many characters tend to emphasize more on two or three characters,leaving the rest not more than extras.)<br />The casting was made of fine actors such as John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Rebecca De Mornay.But, personally watching any film, I largely expect the big stars to deliver their end of the bargain flawlessly,and some names are enough to attract the viewers regardless of the genre, yet I love to discover the little relatively unknown supporting actors and actresses who give a performance as good if not better as their star colleagues. And surely enough, in Identity, I was greatly impressed by the performance of Pruitt Taylor Vince, notwithstanding his relatively short time on screen.He was the best thing in the average Trapped and yet again he proves that he is an actor of immense capabilities.<br />So if you want an intelligent suspense film, with a great script, direction and acting, a movie that you will think about long after the credits roll, then look no further, for Identity is such a film, a valuable addition to your movie library.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>Cusack was always been a mixed bag for me; sometimes I love him, sometimes I'm not, it's just that simple. "Identity" was a time that I really loved him. The movie is complex and confusing, but has an ending that actually answers all the questions brought to light, instead of leaving them to the viewer to decide what happened. Peet was a nice addition to the cast. A must see for mystery fans.<p>DVD is great so is the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Talk about turning a genre inside out. The suspenseful Identity has all the twists and turns of a maze with just as many dead ends. The film starts out like a conventional thriller about a psychotic killer and an attempt to stay his execution. A parallel plot focuses on 10 people who are all trapped at an isolated motel due to a horrible storm. <p>Suddenly, one of them is picking the others off one by one. There's something almost supernatural about the way this version of And Then There None plays. John Cusack plays a former LA cop who is transporting an actress to Los Angeles. He, along with the other 9 individuals, ends up being trapped at this hotel.<p>James Mangold creates considerably suspense with his unorthodox aproach to the material. The screenplay was --surprise--written by the screenwriter for Jack Frost and Jack Frost 2. Actually, I'm not surprised he wrote those absurd slasher flicks. They played with the conventions of the genre albeit less successfully and with a much weaker premise than Identity. <p>The cast all give fine performances particularly the edgy Ray Liotta and John Cusack. Rebecca Morney and Amanda Peet subvert the stereotypical roles their assigned in the movie and also give fine, strong performances. Identity reminds me of Psycho crossed with And Then There Were None. While the mystery at the heart of the film is important, like many amusement rides, it's also about the twists and turns you take on the rollercoaster that are just as important.<p>The DVD features a special extended version as well as the theatrical version. Both are very effective although I found the theatrical version a bit more powerful--the suspense is unrelenting. Identity would be the type of picture that Hitchcock might have done in his prime (if it was possible to do these types of films during his day)or Jonathan Demme when his work was edgier (a la Silence of the Lambs or Some Like It Wild).<p>The picture and sound are outstanding and the interactive menu is quite clever as well. The deleted scenes do add a bit more of character depth but, on the whole, it's clear why they were cut--it hurt the pacing of the picture. Why the film includes both the widescreen and fullscreen versions is beyond me. I realize that some folks prefer fullscreen but that's what the zoom feature on DVDs are for. All of the grit and grime of Mangold's stylized visual compositions are aparent on this terrific transfer. There's also a director commentary but I'd suggest watching the film without it the first time as it might spoil some of the &quot;secrets&quot; of the film.<p>It's a pity this terrific thriller wasn't marketed better or released in a less crowded market; it could easily have been the next Silence of the Lambs or Psycho. In the meantime while you're watching this film stay out of dark motel rooms and avoid looking in the mirror.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>IDENTITY is a clever premise that is expertly executed.  This flick pulls you in with an honestly good mix of atmosphere, pacing, plotting, and performance.  A feeling of impending doom shrouds the story revolving around a group of strangers stranded at a remote motel in the unending rain.  When they start getting bumped off one by one ala AGATHA CHRISTIE, the fun begins as the interesting plot unfolds into something unexpectedly non cookie cutter hollywood.  The movie plows though it's ninety minutes and gives the viewer some cool unexpected curves.  An excellent late night noirish chiller that hits the mark.  The 'alternate ending' on the DVD is really nothing special.  There are very subtle differences that do not change the impact of the film.  The film itself, however, is well worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Well, I was bored and decided to rent some cheap horror movie for some laughs and so forth.

But, all of these characters have secrets and when one by one, they start getting murdered, something weird's going on. The ending is highly unpredictable with a great twist.

But this is a film that packs all of the suspense and entertainment value of The Sixth Sense into an original screenplay about a serial killer on the loose. Haunting in its presentation, yet far from a traditional horror film, Identity follows the exploits of ten strangers who become stranded at a Nevada hotel in the midst of a massive rainstorm. One-by-one, they are being killed off, but no one knows the true identity of the killer...<br /><br />A number of seemingly unrelated people gather at a small roadside motel in a Nevada desert location. Strangers to each other, the people descend from all different types of professions and lifestyles - a limousine driver and his movie star client, a policeman (Ray Liotta) transporting a convict, two parents with their young son, a prostitute (Amanda Peet), a young couple, and the motel's manager (John Hawkes). All of them are trapped on the grounds of the motel due to a record rainstorm that's made the roads impassable. Beset by darkness, each of the motel guests resigns to his fate and settles down to ride out the storm. The guests even make an attempt to socialize with one another.<br /><br />But when one motel guest turns up dead, suspicions are raised. When it's revealed that an escaped convict, (Jake Busey), is on the loose, the guests become panicked. Ed (John Cusack) becomes de facto leader of the small group of strangers who begin suspect each other when the convict is captured and the killings continue. Is the true killer among them? Or is someone else (or something else) on the motel grounds with them? Far away, in an undisclosed location, a psychiatrist is feverishly attempting to prove the innocence of a man accused of murder, and the answer lies right before him...<br /><br />Although it's a decent film, Identity falls into the teenage horror film device of having each character wander off alone - despite the fact that people who wander off alone continually turn up dead. However, I'm usually willing to overlook such things if the rest of the film is decent because a movie's objective is to entertain, and Identity does that...<br /><br />The darkness of the setting, coupled with intermittent thunder and the pattering of rain, create an all-encompassing sense of suspense bordering on fear. Rain muffles sound, so how can you hear if someone's sneaking up behind you? Identity is a unique and original film most movie lovers will enjoy. The plot device is employed with the utmost efficiency, keeping the audience guessing until the very end. Who is the real killer? You'll have to watch Identity to find out...<br /><br />Presenting a knockout performance by John Cusack, Identity is one of the surprise films of 2003. The dialogue is fresh, not stiff, and the characters are well-rounded considering many of them do not live through most of the scenes. With a surprise ending reminiscent of 1990s smash hits, The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects, Identity (although nowhere near as good as those films) is a film you won't want to miss. Due to its well-written storyline and crescendo of suspense, Identity is a definite must-see movie...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I watched this movie one night really liked it,is like the old kind of movies back in late 70s and 80s..Really nice scrip and acting.

'Identity' may be the answer that you're looking for, as it is a clever and dark thriller with a solid story, a terrific cast and a great look and feel to it all.  The film revolves around ten strangers who end up at a little motel due to a horrible storm.  All of them have been brought there by chance... or, is it a little more complicated than that?  They think they're out of the woods until people start getting butchered left and right, in a countdown fashion.  What appears to be nothing more than a murderer on the loose having his or her fun ends up being something a lot more sinister and threatening.  Have these ten individuals been picked at random, or have their fates been sealed from the very beginning?<br /><br />When I started watching this, I thought to myself, 'Oh boy, I bet you I know exactly how this is going to end.'  I was wrong.  The film takes a lot of clever and unexpected twists that really goes to show you how great a thriller can really be if the right brains are behind it all.  It has some great suspense and frightening moments, an intriguing plot that likes to play around with your mind, and it delivers a very confident presentation.  You'll recognize a good majority of the cast, as some of them include John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet and Rebecca DeMornay.  All are great, especially Cusack who proves that he can be a successful lead role in a top-notch thriller.<br /><br />The DVD has some cool goodies to offer.  You can watch it in widescreen or fullscreen, depending on which is your preference.  You also have the choice to watch the theatrical cut, or the extended version (not to be mistaken for a 'director's cut').  I must be honest and admit that the extended version is really not worth it.  The added scene does nothing to enhance the movie and the so-called 'alternate ending' isn't alternate at all, as it is merely extended by only a few seconds.  It was interesting to watch, but again it really doesn't do anything special for the film.  Stick with the theatrical version, then watch the extended version if you're still curious.  Trust me, the theatrical version is the way to go.  Other bonuses included on the DVD are deleted scenes, commentary, storyboard comparisons, theatrical trailer, filmographies and a behind the scenes featurette.  The film looks and sounds great.<br /><br />'Identity' is definitely something that should be checked out by those who are tired by the usual flops that dare to call themselves 'thrillers.'  This is a successful and smart thriller that offers chills along with an impressive script and cast.  Just be sure to give it a chance.  You may think you have it all figured out when it starts, but trust me when I tell you that this movie will play around with your brain until the ending credits.  A more than well-done thriller that doesn't disappoint and is worth re-watching again and again. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>This is so reminding me of Brian DePalma (I remember commenting the first ten minutes into Identity).  There is no doubt that director James Mangold is drawing heavily on a DePalma influence, or perhaps tapping into a Hitchcock vein.  Whatever the case, this thriller is just the fix I've been after without even realizing it.<p>I admit to being partial to the cast.  John Cusack (Ed the limo driver with a past) is an actor I will go out of my way to see any time; needless to say, he is brilliant here too.  Amanda Peet, playing a hooker trying to turn her life around, brings her trademark tough smarts to the role and does a great job as always.  Ray Liotta plays his usual sinister-guy-posing-as-normal character, but here it fits nicely.  Rebecca DeMornay's washed-up TV star part is brief enough to nearly qualify as a cameo, but memorable.  The rest of the crew complement this roundup as the assorted bunch that arrive together at the isolated motel on that fateful stormy night that a murderous evil runs amok somewhere outside - or is it inside?<p>Never fear, this is no mere slasher flick. This *is* a deliciously creepy Whodunit with an added slice of suspense. It is also a real psychological thriller in the old school sense.  In true Hitchcockian tradition there is an underlying plot that manages to bring together the seemingly random people and events that clash so chaotically. The little clues that are dropped here and there are just intriguing enough to give us a taste for the twist that we just know is coming (why is there blood on the back of Ray's shirt just before he covers it up with his jacket?  What's up with the Indian tombs outside?)  Naturally, there is also a false lead or two.  By the time the real killer is revealed we can click those puzzles pieces together with great satisfaction and wonder at how we didn't see the big picture all along.<p>If I had to compare Identity to another recent film, I would say Memento is the closest in style and quality.  In any event, I'd recommend Identity to anybody who enjoys this classic thriller subgenre.<p>-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>My son brought this film home from the local rental place  and, though having never heard of it, I decided to watch it on the strength of the cast, which is stellar. I must say that it is a highly entertaining, atmospheric,  and intriguing  thriller that focuses on ten people, ostensible strangers to each other, who, through a seeming twist of fate, meet one dark and stormy night at a seedy  motel in the middle of nowhere. <p>There, a strange fate begins to over take them, as one by one they meet up with a mysterious killer. No one knows who amongst them is the killer. No one knows who is next. Yet, there is apparently  a link that binds them all. There is also a parallel story involving a convicted killer that  opens the film and continues to be interjected at odd moments throughout the film. It is a story that is also interesting and becomes more so as the film continues. <p>There are subtle clues along the way that point the viewer in the right direction, in terms of what is really going on. The viewer, however, will generally realize this in hindsight, which is, of course, always twenty/twenty. The pace of the film is relentless. The tension is palpable. The acting is top notch. The direction is first rate, and the ending screams out, &quot;Gotcha!&quot;.<p>This is a surprisingly effective psychological thriller that all those who love films of this genre should enjoy.  There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep even the most jaded viewers on their toes. While the performances of the entire cast are uniformly excellent, special kudos go to John Cusack for a truly powerful, memorable performance. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>The movie begins with a subplot of a killer's interview.  Next, on a dark and stormy night, many lives will come together.  George York (John C. McGinley - Dr. Cox from Scrubs) along with his wife Alice and stepson Timothy have a blowout.  Alice is hit by limo driver Ed (John Cusack) driving movie star Caroline (Rebecca De Mornay).  They rush to the closest phone, which is at an out-of-the-way hotel.  Joining them for the evening, also trapped by the storm and flooding, is hooker Paris (how appropriate) played by Amanda Peet, and Officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey - don't Busey's make the best bad guys?), and a young couple whose passtime is arguing.<br /><br />Rhodes' prisoner escapes, and then people begin to turn up dead.  Secrets are revealed, there are arguments, a lot of creeping around in the rain, and nail-biting suspense.  But there's more to this movie than just the typical whodunit.  Where is the connection between these people?  The key to the puzzle is much more complex than you think.  The plot twists and twists again in a most satisfying manner.  I can't say any more without revealing spoilers.<br /><br />John Cusack and Ray Liotta give stellar performances, and John C. McGinley is good in everything he does.  The film is well photographed and the atmosphere is sufficiently dreary to create the required mood.  This is a great movie for a group of friends and a large bowl of buttered popcorn.  Keep the lights on.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>IDENTITY didn't make great waves at the Australian box office, and I am surprised by that. I finally saw it on DVD recently and was very impressed by it, and consider it one of the best films of 2003.<p>10 characters end up at a Bates-like Motel, with seemingly nothing in common.  When people start dying, it becomes a case of who-dunnit. To tell anymore would give it away, but let me say it is one of the most original twist endings I have seen in a long time.<p>John Cusack is excellent, as is Ray Liota.  Rebecca Mornay makes a comeback in this film, if only for 10 minutes.  You will not recognise her at first with her brunette hair.<p>Ignore the negative reviews, Identity is a clever and imaginative film which blew me away! I had the DVD in my possession for awhile choosing not to watch it because of its poor performance at the box office.  Howeverm, that was my loss, because the film was excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>I had high hopes for this movie.  After all, headlining it were John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet, three actors that I've come to respect and admire.<p>I had high hopes.  And I wasn't disappointed! (It didn't hurt anything that Jake Busey had a role, either...)<p>IDENTITY is a movie unto itself.  It's not the greatest phsycological suspense movie ever made (Hitchock probably had a hand in that movie) but it's pretty damn good.<p>Okay, here's the plot: ten strangers wind up, by chance (or so it seems) at a motel in the middle of nowhere, on a night filled with rain, thunder, lightning, and all the rest of that suspensful stuff.  Among them are: a limo-driver (Cusack) and his employer; a prostitute (Peet) heading home for Florida; a man, his stepchild, and his wife (who's involved in an accident before she reaches the hotel); a young newlywed couple; and a cop (Liotta) escorting an inmate (Busey).  Also thrown into the mix is the manager of the hotel who, while no Bates, possesses an air of innocent mystery.<p>Everything, while not alright, is certainly not dangerous...until the convict escapes, and the killings begin.<p>But there is a question that plagues the occupants of the hotel: is the convict really the killer?  And if not him...then who?<p>Trust me, ladies and gents--despite what you think, you'll not be able to predict the ending of this awesome, creepy, thought-provking, and downright enjoyable movie.  The ending is, indeed, what I would consider to be a classic--I just wish I could tell you more, but I can't.<p>In this movie, no one--and I mean no one, ladies and gents--is who they seem to be.  And that's what makes this movie--much more than a glorified &quot;who-dunit&quot;, in case that's what you were thinking--so suspensful and exciting.<p>IDENTITY is a rarity: a movie for adults (don't go into this expecting a simple, Barney-esque plot) that gives its viewers a childish glee.  A must-see!  I mean it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>I have to admit that there were'nt too many scares in this flick but it was still very entertaining. Some people compare Identity to Memento, an over-praised train wreck of a movie in my opinion. Don't be scared away by this comparison, Identity is a fine movie. <p>  A great cast, including John Cusack and Ray Liotta, is brought together to a lonely desert motel during a bad storm, or so it seems. The whole concept behind this movie is not new, but the interpretation and the execution of that concept is very original. The film's final revelations are, to me, the best parts of Identity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>I think there are two basic types of movie watchers.  The first goes into each film trying to figure it out.  That's the whole goal.  If they succeed, then the movie is "predictable" and "stupid".  If not, then the "plot made no sense" or "whole thing was just so boring" and other comments.  No way to win.<p>The second type of movie watcher sees the film to enjoy the movie and does not make guessing the twists or the endings the whole goal.  This is me.  Because of this, I was truly able to enjoy "Identity", especially when the story took its turn.  <p>You see, anyone remotely familiar with great stories in the last hundred years has heard of Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None" where one by one people die at the hand of some unknown killer on site, since leaving the scene is impossible.  The killer must be one of them.  For the first hour, this appears to be a retread of this classic tale.<p>At this point in the movie, either you are in category 1 and you hate the film, or you are in category 2 and you love it because it will challenge you and it will hit you hard.  Even if you are able to see the surprise coming, you have to admit that looking through the story it does not cheat.  It stays faithful to the parameters it has set and that's all you can ask.<p>Yes, the acting is good and the screenplay is well executed and editing and all that, but this film does not depend on the actors.  It works well as fiction and I think you could have replaced the actors with other capable performers and not lost much.  Very few people I have spoken with have been real concerned with Cusack's or Liotta's performances.<p>I will admit that the very end seems a little tacked on.  Hollywood seems to have a formula they have to follow and one is an ending like this one.  It works, but it is unnecessary.  The movie actually twists twice and it does not have to.  <p>Just look at the comments throughout these reviews.  Most are either love or hate.  I think some people get mad when movies put one over on them... not me!  I'll be first in line to get the DVD when it comes out.  This is simply one of the most effective horror movies I have ever seen.  It's Hitchcock meets Christie meets Steven King.  I hope you enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>The best part about &quot;Identity&quot; is that it didn't drag on for long amounts of time, and it felt like it started right away. It stars John Cusack from &quot;Serendipity&quot; and this is a totally different kind of movie. &quot;Serendipity&quot; being a sweet, romantic comedy, while &quot;Identity&quot; is a dark and disturbing thriller. It is loosely based on the mystery story &quot;And Then There Was One&quot; written by crime writer Agatha Cristie. I never read the story, so I can't say how similar the two are, but I know the basic ideas, and both of the stories are pretty much the same, plot wise. An istant problem with &quot;Identity&quot; is Ray Liotta who is a terrible actor. He is similar to Dennis Quiad, who is worse. Dennis Quaid seems to overact in every movie that I see him in, including &quot;The Alamo&quot; and &quot;Far From Heaven.&quot; Liotta also overacts, only he does it worse. He never seems to be able to grab his character and steer him in the right direction. It always feels like he is reading his lines on a cue card taped on a wall. Amanda Peet was in the movie. She is a cute little actress, who is good in &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; and &quot;The Whole Ten Yards,&quot; but this is another actress who is in a totally different role based on her past movies. The rest of the cast seems to be filled with unknowns except for Prutt Taylor Vince who is thought was good in &quot;Simone&quot; as well as Alfred Molina, who having no clue who he was when I saw this in the theatre, but recently saw him in the comic gem &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes.&quot; <p>&quot;Identity&quot; starts off with the audience being introduced to Malcolm Rivers. He is charged with such a heavy crime, that he is about to be executed the next day. His psychiatrist wants to prove that Rivers is not mentally able to be the person to commit the crimes, and he convinced a judge to stand before Rivers and check again to make sure he didn't really commit his crimes. Miles away in a small hotel, a flash flood has brought many strangers together. George, his wife Alice, and his stepson Timmy have pulled into a hotel after an accident injured Alice. The accident had Alice getting hit by limo driver Ed, who hit her while they were changing a tire. Ed is bringing the former famous actress Caroline to wherever she needs to be. They go to the hotel after learning that the roads are flooded, and it turns out that the phones at the hotel do not work because of an accident involving a women named Paris hitting the telephone polls. Two more clusters of people come to the hotel. One is a cop named Rhodes who is bringing a murderer to someplace, and a newlywed couple. All of these people rent rooms in the hotel from Larry, and everything is alright. They agreed to wait until the storm lets up to get help. Everything is going fine until one of the guests die in a brutal way. Everyone is shocked and one by one the guests begin to die, as the remaining people try to figure out who is doing the killing, and who is going to be killed next, while also trying not to be killed, all leading up to a surprising and shocking conclusion.<p>&quot;Identity&quot; is a great thriller, and it is short enough to never be distracted by it. It seemed like it went very fast, and it only clocked in at around 95 minutes. I was really impressed by the ending, and it's one of those movies where you can't have anybody tell you what happens. It would only ruin the experience for you. Even though some movies with a surprise twist are easy to watch again, like &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; and &quot;Godsend&quot; this is not one of them. This is one of those movies where the twist affects the entire movie. In order not to ruin the movie, watch &quot;Identity&quot; and watch &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; back to back. The entire movie of &quot;Identity&quot; is based on the twist, and without it, it would be a totally different movie. The twist makes the movie better than it really is, even though this is a good movie. It is very entertaining, fun, and it has it share of good acting. Watch it once without anybody interrupting or ruining it for you, and then remember it, because it'll be better if you don't see it again. Leave a fresh image of this movie in your mind.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for Strong Violence and Language.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>nicely done thriller with a different version of the Agatha Christie novel with 12 strangers stranded at a inn and then they all start to die some how. great suspense and mystery keeps you at bay till the shocking revealing of whats really happening. an all star cast includes the awesome John Cusack and Ray Liotta.

I loved every minute. Two thumbs way up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>It has been a while since there has been such a great murder mystery than this one. While recently having to sit thru a horrible film that didn't have a drop of fear or intrigue, it is refreshing to see a film that knows how to be scary and have fun doing it. Credit director James Mangold for his stylish, noirish eye, and screenwriter Michael Cooney for concocting a devilish web of mystery and suspense. It's the kind of movie that you will know right off the bat that you will really get into. It all starts during a dark and stormy night. Of course!. It's raining heavily and roads out in the middle of Nevada have been washed out. A group of strangers have been forced to seek shelter at this seedy, off the road motel. They have all crossed paths just minutes before, and it is show thru flashbacks how each one got connected together and ended up at the motel. There is Ed(John Cusack), a limo driver with a past job that makes him a strong leader in working out the mystery. He is driving a washed up actress(Rebecca DeMornay, who despite a hair color change, still looks great). She is the epitome of a spoiled, rich starlet. Success starved, and not willing to spend time in some mundane motel that doesn't have room service. Then there is Ginny(Clea DuValle), and her new husband Lou, who seem to not be the happiest of newlyweds. There's motel manager Larry(John Hawkes), who has some interesting secrets of his own; prostitute Paris(Amanda Peet), who is turning 30 in a week and just wants to go back home to Florida to grow oranges; and a normal, suburban type family led by John C. McGinley of "Scrubs", along with his wife(Leila Kenzle from "Mad About You" fame), and young son Timothy. Then things get weird when a cop named Rhoades(Ray Liotta), shows up with a prisoner(Jake Busey), in tow. He was supposed to be transferring the prisoner when they got caught up in the storm. There are numerous other things that have gone on and more in depth descriptions of the people, but telling would be spoiling all of the twists and turns this movie will take and how it will keep you thinking. Suddenly, one by one, the stranded motorists begin getting knocked off. When you think one way, you are suddenly proven wrong and think another way, until you finally come to the conclusion that you have no idea what is going on. The mystery is mind boggling and the turns in the story are clever and a lot of fun to figure out. Although you won't. You think that the murderer can't quite possibly pull this off, but it's even more interesting trying to figure out just who is behind it. The performances here are all stand out. Cusack is his usual reliable self, and Liotta is always convincing in everything he does. The rest are all up to the task as well. Jake Busey as the prisoner is good too. Then again, put someone with the last name of Busey in a psycho role, and you usually get an interesting performance. The movie really gets you to think, and Mangold's direction and keen eye for setting up chills and suspense are right on. The rain, the motel, the atmosphere, they are all just as much a part of the cast and the main story as the cast and story itself. What I always love about movies like this that have an eclectic cast of characters and actors is that I love watching how the different personalities interact and how they either disintegrate in the madness, or change for the better because of it. I have to say that the ending, while it may seem like a disappointment, is still very well executed and wonderfully constructed. It is a nice twist, but it does damage, in some way, what you have invested in it up to that point. I wasn't really disappointed because I thought that they had done it in a very creative, and well imagined way. Some people missed that. I really don't know what else to say without getting too much into the movie and giving things away. "Identity" is a suspense thriller that brings respect and dignity back to the genre. See it!.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>....the premise is silly and the ending sillier in this so-called psychological mystery. Without trying to give too much away, I'd have felt more better if the Liotta character was actually the mass murderer and he and Amanda Peet were left to fight to the death, so to speak--this to me, simply became one dark, gloomy and soggy night at the 'Don't Drop In' Motor Inn. Even though the creators tried to keep it from being another horror-slash film like Halloween, (maybe to revitalise that genre for an older demographic--the original audiences for the 80's slasher film), in my opinion, that's exactly how it comes off, except the victims are not horny, drunk teenagers. It also has the feel of the director shooting scenes just as the writer(s) come up with new pages of dialog. Which was okay in those days when they were doing those corny Sat Morning Matinee serials. The only redeeming value of this movie, to me, is that it has that glamourous De Mornay in it for a split second... A far more creepier, more intense and nastier show is the 80's moderate budget movie The Hitcher with Rutger Hauer and C Thomas Howell. Don't get Punk'd on this. There ain't no Kutcher involved and thusly it ain't much fun.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This is really a mess.  One wonders how such movies get made.  James Mangold, who was off to such fine start in his directorial career with the critically acclaimed Heavy (1995) and the superior psychodrama Girl, Interrupted (1999), and even the slightly offbeat but intriguing Cop Land (1997), really loses it here with this bizarro attempt at something like Psycho and David and Lisa meet Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians."<p>The premise is ridiculous and the resolution just plain silly.  Without revealing anything (the denouement of the obtuse plot being perhaps the only thing that might keep the thumb of most intelligent viewers over the age of, say, fourteen, off the stop button) let me say that when it's over you just might feel cheated.  <p>John Cusack stars as an ex-cop, now a chauffeur, who can suture wounds.  The scene is the Nevada/California desert during a savage downpour that traps ten (+1) people at an isolated motel where bloody mayhem of the most inexplicable sort ensues as one by one the guests turn up dead.  The action consists of wet people screaming and staring with horror at such sights as a dead man with a baseball bat shoved three-quarters of the way down his throat, etc.  They insult each other a lot.  Prostitutes don't like cops; little guys who never got any, hate prostitutes, and the little boy doesn't really love his mommy, etc.  As the coincidences pile up (as the motel proprietor remarked, with the odds against being "trillions to one") we begin to realize that either something supernatural is going on or...  You guessed it.  It's all a....<p>But I can't say.  We do get a hint of how everything will turn out when Mangold flash-forwards to a group of shrinks and other interested parties who are holding a kind of seance around what seems to be John Cusack's character.<p>Anyway, even the acting is not that good with the usually very fine Cusack seemingly infected by the deficiencies of the other players, or the stupidities of the script, or the impatient-to-get-it-over-with direction by Mangold.  (I don't think the actors wanted too many takes in all that water, and it shows.)  At any rate if you want to see a little kid and some mediocre actors overact or a lot of people deadpan the horror their eyes spy while barking at each other or you just like seeing Hollywood players have to make a living while wet, go for it.  Otherwise, hit the off button and watch reruns of "That 70's Show."</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Identity was a pretty good movie runied by a predictable ending. The film reminded of Lifeboat but with a scarier atompshere. The film in my opinion really didn't have any jump out of your seat moments. John Cuscack and Ray Lioltta are in top form as always and Amanda Peet looks yummy as always. My only other compliant with the film was that Jake Busey had such a small part. Still it's James Mangold best film since Copland and worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Ever see Memento? <p>Identity's like that. It takes place in another person's mind. It's disjointed. It tells the events out of order. The order of the movie's scenes gives insight into what's really happening. And of course, people die and nobody's sure who did it or how. <p>Identity is not quite as slick as Memento. It's choppy at parts, disjointed or just plain plays dirty pool in others. <p>10 strangers end up stranded in the rain at a creepy hotel. The laws of their world slowly unravel as they attempt to escape -- cell phones don't work, cars can't cross the flooded roads, and accidents happen that keep them from escaping the area and each other. <p>There's a lot of interesting characters. There's the cop and the serial killer con he's escorting to an execution. There's the limo driver who was once a cop. There's the hooker with a heart of gold. The couple who just got married because the girl's pregnant. The average family, complete with silent little boy and weird stepdad. The bitchy washed-up actress. And of course, the freaky hotel owner. <p>Everyone in the movie has a secret. The secrets unravel as things go from bad to worse and each person gets bumped off. Some of the deaths are accidents, some are outright murders. All of them leave the corpse with a hotel key, in the order of each person killed. Things get REALLY weird when the hotel keys starting showing up on corpses that died by accident. <p>If you haven't figured it out yet, the rest of this review contains a spoiler. It's the only way I can talk about the film with any candor. So kiddies who don't want the ending spoiled for them, leave the room. <p>Identity takes place in Malcolm Rivers' head. He has 10 personalities in there banging around and Malcolm is about to be executed for murder. Malcolm murdered a bunch of people at a hotel (six victims, I believe), stabbing them to death. But his psychiatrist submits that Malcolm is legally insane and that a new drug treatment will force the personalities to eliminate each other. <p>The premise of Identity is great. I also figured it out five minutes into the film. If you pay attention, the pictures in the first few minutes of the film -- along with certain phrases said by the patient -- are repeated by characters within the movie. In that respect, Identity is internally consistent. If you know that (and when I was watching this with my brother, he didn't catch it), the rest of the movie falls into place pretty quickly. <p>I couldn't help but feel the cut scenes involving the psychiatrist broke up the flow. I wanted a real mystery that strung me along and it felt like Identity thought I was too stupid to keep up. <p>And yet, Identity is definitely an expertly crafted work. There's even a surprise twist -- the dominant personality isn't who you think it is (SURPRISE!) but what's irritating is that while every other twist and turn can be figured out, the final twist simply can't be predicted. <p>In essence, the movie is internally consistent until it isn't, and I felt a bit betrayed by the way it ended. <p>On the other hand, the ending is delicious. It's grimly cynical but perfectly poised, a tribute to everything Hitchcockian and &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (which the film directly references). Identity loses points for not being perfectly consistent, but it's still a damn fine movie. <p>Oh yeah. John Cusack kicks ass in anything with him in it. That boosts a movie normally that would get a 4 from me to a 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />I respect the fact that Identity tries to offer the audience something more than your standard slasher film, but **spoiler alert** multiple personalities is about the most cliched "twist" imaginable and all the pieces don't add up--Identity may be an interesting failure, but it's still a failure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>James Mangold Identity is one hell of a movie. The twist is amazing, didn't see that coming. The ending will shock you to pieces. John Cusack and Amanda Peet are superb in their roles, he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to Flordia. Clea Duvall also appears in this film, Duvall was previously in Girl, Interrupted (another Mangold film). This film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes. Great direction, top-notch acting, and awesome plot. Identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time, I highly recommend this engrossing little film.</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>I will say the ending of this movie totally caught me off guard, but aside of that, I did not really like this movie liked I hoped I would.  I'm usually a major fan of thrillers.  I think the main problem I had with the movie is the suspense never had a chance to build.  Just when things would get interesting, the climax for the scene would happen, and it was over too quick.<br /><br />10 strangers find themselves stuck together on a rainy night in a motel after the storm washes out the road.  One by one the strangers are being murdered, and the strangers are trying to figure out what is going on, and who is responsible.  There are a lot of twists and turns in the film.  What I did like about the DVD is it contained three versions of the movie you could choose from.  You could select Full screen, wide screen (my favorite to watch) or the extended wide screen version.  You also get some deleted scenes, but they would not have added anything to the movie except to make the movie a few minuets longer.  The acting in this film is good, and this film has an excellent cast.  John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay and Jake Busey.  My reason for giving this film a 2 score is the movie was not as thrilling as I had hoped it would be.  This is the type of movie you will watch once.  It's not the type of movie you will find yourself watching over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>One can see why this ensemble cast of talent was drawn to this project. It is your classic "Who dun it?" with all the hallmarks of the great crime stories over the last century. If this film had a narrator, the picture would begin with, "It was a dark and stormy night..." ~Identity~ is so rife with literary devices and tired old clich&eacute;s that it was difficult to settle in at first. However the film is well directed and the performances are not played over the top, thus one can sit back and enjoy the familiar ride. Like all great crime mysteries, the fun is gathering the clues and deducing the perpetrator - Was it the butler in the study? The maid in the kitchen?" Or was it Colonel Mustered in the drawing room? This film could almost be classified as a parody but its creators seemed to have taken it very seriously. Once we think we know what's really going on, and those involved are headed towards living `happily ever after', the story takes another unexpected twist. This is standard practice for the genre - one can only be sure that the film has really ended when the credits begin the roll. Before the film's release, seeing its trailers, my expectations, in hindsight, were a little too high. I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't this film. That said, taken for what it is, ~Identity~ is fun viewing and worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>I have heard a lot about this movie and its surprise ending.  But unlike The Sixth Sense, this move does not have a surprise ending.  All you have to do is pay attention and you will see al of the blatant clues telling you what will happen.<p>The viewer thinks they know what is going on as a collection of characters find themselves stuck at a small motel in a dreadful downpour.  Other scenes concern a mass-murderer who is getting a last-minute hearing.  The prisoner is en-route to the hearing.  But by paying attention we know that what the film wants us to think is far from true.<p>In Agatha Christie fashion, the people in the motel begin to be murdered.  Tensions and suspicions mount.  A new arrival at the hearing substantiates the earlier clues and derails the average viewer's ideas of what is going on.<p>Finally we get to the end where we resolve the relationship between the characters, the motel, the hearing and just what is going on.  No real surprise thanks to the blatant clues.  But even that hinges on believing a &quot;new treatment&quot; is possible without any explanation as to how it was done especially when it is the impossibility of said treatment that causes the dysfunction in the first place.  (sorry for being vague but there are those who will still be surprised and I don't want to spoil it).<p>The disk contains three versions: full screen, wide-screen, and extended wide-screen (extended by only a few minutes).  There are also some interesting deleted scenes (they are included in the novelization), but nothing mind-blowing.<p>A decent movie with great atmosphere (you'll never look at rain the same way) and some interesting characters.  But it could have been better if they didn't put in all of those clues.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Through the years, we have had some really unique, well-done and chilling movies that have become classics in this genre:  &quot;Psycho,&quot; &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger,&quot; &quot;Ten Little Indians,&quot; &quot;Frailty&quot; and now this wonderfully constructed mystery that combines elements of all of these and more, and yet manages to come off as quite a unique shocker in its own manipulative way.  Take your stock ten characters, place them in a motel (hmm???), an awful storm and then before you know, one by one....yes, they're picked off.  But note some of the eerie clues director Mangold posits:  why does the room number on room 6 becoming 9 important: what's that on Ray Liotta's shirt?  What are the scenes with Alfred Molina all about; nothing is as it seems in this movie and that's what makes it so much fun.  John Cusack is brilliant in his role as the cop turned chauffeur; Rebecca De Mornay does for this role what Janet Leigh did for &quot;Psycho&quot; and Angie Dickinson for &quot;Dressed to Kill.&quot;  Ray Liotta is also effective in his law enforcing role; Amanda Peet is both beautiful and impressive as the hooker going to start her own lime/orange farm.  Little Bret Roehr as Timmy is also eerily effective.  Only John McGinley who takes George a little over the top seems out of place and that's not a drawback, just one of those little petty things we have to complain about?<br />I loved the feel of this movie; the rain, the general &quot;staginess&quot; of the motel itself; De Mornay's love affair with her cell phone.<br />This is a great movie and in time think it will join those underappreciated classic mysteries of our time.<br />ENJOY!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>When flash flooding caused by heavy rains makes nearby roads impassible, 10 people are stranded at a roadside motel somewhere in the American West: a middle-aged couple with a young child (John C. McGinley &amp; Leila Kenzle), a prostitute named Paris on her way to a better life in Florida (Amanda Peet), an aging irascible actress (Rebecca DeMornay) and her driver, Edward (John Cusack), a police officer (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner, a recently married young couple (Clea DuVall &amp; William Scott Lee), and the motel's manager, Larry (John Hawkes). One by one, the stranded motorists are murdered. Edward and the police officer take it upon themselves to keep the motel's occupants safe and to find the killer, whom they immediately suspect to be the police officer's escaped prisoner. But even confining the guests to one room where they can observe one another doesn't slow the killer's progress, and panic ensues.<p>&quot;Identity&quot; is a thoroughly enjoyable suspense film that is truly worthy of the &quot;suspense&quot; genre. It's a slasher movie of sorts, with one gruesome murder after another. But the mystery of the killer's identity is emphasized over the gore. And the killer's identity truly is a mystery. Michael Cooney's clever screenplay and director James Mangold's adept direction give the audience more information than the characters have, so we believe that we may know who the killer is. This increases the audience's investment in the story and helps create suspense. But it turns out that we have incomplete information, as well, which leaves the audience to be surprised but satisfied when the killer's identity is revealed. The film's only real flaw is that we never understand exactly what happened at the motel. I found the difficulty in separating fact from fantasy when all is said and done to be frustrating. This didn't actually detract from my enjoyment of the film until the very end, though. Everyone loves a murder mystery, so I think that &quot;Identity&quot; will appeal to a wide audience -although not a squeamish audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>It's nearly impossible to review James Mangold's latest film, IDENTITY, without revealing the plot twist that makes this very enjoyable thriller 'work'...and since the director chose not to reveal it, himself, until the film was nearly over, I'll respect his vision, and not give it away!<p>Two story lines unfold; in one, psychiatrist Alfred Molina has a final session with convicted serial killer Pruitt Taylor Vince, before execution. Despite the defense claiming insanity, the court ruled against it, and the bitterness towards the murderer, and satisfaction the prosecution feels about justice being served are clearly evident, making Molina's task a nearly impossible one.<p>In the other, a chain of events strands a group of motorists together at a seedy motel, run by John Hawkes (who is excellent as the sleazy manager) during a storm. Composed of a hooker (Amanda Peet), who, with a lost shoe, began the chain; a nerdish husband (John C. McGinley), his wife, seriously injured after being struck by a car, and his stepson; the chauffeur (John Cusack) who struck the woman, and his passenger, a fading movie star (Rebecca DeMornay, who is nearly unrecognizable); a bickering young couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); and a marshal, transporting a killer (Ray Liotta and Jake Busey). With the roads flooded and phone lines down, the group is isolated...then, in a fashion similar to Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS, people begin to die! It becomes a race against time to discover who the murderer is...<p>The two story lines intertwine in a very surprising manner, making IDENTITY far superior to the 'by-the-numbers' gore-fests that pass themselves off as 'suspense', with the climactic twist a stunning revelation that is VERY effective!<p>If you like your films challenging, you're in for a treat...IDENTITY delivers!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>True story, for those who are interested; when I saw this film upon it's theatrical release I was literally scared senseless since the theater was having electrical problems and the lights in the entire theater were flickering on and off through then entire movie.  The sound was distorted and the speakers kept cracking on us, and I saw this in a rinky-dink theater that was probably near being condemned (I've since moved, so I'm not sure if it is still there or not) so it all added to the atmosphere that is created so vividly in this film.  Some may balk at the `rainy night' setting and claim it is an overused clich&eacute;, but that clich&eacute; is rarely used to such brilliant effect.<br /><br />Leave all the `flaws' at the door since this film more than makes up for them in sheer terror.<br /><br />The film is a nice twist on the typical `standard' horror film, and while the twist has been spoiled by everyone and their mother, I am determined to remain silent on the midway reveal as well as the final ending `shocker' that took my by surprise.<br /><br />The story revolves around a group of strangers who band together in a dusty old hotel while they strain to survive a killer in their midst.  They are picked off one by one and they are all determined to find out who is behind the slaughter, but pin-pointing the culprit is harder than it looks.<br /><br />Blink and you may die.<br /><br />The cast works well within their character definitions (which is important to the flow of the story and the eventual revelations at bay) to create something organic within all the horror.  John Cusack (an actor who gets slightly more respect and admiration than I deem neccisary) is actually very solid here, anchoring the films moral center without ever appearing to be the natural spout of clarity.  He is a subtle, yet profound look at the `good' in us all.  Ray Liotta is his normal clich&eacute;d self, but at least he is offset by the other actors around him.  Amanda Peet is a diamond in the rough as far as I am concerned.  I kind of love her in everything she does, even though I know that she needs to work out her acting bugs.  I can't wait till she masters the talent she so obviously possesses.  Clean DuVall is a standout for me here, mainly because the `scarred teenage girl' routine is overdone so much in these films that it was nice to see her completely OWN it so effortlessly.  It felt fresher than it should have.<br /><br />And Rebecca De Mornay was a total treat.<br /><br />In the end, `Identity' has enough atmosphere to keep you in nightmares for days.  It is dripping with natural fear factor, and the tweaked script allows the audience to feel two very distinct types of fear; the kind that comes from scary things creeping in the night, and the kind that comes from scary thoughts bouncing around in your head.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>Here is a film--the term "movie" is not good enough for this product--"Identity," which will have 340 reviews after I hit the "Publish" button and I had not heard of it until I picked it up from the Sale bin at a local wholesale giant. This is film making at its best.<br /><br />Oh, 2003, the year the film came out--also, the year of my retirement, my divorce, new house, trip to Ireland, seminary--no wonder I am not familiar with this film. I was too busy with my own identity. "Identity" is such an apt title, too, for this film. Initially, I wondered what its meaning might be, but the story is so taut and full of action and never-let-go-roller-coaster-ride into the psyche that one forgets the title. Too much else to consider.<br /><br />First, the story opens somewhat in the middle with important information provided. The viewer may not have any idea what this information means until much later, when it's too late (not that the viewer can do anything to help). Director James Mangold proves his title along with great editors in organizing the various plot elements into a sophisticated, cubist fashion. What seems chop, chop is not at all, but becomes a careful rendering of truth and reality, fantasy and the unreal world of horror where the characters walk and breathe. Identity. What is it? Who has it?<br /><br />Mangold takes the viewer to a brink, but a brink to what? You cannot guess this one. Part of what makes the center hold is the casting. John Cusack creates one of his better roles and convinces us he is this character. Each character and the actor who plays him/her are well-drawn and made flesh by other talented actors-- Amanda Peet, Ray Liotta, Rebecca DeMornay, Alfred Molino.<br /><br />The setting is a motel. The time is night. All the circumstances are morbid and sinister. Who is this man who runs the motel? What's wrong with him? The movie star, tired and aging, continues her demands for more and better. Her chauffeur who is more than he seems has hit, I should say his vehicle hits the wife of a man changing his tire in a relentless storm that has encircled this group of disgruntled, sad people.  After the grotesque murders begin, Peet's character likens their story to "And Then There Were None." I would suggest that these people have found themselves in a twisted Lovecraft horror tale.<br /><br />For twisted and horror describe the hidden part of the story. There, I've said enough. Identity. What is it? Who has it? When and why?</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Ten people wind up stranded at a desert motel during a thunderstorm. All is well until someone starts killing them one by one. IDENTITY is a movie w/ loads of secrets and twisty surprises. The action grows increasingly odd and ultimately turns completely illogical. In the end, we find that this is necessary to the story. John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet play the central characters. The rest of the cast is equally awesome, w/ Rebecca DeMornay (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle), Clea Duval (How To Make A Monster), Alfred Molina (Species), and Jake Busey (The Frighteners, Starship Troopers) among them! There's a cop, a convict, a chauffeur, a has-been movie star, a hooker, a family, a young couple, and Larry, the jittery desk-clerk. None of these people are who or what they appear to be. Many secrets will be revealed. Many will die. This all culminates in a mindf'ing final twist that will pry your jaw open! Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>A group of seemingly unconnected characters become stormstayed at a remote motel, where one by one, they begin to disappear.  Sounds familiar but promising; while the promise is more than fulfilled though, the familiarity is not, as a classic kind of idea gives way to one of the most original and twist-filled movies around.  It's astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out, regarding its genuinely shocking ending - I had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its DVD release!  Even with advance knowledge of the outcome, though, it was still astounding - I can only imagine how jaw-dropping it must be to witness it not knowing.  Fantastic suspense; great characterization as played by a cast of well-knowns including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca DeMornay and Ray Liotta; excellent production values; and total non-telegraphing of the plot combine to make "Identity" one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time.  If you don't know the ending, do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible - the turns are some of the most unexpected ever.  Even if you do know the gist of it, don't hesitate to see it - it'll still deliver many times over.  Indispensable for fans of mystery, drama, horror, or thrillers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>This sounded like a very interesting movie, so I borrowed it. It had an good cast, and there's always a face you recognise from somewhere, even if you can't put a name to the face.<br /><br />Despite being a highly predictable movie, and you end up working out the actual twist at the end (part of it anyway), it's quite enjoyable, even if I did have to keep pausing the DVD so I could work out what was happening on screen.<br /><br />Most of the actors, including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay (who appears to have a LOT of work done, and I don't just mean her hair colour), Amanda Peet, Jake Busey and William Lee Scott, but my particular favourite was Clea Duvall, as she did an absolutely fantastic job. Her screaming, when her husband of 9-hours was banging on the bathroom door was terrifying. All the characters have surnames of US states, which doesn't really make much sense right until the end. The names include: Edward 'Ed' Dakota, James 'Jim' Rhodes, Paris Nevada, George York, Alice York, Timmy York, Larry Washington, Caroline Suzanne, Ginny Virginia, Lou Isiana, and Robert Maine. The actual 'connection' between all the characters (apart from the one at the start) is really silly to be honest.<br /><br />The finale will probably confuse a lot of people, and completely floored me. Without giving too much away, it's one of those finales, that will have you thinking about the rest of the movie, and trying to figure out what the hell happened. And as for the fact that there's supposed to be a alternate ending on the DVD - I couldn't find it! I checked both the endings on the theatrical release, and the extended one, and couldn't see any difference. Unless it's an easter egg.<br /><br />The film also doesn't know what it wants to be: horror, mystery, drama, comedy, psycho movie, or just simply surreal. The ending is very strange, but ties up all loose ends up, just incase you were thinking that.<br /><br />I doubt I would ever watch this film again, so I'm glad I borrowed it, rather than buying it the second I saw it - which is what I normally do. It's certainly one of those films where you'll remember the twist, and that will certainly put you off watching, rather than something like Sixth Sense, where you look for new clues to the twist at the end, each time you watch.<br /><br />The extras include: commentary by director James Mangold; exclusive branched version of film with alternative ending (bull) and additional scene; deleted scenes with director's commentary; storyboard comparisons and STARZ special: On the Set of Identity.<br /><br />I would say this movie is well worth a peek, just try not to work out the twists before the film starts. And don't read any reviews beforehand! I wasn't expecting there to be a twist, as I hadn't read any reviews.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Without giving too much away, if you've seen "Adaptation" you might recognise the plot of &quot;Identity&quot; as being akin to that of "The Three" - the "unfilmable" screenplay Charlie Kaufman's infuriating brother Donald comes up with and promptly sells for six figures.  Trust Hollywood to go make it.  It's fun for a while, but if you pick the twist it quickly becomes laborious.  If you don't pick it, then I guess "Identity" is made for your demographic and you'll probably have a great night.  For all its apparent exploration of psychology, this is really just a slasher movie dressed up with a good cast and a twist.  The players make up for what the story lacks, but only so far.  Twist movies work best when one of the central characters is the victim of the twist as much as we are, e.g. "Seven", "Fight Club" and "The Usual Suspects".  But if, as here, the audience is the only victim then the joke is on us and we're just left feeling manipulated.  So in the end, I'm with Charlie.  (But I still wish I was cashing Donald's cheque.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>I did not expect the twist in the middle.

One final scene in the picture (a daylight scene near an orange grove) really impressed me for its deep, rich color. Just looks great on this Widescreen (2.40:1) presentation of the movie.<p>There's a Full-Screen (1.33:1) version of the film included here as well.  But &quot;Widescreen&quot; is definitely the superior format for this (or any other) motion picture.<p>With an ample supply of twists and turns to keep us guessing, this film (although featuring its fair share of lifeless bodies along the way) rises well above the &quot;slasher&quot; film mentality, providing the viewer with a perfectly reasonable--and realistic--explanation to the events we're seeing on the screen.<p>John Cusack is rock-solid here as a former cop who gets more than he bargained for during a seemingly-routine trip to California.<p>The movie-makers have done a more-than-adequate job of character development for this film. Not an easy task, either, considering we're introduced to more than your average number of principal players (numbering in double digits).<p>In the tradition of a good, old-fashioned scary thriller, &quot;Identity&quot; rises to the occasion and delivers some genuinely eerie moments.<p>It's nice to know that Hollywood still CAN make 'em like this in the 21st Century.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>As if Psycho weren't enough to scare you off rundown motels in the rain, Identity comes along to drive the point home.  This is a solid thriller with a great cast.  You'd have to include the storm as a character, since it is the rain that drives ten strangers to a decrepit motel in the desert, and the lightning and drenching water are a constant presence as bodies begin to turn up and tensions heighten.  Toward the end there are, of course, two main twists -- one works very well, the other is goofy and predictable, though it doesn't spoil the film.  While it wasn't the best thriller I've ever seen, it was not merely a slasher film either -- something I was counting on based on John Cusack's presence -- and when the movie was over I didn't feel ripped off.  I always enjoy Cusack, the rest of the cast was great, the editing was very good, and the premise was quite interesting.<p>Extra features include a director's commentary, a trailer, a featurette, 4 deleted scenes, a (slightly) extended ending, storyboard comparisons and a filmography for some of the cast and crew members.

However, as one begins watching the film, you are swept up into the movie's engaging plot.  As a thriller, it's great and as a thriller with a twist it's one of the most original to come around in a long time.  IDENTITY revolves around 10 people who all become stranded at the same creepy motel on a dark and story night. Somehow contected to all of this is the hearing concerning a bald-headed mass murderer. This hearing doesn't come into play much, but has a very important connection to the rest of the movie.  Anyway, back at the ranch, I mean, hotel.  One by one the people at the hotel start dieing. Everyone becomes suspicious of everyone else until no one has a clue to what's going on.  Things get wierder and wierder until the film's climax and all the loose ends are tied up.  However, even then things aren't what they seem to be.  IDENTITY is an interesting movie.  It was a bit better than I thought it was going to be, and the fine performance of the cast (especially John Cusack) and the great freshly-original screenplay made the film better.  It's a nice movie to watch with someone on a rainy night.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Identity (James Mangold, 2003)<p>See this movie. See it now. Spend the film wondering how director James Mangold (who did manage to make one very good film previous to this in Cop Land, but has otherwise foisted such tripe upon the viewing public as Girl, Interrupted and Heavy) and screenwriter Michael Cooney (he wrote a script for Jack Frost 2: Return of the mutant Killer Snowman. Need I say more?) managed to put together such a startling, refreshing piece of filmmaking as this.<p>Ten strangers are stranded in the Nevada desert during a rainstorm. They start dying. As the deaths get more and more incongruous, the survivors begin to turn on one another. It's a very thin plot... or it would be without a twist that is, quite simply, completely different than anything you've ever seen in a thriller. It's a plot twist that ranks right up there with Fight Club, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, `Salem's Lot (the book, not the movie), fill in whatever you want that left your jaw hanging open. The setup is brilliant, the payoff even more so.<p>Much of the credit here is due to a stellar cast, headed by John Cusack (Max, Being John Malkovich), who has turned his eighties teen stardom into one of the best-managed careers in Hollywood today. His foil is played by Ray Liotta (Narc, Cop Land). Others at the hotel are John C. McGinley (Scrubs, Intensity), Amanda Peet (Igby Goes Down), John Hawkes (From Dusk Til Dawn, Playing God), Jake Busey (The Frighteners)... you get the idea. High-powered cast. Everyone has perfect timing throughout. Expect much; you'll get it.<p>Easily one of the best films of the year, if not the best. A must for any fan of intelligent thrillers, horror films, graveyard humor, John Cusack... oh, forget it. It's a must for everybody. **** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AWEOR1WZSMBEZ.html">AWEOR1WZSMBEZ</a><br/><p>I have read seemingly unsatisfied reviews about the movie, such suffering a mixed identity from being a mystery, thriller, &amp;/or horror story.  So, I decided to see it for myself.  Without reading the gist at the back of the DVD cover, I had little expectations to begin with.  I noticed its remarkable similarity with Agatha Christie's &quot;And then there was none&quot; (The Psycho set-up was a given).  Of course, once the sentenced serial killer was introduced in the screen, everything fell in its place &amp; the movie sort of became predictable (especially the ending).

After seeing the movie, feeling a little duped by the trailer (there's few things as aggravating as a misleading trailer, except for a trailer that shows all the best parts), I was a little surprised to see it was much more than I assumed, being a decent mystery/thriller with slight horror undertones.  Directed by James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted, Kate & Leopold), the film stars John Cusack (High Fidelity, Serendipity), Amanda Peet (Saving Silverman, Something's Gotta Give), and Ray Liotta (Goodfellas), three actors I generally like, although Liotta's star quality still suffers with me from his appearing in the 1997 turkeyfest Turbulence (a film which systematically dismantled Liotta's costar Lauren Holly's budding career, forcing her into the realm of television for quite some time).  Other notable appearances are made by Alfred Molina (Spider-Man 2), John C. McGinley (Stealing Harvard), Jake Busey (Fast Sofa), weird eye guy Pruitt Taylor Vince (Nurse Betty), and Rebecca De Mornay (The Hand That Rocks the Cradle), sporting the biggest set of fake hoo hoos I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The story, mostly taking place at a lonely Nevada motel, features a group of people brought together under curious and seemingly coincidental circumstances, stranded as they're caught in the middle of a heavy rainstorm (yes, it does rain in the desert on occasion, and usually pretty hard) due to the fact the road leading away from the motel in either direction is washed out.  It's an interesting mix of characters, a limo driver (Cusack), a prostitute (Peet), an officer (Liotta) transporting a convicted criminal (Busey), a family of three, a newlywed couple, and a seemingly once popular actress, whose star has since faded (at the very least, she's still got the huge rack).  Shortly after our soggy assemblage has an opportunity to get acquainted with each other, their number begins to dwindled as someone within the group is eliminating them one by one, leaving evidence indicating there may be a pattern.  Maybe someone should call the police...but wait!  The phones are out, and the only cell phone among the group can't make a connection (with the advent of cell phones, many thriller/horror films have had to resort to the old `I can't get a signal' contrivance to justify why a character can't phone for help, either that or they actually have the phone get damaged or the battery be depleted).  Now, those who haven't suffered a terminal case of death must try and figure out not only who among them is a killer, but why (we later learn there's a connection between the individuals present), before those left meet the same, grisly fate.<br /><br />The positives of the film are many, including a strong cast, led by Cusack (remember the days when he only seemed to do silly comedies?  Who knew back then he would evolve into dramatic roles as well as he did?) and Liotta (the two played against each other nicely, enough so I wouldn't mind seeing them appear in something else together).  The rest of the cast follows suit, but given the collective professional experience in their backgrounds, I wouldn't have expected less.  The direction by Mangold is tight, and it's obvious he knows how to create suspense and deliver the goods (there were a few `pop outs', or basically throwing something at the viewer to create a quick, cheap scare, but Mangold seemed to be able to present it in such a way where it wasn't as obvious as it would have been with a lesser director).  The photography was really beautiful, deftly using the rain in such a way as to accentuate the story, and also to keep the viewer engaged.  I also thoughts the sets were detailed and realistic, giving the film a dark, brooding quality, much like that of David Fincher's film Se7en (1995).  The biggest problem I had with the movie was related, in a small way, to the ending and the revelation of the identity of the killer in that films that utilized dream sequences (there are none here) or similar plot contrivances seem to use them in such a way as to forgo justifying various details and unexplained events as to say to the audience, `Well, because of the context of the occurrence of the details and/or events, we don't have provide any reasoning, and you just have to accept it'.  Now, I don't need a reasoning or rational for everything, as I'd like to believe I'm intelligent enough to extrapolate these things from myself, so long as the story is adept enough to provide the basic necessities to do so...but that wasn't always the case here (an example being the entire Indian burial mounds aspect, and its' introduction with regards to the killings possibly being supernatural in nature).  I did appreciate the inclusion of various clues, not so much relating to who the killer was, but who the killer wasn't.  The concept put forth by the story in this regard certainly was interesting (and entertaining), but the execution seemed a little weak.<br /><br />The DVD features both anamorphic widescreen (2:35:1) and the pan & scan (1:33:1), allowing the viewer to choose their preferred format, both looking very clean and sharp.  The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1, and comes though very clearly.  Special features include a commentary track by the director, a `Starz' on-set featurette, storyboard to scene comparisons, deleted scenes, selected filmographies, and the ability to choose to view the original theatrical release, or a slightly extended version of the film (I believe this last feature is only available in the widescreen format).  Normally I'd probably rate this three stars, but due to the strengths (especially the cast), I'm willing to go to four stars.  I'd recommend renting before buying, though, as I see little value in repeat viewings.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2003 film is a mystery as well as a horror film.  Ten strangers are stranded in a desolate motel on a stormy night.  One by one they are getting murdered.  It's a classic mystery as the guilt seems to fall on several characters.  There's also an interconnected story about a murderer whose psychiatrist is trying to get a last minute reprieve.  <p>John Cusack plays the part of a limousine driver who has once been a cop.  Ray Liotta plays a cop who's transporting a prisoner.  There's also a newly married couple who argue a lot, a prostitute who's giving up her way of life and another woman who's been injured in a accident as well as her husband and young son who never speaks a word.  There's also a strange motel clerk with secrets of his own.<p>But this is not a usual &quot;whodunit&quot;.  No way.  The connection between the individuals in the motel is much stranger than that. And when this connection is finally revealed, I was annoyed.  To my humble tastes, it was too contrived as it wanders into the unknown realms of the human psyche.<p>Yes, it held my interest.  Yes, there was some good acting.  But I hated the ending and felt the writer had played a rotten trick on the audience.  That's why I can only give this film a lukewarm recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>"Identity" is a unique horror movie that lives in the audience's mind forever.  Every detail keeps everyone waiting for the next scene.  Most occurances are deceiving; therefore, one must listen closely to fully understand the plot.  The deceits keep the audience anxiously awaiting the next movie viewing.  Many sudden impact surprises keep the audience's hearts pounding in tremendous startlation.<p>A family drives down a deserted road as a woman's high heel pops a tire.  As they wonder how it stumbled there, the step-father witnesses his wife getting hit by a car by an ex-cop, turned limo driver.  The group rushes for the nearest hospital, but the roads are flooded.  Their only safe shelter is a hotel.  The owner of the high heel, two newlyweds, and cop/convict are surrounded by the flood waters.  As they stumble upon the injury sight, they try to help assure the injured woman's survival.  Little do they know that the worse is yet to happen.  Their relation toward one another becomes crutial in discovering why this is happening to them.  <p>John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Clea DuVall, Jake Busey, Alfred Molina, and others wonderfully act in this thriller.  Their individual storylines give the audience the added experience.  Cusack achieves the most demanding role of the movie.  The underrated DuVall proves in acting her character's drama that she will be a star in the years to come.  <p>"Identity" is a movie for everyone looking for a great thrill ride.  Missing a single second will miss a crutial part in the movie.  One will not be disappointed.  Some must watch it more than once to fully understand all the truths, but most will be glad they did.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Identity quickly sets itself up as a tightly-drawn whodunnit mystery thriller. As 10 strangers (including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey) come together in a rundown desert motel during a rainstorm, suspicions and fear among them rise when it appears their is a killer in their midst. Adding the intrigue are the seemingly unconnected scenes of a late-night hearing of a would-be sent-to-death serial taking place far, far away from the motel.<br /><br />For about 60 minutes, this 90-minute movie keeps you hooked. Then it sets about breaking all the rules it has set up and massive gaps in logic distract your attention from the increasingly preposterous climax. I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming. But it came too early and led the film into stupidness.<br /><br />It is atmospherically shot and the feeling of isolation is quite cool, even if it doesn't last very long. But, in the end, I've seen episodes of Midsomer Murders that are far better than this. But what do you expect from the guy who wrote Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman?<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are a bunch of extras I don't care about.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>My son brought this film home from the local rental place and, though having never heard of it, I decided to watch it on the strength of the cast, which is stellar. I must say that it is a highly entertaining, atmospheric, and intriguing thriller that focuses on ten people, ostensible strangers to each other, who, through a seeming twist of fate, meet one dark and stormy night at a seedy motel in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />There, a strange fate begins to over take them, as one by one they meet up with a mysterious killer. No one knows who amongst them is the killer. No one knows who is next. Yet, there is apparently a link that binds them all. There is also a parallel story involving a convicted killer that opens the film and continues to be interjected at odd moments throughout the film. It is a story that is also interesting and becomes more so as the film continues.<br /><br />There are subtle clues along the way that point the viewer in the right direction, in terms of what is really going on. The viewer, however, will generally realize this in hindsight, which is, of course, always twenty/twenty. The pace of the film is relentless. The tension is palpable. The acting is top notch. The direction is first rate, and the ending screams out, "Gotcha!".<br /><br />This is a surprisingly effective psychological thriller that all those who love films of this genre should enjoy. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep even the most jaded viewers on their toes. While the performances of the entire cast are uniformly excellent, special kudos go to John Cusack for a truly powerful, memorable performance. Bravo!</p></br></body></html>

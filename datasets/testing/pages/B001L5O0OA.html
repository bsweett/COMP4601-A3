I never have to seek out this movie. It finds me. Last year I believe a cable station had A Christmas Story Marathon. They just ran the movie over & over & over. The dvd version with commentary might be interesting. Indeed you can have this on in the background while you wrap presents, cook, address cards etc. pausing everytime the wicked witch or Santa Claus  says to Ralphie, "You'll shoot your eye out." Lots of touchstones of the time: a ditsy stay at home mom, radio shows, getting your mouth washed out with soap, hunting for the perfect Christmas tree. Darren McGavin is not exactly Ward Cleaver as the gruff, profane, childish but lovable old man. If this movie wasn't already a Christmas classic it could be a cult film.</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>This classic Christmas story will bring out the little kid in you.  The childhood memories will flood back and you will not be able to control your giddy anticipation of what Christmas might bring this year.  Relive the wonder and naivete of being a child.  I double- no, I triple-dog dare you!</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL WITHOUT THE USUAL "YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT NON-SENSE!<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL:<br /><br />Here we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.<br /><br />FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL:<br /><br />We have a lofty goal - THE RED RYDER BB GUN under the tree! To reach this goal he must overcome the growing din of naysayers including his teacher and mother who insist: "YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT!!!!!!<br /><br />To reach that goal we have objectives - giving clues to mom and dad, getting Miss Shields [5th grade teacher] to endorse the idea, and going directly to "THE MAN" - SANTA, to enlist his support.<br /><br />BUT THERE IS MORE - MUCH MORE!<br /><br />For starters, we have a ten year old's strange fantasies - having "BLACK BART" and his gang all "pushing up daisies" after a showdown with cowboy Ralphie and "Old Blue" [his Red Ryder].<br /><br />We have a dare that goes from bad to worse as it escalates into a "Triple Dog Dare"! What ensues, is simply something that we suggest you don't try at home. That is, unless you want to get your tongue frozen stuck to a pole?<br /><br />We have Bully's and their henchmen. We have really cool narration. Plus, we have Dad and his major award silliness, when he isn't fighting furnace fires, the Buppases dogs and just plain acting uncool in a perfect dad sort of way.<br /><br />Add to that, we have Chinese turkey and christmas themes, flat-tires, a soap poisoning fantasy, a little boy wearing a little girl's pink bunny outfit and the long awaited "Little Orphan Annie" decoder set with a letter countersigned by Annie in real ink! We have a little brother, an epiphany over mom and some typical school chums getting into trouble stuff too.<br /><br />There is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for "The Grand Canyon Suite" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Super-duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family. It never gets tiring and it actually grows on you over time. I first saw "A Christmas Story" at the Vero Beach [FLA] Drive-In in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />I have never seen the 2-Disk set. The single disk, full-screen version I do have is quite an improvement over the VHS version insofar as picture quality is concerned. There are NO FEATURES, and that is of course sad as this type of nostalgic film with child actors really would benefit from that. All in all, this is a great film to have on DVD as it seems to shout - PLAY ME AGAIN!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is a collection of tales as they are recollected by a person thinking back on their childhood one Christmas. It has all the exaggerations with its ups and downs.<br /><br />Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) spots a "Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB" 200-shot Carbine with compass, in the window of a story and fantasizes on how to get it for Christmas.<br />Will he succeed?<br />And if so will he shoot his eye out?<br /><br />I had one of those Davie Crocket hats when I was a kid. There were lots of other items and actions that I could relate to. However my wife likes the watering method used by Melinda Dillon (mother) around the trophy. And she likes the way the mother conserved electricity by turning it off. I could see her snickering through the corner of my eye. I am not sure I should have bought this movie. It may prove fatal to any window plans.<br /><br />The sequel of "A Christmas Story" ("It Runs in the Family" [1994]) lacks a lot of the originality of this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is one of the true classics of American Cinema. I am admittedly not very big on most Christmas themed movies (too commercial), but I make a big exception here. Adapted from Jean Shepherd's wry book &quot;In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash&quot; and set in the American midwest of the 1940s, the movie follows young Ralphie, perfectly portrayed by Peter Billingsley, his family and friends during a youthful Christmas season. <p>During the course of the film we get to see typical childhood problems through the eyes of Ralphie. The problems include dealing with a neighborhood bully, enduring hideous Christmas presents (most notably the pink bunny suit, which is not to be missed), and the dreaded 'triple dog dare.' A brilliant cast is directed by veteran director Bob Clark. The parents in this film embody the no-nonsense, yet loving, parents of period America, in this case played to perfection by Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin. The highlight of the movie for me is EASILY the delivery of the dad's 'major award,' and his wife's acute embarrassment when it is placed in the living room window. (That's all I am going to say about the matter: if you haven't seen the movie, this scene alone is worth the asking price.) <p>The recurring theme through the movie is the angst induced by being repeatedly told that the one gift that Ralphie truly wants, a Daisy Red Ryder BB Gun ('with a compass in the stock and a thing that tells time') is off limits with the sentence &quot;You'll shoot your eye out.&quot; (Even the deranged department store Santa gives this same warning in another masterstroke.) In the end Dad turns out to be way more of a softy than we would have ever taken him for, and Ralphie has the best Christmas ever, despite the 'Bumpus hounds' devouring their Christmas dinner.<p>For the 2 CD set, you get the movie (of course) and some truly wonderful extras, most notably a documentary &quot;Another Christmas Story&quot; which interviews Clark, Billingsley (who looks exactly the same as an adult), and many other cast members about the making of the film. Also included is a fun trivia game (I got one question wrong), and the mini documentaries &quot;A History of the Daisy Red Ryder,&quot; and &quot;Get a Leg Up,&quot; which irrevocably demonstrates that humor is alive and well in America.<p>This is a classic! Get in the Christmas spirit and buy this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>A yuletide tradition for my family (and many others, no doubt) that was a staple long before TBS started spamming it nonstop on Christmas Day every year. It's warm, funny, poignant and relatable without stretching itself thin and effortlessly captures the dueling heartaches and wonders that embodied the holiday season for many generations of American children. Infinitely quotable, its one-liners have yet to wear thin and the expertly-paced plot delivers both rose sniffing and speed racing with grand efficiency. One I'll never get tired of.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie is one of these rare stories that you don't get tired of watching. Every Christmas, they play this on a marathon on cable, and it is so much better than other Christmas movies like 'Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer'<br /><br />Created 25 years ago, and set in 25 years before THAT, this story features a cute, bespectacled boy named Ralphie and his desire for a BB gun for Christmas. Mind you, the 50's was a time where people didn't have to be as worried about guns, and these times are bygone. No Internet, no TV, chalkboards with real chalk instead of dry-erase boards, and so on and so forth...<br /><br />This movie is entertaining because of its well-written story, but it's also awesome for nostalgia.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Few films can stand to be seen as many times as 'A Christmas Story'. If you grew up in the 50's or 60's this film will really bring back memories of being a kid at Christmas time, but anyone should be able to relate to this film. I avoided this film for a few years because TNT played this film continually for 24 hours every Christmas. I finally was ready for a viewing and what better day to do it?<br /><br />The film is a timeless classic brimming with the excitement of the holiday. The narrative only enhances the dialogue going on in our own minds. This was Christmas in a simpler time, when the emphasis wasn't on over spending, but the thought of family and that one special item for Christmas morning could make all the difference.<br /><br />The two disc set is very nice with full and widescreen versions of the film included, There is also a fair amount of extras including commentary, trivia game, "making of" feature-ette with on screen comments by the director, Billingsley and three other child actors from the film. There are spots on Daisy rifles and the famous leg lamp and a few other interesting tidbits to toggle through. While most of the extras are fun, none of them are essential or give any real insight on this excellent low budget film. I would have loved more depth in the making of feature-ette and not just the actors remarking on how much they liked making the film. The DVD transfer looks really good and if you don't have this in your collection, you should.<br /><br />Merry Christmas everyone, from yours truly Dr Shock!</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>"A Christmas Story" is colorful, theatrical, musical, family-centric and meaningful and incredibly funny. This has always been my very favorite Christmas movie. As you may know there are about a zillion different "A Christmas Story" movie releases so although this review is about the movie, I will also be detailing the 2-disc DVD set that came out in 2003.<br /><br />I have fond memories of seeing "A Christmas Story" when it was still in the movies as a very young child. But this is the type of movie that everyone will love, it's not a movie just for children. The entire family will appreciate it.<br /><br />The story centers around Ralph Parker (Peter Billingsley) who longs for nothing more than a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. Ralph will stop at noting to get his Christmas-fix. Although the children in the movie were all very talented and funny, I think I liked the parents the most.<br /><br />The father is played by the late and much-loved Darren McGavin and the mom is portrayed by Melinda Dillon. I love the parents because everyone has parents like them. Mr. Parker always came home angry at the world, but just as angry and caustic as he was, that's how kind and loving Mrs. Parker was. I also loved the character of Randy (Ian Petrella) because he had to be at least 8 or 9, yet he was still being treated like a 2-year-old. That's classic and so hysterical.<br /><br />The coup de gr?ce has gotta be when Ralph goes buck-wild on Scut Farkus (Zack Ward). He just snapped and manages to get on top of the resident bully and just starts pummeling him with b-slaps, causing Farkus to start crying. I also love the part when Ralphie is forced to wear that hideous pink rabbit costume that his aunt sent him for Christmas. Because what child cannot relate to something similar happening; although I am sure nothing is as ludicruis as Ralph's bunny suit.<br /><br />Although the movie is shown during a 24-hour marathon every year I cannot think of a single reason why everyone should not own it. But, there are so many different releases, so it may be a little confusing to know which to choose. I prefer the 2-disc 2003 special edition set. Because it didn't cost much (that's most important and yes these are used but I couldn't care less) and because the packaging is great, it's looks like a Christmas gift (see the scans that I took the time to label and post) and it includes lots of bonuses and interviews. The 2003 2-disc set includes "A Christmas Story" in both pan and scan and letterbox, and the movie is remastered; making it appear just as fantastic as it sounds.<br /><br />If you're like me you will watch "A Christmas Story" over and over again during Christmastime because it's the perfect movie to welcome in the most joyous time of the year. Repeat the sounding joy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"A Christmas Story" is by far my family's favorite holiday movie! Our VHS tape wore out and we had to replace it with this DVD. We watch it at least twice during the Christmas season and once or twice in the summer. We also find ourselves quoting some of the classic lines all year round!<br /><br />Based on great book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385021747">In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash</a>, this movie captures the mania that built up around Christmas in almost every child in a more innocent age. The sub plots are well conceived and wonderfully woven into the story.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>Amazon has combined the reviews for the Blu-ray and standard DVD versions of this set, which aren't exactly the same in their features.  This review is for the Blu-ray version.  My review of the standard DVD version is here too, so be sure you're reading the one you're interested in.<br /><br />The movie is excellent, a Christmas classic (see below).  Should you upgrade to the new Ultimate edition if you already have the 2006 Blu-ray edition?  That depends on how much you like memorabilia.  The new edition is a repackaging of the 2006 edition, with a couple new non-DVD extras:<br /><br />-- a collectible retro Christmas cookie tin (the container for the set)<br />-- a strand of leg-lamp Christmas lights (Blu-ray exclusive)<br /><br />Those look like fun, if you're into that kind of stuff.  Amazon has a photo of the tin and a second photo that shows the tin and the leg-lamp lights.  (The announcement for this set said that the items from the standard DVD set (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CFEC7Y">here</a>) would be included in this one, but that isn't correct.)<br /><br />The Blu-ray DVD won't be remastered from the previous one.  The video quality of the 2006 release was only fair for hi-def, soft with fairly good color, with fair mono sound.<br /><br />The 2006 Blu-ray didn't include everything that was on the HD or the 2-disc SD set.  Here's what's actually included:<br /><br />-- audio commentary by director/co-writer Bob Clark and star Peter Billingsley (Ralphie)<br />-- Another Christmas Story featurette, includes interviews with Clark and a few members of the cast<br />-- Get a Leg Up featurette, about the making and ongoing sale of the (in)famous leg lamp<br />-- A History of the Daisy Red Ryder featurette, on the object of great desire's actual history<br />-- original theatrical trailer<br /><br />The features from earlier editions that aren't included are trivia and decoder games, readings (audio only) from Jean Shepherd, and an ad for the real leg lamp.<br /><br />Now, about the really good stuff, the movie.  A Christmas Story is that odd film that appeals to a cross-section of viewers who often can't agree on what to watch.  Fans of sweet Christmas cheer are happily joined by people with a more jaundiced eye to the holiday.  To be sure, the movie leans more to the sweet than the sour, but it has enough edge and good-natured twistedness to please some of our darker Christmas angels too.  It conveys a genuinely warm nostalgia and some sharp, sometimes pretense-deflating observations about human nature.<br /><br />The story is set at some indefinite time around 1940 in an Indiana town approaching the holidays.  Young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants only one thing for Christmas, the Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action 200-Shot Lightning Loader Range Model Air Rifle with a compass in the stock.  (That is, a BB gun, a very particular one.)  He plans carefully well in advance how to lay the groundwork for this while avoiding the dreaded rebuff, but almost everyone says it anyway: "You'll put your eye out!"  The relentless struggle for the one true gift develops alongside several other small stories and amusing details, a tongue-on-frozen-pole triple-dog dare, facing the local bully, the notorious leg lamp, the Santa slide, Peking Duck for Christmas, and several others, each memorable in itself.<br /><br />The actors aren't very well known, but they're all just right.  There is narration throughout, representing an older Ralphie, done by the originator of the story, Jean Shepard, also just right.<br /><br />This movie, made in 1983, has gradually become a favorite Christmas classic, now shown in an annual 24-hour Christmas marathon on cable, which attracts a huge number of viewers.  If you've never seen it, give it a try, even if you have a little Scrooge in you, and you'll probably enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>It's 1940's Indiana, and all Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB Gun.  He knows he needs to drop subtle hints to his parents (Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon).  But when his mother expresses concern that it might not be safe, he has to develop some back up plans.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is plenty else going on in the family.  Ralphie has to face the neighborhood bully to defend his brother Randy (Ian Petrella).  His father wins a hideous lamp.  And Ralphie finally gets his Little Orphan Annie decoder.  But through it all, Ralphie plots and schemes to get his BB gun.  Will it be under the tree Christmas morning?<br /><br />This movie is based on a collection of short stories, and it shows.  While the multiple stories weave in and out of each other much like real life, they never truly form a cohesive whole.  And ultimately, that's my problem with the film.  It felt uneven to me.  There were several laughs along the way, and the acting was good.  But the movie seemed to be wandering with little focus, and that proved to be too much of a distraction.<br /><br />I'm sure if I had grown up with this film, I'd feel differently about it because this isn't a bad film.  But it isn't one that I will add to my Christmas traditions.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>Nine-year-old Ralphie wants nothing in life more than a Red Rider BB gun.  He plots and schemes but no matter where he turns, he is thwarted by the mantra that all adults seem destined to utter, "You'll shoot your eye out."  This is a simple story of one family at Christmas time and follows Ralphie as he goes to school, deals with his parents, and keeps fighting to get his BB gun.<br /><br />This movie was virtually invisible when it was originally released, but has since become a holiday classic.  All of us can relate to Ralphie's quest on some level, and many can probably empathize with the parents as well.  The cast was virtually perfect from top to bottom and Peter Billingsley's wide eyed innocence is particularly effective.  The other standout is Darren McGavin with a wonderful performance as the dad that is understated at some times and wildly exaggerated at others... but always striking the right note at just the right time.  The only sour note is kid brother Randy who simply whines and cries throughout the entire movie and adds nothing funny or interesting.<br /><br />A Christmas Story deserves to be enjoyed each year during the Christmas season.  It's a timeless story and captures a little slice of Americana in a unique and charming way.  It is shown regularly on TV, but is much more enjoyable when watched uninterrupted and unedited from the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I couldn't even count how many times I have seen this picture.  I am glad it finally got the special edition treatment.  This is an American film classic.  It certainly is not a perfect film, but it is endearing.  The settings are great, and it truly feels like you are transported back in time.  The acting is first rate all the way around.  The whole story revolves around little Ralphie's quest for a Red Rider BB Gun on Christmas.  Along the way we experience the Bully, the Leg, the tongue frozen to the poll, a scary Santa, the furnace, and the ultimate bad word among many warm humorous moments.  You can go wrong with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>"A Christmas Story" is one of those classics that you feel, needs to be watched every Holiday season.  I can remember watching this film a jillion times as a child and now having the opportunity to share the film with my kids.<br /><br />Despite being a low-budget film at that time, what made this film become a classic is that, it's a Christmas story of an American family in the 1940's.  Ralphie is a child who listens to Orphan Annie on the radio, reads comic books and wants a Red Ryder Air Gun for Christmas.<br /><br />But of course, how can he convince his parents to buy him one when his mother thinks he'll shoot his eye out.  So, you get to see how Ralphie tries to get the gun by trying to get a good grade on his school report, to planting an ad in his mother's favorite magazine and even going to the mall and talking to Santa.<br /><br />But the magical part of this film are its characters.  Every character from Ralphie's family to his friends, everything comes together quite well.  From his father who wins an award which is a leg (in fishnet stockings) lamp, his friends being bullied by Scotty Farkus, his brother who is overly dressed in his snowsuit, his friend sticking his tongue on a pole to see if it would get stuck and much more.<br /><br />So, back in 2003, this film received a 20th Anniversary DVD treatment and in 2006, was followed up by its first Blu-ray release.  Then sure enough, with the 25th Anniversary Ultimate Edition which had a special bundled edition in which people could own a miniature version of the leg lamp (ala string leg lamp lights for the Christmas tree) and the film on Blu-ray or get a version without the lamps.<br /><br />There is no difference with the 2008 Blu-ray version versus the 2006 version.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />The video is featured in 1080p High Definition/16?9, 1:85:1.  The Blu-ray is marginally better than the DVD version.  But you can notice the quality of it's clearness via Blu-ray.  You'll have parts on the film which look soft and nicks and scratches from the film.  But I compared my old VHS version to the Blu-ray and oh my, the Blu-ray is light years ahead of it in quality.  For an older film, having been remastered already, I don't really think we are going to get anything better than what we have on Blu-ray.  But it still looks good.<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />The audio is Dolby Digital 1.0 in English and French.  I doubt we will see a TrueHD for this and since it's mostly dialogue and because of its time setting and how old this film is, I suppose I'm not too bothered by this.  It's one of those films that I'm not begging for surround sound.  So, I'm actually OK with it being 1.0.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />I've owned the first DVD version which had nothing in terms of special features, I didn't own the 20th Anniversary but as for this Blu-ray it includes:<br /><br />  * Commentary by Peter Billingsley and Director/Co-Writer Bob Clark - This commentary was actually quite fun to listen to.  You get a lot of Billingsley asking questions to Bob Clark about certain scenes, working with different individuals and also talking about the film and its reception from viewers in the last 20 years.  His relationship with working with Jean Shepard and much more.  There are some times where they are watching the film and don't say anything but I think both were pretty much rewatching the film for its entirety probably in a long time.  One scene I wondered about was the parade which featured Mickey Mouse.  I always wondered how Mickey could show up on an MGM film and sure enough Clark explains how Disney allowed it.<br />  * 20th Anniversary Documentary "Another Christmas Story" - This documentary features Bob Clark, Peter Billingsley and the guys who play his two buddies and the guy who plays Farkus.  Each talking about their experiences, the pole and tongue scene and how people react to them to this day and how people have memorized the lines.  And learning how a lot of detergent was used to re-create some of those snow scenes.<br />  * Daisy Red Ryder - This was an interesting featurette on the actual Daisy Red Ryder Air Rifle.  How it was created for the film and the actual company who produces air guns.<br />  * Get a Leg Up - This one is a infomercial like featurette of the leg lamp.  Nothing major.<br />  * Script Pages - This features the script of actual scenes that were cut.  Clark talks about several scenes that they didn't use in the film.  I wish they still had that and offered the videos as a deleted scene (especially the Ralphie/Flash Gordon scenes) but you can read the script of what was cut.<br />  * Trailer - And looking at the trailer, it looks so old in terms of picture quality after watching it on Blu-ray.<br /><br />For me, "A CHRISTMAS STORY" is like "It's a Wonderful Life" and even "Home Alone".  Films that are Christmas classics that you just want to watch with the family during the holidays.<br /><br />"A CHRISTMAS STORY" has been a part of so many families holiday's within the last 20 years and remains one of the classics next to "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Charlie Brown Christmas" (and other classics) shown every year and watched by many.  It's a true-to-heart tale and the way it's written, it's not fluffy, it's the life of a young boy who wants a Christmas present but his parents are not exactly "Brady Bunch", magical parents.  Blue collar father with a temper, mother who does her best to take care of the kids and a time in the 1940's of decoder rings and Ovaltine.<br /><br />If you own the 20th Anniversary DVD, really...you don't need to buy this.  But if you are like me and you own the first DVD version with no special features or the VHS version, then yeah, moving up to Blu-ray is a great decision.  It's marginally better in picture quality than the DVD and you get all the special features as well.<br /><br />Overall, it's a Christmas classic worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>I was almost finished recording "A Christmas Story" on last Christmas morning. Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition soon.<br /><br />That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half of my favorite holiday on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love "A Christmas Story." This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.<br /><br />Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a "thing that tells time." But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: "You'll shoot your eye out."<br /><br />As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says "the mother of all dirty words," and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky "major award" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.<br /><br />Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything ("We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice"), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.<br /><br />Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message about love and family and all that -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa ("HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!"), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with "Ol' Blue" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.<br /><br />And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life with his slightly stressed-out delivery. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: "Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap." "He looks like a pink nightmare!" "Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!" and others. McGavin gets many of the best ones, though ("FRA-GEE-LAY... that must be Italian!").<br /><br />Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. He's never oversmart or annoying, ever. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's "show me how the piggies eat!" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.<br /><br />This movie has seen a bunch of editions over the last few years, from a bare-bones full-screen edition to a full/widescreen edition with a second disc of goodies. From what I can tell, this is the latter -- easter eggs, trivia, documentary and featurettes about the movie, commentary from the lead actor and director, readings from Jean Shepherd, and so forth. Also a goofy new cover with... well, everything you love about this movie, from the bunny suit to the leg lamp to the BB gun.<br /><br />"A Christmas Story" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime. HOOOOO HOOOOO HOOOO...</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>I LOVE this Christmas movie and in my opinon it's probably one of the best movies ever made in the United States. Based upon the life and real-true story of Jean Shepard the movie takes place when a young boy Ralphie wants a coveted Red Ryder B.B. gun but his mother tells him "no you'll shoot your eye out." So, all his Christmas hopes are dashed... but, not giving up Ralphie deals with some hillarous incidents in dealings with bullies, teachers, and even a store Santa to get the toy of his dreams.<br /><br />This will remain to be a classic in American homes for generations to come. Kids will love the movie for they can relate to that "gotta have toy" feeling and adults will remember what it was like- to be a child around Christmas or what their FAVORITE Christmas was like.<br /><br />Written very well this smart witted comedy gets laughs no matter how many times you watch it. Jean Sheppard's voiceovers as the Older Ralphie fit in perfectly with the younger Ralphie's antics.<br /><br />This movie will bring a smile to any kid or adults face and is the perfect Christmas present or DVD to watch around Christmas. Hit the buy now button and don't miss out!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>I was almost finished recording "A Christmas Story" on last Christmas morning. Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition.<br /><br />That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love "A Christmas Story." This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.<br /><br />Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a "thing that tells time." But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: "You'll shoot your eye out."<br /><br />As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says "the mother of all dirty words," and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky "major award" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.<br /><br />Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything ("We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice"), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.<br /><br />Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa ("HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!"), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with "Ol' Blue" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.<br /><br />And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: "Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap." "He looks like a pink nightmare!" "Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!" and others.<br /><br />Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's "show me how the piggies eat!" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.<br /><br />"A Christmas Story" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime. HOOOOO HOOOOO HOOOO...</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is a collection of tales as they are recollected by a person thinking back on their childhood one Christmas. It has all the exaggerations with its ups and downs.<br /><br />Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) spots a "Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB" 200-shot Carbine with compass, in the window of a story and fantasizes on how to get it for Christmas.<br />Will he succeed?<br />And if so will he shoot his eye out?<br /><br />I had one of those Davie Crocket hats when I was a kid. There were lots of other items and actions that I could relate to. However my wife likes the watering method used by Melinda Dillon (mother) around the trophy. And she likes the way the mother conserved electricity by turning it off. I could see her snickering through the corner of my eye. I am not sure I should have bought this movie. It may prove fatal to any window plans.<br /><br />The sequel of "A Christmas Story" ("It Runs in the Family" [1994]) lacks a lot of the originality of this one.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AZKP6">It Runs in the Family</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>How do movies become classics?  I am clueless to answer.  I do not remember seeing "A Christmas Story" advertised in 1983.  This movie did very poorly in theaters.  Perhaps this low-budget film suffered from lack of support.  The movie does not compare with typical Christmas movie releases that emphasize mega-budgets and big-name stars.  Maybe we were all looking in the wrong place for entertainment.<br /><br />The movie is based on the late Jean Shepherd's book, "In God We Trust, All Other's Pay Cash."  Jean Shepherd also narrates this marvelous movie, as well as appearing in the film.  Jean's narration is wonderful and really helps to make this movie successful.  The story is inspired by real life events (even if they did not happen to Jean, they happened to others - trust me on this).  Jean managed to capture the feel of Christmas in the Midwest in the post-World War II era.  Actually, the Midwest had this feel into the 1950's and 1960's.  I recall myself asking for a BB gun in the 1960's and the answer was - yep, you guessed it - you'll shoot your eye out!<br /><br />The Midwest has always been a peculiar place when compared with the coasts.  While the Midwest is just as advanced as either coast, it somehow feels more nostalgic and archaic.  In some small towns, like the fictional Hohman, Indiana, entering town feels like stepping back several decades.  The display windows of stores were a big deal in past decades, from coast to coast.  Toy trains were often a feature of window displays.  The display in Higbee's (which was a real chain of stores in Ohio) was a classic store display.  I admit that I fail to recall the kind of store Santa that Higbee's had.  The Santa's that I visited in the past had fancy chairs, but they were on the ground.<br /><br />The bully was nicely played in this movie.  As Jean Shepherd noted after the incident between Ralphie and Farkus, once you stood up to the bullies they often stopped bothering you.  I guess it was only fun being a bully when the smaller kids ran away.<br /><br />Ralphie and the broken glasses is also classic.  Glasses were expensive and parent continually advised their children to take care of them.  Ralphie had to think fast after accidentally crunching his glasses.  If Ralphie had revealed that he stepped on his glasses after they fell off because of a ricocheting BB, his parents would like have confiscated his BB gun until he turned 50, or maybe older.<br /><br />The list of events in this movie that defines an era is lengthy.  As I noted before, while the specific incidents may not have been true, they were inspired by actual events.  Jean Shepherd did a phenomenal job of capturing the essence of a region and an era.  Jean clearly loved his childhood in the Midwest, his parents and had a strong nostalgia for an era that is rapidly fading into the distant past.<br /><br />Does the movie have a "message," which one reviewer suggested the movie does not?  This movie has lots of messages.  Note Ralphies' reaction to his Little Orphan Annie decoder; Message:  It's a crummy commercial.  Ralphies' first experience with his Red Ryder BB gun; Message:  Your parent's may actually know what they are talking about and you should take greater care in following their advice.  Ralphie and the bullies; Message:  Sometimes you need to stop letting bullies push you around.  Okay, enough messages.  This movie is filled with messages.  If you failed to find one, you were looking somewhere else - like your navel, or a picture book.<br /><br />Though there is minimal significance to awards for a movie like this, this movie obtained nominations for thirteen awards of various types, and it won two.  Good job!<br /><br />"A Christmas Story" may only be a great family Christmas movie for a while.  That "while" may only be as long as there are enough of us that remember the 1940's, the 1950's and the early 1960's.  Until then, I plan to watch this movie again and again.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>A true classic, in the best sense of the word.  It's not a "stuffy" classic that everyone admires but no one actually enjoys.  It's not a classic in that it's a movie your grandparents really admire...but you have no use for.  Another word for CHRISTMAS STORY would be "timeless."  I have seen this movie nearly every year since it first came out on the big screen 20 years ago.  I enjoy it EVERY TIME.  All the classic comic moments remain hilarious even now.<p>Tongue stuck to flagpole.  The bully with the yellow eyes...and his comeuppance.  The sexy lamp.  The frightening Santa.  It's all there.  Saying "oh fudge!" The movie had a beautiful feel of nostalgia when it came out, and it has the same feel today.  I think for many viewers, this movie has come to define what small town, depression era America was like.  Innocent in all the best ways.  <p>Oh, did I mention the dog and turkey scene?  Or the "how to the piggies eat" scene?<p>Anyway, this is the one movie about Christmas that everyone has seen.  I can mention it to people who think high-art is THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and they recall CHRISTMAS STORY with fondness.  I can mention it to people who normally only see films with sub-titles, and they "ooooh" with misty eyes at their favorite memories.<p>Truly, there isn't a single scene in the movie that's stinker.  It's one of the leanest, meanest movies you'll ever see.  The fat was trimmed very well indeed.<p>Peter Billingsley as Ralphie is perfect in the role.  This kid is almost as big an icon of Christmas entertainment as the Grinch!  Darren McGavin, a favorite of mine, is just terrific as the crusty father with the flair for expletives.  The list could go on.  Not a single role is miscast or forgettable.<p>If by some chance you haven't seen it and can't decide whether you should or not...just go ahead and buy it.  Once you've seen the movie...it'll become a part of YOUR Christmas tradition too!<p>(One very tiny note of warning: the movie doesn't deal with the religious aspects of Christmas one little bit.  It is a totally secular holiday, if this film is to be believed.  If you want a show that remembers the Christ in Christmas...then the Charlie Brown Christmas special needs to be under your tree this year.)</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>This holiday flick definitely ranks in the Top Ten Christmas films of all time, but it caters to a unique audience.  The sense of humor is succinct (not subtle) and the acting definitely outlines the minds and thoughts of many during the Christmas season.  Any film that portrays the thoughts of youngsters when Santa Claus was real...when white Christmas's meant s-o-o-o much...and the excitement of opening presents early on Christmas morn, will love this film.  I believe the best acting performance is turned in by Melinda Dillion (Mom).  She is the most believable.  Child star Peter Billingsley is cute as a blonde, blue-eyed youngster, but he has very few lines and has ample cameo shots (without dialogue).  Veteran actor Darren McGavin is silly and boisterous...but Melinda wins the show.  A must during the Christmas season, this film is funny and will warm your heart.  I'm surprised I waited so long to watch this gem. However, I wouldn't show this film to children.  The angry father (profanity) and the bullish thugs at school may frighten the very young.  All 5 stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"A Christmas Story" was originally released to theatres during the Holidays of 1983, and the film was met with only modest success. Not a critical hit either upon its release, the movie has now become the most touching and heartfelt Christmas motion picture of all-time thanks to numerous showings on cable stations such as TBS, TNT, and pay channels like HBO. At one time the movie was so popular the film was actually shown in a continuous 24 hour marathon. Given a modest budget, "A Christmas Story" tells the simple story of a young boy named Ralphie who wants only one thing for Christmas: a bee bee gun. The film is set around the 1930's or 1940's and features an excellent cast of adult actors, but it's the young child stars that steals the film, most notably Peter Billingsley who plays Ralphie. What person wouldn't love Ralphie, what with his cute smile and big round glasses. The DVD has many bonus features, but it is the informative commentary that features Billingsley and director Bob Clark that is the crowning jewel. They both offer insight into the making of the film. One neat tidbit from the commentary is when Clark states that Jack Nicholson was his original choice to play the dad. Upon viewing this treasure "A Christmas Story" will become a part of your Holiday viewing pleasure for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>There must be at least a hundred films and TV specials that deal with Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, etc. All of them range from the greatest to the worst, and A Christmas Story is one of the greatest. A majority of this country's population have seen this film, and I'm sure all of them now love it right after they've watched it (well, ALMOST all of them, now that I've seen the current reviews here on Amazon). I should be included on the list of those who love it. I mean, this is a definite classic. It's both hilarious and touching at the same time. Along with It's a Wonderful Life and Home Alone, every single minute of this film is almost flawless. It's also one of those films in which you can memorize much of the dialogue, not to mention the many sight gags (tongue on frozen pole, anyone?). I think my favorite scenes are the ones involving soap and lamps . . . I won't give out any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet. Speaking of which, if you haven't seen this Christmas classic just yet, give it a shot, especially on Christmas Eve. You'll quickly understand why it's considered one of the greatest Christmas films of all time.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film begins in winter, children await Christmas. The cars suggest the 1930s. Kids view a department store window. Ralphie sees the one toy he wants: a Red Ryder BB gun. People listen to "The Lone Ranger". Mother knows there is danger with such a toy. [Ralphie's fantasies reflect the cowboy movies of the 1930s.] Remember those snow suits? Would they act up in class? Would they stick out their tongue? What do they want for Christmas? What did his Dad win? How do the piggies eat? What an artistic lamp? They don't make them like that anymore! Remember 15 minute radio programs? Remember tires that often went flat? Getting your mouth washed out with soap? [Was 'Lava' worse than 'Lifebuoy'?] "A crummy commercial!"<br /><br />Ralph's father fights with the furnace. His Mom has an accident with that lamp. Ralphie learns about peaceful coexistence in the alley. Can he ask Santa for that BB gun? We see an elaborate Christmas parade from that era. Santa Claus warns him about that BB gun. Christmas arrives, Santa left a load of toys. Aunt Clara sent a special gift for Ralphie. Isn't it cute? "What's that behind the desk?" Ralphie learns that a BB gun is dangerous when not properly supervised. [A metal backing ricochets towards the shooter.] An open door is dangerous when there are hungry dogs outside. Where can they find a restaurant on Christmas Day? They'll always remember that day.<br /><br />Jean Parker Shephard had a late-night radio show from the late 1950s to the late 1970s. He would reminisce about the days of yesteryear, as in this film. He wrote books during this era. The fact that he lost an eye in childhood was a secret. You can surmise the cause. Any gun is a danger when mishandled by an inexperienced child. BB air guns were originally designed as a toy or tool for adults or responsible children. If you remember another version you'll know they were more explicit about the damage to the eyeglasses. This film shows how commercials to children are used to control buying by adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q04XXGGED746.html">A3Q04XXGGED746</a><br/><p>This classic makes for memories. Who could forget the boy getting his mouth washed out with soap for using profanity, or his delight upon getting a Daisy BB gun for Christmas? Who could forget the scene where he beats the tar out of a bully? Or the scene where he fantasizes being a prima donna in front of his class? And who could overlook the distinctive lady-leg lamp, and the neighborhood spectacle it created? Funny!</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>Hard to believe that this year marks 25 years we were introduced to young Ralphie and the quest for his air power rifle. It is still a fun filled movie for the entire family. Of course we don't recommned that you stick your tongue on a frozen pole and savoring the taste of a bar of soap (you could if you want to!). A Christmas Story is delightful all the way. Fast forward 25 years later to 2008, Peter Billingsley is the man behind another successful Christmas movie...Four Christmases. We will never get enough of this movie for many years to come.

And I've loved it each time. With a wonderful somewhat laconic voiceover narrative by author Jean Shepherd (upon whose stories the movie is based) and terrific performances by Darren McGavin, young Peter Billingsley and Melinda Dillon, this is an immensely funny and even touching movie--with well-realized, wildly imaginative scenes (school bullies, getting a kid to eat, the father's love for an outrageously ugly leg-lamp won in a contest). There is something in which to take new delight with every viewing. Instead of the usual sappy, saccharine stuff that gets aired during the Christmas season, here's a movie with zest and bite. This is a film that uses its source material wonderfully well and succeeds in every way. Celebrate the season with glee and take in A Christmas Story.<br />My highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>I begged my parents for a BB Gun when I was a kid.

It stands well and above every other holiday themed film. It's a true American classic in every sense of the word. Young Ralphie Parker wants a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas. Everyone tells him that he'll shoot his eye out. Ralphie tries everything he can to get that gun. On Christmas, Ralphie gets his wish. The people that warned him about it were also right. The film has the most believeable family. How many parents were like this?. I know of many. Peter Billingsley gives a wonderful performance as Ralphie that is cemented in stone as a film classic. Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon as his parents are top notch. The film is hysterical and very tender and touching as well. I'd watch this movie all year round!. This isn't just a special holiday film. This movie is just special....period.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>One memorable Christmas in the life of a nine-year-old in 1940's Indiana makes for a memorable movie and reflections on the innocence of youth in "A Christmas Story," directed by Bob Clark and starring young Peter Billingsley, Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon.  What is happiness?  To young Ralphie Parker (Billingsley), it's simple; it's getting the best Christmas present a boy could ask for, namely a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot carbine action air rifle BB gun.  But it's getting close to the big day, and his hopes are fading fast; there's an obstacle between him and the coveted weaponry:  Mom (Dillon).  And the answer is "No."  But why!?  "You'll shoot your eye out."  Reasoning and wisdom to which there is simply no argument.  But, as Yogi once said, "It ain't over till it's over," and a determined Ralphie refuses to give in or give up on his quest for the ultimate gift.  And as the story unfolds we get a glimpse, through Ralphie's eyes, of the way life was in another time and another place; an era long since gone, but never forgotten.  Based on a portion of the Novel "In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash," by Jean Shepherd, with a screenplay by Shepherd, Leigh Brown and Bob Clark, Shepherd narrates (as the adult Ralphie), with reminiscences that are poignant and delightful; about Dad (McGavin), an Oldsmobile man, turkey lover and fabled "furnace fighter," who in the heat of battle could weave a tapestry of profanity that as far as anyone knows is still hanging in the air somewhere over Lake Michigan; Mom, a woman who hadn't had a hot meal in years, thanks to tending to the needs of her family first; younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella); friends Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) who share Ralphie's myriad adventures and set the protocol of the "dare," from the singular all the way up to the coup de grace, the "triple dog dare," employed during a contest to determine, once and for all, if one's tongue will in fact stick to a frozen metal flag pole; the endearing Miss Shields (Tedde Moore), the teacher who makes them write a THEME; and last, but not least, the yellow-eyed neighborhood bully, Scott Farcus (Zack Ward) and his toadie, Grover Dill (Yano Anaya), who give new meaning to the phrase, "Say Uncle!"  There are humorous anecdotes about flights of fancy and lessons in life, like how to change a tire in record time and how to barter for the right Christmas tree (from Dad), and tricks used to get your younger brother to eat his food instead of just playing with it, as well as alternative uses for soap (from Mom).  We also discover how Ralphie learned a valuable lesson about how the journey is often the best part of the goal finally realized (courtesy of a "Little Orphan Annie" secret decoder ring), and the real meaning of a "Major Award."  McGavin is perfectly cast as Ralphie's dad, "The Old Man," as he is referred to affectionately, and he gives just the right touch to all of the small ironies of life that seem to surround him, while Dillon gives a winning performance as his mom, whose TLC nurtured the warm memories from which this story was born.  But the most exemplary performance given here is by Peter Billingsley, who forever after will remain Ralphie Parker in the memories of anyone who sees this film.  There is an engaging naturalness about him that makes an instant connection with the audience, for he personifies the child in all of us, and it's a character you'll remember for as long as you retain any memories of your own childhood.  And therein lies the real charm of this movie; because everyone was once a child, and for better or worse, will carry memories akin to Ralphie Parker's (or Jean Shepherd's) forever.  A heartwarming, funny film, "A Christmas Story" is a true classic that can be enjoyed again and again and will most likely become an annual event once you've experienced it.  In the tradition of "It's A Wonderful Life," and "A Christmas Carol," this is a movie that can add so much to the festivities, no matter how you celebrate your holidays.</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>this movie is a modern-day Christmas classic. It captures the joy and fear and exhilaration and disillusionment of what it was like growing up in an America of a by-gone era.

It's all there!<br />Not everyone seems pleased with this SE, but I'm thrilled.  Compared with what was previously available on DVD, this is lightyears better!<p>The extras are great fun, especially the interviews.  It's a shame Jean Shepherd died before he could truly contribute to this real keeper.<p>As for the movie itself, Darren McGavin is great as the blustery but sentimental dad and Melinda Dillon as the mom who is wiser than her kids give her credit for. The movie is touching and hilarious at the same time. It's so hard being a kid sometimes!<p>This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and still laugh.  Everyone gets a chance to relive those classic childhood memories.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>"You'll shoot your eye out, kid."<p>With those six simple words not only were dreams of an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle altered forever, so were the normal holiday movie traditions of Americans across the country. As popular as this feature is today, this did not take hold until quite recently. When A Christmas Story opened in theaters back in 1983, the studio that produced the film had no confidence in it, thus launching the film in only 886 theaters. By the end of its run, the film pulled in a disappointing $19 million and its television rights had been sold off quickly without a second thought. It wasn't until the TNT television network began to offer numerous viewings of the classic holiday comedy over the festive season did the film begin to finally be accepted by the masses. Now A Christmas Story has joined the ranks of such other yuletide treasures as It's a Wonderful Life and A Charlie Brown Christmas as a true staple of this special time of year.<p>The story fellows the adventures of a young boy set against the Christmas holiday in the 1940's as he dreams of the perfect holiday gift. Ralphie Parker is like any other typical young boy in the 1940's but there is something that does set him apart from the rest of the pack. His aspirations for an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle, the one item that he believes to be the perfect Christmas present. Unfortunately for young Ralphie, he faces stern opposition from his mother who believes the toy will "shoot his eye out". He receives no help from his father who is too busy holding off the Bumbus hounds or shouting at the furnace, so Ralphie seeks to find higher help for his cause, the big man himself: Santa Claus. But even this last splint of hope is dashed to pieces with those devastating words coming from the "jolly" fat man himself, "You'll shoot your eye out, kid." All hope seems lost for poor Ralphie but if only he knew what Christmas Day would bring! The plot for A Christmas Story is one of the most wonderful concepts ever attempted in a holiday feature film and what makes it so memorable is the fact that many elements, no matter how elaborated, can be related by one family or another in some point in their lives.<p>The biggest highlight of the comedy has to be how each character is cast perfectly. Peter Billingsley, who takes on the role of Ralph Parker, showcases a delightful performance despite his relatively young age. Many of the funniest moments of the feature come from his reactions alone to certain situations. Melinda Dillion gives a wonderful if not eerily familiar performance of Ralphie's typical 1940's mother. She works perfectly opposite Darren McGavin especially over the battle of the broken leg lamp. McGavin more then likely outshines them all with his over-the-top performance as Ralphie's Old Man. His shoutings of "Don't anybody move!" and "Notafinga!" will likely stand the test of theatrical comedic time but it is his overall good fatherly nature that makes every audience member feel as if they are witness a part of their own familiar past. Though he is not remembered by his name, Jeff Gillen does a hilarious take on the mall-Santa, stingy elfs and all. And Jean Shepard, who wrote the book on which this film is based on, gives a perfect off-beat narration of the film with perfect tones and comments for each situation as it happens in the feature. The narration works almost as well alone as the actions performed in A Christmas Story.<p>Overall, Can the Christmas season be fully complete without at least one viewing of A Christmas Story? You can try but all bets are that even the "Grinchiest" person can't escape the irresistible personality of this yuletide comedy. There are so many wonderful things going for this film that it is hard to pick out the flaws. If anything, the last portion of A Christmas Story tends to drag a little bit near the end unlike earlier parts where actions were performed in a much quicker pace. In a way like Christmas Vacation, many of the elements within A Christmas Story connect with someone at one point or another based on their own Christmas experiences with their family. Though some would not like to admit some of the more embarrassing memories (aka looking like a pink nightmare on Christmas morning), we can all relate to young Ralphie's blight of getting the perfect Christmas gift when we were his age. But in the end, we realize that family, no matter how embarrassing or bumbling they may be, is what is the most important during the holidays. That is one memory that we should always keep close to our hearts no matter what time of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>New Ultimate editions of A Christmas Story are coming out in standard definition and Blu-ray.  Each will repackage the current version with special memorabilia.  So, the standard DVD Ultimate edition will have the same DVDs as the 2003 2-disc Special Edition, and the Blu-ray Ultimate edition will have the same DVD as the 2006 Blu-ray.  In addition, the standard DVD version will have these non-DVD extras:<br /><br />-- a collectible retro Christmas cookie tin (the container for the set)<br />-- 48-page cookbook with recipes inspired by the movie<br />-- photos and quotes from the movie<br />-- a red chef's apron with an A Christmas Story logo on it<br />-- 5 collectible cookie cutters "in iconic Christmas Story shapes" (looks like a star, a house, a leg lamp, Ralphie in his bunny suit, and what may be Peking Duck)<br /><br />The Blu-ray will have a different color collectible tin and a strand of leg-lamp Christmas lights.  Pretty cute.<br /><br />The new editions won't be newly remastered.  The video quality of the 2003 standard DVD release is fairly good, a bit soft, with good mono sound.  It includes both the original 1.85:1 widescreen format (anamorphic) and full screen versions.  The Blu-ray from 2006 is soft-looking for a hi-def version, with fairly good color and the same mono sound.<br /><br />The DVD special features will be the same as before.  For the standard DVD, that includes:<br /><br />-- audio commentary by director/co-writer Bob Clark and star Peter Billingsley (Ralphie)<br />-- two readings by Jean Shepard, author and narrator for the movie (audio only)*<br />-- Another Christmas Story featurette, includes interviews with Clark and a few members of the cast<br />-- Get a Leg Up featurette, about the making and ongoing sale of the (in)famous leg lamp<br />-- A History of the Daisy Red Ryder featurette, on the object of great desire's actual history<br />-- Triple Dog Dare Interactive Trivia*<br />-- Decoder Match Challenge*<br />-- easter eggs (including an actual ad for the leg lamp)*<br />-- original theatrical trailer<br /><br />The Blu-ray lacks a few of those features, marked by asterisks.<br /><br />Now, about the really good stuff, the movie.  A Christmas Story is that odd film that appeals to a cross-section of viewers who often can't agree on what to watch.  Fans of sweet Christmas cheer are happily joined by people with a more jaundiced eye to the holiday.  To be sure, the movie leans more to the sweet than the sour, but it has enough edge and good-natured twistedness to please some of our darker Christmas angels too.  It conveys a genuinely warm nostalgia and some sharp, sometimes pretense-deflating observations about human nature.<br /><br />The story is set at some indefinite time around 1940 in an Indiana town approaching the holidays.  Young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants only one thing for Christmas, the Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action 200-Shot Lightning Loader Range Model Air Rifle with a compass in the stock.  (That is, a BB gun, a very particular one.)  He plans carefully well in advance how to lay the groundwork for this while avoiding the dreaded rebuff, but almost everyone says it anyway: "You'll put your eye out!"  The relentless struggle for the one true gift develops alongside several other small stories and amusing details, a tongue-on-frozen-pole triple-dog dare, facing the local bully, the notorious leg lamp, the Santa slide, Peking Duck for Christmas, and several others, each memorable in itself.<br /><br />The actors aren't very well known, but they're all just right.  There is narration throughout, representing an older Ralphie, done by the originator of the story, Jean Shepard, also just right.<br /><br />This movie, made in 1983, has gradually become a favorite Christmas classic, now shown in an annual 24-hour Christmas marathon on cable, which attracts a huge number of viewers.  If you've never seen it, give it a try, even if you have a little Scrooge in you, and you'll probably enjoy it.  If you're a big fan, or know one, you might want the memorabilia with one of the new Ultimate editions for yourself or a gift.  If you don't care about such extras, just get one of the older editions.<br /><br />There are Amazon pages to pre-order the Ultimate editions <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CFEC7Y">here</a> (standard DVD) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CFLGMS">here</a> (Blu-ray).</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>Ralphie... a man before his time. A victim of BB gun "gun control." Harrassed by bullies, disillusioned by Little Orphan Annie products... Ralphie is maturing despite himself.<br /><br />The funniest scenes involve the stuffed stiff little brother, whose winter garb made him "look like a tick about to pop."  I thought my mother was the only over-protective winter alarmist!!<br /><br />Even small, unimportant moments make me laugh... such as when a "Wizard of Oz" style witch garbed woman is working the crowd lined up to see Santa starts bothering poor Ralphie, and calls him a "tasty little morsel." Ralphie, obsessed with soliciting the big red guy for his Holy Grail of Christmas Presents, responds...<br /><br />"Uh... leave me alone... I'm, uh... THINKING."<br /><br />Ralphie articulates what all kids feel, he daydreams almost as much as I used to.<br /><br />Some forgivable weaknesses in this film is an over-used soundtrack, "cluing us in" as to when we're supposed to laugh... it's repetative music just gets in the way of the humor!<br /><br />Another forgivable flaw is how the movie is actually a series of events, loosely strung together by it's "anecdote master" writer. Still, that's how real life is... not every daily occurance is tied in to the next.<br /><br />The odd style profanity depictions of the father also takes some getting used to... "glabber-puss, humbuckle dash-heimer!!"  We're supposed to imagine the actual terms... which are more commonly heard on television these days than in the movies in the 80s.<br /><br />Ralphie represents the childhood experiences most of us have had... whenever they grew up. It's timeless nostalgia!<br /><br />The DVD extra features serve us well enough, considering the fact that this movie was considered a theatrical "flop" of the mid 80s. It's been a mega-force Holiday tradition in the years proceeding!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>I recently found out that my mother had not seen A Christmas Story; in fact, she had never heard of it. Granted, we're Jewish, and we never watch TV, but I was still appalled. If somebody were to loudly exclaim 'Ith thtuck! Ith thtuck!', or try to sing a Christmas carol with a heavy Chinese accent, she wouldn't understand the reference! She thought my fanatic insistance that everyone on earth had seen the movie and loved it was a mild exaggeration - until we went to the store to rent the movie, and the clerk kept saying to her as he scanned the barcode: "C'mon you must have seen it on TV?--At least once?"<br /><br />So don't imagine your duty is finished once you've seen the movie and enjoyed it.

I have been watching this classic since I was a child.  From the first time on VHS to DVD and now Blu-ray.  This story is probably one of the best Christmas tales to come around the past 25 years.  So how does this HD version stack up against all the others?  Very well if you must know.<br /><br />For all of you familiar and unfamiliar with the story it takes place in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1940's.  An America many people seem to remember fondly.  The story centers around a boy named Ralphy and his Christmas wish to have a Red Rider BB gun.  Of course the adults all seem to feel the gun is unsafe and you the repeated phrase, "You'll shoot your eye out."  Although this is really just a small part of the story.<br /><br />Ralphy is like many boys of his age then and now.  On the cusp of adolescence while still having his childish tendencies.  During the movie you get to know his friends and all the people around him.  Every time I watch this movie I realize how much things are the same when it comes to Christmas in middle class America.  This story seems to tell it better and more realistically than most movies made.<br /><br />Now if you have not bought this movie on DVD it is a great value.  The picture is only mildly improved from it's DVD version.  Sometimes you will be wondering if it's really in HD.  Although despite that this is a great movie.  Christmas or not it is a classic.  The Blu-ray version comes with some extras like a anniversary follow up with a few of the child actors.  Although that is not entirely exciting the movie is.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.5 stars<br /><br />Never saw this as a kid, somehow. I liked it last week, though, and wished I had seen it as a boy so I could have used it to convince my folks to get me a bb gun!<br />My mom said "You'll shoot your eye out" pretty often too. It's a good line, one of the few I had no decent comeback to. "I've got two" never seemed very impressive. Fortunately I still do have both eyes, and they enjoyed this movie. It's well-written and moves along nicely. McGavin is exceptionally funny at times...the Night Stalker as family man.<br />Don't let your boy see this unless you're ready to have the "bb-gun talk"!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>When A CHRISTMAS STORY originally arrived in theatres, it was only around for about three weeks because the studios didn't feel it would make any money and felt the story didn't lend itself to a longer theatrical run. It wasn't until the movie started airing on televsion and cable that people found out how great a movie A CHRISTMAS STORY is. Since then, the movie has become a piece of our American heritage, a part of the pop culture paradigm, and (like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) a Christmas classic.<p>The film revolves around nine-year-old Ralphie whose only wish for Christmas is to own a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action BB gun. However, everyone from his mother to his teacher to Santa Claus himself tells him it's too dangerous and that "You'll shoot your eye out, kid." Along the way, Ralphie and his friends and family get involved in all sorts of comic mishaps. However, in the end everything turns out alright and everyone has a merry Christmas.<p>The movie is full of hilarious heartfelt nostalgia. Anyone who has ever been part of a family or from a rural (in mindset) town will enjoy watching this film again and again. Recommended for viewing at least once a year. And, oh, yeah; don't shoot your eye out.<p>The DVD includes the original theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is my all-time favorite movie so there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about it!<p>Set in the 1940's, the story revolves around Ralphie, a nine-year-old growing up in the midwest, who only wants one thing for Christmas: a bb gun. The movie follows Ralphie, his friends, and family through hilarious adventures, most of them revolving around the bb gun.<p>Laughs abound in this movie and you can't help but cheer for Ralphie when he finally receives his coveted Christmas gift. <p>Every Christmas I watch this movie and still cannot get enough of it. Although I own it both on VHS and DVD, I can't help but watch the 24-hour marathon on TNT on Christmas Eve. <p>This is one movie that is a classic and will be loved for many generations to come!

To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Red Rider Beebee gun glory.<p>The cast is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood.  It is fond remembrances, without the overly cutsie pie touches.  The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.<p>I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other.  Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.<p>Every family should have this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>I was almost finished recording "A Christmas Story" on last Christmas morning. Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition soon.<br /><br />That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half of my favorite holiday on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love "A Christmas Story." This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.<br /><br />Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a "thing that tells time." But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: "You'll shoot your eye out."<br /><br />As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says "the mother of all dirty words," and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky "major award" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.<br /><br />Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything ("We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice"), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.<br /><br />Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message about love and family and all that -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa ("HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!"), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with "Ol' Blue" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.<br /><br />And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life with his slightly stressed-out delivery. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: "Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap." "He looks like a pink nightmare!" "Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!" and others. McGavin gets many of the best ones, though ("FRA-GEE-LAY... that must be Italian!").<br /><br />Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. He's never oversmart or annoying, ever. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's "show me how the piggies eat!" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.<br /><br />"A Christmas Story" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime. HOOOOO HOOOOO HOOOO...</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>For me, this is a childhood favorite!

In case you are new, I'll give you a brief synopsis; Ralphie Parker wants an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model air rifle (BB Gun) for Christmas, but his mother, teacher, and Santa Claus keep telling him "You'll shoot your eye out" Will Ralphie get his BB gun? If you love Christmas, comedies, and classics, you'll love A CHRISTMAS STORY!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>All I can say is....finally. This movie finally got a decent DVD treatment and we can all now release a big sigh of relief. It's here. Haven't seen the movie before?. Well, forget about "It's A Wonderful Life" or "Miracle On 34th Street", because this is the quintessential holiday movie. No buts about it. The movie was adapted from a short story by author Jean Shepard, from his book,"In God We Trust:All Others Pay Cash". It tells the story of little Ralphie Parker(Peter Billingsley), a young kid who has one wish this holiday season. He wants nothing more than a Daisy Brand Red Ryder BB Gun all wrapped up in a big bow under the Christmas tree come Christmas morning. It turns out to be more of an ordeal than Ralphie expected, when he keeps getting told that it's dangerous and he'll "shoot you're eye out". The rest of the family is made up with dad(the great Darren McGavin), a curmudgeonly man who spends a lot of time battling the neighbor dogs, and their unstable furnace. Mom(the great as well, Melinda Dillon), is a typical housewife who is kept too busy with the house and raising the family, than having any real time of her own. Little brother Randy, well, he doesn't like to eat his food, and he has a rather nasty snow outfit. The movie is about as warm and cozy as you could possibly get. It takes place in the 40's, and the filmmakers and set designers pull it off brilliantly, as it really looks and feels like that time. The acting is sharp and real. They really act like a family, and not like they are trying to pretend to be a family. The movie has a real Norman Rockwell type look and feel to it, and that only adds to it's charm. It's a very nostalgic piece, and will hit home with a lot of people. Not necessarily because of the holidays and what may go on in your house at that time, but just because of the childhood factor. The close friends, the walk to school, the bully, the grumpy pop. And, if you are old enough to of been around back then, the cars, the furniture, and the radio shows. It's just very nice. Christmas has never been more fun, more heartwarming, or more real, than in this movie. It's a classic, and an American treasure. Now, the extras. The movie comes with both widescreen and full screen. If you get it in full screen, why on earth would you want it in widescreen?. I'm so glad it came with the full screen option, for as I can't stand widescreen, and can't possibly understand how anybody can. It's a horrible thing, and ruins the movie. It doesn't add anything, but so many people have been duped into believing it does. You can't take reviewers seriously when they rate a DVD one star because the widescreen isn't good, but they also have a full screen option. Or that it only comes in full screen. Full screen is what you want!!. The other special features are a mixed bag, but all of them pleasant nonetheless. First of all, Melinda Dillon is promised to do the commentary with Billingsley. She isn't here. It's Billingsley and director Bob Clark. There is an 18 minute piece with Billingsley, Clark, and three other kids(Flick, Schwartz, and Scott Fargus), talking about their time on the movie. It's a cute feature, and it's nice to see these kids have turned out so well. There is a great piece where we get some old radio readings from Jean Shepard. It's so cool and will be nice to listen too with your tree on and a fire going. You get a trivia quiz with the actors giving questions and responses, as well as the trailer, a decoder game, and a history of the leg lamp and the red ryder gun. Those last two are quite dull, but fun to have. It would of been nicer if McGavin and Dillon and the little brother were featured too. Where were they?. All in all, it's a sharp collection, and the packaging is great, and the picture and sounds are crisp, clear and wonderful. Not a single problem here and definitley not a one star disc compared to the ludicrous other reviews. Get it today and make sure it is part of your private collection forever. I double dog dare you!!.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KROYMQ61M7A.html">A3KROYMQ61M7A</a><br/><p>"You'll shoot your eye out." How many<br /><br />times did Ralphie hear that?

It's a simple child's tale of the all-American Christmas, capturing a picture-perfect portrait of holiday warmth and zest through its delectable combination of laughter and touching moments. Most importantly, the film recalls the pleasures of childhood during the Christmas season, and that can provide as much joy as any other film. <p>The story is based on a segment of Jean Sheperd's novel &quot;In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,&quot; a personal memoir of his experiences. It helps that Sheperd collaborated in the creation of the screenplay, as well as lending his narration as the adult voice of Ralphie Parker (played by Peter Billingsley), who wants nothing more than to wake up on Christmas morning and find a &quot;genuine Red Ryder 200-Shot Carbine Action Air Rifle&quot; under the tree. Ralphie doesn't merely want this gift, but yearns for it with every fiber of his childhood being. His convictions that an English paper on what he wants for Christmas, as well as putting in his request to Santa Claus, stand as his assurance that he cannot fail in his quest. <p>Of course, there are obstacles, made whimsical and witty by director Bob Clark's wonderful knack for situational humor. His mother's words, &quot;You'll shoot your eye out,&quot; seem to echo from the mouths of everyone around, including his would-be alibi, Santa Claus, who is seen in a most frightening light by the children who line up to sit on his lap. Even Ms. Shields, his teacher, is a dead end, granting him a C+ on his &quot;All I Want For Christmas&quot; theme paper with a small note toting Mrs. Parker's infamous warning.<p>The film is a very warm and inviting Christmas story, capturing the holiday season of yesteryear in an authentic and gleeful manner. Set in Indiana in the 1940's, Clark captures small vignettes of the time period through Ralphie's life experiences, from his eager anticipation of a secret decoder machine sent by the radio show he listens to every night at 6:45, to his punishment for using foul language by keeping a bar of Lifebuoy soap in his mouth for a prolonged period of time (&quot;Over the years, I got to be quite a connoisseur pf soap...&quot;). <p>What helps the movie in the long run are its characters, who never overstay their welcome or lose the appeal they possess. Ralphie's parents, known only to us as Mom and the Old Man, are the perfect parents: his mother, played with supreme charm by Melinda Dillon, is a warm and caring woman, as shown in her methods of getting younger brother Randy to eat by referring to him as &quot;Mommy's little piggy,&quot; and in her protective yet nurturing nature in regards to her children. His father, a stern yet gentle man, is the ideal working-class family man who sits at the table, reads his paper, but still exudes a great deal of caring for his family. Darren McGavin's performance as Mr. Parker deserves high praise, especially in his childlike glee over winning a table lamp in the shape of a woman's leg. <p>Billingsley is the most notable of these actors, instilling Ralphie with all the emotions and thoughts a normal child experiences. His run-ins with neighborhood bully Scut Farcus provides a truly satisfying scene of turning the tables, while his daydreams of getting an A+ on his English paper and his going blind from &quot;soap poisoning&quot; are filled wit merriment and humor. <p>I think what &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; captures most effectively is the unbearable countdown to Christmas Day, which, for a child, can be the most excruciating twenty-four days of the year. Here is a movie that is guaranteed to bring back wonderful memories of childhood, with something that everyone from all generations can relate to, whether it be the joys of the long-awaited Christmas morning, or the shared pleasure of reliving the time and place, and the painstaking accuracy with which it is portrayed.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>For some reason unknown we had never seen this movie before last night. Well last night we watched it and were totally drawn into its charm. In 1940 I was about the same age as the hero of our story and shared the same longings for a Red Ryder BB Gun. It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance that BB gun had in the life of a boy of that age at that time in history.<br /><br />The movie does a grand job of picturing the life of a boy in that era; the radio programs, the special rings, decoders and other secret devices that were available for the boy who wanted to be a part of something special and most of all the prized BB gun. These things made life worth living for the boy of that time. The serious turn that life would take on December 7th of the next year was still future and unknown; life at this time was good.<br /><br />In the evenings the family would gather around the radio and listen to favorite shows; there were a number of mystery shows that would come on in the evenings and we would always turn off all of the lights in the house and the glow of the dial on the Philco radio would be the only light. Some of the feelings of this mood are caught in the movie.<br /><br />The movie faithfully captures pictures of products that were popular during that time in the kitchen and laundry. The major children's movies of the time, "Snow White" and "The Wizard of Oz" are portrayed in the Christmas parade scene. Both of these movies were major accomplishments that still have a huge following today.<br /><br />The movie does a good job of placing the viewer in the mind of the young boy in 1940 with his dreams and fantasies about what might be awaiting him in life. This movie is a fairly authentic trip down memory lane for those of us who lived our lives at that time and a glimpse of life from a boy's perspective in 1940 for those who were to be born later.<br /><br />I recommend the movie highly for the entire family; we're adding it to our annual Christmas collection along with other Christmas classics.<br /><br />PS For the record I got my Red Ryder BB gun but can't remember for sure if I slept with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is a collection of tales as they are recollected by a person thinking back on their childhood one Christmas.

Only a few movies are exceptions to this, and "A Christmas Story" is near the top of that list.<br /><br />It doesn't matter that the story is set in late 1945 --- if you remember your own childhood (or have kids in the right age) you will be able to relate to the trials & tribulations of Ralphie and his peers.  This movie is remarkably free of sappy nostalgia --- thank fortune --- and instead focuses on the ordeals of childhood with all of Shepard's mordant wit wonderfully intact.  The narrative & dialogue is exquisite and always has me laughing, even after repeated viewings.<br /><br />From a historical perspective, I enjoy the fact that this is one of very very few films available today that deals with post-war 1940's USA.  I cannot think of many films ("Best Years of Our Lives" --- any others?) that cover that particular time period, which seems to have disappeared from our collective memory for some reason.<br /><br />Really, this is as good as it gets; a reminiscence of childhood without sentiment or nostalgia, and gobs of humor.  It happens to be centered around the Christmas season, so I suppose it has to be classified as a Christmas film, but it really is entertaining to watch at any time of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>This is the story of a particular Christmas in the 1940s when little Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wanted a genuine Red Ryder BB gun and was terrified that no one would get one for him.  This film has become a beloved holiday classic, but somehow I seem to be immune to its charms.  It's not a bad movie, but it seems more like a better-than-average TV movie than a Christmas perennial that actually won two Genies (Canadians Oscars) for direction and screenplay.  However, I'll grant that the scene with the department store Santa is a classic.<br /><br />I guess I have to put this on the same list as "Vertigo," "E.T.," and "Blow Up"--movies beloved by so many that just don't do it for me./</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>So many people cited this as their very favorite Christmas movie, and I'd never seen it, so  I figured I should watch it.<br /><br />Basically, it's about a boy in the 1940s who wants a BB gun for Christmas. It's set in the 1940s. Rather than a single, linear story, it's a series of scenes about their life in the 1940s. Did I mention that it's set in the 1940s? Argh. Obviously, the filmmakers spent a lot of time and money getting the setting just right, because they beat the audience over the head with it every chance they got. Drove me up a wall, in case you didn't notice.<br /><br />It's also got the first-person voice-overs from grown-up Ralphie. If you watched The Wonder Years, it's like that. A grown-up navel-gazing about his childhood. It's almost as entertaining as listening to someone tell you about their dreams.<br /><br />There were some amusing scenes, of course, and I even laughed aloud several times. And I really enjoyed the end. It was such a nice parent moment--that no matter how disappointing his own life was, he could still give that joy to his son.  Awwwww....<br /><br />I'd guess it would be a more appealing movie if I had an idealized view of childhood or of the 1940s (it was set in the 1940s, by the way). Unfortunately, I have neither. Or if I liked Hollywood's version of a "cute kid." I have kids. Three of them. They're cute--or were, when they were younger. I tend to find Hollywood's version of cute obnoxious and whiny.<br /><br />On the other hand, I can't agree with the (very few) negative reviews--almost all of which complained about either vulgarity or *gasp* a gun! for Christmas! *ack!*--either. It was the 1940s. Kids had guns. They had BB guns in the 1960s, too--well, the boys did, at least--I had to borrow my little brother's. And it's pretty obvious that vulgarity doesn't bother me--I give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Z4OXS">Blazing Saddles</a> 5 stars.<br /><br />I'm glad I finally saw it, but I don't think I'll be watching it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>There are some strengths to this movie.  The marriage we get to witness is a terrific one.  The father and mother love each other and the children.  It is not a wealthy family.  It is an average family.  I can't believe that one of the reviewers on this site complained that the family was grimy.  That is one of the few strengths of this film, that the family is ordinary rather than wealthy and proper.<br /><br />My favorite moment of the movie is when Santa Claus gives the little boy a kick.  It's the only real laugh in the film.<br /><br />As for the rest of it, it's a children's film, and if you like that sort of thing, you will like this.<br /><br />The bullying that takes place in the movie is disturbing.  I don't see any humor in it.  Bullying is no joke.  I was glad to see that the little boy gave the bully hell, eventually.  But it really isn't the kind of subject to make light of, and this movie does make light of it.  Oh well, haha, a neighborhood bully is tormenting the kids again, no big deal.<br /><br />To sum up, I like the love in this ordinary family, and for a kids movie it isn't too bad.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>This movie, some would say is right up there with, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;.  I have to disagree.  Don't get me wrong.  It's not a bad movie, but it's not that great.  There are moments that are funny like the scene where the kid sticks his tongue on the lamp post in below freezing teperatures or the lead kid getting sent down the chute by Santa Claus.  Other than that, it's at best, an average movie that serves it's purpose for the holiday.  Good, but not Great!!</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>I would rather have my eye poked out than watching a movie about a whinning kid who wants a BB gun for christmas for god knows why, maybe shooting the kid who put his tongue on a frozen flagpole on a dare.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>HOWEVER-RALPHIE'S GOAL:A RED RYDER LEVER ACTION B.B. GUN, IS SOMEWHAT MORE LOFTY!<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL:RALPHIE IS A BOY ON A MISSION -- A CHRISTMAS MISSION<br /><br />Here we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.<br /><br />NEVERTHELESS - FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL:<br /><br />We have a lofty goal - THE RED RYDER BB GUN under the tree! To reach this goal he must overcome the growing din of naysayers including his teacher and mother who insist: "YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT!!!!!!<br /><br />To reach that goal we have objectives - giving clues to mom and dad, getting Miss Shields [5th grade teacher] to endorse the idea, and going directly to "THE MAN" - SANTA, to enlist his support.<br /><br />BUT THERE IS MORE - MUCH MORE!<br /><br />For starters, we have a ten year old's strange fantasies - having "BLACK BART" and his gang all "pushing up daisies" after a showdown with cowboy Ralphie and "Old Blue" [his Red Ryder].<br /><br />We have a dare that goes from bad to worse as it escalates into a "Triple Dog Dare"! What ensues, is simply something that we suggest you don't try at home. That is, unless you want to get your tongue frozen stuck to a pole?<br /><br />We have Bully's and their henchmen. We have really cool narration. Plus, we have Dad and his major award silliness, when he isn't fighting furnace fires, the Buppases dogs and just plain acting uncool in a perfect dad sort of way.<br /><br />Add to that, we have Chinese turkey and christmas themes, flat-tires, a soap poisoning fantasy, a little boy wearing a little girl's pink bunny outfit and the long awaited "Little Orphan Annie" decoder set with a letter countersigned by Annie in real ink! We have a little brother, an epiphany over mom and some typical school chums getting into trouble stuff too.<br /><br />There is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for "The Grand Canyon Suite" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Super-duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family. It never gets tiring and it actually grows on you over time. I first saw "A Christmas Story" at the Vero Beach [FLA] Drive-In in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />I have never seen the 2-Disk set. The single disk, full-screen version I do have is quite an improvement over the VHS version insofar as picture quality is concerned. There are NO FEATURES, and that is of course sad as this type of nostalgic film with child actors really would benefit from that. All in all, this is a great film to have on DVD as it seems to shout - PLAY ME AGAIN!</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Adapted from humorist Jean Shepherd's hilarious memoir (In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash), A Christmas Story has climbed the ranks of the annual holiday must see films to claim its spot among the hallowed elite. If you've ever tried to lick a frozen telephone pole, or found yourself in a ridiculous outfit on Christmas morning, then A Christmas Story is one comedy that you won't want to miss...<br /><br />The story focuses on one central character - 5th grader Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his all-encompassing quest to receive a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle for Christmas (you could put an eye out with one of those things, you know?) Thwarting Ralphie at every turn are his mother (Melinda Dillon) and father (Darren McGavin) who seem absolutely oblivious to their young child's aims.<br /><br />Unable to come right out and say what he wants, Ralphie drops subtle hints around the house (such as placing clipped-out magazine ads for the gun in his parents' nightstand reading material). When prodded for his true Christmas wish, Ralphie blurts out that he wants a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB gun, but his mother's only reply is, "You don't want one of those. You'll shoot your eye out!"<br /><br />A Christmas Story is filled with memorable scenes and highlights that have helped built a cult following around the life of a young boy obsessed with Christmas and surrounding by eccentric family members. When Ralphie's father beams with pride at his ability to win a newspaper contest, his proudly displays his prize in the front window of the family home - his prize being a lamp with a woman's long, stocking-covering leg as its own leg to stand on. Embarrassed, Ralphie's mother "accidentally" breaks it, sparking a war of words with her husband. Meanwhile, Ralphie dreams of saving the whole family with his Red-Ryder BB gun, and thus earning their undying gratitude.<br /><br />One of the best sequences in the film involves a family trip to the local department store, where Ralphie and his little brother Randy meet with the store Santa Clause near closing time. Following a long, extended wait to reach the front of the line to see Santa, Ralphie is so brimming with anticipation to tell Santa what he wants that he can't speak. So, Santa convinces Ralphie that he wants a football. But before Santa's helper can push Ralphie down the North Pole slide, Ralphie blurts out his true wish, only to hear Santa's reply, "You'll shoot your eye out with that, kid!"<br /><br />One of the best Christmas comedies ever made (few come close to Christmas Vacation), A Christmas Story is a memorable holiday classic that the whole family can enjoy. In much the same way as It's A Wonderful Life, the film has only grown in popularity in the years since its release. The timeless nature of its subject matter lends itself well to annual holiday viewing, and it remains one of the few "must see" films of the season...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Twenty years after its initial release, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; remains one of the most heartwarming, human and enjoyable Yuletide tales ever.  The casting of Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin was truly inspired and are at the heart of this classic.  Billingsley's unabashed imagination, his wide-eyed awe of all that goes on around him, his desire to get that beebee gun, and his joyous love of life is one of the best children's performances on celluloid.  Melinda Dillon's Mom is a joy to behold---witness how she gets little Randy to eat his mashed potatoes and meatloaf--what a marvelous performance she gives--her love and admiration for her husband and children is evidenced in so many sublte ways and Dillon captures and embodies the wonder of motherhood.  McGavin, needless to say, is awesome.  Childlike, foul-mouthed, but the biggest kid in the movie.  This movie alone shows what an underappreciated and fine actor Mr. McGavin is.<br />Christmas' true meaning and its simplicity and joy have not been captured any more effectively in this Christmas gem.<br />Have yourself a merry little Christmas and watch this one every year!</p></br></body></html>

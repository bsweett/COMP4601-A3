It also stars Anita Briem as a Mountain Guide/Love Interest and Josh Hutcherson as Fraser's nephew.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, but even with a healthy suspension of disbelief, this movie has so many holes and overly cute elements that it falls firmly into the same category as Looney Toon Cartoons for me. Except for one tear jerker scene (relatively short and needed to close a plot line), it is mostly comic mayhem and some bits of genuine excitement. It flows like a video game, moving from scene to scene at a hectic pace that most kids will enjoy.<br /><br />About the 3D: The DVD we received had the 2D version on one side and the 3D version on the other. It also came with four 3D glasses. The 3D shown in the theaters uses a completely different technology to produce the 3D effect than the type that is possible on home TVs. This resulted in a hugely disappointing experience for my family, as the 3D effect bothered all of our eyes. We toughed out the bad 3D for about 1/3rd of the movie before flipping it over and finishing with the 2D version.<br /><br />All in all, it is a fairly fun movie but it is completely disposable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This remake is really disappointing and doesn't even come close to capturing the wonder of the original. The writers aimed this movie at 5 and 6 year old kids, but I think even they would be bored to tears as the action doesn't start until two thirds of the film has elapsed! Even when the film gets going.....so to speak, it's so tame and ridiculous that you would be much better off watching a classic like 'Pinocchio' or even the Saturday morning TV show 'Land Of The Lost' for more drama!<br /><br />I like Brendan Frasier, but he has made some extremely bad film choices over the years, hey I know....who can argue with a couple of million dollars to do this stuff?. Right?....... I'd probably do it too!<br /><br />In short, the CGI is unconvincing, the film is beyond juvenile and the story is really stupid and boring, it even seemed long for it's 85 minute running time and 10 minutes of that are opening and closing credits. I like the cast, but even they can't save this one from falling into a bottomless pit!</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie is awesome. i loved the original alot and i love this one to. i liked how it was not as much of a reemake but more of a reebot. like they did not redo the same story. i liked how the maine characters followed the book to find the center of the earth. this is a great family film full of wonder and excitement. who knows maybe there is another world within ours. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>We have seen Brendan Fraser movies at only maintained the title and not the meat of the true story, such as "The Mummy", who does not look a thing like Peter Cushing (1959). Now we are presented with "Journey to the Center of the Earth."  However, this movie does give us a good synopsis of the story.  Moreover, it is very much fun to watch.<br /><br />Prof. Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) has lost a brother. Professor Anderson's nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has lost a father. Well circumstances force them to spend some time together.  They realize that they might be able to find the lost Max Anderson and make a trip to Iceland in pursuit.  They are bigger and across the tasty mountain guide Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (Anita Briem), who has recently lost her father.  Both Hannah's father, and Trevor's brother had one thing in common; they were Vernians. So all three each bringing their own unique talents, set off to find the lost Max Anderson.<br /><br />I first watched the 2D version of this movie in Blu-ray high definition.  Some of the scenes were quite beautiful, such as the diamonds that had the lights behind them, so they would glisten in the cave.  The movie did look a little bit like it was cranked out at the last minute with many things not thought out.  However, it was still fun for the time that it lasted.<br /><br />Now it was time to watch the 3-D version. , I must say that some of the scenes are spectacular.  The trilobite at first may be halved almost at back of the seat.  Other scenes instead of extending out into the viewer's space recessed back and looked like the old stereoscopic slides. Occasionally there looked like a pane of glass with a reflection of what was behind it. I am not sure if this was sloppy manufacturing or beyond the technology even of today.  No matter the problem, it is well worth the viewing and I hope this will catch on as an industry option.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>The good: Lots of great effects and exciting scenes. I saw this in 2D, but lots of coming-at-you scenes must have worked beautifully in 3D projection.<br /><br />The bad: pretty much everything else. The story's logic faltered in just too many places. And, for a movie about a scientist, they got way too much of the science horribly wrong. Magnesium never occurs in metallic form in nature because it's so reactive, birds didn't exist 150 million years ago, and, well, lots more. And, despite his best effort to shake it off, Fraser's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304711867">George of the Jungle</a> seems to stand behind every attempt at a dramatic scene. If you want mindless excitement, great, but make sure you understand just how mindless.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>Skip the movie and go straight to the extra features. There's a terrific one on the whole "hollow Earth" movement that fueled Jules Verne's imagination to write the terrific book on which this lame movie is based on.<br /><br />No amount of special effects can save this as the movie just meanders all over the place. Brendan Fraser cannot carry movies unless they are comedies. The female actress (whose name I've forgotten already) is unmmemorable and if she's supposed to have an Icelandic accent it keeps morphing into British. The young kid is also hopeless in this.<br /><br />Really, it's not any of these actors' faults as the script is just brutal.<br /><br />Literally, I ended up doing chores around the house as this ran as after awhile I just gave up. It's beyond dull. (Plus as posting of Aug. 25, 2001, there are over 200 used copies of this for sale starting from 16 cents so that says a lot more than any review.)</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This isn't the greatest movie, but it definitely isn't terrible. If I were able to give half stars, I'd give this one three and a half. The story is entertaining and fairly interesting if a bit cheesy and cliched at times, with several plot holes. Brendan Fraser does a decent job as the main character, and the adventure he has with his nephew and tour guide is fun to follow. Rent this movie before you decide to buy, some will like it more than others.

We were able to watch it very comfortably with our 9 year old grand-daughter.<br /><br />The movie, which is about three people trapped far beneath the earth with prehistoric plants and creatures, is both exciting and funny. The main characters are all likable, and Brendan Fraser is at his charming and funny best.<br /><br />Sadly, even if you do all the work to correctly track down the 3D dvd version of this film and the 3D glasses. it won't do you much good. The home 3D presentation doesn't exactly jump off the screen at you, so my advice would be to skip the extra trouble and expense that I went through to that end.<br /><br />Suspension of disbelief is no greater for this 'follow-up' film than it was for the Verne book or for the original movie with James Mason and Pat Boone. The special effects are good, and the same solid dinosaurs about to eat people type that you've come to appreciate ever since Jurassic Park. The story is NOT meant to be a cover of the Verne book, it is sort of a sequel, in a way. That element of the movie was handled in a very interesting fashion.<br /><br />This is not the best movie you've ever seen, but it is enjoyable, and one of few you can enjoy with the family, so it does have value.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A science professor's untraditional hypotheses have made him the laughing stock of the academic community. But on an expedition in Iceland, he and his nephew stumble upon a major discovery that launches them on a thrilling journey deep beneath the Earth's surface, where they travel through never-before-seen worlds and encounter a variety of unusual creatures. This movie is the most entertaining 3-D movie I've ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>This (latest, mindless) remake of the Jules Verne classic is hopelessly silly, Brendan Fraser must possess an innate "annoyance" chromosome, and if I saw one more death-defying plunge down some endless abyss I was promising to scream louder than the actors.  Yet, oddly, indescribably, uncharacteristically, I found myself having a bit of fun watching this moronic bubble-gum version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  I'm just not going to tell anyone.<br /><br />Playing a pseudo scientist (which is fitting, as Fraser is a pseudo actor) journeying to Iceland with the young son (Josh Hutcherson) of his dearly-departed brother, Fraser's Professor Trevor Anderson comes under the tutelage of Hannah Asgeirsson (Anita Briem), the daughter of Trevor's brother's former mentor (huh?).  Hannah takes the two Americans on an Icelandic expedition, where they end up plunging down a hole and into a funky world of animated nonsense.  All the silliness is amplified by cornpone action sequences, yet I had to keep reminding myself this film was initially a 3D offering for kids (and Hutcherson darn sure plays to that audience), so it's all in good clean (sort of) fun.  The ending is predictably (and conveniently) over the top, and the plot instantly forgettable, but JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is still worth one or two giggles and gaggles.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Brendan Fraser, Anita Briem and Josh Hutcherson go deep in the relatively entertaining tale "Journey To The Center Of The Earth."  This version of "Journey" is not a remake nor is it an adaptation of the Jules Verne adventure that some many other films have been based on.<br /><br />In this particular tale, Fraser plays a seismic geologist named Trevor Anderson who is losing students and his brother's memorial research center at the university where he teaches and does research.  When his nephew, Sean (Hutcherson), comes up to spend a few days with him before moving with his mother to Canada, the pair uncover notes in Sean's father's copy of "A Journey to the Center of the Earth" that match up with some of Trevor's research.  This leads them to believe that Sean's dad might have been on to something before he went missing in the field.<br /><br />With Sean's father's copy of "Journey" in tow, a hasty trip to Iceland is planned to check data gathered at one of Trevor's sites.  Notes in the novel lead the pair to an obscure professor's research institute in Iceland where they meet the now-deceased scientist's daughter, Hannah (Briem).  She agrees to guide them on their quest and then the three of them literally journey to the center of the Earth.<br /><br />Once the group enters the cave that will eventually lead to the center of the Earth, the viewer is offered a ton of visual oohh's and ahhh's.<br /><br />Originally shot in 3-D, the film relies on the gimmick a bit too much at times and the plot suffers for it.  The CGI is very vibrant and colorful, and can be sketchy at certain points.  However, the entire film has a light air to it, and the sometimes goofy CGI only aids to this.  From runaway mining cars a la "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" to a race for life against an enormous T-Rex that nods to "Jurassic Park," the writers/director/producers know exactly what they've got with this film and try to build upon it throughout the movie.<br /><br />Fraser, Hutcherson and Briem work very well together.  While there's quite a bit of generic dialogue between the characters, they seem to be in on the joke that this film is meant strictly to entertain and do nothing else.  All three of them seemed to be having fun with the silliness of the script.<br /><br />While it isn't the greatest family film out there, it is definitely a crowd pleaser for families with children under the age of thirteen.  Some of the action might be a little tough for younger viewers to watch, but the film has no foul language (although adults and most kids will pick up the "shist" line easily), no sexuality and only brief moments of peril.<br /><br />Take it for what it is.  It's funny, silly and plays to Fraser's comedic strengths.  He's one of the few actors who can pull off the action/comedy bit and do it well.  It's more deserving of three-and-a-half stars than four, but I rounded up for the simple fact that it is a very fun film to watch.<br /><br />Recommended to families with children interested in science fiction and fantasy, fans of Fraser's work, and to folks who just want to turn of their brains for a bit and have a good laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>After wasting time watching this remake, I was made to appreciate the classic "Journey to the Center of the Earth". The 1959 version with it's comically outdated "special" effects and corny acting and dialog I was made to appreciate at least for the "gravitas" and dread that movie was so infused with. As a kid it was kinda heavy. You feel like your embarking on a very dangerous expedition. Which makes sense considering your going to the center of the Earth (although of course that is all that is sensible about this fantasy story). But if you do a story about people going through the Earth and repeatedly almost being killed you want to convey the emotion of people being terrified to death. Remember the music from the old movie? And the duck? No duck in this one. And no dread. Just a silly, mostly lighthearted second rate cgi roller coaster ride that isn't worth the price of a ticket.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>Trevor: Hey, look at all the shist.<br />Sean: What?<br />Trevor: It's a metamorphic rock. Green shist, white shist, micro-guarded shist-<br />Sean: Oh. Shist.<br /><br />This adaptation of the Jules Verne classic novel features Trevor, a goofy volcanologist (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, a canny Icelandic tour guide (Anita Briem).<br /><br />While on a hastily arranged expedition to Iceland to retrieve data from a previously dormant volcanic sensor gadget, the trio emulates Alice by falling down a hole.  Curiouser and curiouser, they end up not in Wonderland, but in a lost world, where long-extinct phosphorescent birds flutter by and the flying fish have a serious case of overbite.<br /><br />Using the storyline of a missing brother and misunderstood Vernian volcanologists, the little group wanders around the treacherous terrain, overcoming insurmountable odds and horrible hardship (Eat your Trilobite, Sean) before reaching the grandly preposterous finale.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1.

Classic Story! Brendan Frazer! Stunning effects!  Can't lose, right..?<br />Wrong.<br />The relation to the original story is weak, with only the `idea' preserved, none of the richness of character, imagination and depth of detail of the book (or the original James Mason film, for that matter..).<br />The script is geared to kids, and is all about moving quickly through the motions in the same way those short movies that introduce amusement park attractions do.  No-one cares about character development or building tension etc... it's just - when can we get to our next `moment'!  And if it's moments you are after, there are certainly some ok effects on display, and younger viewers might have their interest held.. but I for one was grateful it only lasted 90 minutes.<br />So much for the film - what about the 3D!  Well, there is the option to watch in 3D on one disc, or 2D on the other.  In 2D the movie is flat, lighting looks abnormally bright, and colours washed out.  On the 3D version - yes, you really do get to watch in 3D - or at least as many of you have glasses...  However, the effect though stunning is rather erratic, the glasses uncomfortable cheap cardboard, the images in dark and weird colours thanks to the green / red glasses you wear.  I think watching in 3D is an exciting novelty - but based on this, it's a cinema experience, not a home theatre one, no matter if you do have a large projector screen. And clearly directors have not yet figured out how to make a movie that happens to be 3D, rather than an amusement park ride drawn out to feature length in order to get a release.  It's all just too self conscious.<br />Shame, I love Jules Verne, and even beneath the shallowness of this effort I enjoyed some of it in the way younger kids will.  But my advice - save the pennies, and next time a movie like this comes along, try and see it at the cinema if you want to see it in 3D.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>I wanted to see this flick because I liked the original Journey to the Center of the Earth with Jame Mason and Pat Boone.  That movie was a real long journey, mostly on foot and still captured the imagination.<br /><br />What this movie did was made the story into more of fascinating joy ride.  It gave you thrill ride sensation, like you were at an amuzement park or at a theme park.  The movie had some fun scenes that must have been great in 3D.  I liked the roller coaster ride that was created from the mine shaft train, a little Indiana Jonesish, but still fun.  The dino scene was a little silly, but still fun.  The falling scenes were also pretty good.  Although the humor was campy, there were definately a few laughs.<br /><br />Fraser is a rather nice guy geologist who is down on his luck, his brother went missing over ten years ago and Fraser is attempting to keep his work going.  His nephew is sent to spend a short vacation with him and Fraser is given his brothers things that eventually open the door to going on the journey.  Cool were the older copies of Jules Vernes actual book.  I remembered some of those from grammar school.<br /><br />There is the usual troubled teen issue at the beginning and he grows from his bonding experience with his uncle.  So we have a good story, good comedy, great action and effects, but, it was still a bit light.  I wish they would have had Pat Boone show up in the flick for a cameo giving us a connection with the old movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed the scenes in Iceland and Italy, and of course, the Center of the Earth.  Good for a laugh or for a light evening of got nothing better to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I am a fan of Jules Verne, which is why I wanted to watch this movie. The special effects are fantastic and storyline is decent & fun throughout the movie. It is also action packed and this is good. I think this is a good movie for children too.<br /><br />The acting by Brendan Fraser is simply awful. The poor man can't act (in my opinion) and the rest of the cast was alright in terms of their acting skills.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Although I'm certain 3D will enhance the viewing experience with this fun film, it's not necessary for pure enjoyment. I loved the pace of the story and of course all the 'creatures'. A treat for anyone who is a fantasy, action lover and a fan of the book as well. I do hope to see it on a bigger, 3D screen at some point. Fraser is his usual amusing self as a lovable Uncle and Professor who accidentally brings his nephew and a female mountain guide on the journey of a lifetime when he tries to find out what happened to his older, adventurous brother.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Cheesy to its core. Brendan Fraser mugs his way through this family-fared piece of fluff, while CGI Dinosaurs and glow in the dark birds make up the ooh and ah factor. With a running time of barely 90 minutes, there's no filler at all, but frankly, there's no depth. Fraser, with his affable charm, at least gives the film a center. His nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and their Icelandic volcano guide (Icelandic actress Anita Briem) are given little else to do except run from danger and scream often.<br /><br />Given that "Journey To The Center Of The Earth" was set up as a kids effects movie (I did not see the 3-D version, but the 3-D moments were obvious), this is pure, mildly exciting and non-frightening entertainment. Be prepared for the fact that this movie is meant to amuse 8 year old boys, and you'll be fine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>I am a fan of science fiction, especially the classical kind of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and other European authors of the pre-Hollywood era.  I've read many of these books, and have watched almost all the English-language movie adaptations of said books, and I will say that this is the best adaptation of Journey to the Center of the Earth produced by Hollywood so far.  This version is not as faithful to the book's plot as previous versions.  But as a movie, it is by far the best, for the following reasons.  First of, the special effects are great and very realistic, which is a required of any sci-fi movie these days.  Second, the action and dialogue were actually quite believable.  Brendan Fraser actually played a half-serious role, and the movie, though funny, was not ridiculous.  The other two characters; the boy and the lady, came across well, and were cast well.  Last, there were no outlandish scenes involving far-fetched technology, or some long-lost underground tribe of humans.  This made the movie very believable.  All in all, quite good, and probably Fraser's best action movie in the past several years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>This movie was good. It's fun and exciting. The visual effect was great.<br />Also the scenes were nice. You need to wear 3-D glasses so you can realize the movie perfectly. I like the movie character because he was known the mummy series movie star, you know that, right? This movie was making good. I never bored this movie. I had a great time to see this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I am a very huge fan of the original "Journey of the Center of the Earth (1959)". In fact it is in my top five all time favorites so you can imagine from the ads I suspected this remake would be a real loser. Especially when I heard it was 3D. In all seriousness do you ever truly take the 3D movies serious? We did not watch it in 3D but I imagine we will at some point. After watching it with my wife we decided two things. We still like the original best, the second was this isn't a true remake. However, I mean that in the best terms. We actually found this version quite entertaining and not at all like the original and that we liked too. It doesn't try to be or beat the classic movie. Although you see some jewels, giant mushrooms, a dinosaur, et cetera, none of it feels or looks the same.<br /><br />Brendan Frasier (The Mummy), Josh Hutcherson (Jurassic Park III), and Anita Briem do a great job of acting in this movie and that really helps too. Look for a couple cute references in this movie to Josh's part in JP III. Good quality DVD with good replayability. I probably would have given it 3 and a half stars if I could but I don't feel bad about four. There aren't enough movies like this to suit me these days. As a kid I was spoiled by having lots of movies like this to watch. I kind of feel sorry for kids and families today because if they don't appreciate the classic versions, it's a wasteland out there for the most part. I recommend it for the whole family. If you enjoyed this catch "Stardust" and "The Forbidden Kingdom".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Journey to the Center of the Earth is a good action flick for the family but otherwise this film is pretty average. Brendan Fraser always plays the smart but dimwitted guy, his facial expressions say it all. Josh Hutcherson is a great younger actor, he actually carries this movie instead of Fraser. The action and special effects are excellent but the storyline is rather mundane, it's a mixed bag for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I'm not sure that Jules Verne, who was a stickler for scientific detail - be it imaginary or real - would think too highly of this film, even though it's not a true adaptation of his original novel.  In this cinematic world, scientific fact is the equivalent of a prize greased pig - everyone keeps chasing it, but no one ever catches it.  If you're going to throw realism to the curb, though, you might as well do it in unabashed grand style - and that is precisely what you get in this 21st century Journey to the Center of the Earth.  What you have here is your basic summer-time action comedy.  These guys survive falls that Wile E. Coyote couldn't walk away from.  Fortunately, the whole thing is entertaining enough to overcome all of the inanities that could otherwise have doomed this film into forgettable silliness.  In other words, it's a Brendan Fraser movie.  Every time I see Brendan Fraser in a movie, my immediate reaction is to say uh oh and expect the worst - yet every time I actually end up feeling entertained.  That's not to say this is a good movie - it's more of what I call a "good enough" movie.<br /><br />Fraser plays Trevor Anderson, a volcanologist dedicated to continuing his late older brother's studies.  Max apparently got himself killed searching for the lost world described in Verne's novel, believing that the father of science fiction was describing fact and not fantasy.  Just when his lab is stolen out from under him and all seems to be lost, a 10-day visit with Max's son Sean (Josh Hutcherson) brings with it new clues in the form of notes inside Max's copy of Verne's novel - and this leads uncle and nephew to discover a new site in Iceland they simply have to explore.  The scientist they want to check with in Iceland turns out to be dead, but his hot redheaded daughter Hannah (Anita Briem) agrees to guide the two up the mountain to the site.  Of course, they end up trapped by a cave-in and forced to explore the mountain cave system in search of an exit.  They find a lot more than that, though.<br /><br />The film's myriad of CGI effects aren't all that impressive in 2D, but I'm sure the 3-D version must pack much more of a punch.  Either way, though, I was surprised at how few "prehistoric" creatures there were on display.  For example, I expected to see people running from dinosaurs all over the place, but there's basically just one giant monster to be found here.  The characters' falls are worth watching, though, especially the first big one.  If there's a longer falling scene in any other movie, I haven't come across it yet.  A roller coaster-like ride in an old mine system is also great fun to watch - and the adventure doesn't end there.  Some critic said this film was made as if it were a theme park ride, and I think that sums the whole thing up quite well.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Brendan Fraser stars in the latest adaptation of Jules Verne's "Journey to the Center of the Earth," but the real star of the film is, of course, its special effects including 3-D images. Unfortunately I couldn't see the film in 3-D (the theater I went to showed only 2-D version), so please read my review as such, in which "effects" means only traditional 2-D special effects.<br /><br />Probably you already know the film's story as you have read the original book or seen the 1959 version starring James Mason as Sir Oliver S. Lindenbrook. For the new adaptation the Hollywood studio decided on a story that they think is fit for effects. The new adventure story is much simplified: Brendan Fraser's hero Prof. Trevor Anderson is looking for his missing brother; Josh Hutcherson is his nephew Sean who follows his uncle's (and father's) quest; and Anita Briem is a mountain guide Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (a nod to "Hans" of the 1959 version?) whose father is one of the "Verneians." Actually the film is slightly self-referential as our hero finds a clue about his brother in the titular Jules Verne book.<br /><br />And ... that is all. No "villains" appear (except, perhaps, a mean-spirited boss of Fraser's character, a very small role you may forget soon) as this is a family-friendly picture and each scene is obviously borrowed from other films like "Indiana Jones." The Jules Verne fans would lament, or even is angry with, the changes done to the source material.<br /><br />Still as the film is fun. Yes, it may be silly kind of fun, but fun nonetheless as first-time feature film director Eric Brevig (also, visual effect veteran) has provided enough actions to keep the ball rolling. Even seen in 2-D the images are not bad if not great. Yes, I know, the characters are flat and its romance is uninteresting, but still I like the film for what it is, a 90-miinute roller-coaster ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is a professor trying to carry on his late brother's work.  His brother studied earthquakes and volcanoes.  But the university is losing interest and it looks like the lab will be shut down.<br /><br />That same day, Trevor's nephew is dumped on his door step for a few days.  Trevor hasn't seen Sean (Josh Hutcherson) in years.  It looks to be an awkward time until Trevor finds an old copy of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth that his brother had marked up.  As he begins to interpret his brother's comments, he begins to think there may be more going on than he knows about.<br /><br />As so the two set off to Iceland.  Hiring Hannah (Anita Briem), they set out to recover a probe.  But a series of events find them falling into a magical world.  Can they find their way out?<br /><br />I went in expecting a highly fun, fantasy adventure.  And I got just what I had bargained for.  The movie takes a fairly healthy dose of suspension of belief, but considering the premise, I didn't have a problem with that at all.<br /><br />This is a special effects heavy movie with the plot at times being nothing but an excuse for them.  But they were amazing.  And the plot works, too.  Yes, it's predictable, but it is fun, so that didn't matter to me.<br /><br />Granted, it helped that I cared for the characters.  And the acting by the three leads was good enough to draw me into the story.<br /><br />For all my praise, I do have two complaints.  The first is the pacing.  The movie took a little too long setting things up before the adventure really started.  Secondly, the ads for the movie gave away too much of the story.  I sure wish marketing departments would figure that out.<br /><br />The film is rated PG due to the action elements.  It will be too intense for kids who get scared easily.  But any kids who can handle some suspense will love it.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a family movie night, give this one a chance.  If your kids won't be scared by it, you'll all enjoy an amazing trip.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>One of the things I will always say about Brendan Fraser is, he's a great actor who is a part of some terrible movies. What is it about the guy that has him reading a script and saying "yeah I wanna star in that movie"? Does he have some form of learning difficulty, or does he do it on purpose to test how far he can push his fans before they say "OK that's enough"? One thing's for sure, "Journey to the Centre of the Earth" is one of his worst films to date. Not only is it a terrible story featuring some terrible supporting actors, but a film that needs to take advantage of the best CGI technology in the world, seems to fall short on its budget... or their CGI guy hates the director, one or the other. The prospect of what lies in the centre of our Earth is an intriguing one, and has only really been touched upon in a good way by the movie "The Core", however, this just falls short of grabbing my interest. I'm aware this is based on the Jules Verne novel and in some ways could be considered a 21st century sequel, however, it pales in comparison to the fantasy of the original.<br /><br />The story focuses around scientist Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) and his quest to find his lost brother. On the way his nephew, Sean played by Josh Hutcherson (that annoying kid from Zathura), and his Mountain guide Hannah played by Anita Briem... I've never heard of her either stumble across the Centre of the Earth. That's right, I said stumble, because apparently you just stumble across a portal to the centre of our planet. I know it's a fantasy film, but come on, you can't seriously expect my kids to buy the fact that a scientist, his nephew and a mountain guid stumble across the centre of our planet. What about the mountain guide? She's a guide, for the mountains. Has she not seen this pathway before? Maybe she has and she just forgot it was there, let's be honest, it's an easy thing to forget about in the hectic day of a mountain guide. I can't tell you anymore about the story because it's just infuriating to think about it in anymore detail. Just know it involves dinosaurs, really big plants and jumping piranha's that can be hit with baseball bats.<br /><br />I'm aware it's a fantasy film and they aren't meant to ascertain to any form of genuine reality, but I just found this film and it's sequences to be utterly ridiculous. I'm actually disappointed by Fraser and although I've come to expect him in terrible films, this one just takes the cake and I'm sure that to many this will be the film that will have his fans saying "that's enough." I know I've come close to saying that this time around, but I'm prepared to give him one more chance. All I know is that with a virtually unknown supporting cast and quite frankly shoddy CGI effects, there's no doubting the terrible nature of this film.<br /><br />Stay away, because you really don't want to risk seeing such an atrocity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>Actually, I didn't watch this masterpiece in 3D.  Two dimensions of it were sufficient for me and I'm giving it one star for each dimension.  We have a story in which Brendan Fraser's scientist brother Max has disappeared and Trevor (Brendan Fraser)  is setting out to search for him.  But he gets saddled with having to care for Sean, Max's son played by Josh Hutcherson, who starts out as a bratty teenager and, of course, is initially p......d-off at the world.  (Actually, I was suspicious that Max simply couldn't stand Sean any longer and just took off).<br /><br />But, no. They follow Max's trail, aided by pretty guide, Hannah (Anita Briem) who causes Sean to drool a little, to the mouth of a volcano. They all begin to fall down a rabbit hole and finally land on a heap of sticks  and dry leaves -- no, I'm sorry, that's in Alice in Wonderland.  The volcano's hole turns into a water slide and they enter into a world that resembles a defective ride in a theme park.  They discover that Max had died there, of boredom no doubt, and encounter gigantic Venus flytraps (I  never saw any gigantic flies, though), dinosaurs stomping around and birds that glow in the dark.  They also get to ride in a mining car which turns into a roller-coaster that manages to jump across a ten foot gap and land on the tracks on the other side, the chances against that happening being about 30 billion to one.  At another point on their raft, a sharp-toothed fish is getting closer and closer to taking a bite out of Hannah's rump as Sean is watching and his lips seem to be saying "Go for it, go for it!"<br /><br />Even though I was watching this movie in 2D, it was obvious that it was shot in 3D because actors are seen pointing out at the camera or shooting a yo-yo out of the frame at you or some other shenanigans, which simply stalls any continuity this film might have had.  By the time it's over Sean has transformed into a smiling puppy, licking his uncle's hand or whatever.<br /><br />The 1959 version of this story is a much superior film, having actors such as James Mason, Arlene Dahl and Pat Boone (Pat Boone??  Yes, it is Pat Boone), it's rather antique special effects notwithstanding.  Some shots were actually made in Carlsbad Caverns, I believe.  Now, you can't get more realistic than that.  The backgrounds in this new film look very much like painted scenery flats and the dinosaur chase scene with the characters running in the foreground on a treadmill is clearly a green screen process not particularly well executed.<br /><br />I had completely forgotten that Brendan Fraser had done a really nice acting job in the fine film "Gods and Monsters."  What did he do to deserve this mess?  Presumably he was well paid for it.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>I  wanted to see this when it first came out, and I'm glad I didn't. This film seemed like one big advert for a universal studios feature ride. There was zero believability whatsover as the main characters fall for thousands of yards and like cartoon characters survive without bumps or bruises. Sled on the fossilized skull of some unbelievably large dinosuar, ride a broken coal cart like it was a roller coaster etc.<br /><br />The main characters were likeable. The absent-minded professor, the trailguide, the unhappy nephew. But everything was dumbed-down and cartoonized presumably to appeal to an audience of children.<br /><br />I found myself fast-forwarding scenes where characters were constantly yelling and screaming as they were being chased and hounded, an the really sappy scene in the middle.<br /><br />Kids might like the action-y bits. Myself, I found it got old about halfway through. 2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>4 Red-Blue glasses are included in the movie's case. The resulting 3-D quality is unimpressive on a TV, but very good on a PC.  Note that the great 3-D been talked about is not in the home DVD, because special equipment would be needed. The movie is anyway very entertaining, if not sophisticated. The story moves along at a good steady pace, keeping the viewer's interest. Plus, it is also family-friendly.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>About once every decade or so the motion picture industry decides to revisit 3-D technology, and one of the properties chosen for this occasion was Jules Verne's classic JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  Originally published in 1864, the story has been through more screen and television adaptations than you can shake a stick at--most famously in a 1959 big screen adaptation starring James Mason.  The current version, however, is not a literal adaptation of the novel; it is instead a modern riff that finds scientest Trevor Anderson (Brandon Fraser) using his late brother's notes on the Jules Verne novel in an effort to revive interest in his own dying university program.<br /><br />With smart-alec nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and hiking guide Hannah (Anita Briem) in tow, Trevor stumbles into a cave that leads to an old mine that unexpectedly drops them to the center of the earth, where they find Verne was right all along.  Along the way they encounter a wild mine cart ride, a man-eating plant, a T-Rex, and lots of other bits of business designed to show off the 3-D effects.<br /><br />3-D is really a big screen format, and when to bring it to the small screen the result is only so-so.  The glasses are as annoying as ever, especially if you wear glasses yourself; be that as it may, it works fairly well as long you keep the room completely dark and sit directly in front of the television.  You may have to move further back or closer to the screen for best viewing.  This aside, JOURNEY is a flyweight thing, well-designed, reasonably well-acted, but with a trivial script and story that exist only to provide an excuse for the 3-D effects.  Recommended if you want check out what 3-D is like these days, but never mind the rest.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>Sure, I'll concede that this film hit the target for the intended audience. It's a family action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and has much fast paced action, suspense and light humor.<br /><br />You really have to divorce yourself from reality and even harsh criticism while watching this, because it's very easy for an adult with high-expectations to feel let down. But the truth is, this about the same type of fare as you'll find with films such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC39ZE">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009YXAV">The Apple Dumpling Gang</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V42">Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a>, and so on.<br /><br />My wife liked it and thought it was entertaining. However, I'm a fan of Jules Verne books and always have been. I guess I was hoping for more of an adult driven, Steampunk style (see comment below) drama than what I saw. I wish the CGI was better and the mood a little less cotton-candy-ish, but it really wasn't aimed at me and I can concede that. I'm not going to give the movie less than the four stars that it does deserve for the simple fact that with every scene, you can see that Brendan Frasier isn't overdoing the acting and delivers a family movie with a family movie level of acting. Kudos to him for being aware of what he was involved in.<br /><br />This review is about not going into this hoping for an epic telling of a Jules Verne Classic, but going into it with the perspective of seeing a family movie.

That system was the only type available when this was put out on blu ray. Today you can get a proper 3d version that is actually cheapet to buy than this one is.  I would make sure to ask which version you are getting. The newer 3d version needs a 3d tv and 3d player and it looks outstanding. The older version which uses the old style glasses is ok but it can't compare. In fact using the red and green glasses causes a ghosting effect, (images seems to have lines around them or a fainter second image) this is ccmmon and normal when using those old style glasses. SO you don't want to pay 35.00 for that version, while the version with the 3d logo on it looks great as you will have the black glasses and a three d tv.  The story isn't as good as the 1959 version which is coming out on blu ray in 2012, but it's fun and a romp with effects from the 00's decade so that's a bonus.  It's got extras too. But I would certainly not waste your money on a older 3d version with green and red glasses unless you don't ever intend buying a 3d tv. That would be a mistake though as the format is outstanding. SO make sure to ask which version you are getting. The older is more exp3ensive because it was in print only a few months and lots of people complained abou tit and it was yanked out of print.  The ghosting though is what you get with those glasses on a tv. that's just the way it was until the new format came out and you can get this in the new format for less!.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This film is an odd combination of adventure and comedy, aimed directly at a kids' audience rather than a deeper film that adults might enjoy as well.  It is fantastical, full of coincidences and miraculous survivals, and in the end completely unbelievable for hard scifi fans.  That being said, it does have some of its own magic and my kids absolutely loved it for a rollicking fun ride, even if for us, the parents, it was mere background noise.

Using colored lenses that use tints that are more 'opposite on the color wheel; the picture seperates better. Not perfect, but better than most and of course the picture neutralizes; but you got a 3-D movie in the house!<br />The Dolby track needs to be turned up to compensate for the lack of HD track as there are a lot of 3-D sound effects that whooosh, click or boom with the film. The story is perfect for a light adventure; but it is best enjoyed in 3-D.

Frasier stars as Trevor Anderson, a college professor who teaches plate tectonics and volcanism.  He is kidded by his colleagues because he only has two students in his class.  Ten years earlier, Trevor's brother went off to prove that the assumptions made by Verne in his novel were actually true.  Trevor has also agreed to take in his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) for the summer.  Trevor share his beliefs about the center of the earth with Sean.  Soon, the two are off to Iceland to track down a possible entry to the center of the earth.<br /><br />Once in Iceland, Sean and Trevor meet Hannah (Anita Briem).  Hannah is the daughter of a dead Icelandic professor whom Trevor's brother was working with.  It is possible that the two may have indeed found the entryway described by Verne.  Hannah agrees to be Trevor's guide and take him to the possible entry site.  Once there, Trevor discovers a piece of scientific apparatus and retrieves it, but a severe lightning storm strikes, forcing Trevor to drop the apparatus and run to the safety of a nearby cave.  Unfortunately, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean are trapped when a large rockslide covers the entrance, but they did indeed find the entrance to the center of the earth, for soon, they are careening down an abandoned mineshaft in coal cars.  Then, they fall through a thin layer of rock and, just as in Verne's novel, find themselves at the center of the earth.<br /><br />But, once there, Hannah makes a sobering discovery; she find's Trevor's deceased brother.  After burying him, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean must find a way back to the surface before the underground temperature gets too hot.  Along the way, they encounter some nasty sea creatures, a very scary T-Rex, and some hungry carnivorous plants.  Their only hope is to reach a vent which leads to the surface, but this vent is located on the far side of a vast underwater ocean.  Will the three adventurers make it before its too late?<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Brendan Frasier is excellent in his role, and Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem are very good as well.  The special effects are first-rate, and there are several exciting moments in the movie, including the T-Rex chase, the journey across the underground ocean, and the thrilling ride in the mine cars.<br /><br />I give this great movie my highest recommendation.  It does a good job of combining adventure and comedy.  Viewers familiar with Jules Verne's story will surely enjoy this fine movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>My 10-year-old son was mesmerized from the time the movie began until it ended. I too thought that the story was lighthearted and entertaining as well. We both had the simple desire to be entertained, on a Sunday afternoon and "Journey to the Center of the Earth" fit the bill.<br /><br />Sean, a young teen who has lived most of his life without the benefit of a father (an adventurer gone missing), is being forced to spend time with his uncle Trevor (his father's brother, a professor).While going thru several items belonging to his missing, yet presumed dead father, they discover a book that yields clues to his possible whereabouts and could unlock the mystery to a magical world. Jumping on a plane to follow the clues, Trevor and Sean try to build a relationship that they both can benefit from, while deciphering clues. As they arrive in Iceland, the adventure begins with the addition of a beautiful mountain guide Hannah, whose father and Trevor's brother were ultimately connected because of similar beliefs. As all three struggle to believe in the impossible, we are dazzled by glowing birds, amazing, waterslides, angry dinosaurs, large attacking Venus fly traps, and other moments of wonderful special effects.<br /><br />"Journey to the Center of the Earth" is a wonderful family drama that had everything you could hope for. You had romance and comedy (uncle and nephew argued over who would get the girl), there were tender moments (when Trevor finds resolution to what happened to his brother 10 years earlier), and very entertaining special effects. So, if you want to watch an easy going, light adventure, this is the movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Like others...i tried watching the 2d version with 3d glasses as the disk is not very clearly mark....very small writting..bad eyes.<br />Anyway the 3d effects with the glasses were pretty descent on my 42 inch tv.<br />So bottom line....Good movie...good 3d....still enjoyed this movie after watching it twice...1 normal...1 3d...A Keeper, good for multiple views.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Warner Brothers / Region Free / 2-D<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br />VC-1 BD-25<br />Running time: 1:32:34<br />Movie size: 18,32 GB<br />Disc size: 20,48 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 23.56 Mbps<br />Number of chapters: 21<br />Subtitles: English SDH / Spanish<br /><br />No Lossless (HD) audio<br /><br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br /># Behind the story: Commentary by Brendan Fraser and Director Eric Brevig<br /># A world with our world (HD - 10 minutes)<br /># Being Josh (HD - 6 minutes)<br /># How to make Dino drool: Documentary (3 minutes)<br /># DVD Digital Copy<br /># 2D and 3D versions of the film including 4 pairs of 3D glasses</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>2008's "Journey to the Center of the Earth" is a loose adaption of Jules Verne's classic book set in modern times. Here, the story involves Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, an attractive Icelandic mountain guide (Anita Briem), and their many misadventures as they stumble upon a an old mine and "volcano tube" that drops them deep into a marvelous subterranean world. Can they make it out alive?<br /><br />One glance at the poster or dvd and the viewer will instantly know what s/he is in for -- a fun, mindless adventure in the spirit of "Indiana Jones", which is understandable in view of the fact that the first Indiana Jones film ripped-off two scenes from the 1959 version of "Journey" (the 'guiding light' and huge rolling stone sequences). This 2008 rendition even features a thrilling rollercoaster-like railcar sequence a la "Temple of Doom," although it's done better here IMHO. There's also a t-rex sequence reminiscent of "Jurassic Park," but the oversized reptile is more cartooney here (interesting how filmmakers still aren't able to outdo that t-rex sequence a full 15 years later!).<br /><br />I won't compare this version to the 1959 rendition with James Mason, Pat Boone and Arlene Dahl since that film was made a half century ago! Needless to say, these are two totally different movies from two totally different eras. I will say, however, that it's not as long & tedious and there's no pet duck -- lol (not that I dislike that one).<br /><br />Normally I'm not into mindless "blockbusters" like this but if they're done right and I'm in the proper mood for mindless fun adventure I'm usually able to acclimate and enjoy them for what they are. Such is the case here. Brendan Fraser is the perfect actor for these types of films (e.g. 1999's "The Mummy); he's got that likable, benevolent 'everyman' charm. In addition, Anita Briem is easy on the eyes. It's surprising that there are only three main characters in the entire film, but they have great chemistry and you can tell they had a fun time filming; it transfers to the viewer.<br /><br />This is a family-friendly misadventure with the requisite goofy humor, which caused me to bust out laughing numerous times. I think it's better than the three Indiana Jones sequels ("Temple of Doom," "Last Crusade" and "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"). The only reason I detract a Star is my mind started wandering a bit after the t-rex sequence late in the film. Other than that, this is a highly entertaining zany adventure flick full of spunk and wonder. That said, I'm glad it only runs an hour and a half as films of this ilk should stay around the 90-minute mark so as not to risk overstaying their welcome (e.g. the three "Pirates of the Carribean" flicks).<br /><br />I also enjoyed the desolate, mountainous Icelandic locations seen early in the picture.<br /><br />One last thing: The dvd features the option of viewing the film in 3D or regular (one side or the other) and provides four pairs of 3D glasses for the former. I tried the 3D version and wasn't impressed; the 3D gimmick just doesn't do much for me and I especially dislike the dingy overall picture it offers. Needless to say, I recommend viewing the film in non-3D.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Turn off your brain and have a blast!</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Please note that I watched this on my LCD TV on the HBO channel so I can't speak to the quality of the 3D, but after reading several of the reviewers here who know something about it, it looks like I didn't miss anything since they say the polarized 3D method that was used wasn't that good.<br /><br />But I thought the movie itself was great for the spectacular special effects. Some are eerily beautiful, like the phosphorescent pools and the luminescent birds. The CGI animation, such as in the chase with the tyranosaurus, is also outstanding. The movie only loosely sticks to the original book, but then most people don't know the original book anyway. (I don't either, I only read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, which is the more popular of the two books).<br /><br />By the way, a little trivia here, Verne originally got started writing westerns, only set in South America, oddly enough, but later turned to writing sci-fi, which is what he's best known for.<br /><br />The acting is also fine and Brendan Fraser projects a sort of goofy benevolence and exasperatedness which gives him an engaging on-screen presence--actually very similar to Cary Grant in many of his movies. He'll probably never be considered a truly great actor like Grant because of the movies he's been in, but he brings something to his roles that perhaps no one else but Grant did.<br /><br />So overall a fun CGI and special effects filled romp that, while nothing profound, is still worth watching for the stunning visuals and also suitable for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>We have seen Brendan Fraser movies at only maintained the title and not the meat of the true story, such as "The Mummy", who does not look a thing like Peter Cushing (1959). Now we are presented with "Journey to the Center of the Earth."  However, this movie does give us a good synopsis of the story.  Moreover, it is very much fun to watch.<br /><br />Prof. Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) has lost a brother. Professor Anderson's nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has lost a father. Well circumstances force them to spend some time together.  They realize that they might be able to find the lost Max Anderson and make a trip to Iceland in pursuit.  They are bigger and across the tasty mountain guide Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (Anita Briem), who has recently lost her father.  Both Hannah's father, and Trevor's brother had one thing in common; they were Vernians. So all three each bringing their own unique talents, set off to find the lost Max Anderson.<br /><br />I first watched the 2D version of this movie in Blu-ray high definition.  Some of the scenes were quite beautiful, such as the diamonds that had the lights behind them, so they would glisten in the cave.  The movie did look a little bit like it was cranked out at the last minute with many things not thought out.  However, it was still fun for the time that it lasted.<br /><br />Now it was time to watch the 3-D version.  I put on my trusty red and green glasses that came with the DVD.  I must say I am not sure why they switched from red and blue, to red and green.  However, it might have something to do with the fact that televisions are made up of three colors of light red, green, and blue.  The military also change their lighting from red at night light to green night light for some reason.  Therefore, we are not aware of something afoot.  In any event, it took about 15 seconds to get used to the new color environment.  In addition, I must say that some of the scenes are spectacular.  The trilobite at first may be halved almost at back of the seat. Of course, with the exception of the color change the technology has not changes since the origins of 3D. Other scenes instead of extending out into the viewer's space recessed back and looked like the old stereoscopic slides. Occasionally there looked like a pane of glass with a reflection of what was behind it. I am not sure if this was sloppy manufacturing or beyond the technology even of today.  No matter the problem, it is well worth the viewing and I hope this will catch on as an industry option.<br /><br />This comes with a digital download. I have not tried it yet. I have watched the picture in picture voice over which added to the second viewing.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603400281">"A Journey to the Center of the Earth" by Jules Verne</a><br /><br />3D GLASSES - Journey to the Center of the Earth DVD Extra 3D Glasses (3 Pairs)</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>The filming is terrific.

The film brings to the screen a scientist whose brother was lost trying to retrace the steps of Verne's characters.<br />Don't look for the movie to make any sense; it doesn't, as it is totally unbelievable even for a Verne's novel.<br />Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well though the acting is nothing extraordinary. The revelation is in relation to the lovely Anita Briem who steals the show and proves beyond any doubt that she has the potential to have a great career in acting.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all right, though there was plenty of room for improvement.<br />In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment for pre-teens. 3 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Entertaining enough to watch once, this must have been really cool on the IMAX in 3-D. Brendan Fraser is reliably affable, and the tour guide is really cute, but the movie special effects are TV-show quality, at least in 2-D. Watchable, but nothing special.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Remember the old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007JMD8">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a> movie, with the optically enlarged lizards presented as dinosaurs (colloquially termed "slurpasaurs")?  That was what passed for a nifty special effect in 1959.  Today it's 3-D effects.<br /><br />Of course, audiences of today are far too sophisticated to fall for lizards with horns and fins glued to them; in the age of movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAT">Jurassic Park</a>, only a digitally animated Gigantosaurus will do.<br /><br />This latest incarnation of Journey is surprisingly true to its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402743378">roots</a>: Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is an absent-minded volcanologist who is spending ten days with his nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson).  Trevor's brother and Sean's father Max disappeared a decade before looking for the center of the Earth.  Max left behind sensors that detect geological shifts in the Earth's crust and a cryptic series of notes in a Jules Verne novel (guess which one?). When one of the sensors fails in Iceland, Trevor decides to go on an adventure in 1950s fashion, bringing along his plucky nephew for the ride.<br /><br />Accompanying Trevor and Sean is the fetching Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (Antia Briem), the daughter of another volcanologist and the only person with any spelunking skill whatsoever.  While checking on the device, lightning strikes, our heroes dive for cover, and from there it's a lot of falling, screaming, and running.<br /><br />This is a 3-D movie, which means that at various times and for no reason whatsoever, something flies straight at the screen.  Since you will likely not have invested in the expensive 3-D glasses and you may not have even had the good sense to rent the 3-D version, this makes the movie seem even dumber than it is.<br /><br />The other surprise is that despite the dinosaurs and the hottie, this movie is aimed at a younger set.  The dialogue isn't very good, although Fraser does his best.  Sean is meant to be a wisecracking preteen modern hero, but he reverts quickly to type.  Scenes that are meant to be scary are played up for laughs: giant venus flytraps get pummeled in wrestling-style fashion, flying killer fish get batted away like softball practice, and there's a long and pointless mine cart sequence whose sole purpose is to show off the 3-D effects of the glasses you didn't buy.<br /><br />Did I mention the irritating glow-in-the-dark mascot?  There's a bird.  It follows Sean around.  Only he can understand it.  And it glows in the dark.<br /><br />Ultimately, Journey is more an amusement park ride than it is an actual movie. Because amusement park standards are much more family-friendly, Journey to the Center of the Earth is heavy on the Journey, light in the Center.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>It'd be tough to pin down exactly how many times JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH has been adapted to TV and the big screen, but a fairly accurate accounting might be "too many." I've been able to find at least eleven adaptations (a few of them foreign productions, but still productions). What's more puzzling is that in 2008 not one but TWO versions of the book made it to film. The first was a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MJ6HE">horrible television adaptation in January</a> starring Rick Schroeder (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017I3RKO">Scrubs</a>). And the second is this supercharged action version starring Brendan Fraser (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKLW">Crash</a>) who's probably best known for his portrayal as Rick O'Connell in the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HQZJPM">Mummy series'</a> of films.<br /><br />The big question as to this particular Jules Verne story's appeal is obvious: Why? Why so much fanfare and Hollywood hype? Many people have been critical of Hollywood and their lack of originality, and if you use Journey to the Center of the Earth as a barometer to that affect, then you'd be absolutely correct; they have to keep reinventing old shtuff because they can't come up with anything else.<br /><br />Regardless of your take on originality, the one large positive that comes from these hyperbolic recreations is that it introduces a new audience to Verne's masterpiece. And the action in this one is really fun to watch on a big screen with 3-D images plunging into your vision.<br /><br />Although this edition is cool from a visual perspective, I still hold the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007JMD8">1959 version starring James Mason</a> as the penultimate adaptation. Quirky, funny, and outlandishly impossible (and in technicolor!), the `59 film was an adventure fantasy/SF film ahead of its time. At the 1960 Oscar's it was nominated for three awards, including special effects. I doubt this 2008 recreation will be so blessed. But...<br /><br />It is fun, however. You can't help but smile at some of the newly introduced lines ("What? You're thirteen, you can't calls dibs." -- when the two males in the party realized how attractive their guide was). But herein also lay a big problem: distance from the source material. With the exception of getting to the center of the Earth and how they leave it, there's not much Jules Verne left in here. For a beloved classic, that's a shame. But, again, the film will hopefully introduce a new set of readers to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1562549146">the novel</a>.<br /><br />It is also noteworthy to mention newcomer Anita Briem as the incredibly attractive guide Hannah. A stunning looker in terms of natural beauty, she not only prettied up the film but also gave a surprising rugged quality to her character. Also of note is veteran child star Josh Hutcherson as Sean. Many will recognize him from his roles in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DBHX4M">Zathura</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P6R5Y8">Bridge to Terabithia</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCFNZY">RV</a>, and the soon-to-be-released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316153788">Cirque Du Freak</a>. He played well next to Fraser and was the sympathetic character most will come to identify with.<br /><br />The final word...<br /><br />It's an okay diversion with lots of action and an update to Verne's classic, but it's not really Verne's anymore. Beware purists.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>Basically, Brandon Fraser's getting kicked out of his college lab (SNL's Seth Meyers makes a great appearance), Brandon's nephew spends vacation with him before moving to Ottawa (I prefer Toronto), the two go volcano hunting in Iceland (none of my uncles would have ever spent the money to take me to Iceland)... Ahhh who cares, it's all just an excuse to for some 3D action! But let me warn you, DO NOT GET THIS IN STANDARD DEFINITION! Why?<br /><br />Because this movie looks stunningly beautiful in awesome in Blu-Ray, and it just adds so much to the experience. In SD, it's a sub-par experience, because the movie was made for HD, and of course 3D, but with those paper red/blue 3D glasses, I only noticed a substantial 3D effect during the credits. During the movie, the action just moves too fast, and your color is all distorted. So unless you have a really good pair of glasses, you might want to skip that. But you'll still have the picture and the action. It's a throwback to those Saturday matinee serials where things jump out, scare you, and surprise you. Things blow up, explode, collapse, and the action and adventure is certainly entertaining. Good family fun, although the little ones may find some of it a bit too intense.<br /><br />Overall, don't even consider the SD version as you'll only come out disappointed. HD on the other hand makes all the difference, and it makes the movie that much better. Sure the plot is nothing to write home about, but the family and I had a very fun time with this popcorn flick. And I'm very open to a sequel, if it's filmed in the same manner. An Atlantis plot is especially intriguing.<br /><br />Real Score: 4.5</p></br></body></html>

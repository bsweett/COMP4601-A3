Enjoyable on a range of levels, the movie is one of the most memorable I have seen. Brilliantly shot and acted, this is one of the greats, in my opinion.<br /><br />Michael Sullivan (Hanks) is an enforcer for an Irish mafia boss, (Newman), with a simple ethic in life. He also has an abiding fear that his sons will grow up just like him and follow him into the business. Soon enough, however, the internal politics of the Rooney family overtake the Sullivans as Connor Rooney (Craig) makes a move and ends up wiping out Sullivan's family. Michael Sullivan Jr and Michael Sullivan Sr take to the road and try to level things out. Throw in a profession assassin with a proclivity to maccabre art (Law) and you have a complex plot that keeps one in the zone.<br /><br />As mentioned, the cinematography is excellent, with some amazing scenes that are truly artistic. The filming was excellent, and matched by the great acting from Newman, Hanks, Law and many others. Portraying hard men in a hard lifestyle is something they all did very well.<br /><br />Overall, this film is without doubt a very memorable one and one that is worth sitting through a number of times. Something new will be gleaned from each viewing, adding to one's appreciation. I loved it and still watch it when I have the chance. Recommended, for sure!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>If you are a parent, especially if you have at least one son, this movie will really hit home. It's brutal; it's emotional; it's violent; and it's heart warming.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is as always in superior form. He plays Michael Sullivan, a 1931 gangster for hire loyal to the Irish mob. But the Irish mob is not loyal to Mike. So Mike needs to go on the run with one of his sons, and ultimately strike back at his antagonists with his son in tow.<br /><br />The father/son bonding and the family losses that Mike suffers are deeply felt. The story is well told, suspenseful and well acted by all.<br /><br />This could have easily been cut down to a PG-13 film. But kudos to the director and producers for an extremely realistic portrayal of a family man involved in the mob circa 1931.<br /><br />Add this to your collection of classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Before seeing this film for the first time, I already knew that Tom Hanks plays a hit man for the mob. Tom Hanks? As I then viewed the film, I assumed that Hanks accepted the role because he liked the script, respected director Sam Mendes, and wanted to work with Paul Newman. I also guessed (only a guess) that he wanted a role "out of character." That is, he wanted to depart from the Hanks persona so firmly established in earlier films, notably Splash (1984), Big (1988), Sleepless in Seattle (1993), and Forrest Gump (1994). <p>The quality of Hanks's acting in Road to Perdition is outstanding. The same is true of others in the cast, notably Paul Newman (John Rooney), Jude Law (Maguire), Daniel Craig (Connor Rooney), and Tyler Hoechlin (Michael Sullivan, Jr.). What I did not fully realize until seeing the film again is that the older Sullivan son (not his father, played by Hanks) is the the focal point of the film, especially after brutal events which are best revealed in the film itself. Hoechlin is among the most talented of younger actors, female or male. In this film, he skillfully portrays a doting and devoted son who inadvertently becomes centrally involved in his father's career in crime. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that Rooney sees Michael Sr. as his "true" son. For obvious reasons, this infuriates Rooney's natural son Connor, a vicious but incompetent heir to his father's mob "franchise."  <p>This film is set in the 1930s. As crime became "organized," certain policies and procedures were agreed upon and strictly enforced. The mobsters' model was the corporate structure, probably General Motors with its hierarchies, divisions, special units, strategic alliances, etc. Activities were organized within specific territories. In this film, Rooney (Newman) rules the Tri Cities area which consists of Moline and Rock Island, Illinois, and nearby Davenport, Iowa. He reports to a "corporate headquarters" located in Chicago, headed by Al Capone. <p>With regard to the title, it refers to a journey undertaken by  the two Sullivans and others before reaching what proves to be -- for most of them -- a violent destination. Who among them will be eternally damned? The title also refers to a town to which Michael Sr. plans to take his son once he (Sr.) eliminates the threats to them both. Special credit to David Self for an extraordinarily clean and crisp script, and to Conrad L. Hall's cinematography which earned for him an Academy Award.  As for Hanks being "out of character" in this part, his acting skills ensure that he is every bit as credible as Michael Sr. as he is as Forrest Gump. In years to come, it will be interesting to observe the course and direction of his career. Perhaps he has only begun to reveal the nature and extent of what his talents can achieve.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks plays as a mafia guy him son witnesses a shooting and tom and his son later drive around trying to stay out of harm.  then they find the truth may not be in that order been a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>I really ejoyed this movie yet it has it's problems.<br /><br />The problems emenate from two things;<br /><br />1) The characters are emotionless and practically cardboard and<br /><br />2) many apsects of this seem very implausible.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is not supposed to be based on reality, it's just a movie and it does entertain brilliantly.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is Mike Sullivan, a sort of honorable hitman working for his adoptive father and crime boss Mr. Rooney, played by Paul Newman. Rooney has a biological son, played by Daniel Craig, who is a complete failure. In a [presumed] bit of jealousy (the movie never really explains this) Craig goes to wipe out Hank's wife and child not knowing that Hanks and his other son got away. In response to this, Hanks, along with his surviving son, goes on a revenge rampage against the whole gang. This is all set in early 1930's depression America.<br /><br />There are problems with some narrative, Craig's actions are not adequately explained, Hanks really does not bereave when he loses his family and people find each other, in a vast 1930's U.S.A., way too easily.<br /><br />I give an easy pass to the aforementioned flaws since this movie is based upon a graphic novel so, obviously, the visual takes presedence over other aspects and the visual is quite impressive.<br /><br />Hanks, believe it or not, is a credible hitman and is often filmed as a shawdowy figure in a trenchcoat and face hiding fedora. As in any comic book, he has few things to say. It is imputed through the film that he is a widely regarded and feared hitman. Paul Newman is portrayed as a physically frail yet mentally strong mob boss. Consistent with comic book monologues, his lines are prophetic. In fact, everybody as brief lines consistent with a graphic novel. Teh dialgoue is just enough to carry the plot.<br /><br />The scenes of old cars careening through country roads or Chicago streets are highly artistic. Likewise, many of the city scenes are done in a art deco manner and are very cinematic.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is it's visuals. Every scene is meaningful, every shadow has it's purpose, every sound advances the plot. There's not a wasted scene. Just like a comic book, every scene is punctuated and that is what makes this movie so great.<br /><br />The tone of the movie, the visuals, the characters are all over-the-top stylish and that is why I find this movie to be such an entertaining piece of art.<br /><br />When you realize the movie is based upon a graphic novel then you should give a free pass to the noticeable flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Few would think the 2002 crime-family drama Road to Perdition directed Academy Award winning direction Sam Mendes (American Beauty) and starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, and Jude Law has something in common with the likes of The Crow, Hellboy, and Batman, but the truth is they're all a part of the same family of movies.  All of these movies originated from the pages of comic books.  In this case the source is the graphic novel of the same name written by Max Allan Collins originally released in 1998.<br /><br />Set in the early 20th century, Road to Perdition is a crime movie, road-trip movie, and stirring father-son drama all set in the era of Al Capone. For years hit man Michael Sullivan's (Tom Hanks) has loyally served crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  One night, when a simple shakedown goes awry due to the erratic behavior of Rooney's son, Connor (Daniel Craig), several men are gunned down as a result, all while Sullivan's eldest son (Tyler Hoechlin) acts as witness to the murders.  Upon discovering that the boy was witness to the crime Connor Rooney takes action, killing Sullivan's wife and youngest son, but missing his primary target, Michael Sullivan, Jr. who is quickly taken on the road by his father.  With son in tow Michael Sullivan, Sr. pledges vengeance on Connor.  Meanwhile, John Rooney is forced to make the difficult decision of letting Michael have his vengeance or protecting his son, Rooney ultimately hires an assassin (Jude Law) to dispose of Sullivan before he has a chance to kill Connor.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place on the road with Sullivan teaching his son a lifetime of values, with stops to rob his former boss's banks and seeks forgiveness for his sins as the road brings him closer to enacting his revenge for the death of his family.  This journey is the titular Road to Perdition.<br /><br />The acting is as good as an audience could expect from this all-star cast, but what stands out the most are the interactions between Tom Hanks and Paul Newman (appearing in his final acting role).  A change from the graphic novel that phenomenally increases the human drama of the film is that Michael Sullivan has come to hold John Rooney as a father figure.  In return Paul Newman treats Sullivan as a surrogate son.  Paul Newman perfectly conveys the emotional conflict Rooney faces when he is forced to make the decision between putting a hit on Sullivan and letting Sullivan kill his biological son.  One can practically see his heart breaking when he is forced to make the decision.  Newman truly saved one of his career's best performances for last in his illustrious career.<br /><br />Even more essential to the film's success than the outstanding performances from Hanks and Newman is its cinematography.  Road to Perdition is an incredibly stylish movie, but not in the same way the graphic novel was.  Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall changes the story from an American set Samurai movie to a timeless portrait of American culture.  The Oscar winning cinematography is easily Road to Perdition's greatest strength.  Director Sam Mendes said that after the Best Picture winning American Beauty he wanted to make a film that focused more on telling its story through visuals instead of dialogue and he succeeds. The best moments in the film come when the dialogue comes to a stop it allowing the images on the film do all the talking<br /><br />A financial and critical success, grossing $180 million worldwide off a budget of $80 million and nominated for six Academy Awards (winning one for Cinematography) Road to Perdition was a success, but there was a very vocal few who considered it a massive letdown during its initial release.  Some complaints were centered on the belief that the film wasn't a stirring crime drama that viewers expected; some felt it was a disappointment from the stand-point of being Mendes' immediate follow-up to the Best Picture winning American Beauty.  Most all of these complaints seem to have died down over the years, but a large percentage of the population seldom acknowledges the film on the basis that it stars Hollywood nice-guy Tom Hanks as a gangster.  This is a grave mistake, as Road to Perdition is not a gangster movie.  Road to Perdition is a familial drama which happens to have gangsters in it.  Playing a father who must take care of his son during a trying, desperate time is a role that Tom Hanks is more than suited to tackle.  To go into this movie expecting a story along the lines of Scarface or The Godfather would be to completely miss the point.<br /><br />Ultimately Road to Perdition should be seen as a turning point in the history of graphic novels and their adaptation into Hollywood films.  The movie is an outstanding example of writers should adapt a source material in such a way that the heart of the story is kept intact while still offering something delightful and new for those who've already read the graphic novel.  The more action oriented themes Collins' novel were muted, but the strength of the father-son relationship, which was the true heart of the graphic novel, remained completely intact, and in some ways was even improved upon in the movie.  While movies such as From Hell (2001) were the first attempt at bringing graphic novels to universal attention, Road to Perdition is the film that sealed the medium's identity as an art.  As a result of Road to Perdition the graphic novel would begin to receive the serious attention it had been denied for decades with adaptations of Alan Moore's V For Vendetta (2005), Watchmen (2009), and David Cronenberg's adaptation of John Wagner and Vince Locke's History of Violence (2005).  If Sam Mendes adaptation of Max Allan Collin's graphic novel hadn't been the critical and financial success it wound up being it seems doubtful that graphic novels would have as much attention from production companies as they do now.  For that reason Road to Perdition is perhaps the most important movie in the history of movie adaptations of graphic novels.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Nothing to brag about. One more film about the end of prohibition and Al Capone. One more film on the mafia, both Italian and Irish. And yet this film has a slightly different touch. It is the fact that the father-son issue is widely explored. A mafia boss has a foolish and cheating son. He protects him and takes under his wing another man, Michael Sullivan, to transfer his paternal love onto someone worth it. Unluckily a detail one night brings the son of this latter man, Michael Sullivan Jr., into the act of witnessing the son of the mafia boss killing another good man on the spur of his anger. This son of a mafia boss will then try to clean up his plate and start killing everyone connected to that embarrassing witness. Michael Sullivan Sr. then has to get on the road of vengeance after the killing of his wife and younger son. He thus escapes the killers with his older son and yet he will end up falling in the last trap out of sloppiness, maybe just to be even with fate and God. The only survivor will be Michael Jr. All the others will be dead and happily buried. There is a slight empathy in that filial and paternal situation. An entertaining film indeed.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A17O7AGDZPOJSS.html">A17O7AGDZPOJSS</a><br/><p>This movie I loved and was waiting for it to come out to buy right after I saw it in the theaters, I will admit before watching this I was trying to picture Tom Hanks playing a hitman (Keep In mind Tom Hanks is on of my favorit actors) and he did it perfectly. The story is great the acting is great and you really get into the movie and will not get up to go to the bathroom or anything like that you will stay sitting down staring at the screen until the movie is over</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Some films just resonate with the viewer and this one did that for me.  It is a perfect period film and Hanks and Newman have never been better.  The story is riviting, it holds your attention from start to finish.  Director Mendes really hits his stride here, and the young actor playing Hanks son is quite a talent.  Much of the film is set in the winter and you can feel the chill in the air, the weather is a ominious presence.  The interection between Hanks and Newman is electric, the scene when Hanks is at the piano and Newman comes over is one of the best acting I have ever seen on film.  It is interesting to hear Mendes take on this scene and that is one of the great features on this DVD.  If you appreciate great movies, then you will thoroughly enjoy this film, a true work of art..well done Mr. Mendes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>I don't know if this movie would have come across better in the theater, but I was more than a little disappointed after seeing several trailers and teasers before the movie.<br />Tom Hanks plays a professional &quot;Hitman&quot; and beloved &quot;right hand&quot; of Mobster boss, played (with more than a little panache) by Paul Newman, in the depression era. When his son stows away and witnesses Hanks making a &quot;hit&quot;, and unwittingly becomes an eye witness to Murder, Newman turns on him (Hanks) and sets out to murder his family for the sake of &quot;loose talk&quot; possibly leading to a police investigation. The director sadly, has spent so much time building this depressing, grey and rain soaked backdrop to the movie, that it actually precludes the story from really coming across. Even fans of this kind of dark and brooding mobster style film, will find it implausible for the most part, and even great cinematics cannot unfortunately save it. You the viewer end up frustrated waiting for the story to gather momentum, but it seems to just stagnate, and plod along until the end, which itself is not particularly noteworthy. At just under 2 hours in length, it's also a bit of a trial to endure, and I found myself clock watching on more than one occasion. I don't want to overcritize this picture too much, and Hanks fans will probably enjoy this step away from his usual material, but this is not in the league of the Godfather, or even The Untouchables, I'm sad to say.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RRBPUGD7UOSP.html">A3RRBPUGD7UOSP</a><br/><p>This was one of those films that I wasn't sure I wanted to watch. Being a big fan of Tom Hanks, I was afraid that he'd chosen a bad script. I was partially right.<p>The gangster film genre isn't one I particularly like, so when I got it, I watched it with a grain of salt. The strong acting of all the actors, Hanks in particular, made this movie much better than the it would have been with other actors. I keep seeing time and time again how great an actor Hanks is, and this film was no exception.<p>Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a mob hitman who goes on the run from the very mob family he's worked for since he was a kid, after his son witnesses to one of Sullivan's 'hits'. With bits of misplaced comedy throughout the film, it was hard to know exactly how to feel. The film went from scenes of machine gun violence, to humor, and back to violence. Guys, next time, go one way or the other. The excellent drama was lambasted by the humorous scenes that either precede or follow them. Remove the humor, and you've got 'Once Upon a Time in America', or better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>In a seemengly endless parade of mob movies, "Road to Perdition" stands out as the most moralistic. It shows, overall, that at the heart of every mob movie, there is a heart. Though masterfully directed by American Beauty director Sam Mendes, with stunning visuals and an intellegent script, "Road to Perdition" fails on a few levels, which keeps it from being the masterpiece it might have been. <p>Tom Hanks plays a family man who belongs to two different families, his wife and kids, and as a hitman for his "father" (Paul Newman) who is the patriarch of a poweful mob family. Things get heated when his 12 year old son witnesses a hit gone wrong, and a contract is put out on Hanks and his family. They embark on a road trip to escape the mob, save their lives, and start someting new. Hanks's motivation is at the heart of this movie- he doesn't want his son to wind up like him.<p>While this is definitely a great idea on paper, it somewhat suffers in the execution. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, leaving little to sympathize with. The mob family loyalty was not played on as strongly as it could, and the drama was lukewarm at best, relying more on gun battles than character development. Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are excellent actors, but their performances here cannot be considered career highlights. Hanks in particular plays a wooden character, and his performance strikes me as a man who would rather be doing something else. The only real standout performance is from Jude Law, who plays a creepy hitman with a morbid obsession for photographing his victims. While I liked the idea, the movie is altogether unsatisfying, for the sole reason that it could have been so much better.<p>The movie might not be a masterpiece, but the Commentary on the DVD is worth the price of admission. Sam Mendes gives some fun and intellegent insight into the movie, how it was made, and gives plenty of interesting anecdotes along the way. The deleted scenes are nothing special, but the "Making of" documentary is enjoyable enough. If you liked the movie, the DVD is a nice companion.<p>While this is far from a bad film, it simply doesn't live up to it's potential. It is perhaps this reason why it didn't get much attention at the Oscars. For some, this is a good twist on the classic mob story, but next time I am in the mood I'll grab my copy of "The Godfather" instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>This movie has many, many great things to recommend it.  The cinematography and art direction are first rate.  The casting is very good, I think.  Tom Hanks as an "enforcer" for the mob is not terribly hard to buy.  He does his job because its what he owes to his boss, who was like a father to him, and its what keeps his family living a nice life.  He works hard to keep his family insulated from what he does for a living, and Hanks is right for the part. We know him as a nice guy.  He's trustworthy and personable.  In this film, he leads a double life...he kills people.  And that is a bit jarring for us, the viewer.  However, we don't actually see him doing his job very often, and in one critical early scene, he's actually NOT planning on killing the guy...it's his bosses crazy son that does it, and that's where the trouble starts, because Hanks' son witnesses this killing, and suddenly, Hank's family is a target, and thus, all his efforts to shield his family from the reality of what he does come crashing tragically down around him.<p>Paul Newman is terrific as the boss.  He's a "gentle" soul with the true heart of a killer.  Newman is a master of underplaying.  His eyes tell us almost all we need to know, and the rest is conveyed in his husky voice.  We should all age as openly and gracefully as Paul Newman!<p>Jude Law plays a hit man hired to track down and kill Hanks.  What a crazy character he is...a photographer who enjoys photographing the moment his victims die.  We've seen this sort of psychopath before, but to see it in a "period" piece rather than in modern times is a bit jarring.  Law limps, has bad teeth and is just generally disgusting.  He's a killer WITHOUT a gentle side.  Is this more honest than Hanks' split personality?  This is one of the questions I think the movie quietly explores.<p>The movie is not fast-paced, but I don't think it drags.  It tells its story with respect for storytelling, rather than a need to have shooting all the time.  Yet there is plenty of action and there are many tense moments, particularly between Hanks and Law, who have some memorable confrontations, particularly when they are in a crowded diner together, and Hanks realises who Law is and what he has been sent to do.<p>About halfway through the movie, Hanks and his son, who are on the lam from retribution, decide they need to make a statement to the boss.  Hanks decides they need to rob all the banks where the mob keeps its money, in order to get their attention.  He and his son have several "wacky" bank-holdup scenes, with Hanks being very amusing with the bemused bank tellers, and his young son being funny learning how to drive by being the getaway driver.  The scenes are fun...you can imagine Speilberg directing them.  Yet they are untrue to the tone of the movie.  These two people have just recently lost the rest of their family very violently, and their lives have become hell.  Yet suddenly, they are in a screwball comedy!!  I'm sure director Sam Mendes felt the audience needed a break from all the bleakness, but ultimately, these scenes betray the characters, and that's why the movie only gets 4 stars from me.<p>BUT any discerning moviegoer should see this movie...it's one of the 10 best of the year, I think.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This is one of the best films of the summer, and should win every Oscar that it gets nominated for. All of the performances were superb, the direction, the music by Thomas Newman, everything about this movie was great! It was a wonderful father/son story. Tom Hanks has out done himself again. He is a great actor, and should win another Oscar. Paul Newman was great, too! I loved this movie. I have seen it twice already.<p>Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This is a very well made and well-directed film, but I have to agree with previous reviewers who have found it superficial and . . . well, not very deep. The story just doesn't amount to very much, and while there are hints that the film is trying to say more than is on the surface, it doesn't do a very good job of making it clear what points, if any, it is trying to make. On one level, the film is about the relation between fathers and sons, but if you compare this film on fathers to FEAR STRIKES OUT or any of several dozen films one could name, it looks pretty lame. I also suspect that most people will find the end of the movie rather unpleasant.<p>Nonetheless, the film does manage to do several things spectacularly well. Although many films have managed a great period look and feel, this one manages that as well as any I have seen. The film is set in 1931, and the amount of detail is quite stunning. There is also judicious use of computers to eliminate much modern detailing in shots. I live in Chicago where much of the action was filmed, and recognized the exact or approximate locations of many of the scenes, and noted that many details have been miraculously eliminated. The film is also magnificently photographed, and is always utterly beautiful to look at. The musical score is lush and somber and perfectly suited for the film's action. The movie should get a lot of Oscar nominations for art direction, music, sound, and photography. <p>The acting is very competent, but this is not an actors' film. Apart from Jude Law's quirky part, there are few opportunities for thespian histrionics. Most of the performances are muted, as if successfully containing a horde of emotion within. There are few "big scenes." This doesn't mean that the performances aren't enormously competent. But the viewer won't leave the theater thinking, "Lord, that guy can act." Tom Hanks is fine, but this won't rank among his most memorable performances. It was more wonderful than I can express to see Paul Newman in this, given his relative inactivity in recent years. I would take bets right now that he will take home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Daniel Craig turns in an appropriately loathsome performance as Newman's son and the manufacturer of all the tragedy in the film. I was not as enamored of Jude Law's performance as some of my fellow reviewers. For a few years now I have felt that Law was just one or two pictures away from superstardom. In ROAD TO PERDITION, he plays completely against type. Although one of the most handsome actors working today, he is made up to look slovenly, pale, and incredibly unhygienic. But his particular performance required little in the way of acting skill. I still expect him to break out hugely in the future. He is a very fine actor with absurdly good looks, and I will continue to await his future roles with great interest. Tyler Hoechlin did a fine job as Tom Hanks son.<p>This picture will receive a great deal of Oscar hype, and most of that I believe will be undeserved, apart from technical nominations. This is an exceptionally constructed film that ultimately could be considered somber and serious fluff. Not a masterpiece, but also not at all a waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting when I chose to watch this movie, other than what is normally an excellent performance by Tom Hanks, which he did deliver, as usual, in what is an extremely atypical type of role for him.  Rarely will you see Tom Hanks play one of the &quot;bad&quot; guys, but in the end, he's a bad guy who loves his family.  Overall though, this film just doesn't live up to its potential, failing to grab the viewer and compel you to the character or characters.  Yes, you do feel for the character and the losses he must endure, but it's just not a compelling story.<p>As is usual for Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, they both deliver exceptional performances, despite a weak story.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's role in the film is so minor as to hardly be noticed.  Jude Law delivers a very good performance in this film, which is par for the course for him.  Tyler Hoechlin's performance is quite admirable for a young actor.<p>Highly acclaimed &quot;American Beauty&quot; director, Sam Mendes led the reigns on this film and sets a beautiful tone for the film, which is thematically rich with the exception of the story itself which I found lacking.  The score for the film is &quot;dead on&quot; for the film.<p>The premise:<p>Tom Hanks stars as Mike Sullivan, devoted family man with his wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two children Mike Jr. and Peter.  Along with being the devoted family man, Mike Sullivan is an Irish mafia hit man whose family, led by John Rooney (Paul Newman) has very close ties to Al Capone.<p>One evening, young Mike Jr. decides that he &quot;must&quot; find out what his father actually does for a living so he stows away in the trunk of his father's car.  On that rainy night, he finds out in the worse way what his father does as he watches him and Conner Rooney (Daniel Craig) murder three men.  He's so shocked by what he's just seen he makes a noise and his father quickly finds him.<p>As much as his father tries to tell him everything is going to be okay and to forget about what he's seen, Conner Rooney isn't going to let them just forget about and orders Mike Sullivan murdered and sees to killing his wife and children himself.  Fortunately for Mike Jr. he's not at home when Conner Rooney murders his mother and brother.<p>What follows from there is a &quot;generally&quot; entertaining but rarely captivating story as Mike Sullivan and his son are attempting to allude Maguire (Jude Law) whose been sent to kill them and at the same time, find a way to get to Conner Rooney to avenge the death of his wife and youngest son.<p>I would recommend this movie as a rental.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>- Deleted Scenes<br />- HBO's &quot;Making of&quot; Documentary<br />- Feature Commentary with Director Sam Mendes<br />- Production Notes<br />- Photo Gallery</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Sam Mendes' "The Road to Perdition" is a film about family: extended, brother against brother, father and sons and ultimately father against sons. It's about the world of Men in much the same tradition as "East of Eden," which it thematically  resembles. Mendes tackles big ideas here:  the sanctity of the family, a father's love of family, a father's right to protect his family and a natural versus an adopted son's place in a family (the right of succession). But Mendes uses the small details of life to develop these themes so that his lofty ideas have a pervasive as well as persuasive effect on the viewer.<br />Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a family man (2 sons, Michael Jr. and Peter) who works for John Rooney (Paul Newman) as a bodyguard and hit man. John has a son, Connor (David Craig)who is intensely jealous of his father's relationship with Michael. It is obvious that John prefers Michael: strong, obedient, intelligent, over his natural son, Connor: weak, smarmy, conniving, underhanded, hotheaded.<br />One evening, Michael Jr., eager and curious to find out what exactly his father does for a living, hides in his father's car while Michael Sr. goes out on a "business call" with Connor to strong arm an associate that ends with Connor recklessly killing the associate with Michael Jr. witnessing the entire event.<br />This proves to be the turning point in the film and the event that sets the remainder of the film in motion: can Michael Jr. be trusted to keep his mouth shut? Connor has some definite ideas about this.<br />One of the most impressive set pieces of the film is a showdown between Michael and John Rooney and his henchman on a public street at night in the pouring rain, shot with absolutely no sound nor blood in sight.  It is as effective in it's way as the last, very bloody scene in "Bonnie and Clyde."<br />Conrad Hall has shot the film in a dark, grayish, almost colorless palette very similar to<br />"The Yards," also coincidentally a film about a family involved in crime. The criminal life for Hall and Mendes then is not the chiaroscuro life that Coppola envisions it in his Godfather trilogy, but one of black and gray signifying a life of hiding, back alleys and drudgery devoid of color, enjoyment and living.  The music is also extremely effective and evocative especially since Mendes has shot large portions of the film without dialogue.<br />The acting is top drawer with Tyler Hoechlin as Michael Jr. almost stealing the picture away from the always effective Tom Hanks, Jude Law and Paul Newman.<br />Sam Mendes has fashioned a film of the utmost purity and beauty: a tone poem to the family and to the father-son relationship in particular.<br />"The Road to Perdition" is a film that resonates with regret and sadness but more importantly an over-riding feeling that, as gangsters "getting into heaven"as John Rooney states... is not a possibility.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>ROAD TO PERDITION is a major departure for Tom Hanks. He kills people. And don't expect to see Meg Ryan as a cutely tousled co-star. Besides, it rains so much in this film that it would've made her look like a wet doggie.<p>It's 1931, and Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, an enforcer working for crime family head John Rooney (Paul Newman). Though Rooney has an adult son, Connor (Daniel Craig), he regards Michael with the affection reserved for the son he wishes he'd had. Sullivan himself has a wife and two boys. In the film's first half-hour, Connor botches a job assigned to him and Michael by the elder Rooney. In the aftermath of the debacle, Connor kills Michael's wife and his youngest (and favorite) son for reasons too complicated to explain here. For the remainder of the film, Sullivan goes on the lam with Michael, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) seeking revenge against Connor while evading a hit man named Maguire (Jude Law) reluctantly hired by John Rooney to pre-empt the reprisal slaying of his own badly behaved offspring.<p>Those who are turned off by ROAD TO PERDITION because of the bloody deeds performed by Hollywood Good Fella Hanks, akin to watching Jimmy Stewart in the role of someone who kicks puppies, are perhaps missing the point. This is a powerful tale of the dynamic that exists between fathers and sons: John and Connor, Michael and Michael, Jr., and John and Michael. This is a Guy Story to be sure. Indeed, in the entire film there's no female lead worth mentioning and very little softness. Much of the magnificent cinematography is done in the dark, brooding atmospheres that one could expect in the Male's Cave. That's not to say that there's no humor. There's a sequence of scenes depicting the young Sullivan's mastering of driving skills that, in the context of the storyline, is positively priceless.  <p>Early on, Newman, the mega-star of yesterday, and Hanks, the mega-star of today, play a piano duet (for real). But the sentimental favorite of ROAD TO PERDITION has to be the former, and I foresee a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Newman's blue eyes continue to shine out of a face that age (and perhaps cosmetic surgery) has only made more striking. Moreover, Paul's Rooney expresses more raw emotion in his relationship with his son than Tom's Sullivan can manage in his. Perhaps this was an intentional part of the script, or perhaps it's a reflection of the accomplished old pro that Newman is and Hanks has yet to be. And Law is especially good as the sinister and creepy Maguire whose hits provide fodder for his day job.<p>I liked this film a lot because it focuses on the nature of the father/son relationship, something which Tinseltown usually ignores. This is likely to be one of the better films of 2002.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Road to Perdition" is brilliantly conceived by director Sam Mendes ["American Beauty"] and stunningly photographed by the late Conrad Hall, whose illustrious career garnered him two Oscars and ten nominations. One of those nominations is for this film. Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Jude Law, among others, give great performances. It is among the best movies of 2002, but it is only fair to warn potential viewers that this is no lighthearted joyride. It is an unrelentingly dark and somber tale; `perdition', after all, is another word for hell. <p>The year is 1931, the place is a small town not far from Chicago. Prohibition has spawned a nation of thugs and gangsters. Legitimate businesses have become hubs of criminal activity. The town is run by a ruthless Irish family headed by John Rooney [Paul Newman] His real son, Connor [Daniel Craig], is his cynical, hot-headed heir, and his adopted son, Michael Sullivan [Tom Hanks], is his enforcer. A great rivalry exists between the two sons. One rainy night, one of the Michael's boys, twelve year old Michael Jr. [Tyler Hoechlin], hides in his father's car and goes along on a job. What he witnesses forever changes his life, puts the rest of his family in mortal danger, and gives John the perfect opportunity to rid himself of his rival. It also gives Michael Sullivan his only chance to see that his son does not become like him. <p>The movie is beautifully rendered in dark tones, giving it the look of a nightmarish dream. This is appropriate because the story is told from the boy's point of view and is a memory from his childhood. <p>"Road to Perdition" is not intended to be realistic. It, like the graphic novel it is based on, is a fantasy. It plays like an updated Greek / Shakespearean tragedy, and its mood is almost operatic. From a commercial point of view, it might have benefited from a bit more levity, but I admire Mendes, a true artist, for keeping his vision consistent and true. It is a movie which will be remembered long after most of 2002's releases are forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, which was in turn based very loosely on various factual stories of the 1930s, THE ROAD TO PERDITION tells the story of Michael Sullivan, a family man and thoroughly nice guy who also happens to be an enforcer and hit man for the Irish Mob.  Sullivan strives to keep his homelife separate from his work--but son Michael Jr. precipitates disaster when he follows his father and witnesses a murder.  Determined to both protect his son and have revenge on the mob boys who have suddenly turned on him, Sullivan goes on the run with Michael, and in the process finally "finds his heart" through his determination that young Michael will never walk his road.<p>There is a great deal to like about this film.  The cinematography is astonishingly beautiful and extremely well supported by the editing, which is among the best I've ever seen, and the soundtrack, which lends the story a meloncholy depth.  Many of the cast members are also exceptional, most particularly Jude Law, who creates perhaps the most chilling killer seen on screen in a decade.  But the film has two significant problems: the plot and the star.<p>There are several issues with the plot, and the overwhelming one is its predictability.  There is nothing new until one reaches midpoint, when Sullivan--with the assistance of his son--attempts to force the mafia to permit his revenge via a series of bank robberies in which he takes only mafia money.  This was quite an original idea, and very intriguing, so I was doubly frustrated when the film took yet another predictable twist that effectively negated that rather large chunk of film time.  The other issue here is Tom Hanks.  Hanks is an extraordinary actor, and the role of a hitman seemed a unique opportunity for him to blow off the super-likeable parts for which he has become famous.  But instead of doing this, Tom Hanks essentially gives a standard super-likeable Tom Hanks performance, and I found it increasingly difficult to believe him as a mob enforcer, much less to give his drive for bloody revenge any creedence.<p>When all is said and done, what is left is a film that essentially holds you by virtue of sheer cinematic technique.  THE ROAD TO PERDITION has an amazing sense of style and creates an amazing visual portrait of the era, and that--along with such performers as Jude Law--held my interest to the end.  But far from "finding its heart," the film is hollow, a matter of style over substance, and I found the story obvious, the conclusion foregone, and the statement commonplace.  While I did enjoy the film, I do not expect to revisit it.  As for the DVD itself, it is a nice package, with the visual and aural elements extremely well done; I found the bonus material, however, as bland in content as the film itself.  Now, this film has garnered many fans, and I say if you can get something out of it, more power to you, and it will be well worth the investment.  But at the same time, I would suggest that you rent this one before you purchase it, for you may just as easily fall into the other catagory--in which case you'll consider THE ROAD TO PERDITION barely worth the trip.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R.html">A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R</a><br/><p>Sam Mendes' "Road to Perdition" is for sure the most incredible motion picture of the year. Wonderfully directed by the acclaimed Sam Mendes (Academy Award Winner-Best Director-American Beauty). Don't let that scare you though! This film has no sexual nature to it at all. The R rating is due to pervasive disturbing violent content, and profanity is scarce. Tom Hanks gives the opposite performance than usual, as a killer and bankrobber. Jude Law and Paul Newman gave exceptional performances as well. The feature length was about 2 hours long, and certainly was not an action-packed, special effects thriller, rather a slower moving, yet still very interesting piece of art. Tom Hanks, who usually takes on very emotional characters, gave a rather unemotional performance, but there was a very subtle hint of the normal Hanks. As my closing comment, every aspect of this movie was perfect, and I can't wait until Feb. 25 to purchase the dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>Road to Perdition is so ambitious that any flaws it may have are made irrelevant by the film's grandiosity of vision, technical brilliance, and unique sensibility.<p>Several members of the production team were carried over from American Beauty -- director Sam Mendes, legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall, brilliant composer Thomas Newman -- but the two films are apples and oranges.  What they do share is a sense of boldness, narrative voices that are unique and distinctive.<p>Hall's photography is once again superlative -- and the larger, more elegiac tone of this film allows him even more room to dazzle with his visual magic.  Thomas Newman's score is inscrutable, once again so intrinsically woven into the fabric of the film that it becomes a seamless part of the whole, enhancing the action rather than sticking out from it.<p>The acting as a whole is wonderful.  Paul Newman still has the ability to ignite the screen with a look; young actor Tyler Hoechlin is terrific as lead character Michael Sullivan, Jr., the gangster's son in danger of following his father's path; and Jude Law is fantastic and eccentric as psychotic hitman Maguire, opting for an engrossing low-key menace.  Tom Hanks is the weak link in the first half of the film; his character is not a well-defined one for a good 45 minutes, and his repressed performance doesn't help.  Fortunately he comes to life in Act 2 of the film with the first bank robbery.  A good thing, for the film's emotional impact hinges on him, and from this point on he acquits himself well.  However, I can't help but think an actor like Liam Neeson (remembering his powerhouse performance in Neil Jordan's Michael Collins) could have brought much more fire, volatility and charisma to this role.  Nonetheless, Hanks works well enough, even if he's one of the flawed elements.  There is a small number of scenes that last a little longer than they need to, as well, even though as a whole the film is quite well paced, and even when scenes run long, the eye-melting cinematography tends to keep you from becoming disengaged.<p>One of Road to Perdition's greatest strengths is that it is unlike any other gangster film in history.  While its themes have been touched upon by the Godfather series, its approach -- kind of a hybrid noir gangster/mismatched buddy/road movie -- is very original indeed.  Just for that, I'd recommend it as essential viewing.  And there is more to be discovered.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>For those of you confused by the title, this is not Hope and Crosby's version of the Faustian myth.  It's Sam Mendes follow-up to "American Beauty".  It's Tom Hanks most internalized acting performance.  It's Paul Newman making a rare, and much needed, return to the big screen.  It's Jude Law with bad teeth and a balding patch, Jennifer Jason Leigh with almost no lines, and Conrad Hall with another virtuoso example of how to light a movie.  It's all these things and more.  But somehow, it also manages to be all these things and less.  But more on that later.<p>Like in his previous film, Sam Mendes gives away the fate of his main character within the first couple lines of dialogue.  The wheel has been set a-spinning, and the only question is how it all plays out.  Mendes is a director less interested in the final destination than in the road taken to get there ("Road to Beauty" might have been a better title for his first film; then again, "American Perdition" would be quite apt here).  Although, to be fair, the final outcome appears more in doubt here than in that last effort, even with all the gangster talk about "the life we chose" and "none of us will see heaven."<p>Visually, Mendes knows how to frame a scene.  Mostly, we see things from the point of view of Michael Sullivan, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), the eldest son of Mike Sullivan, Sr. (Tom Hanks), lead enforcer for town boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).  Mike Jr. stows away in his father's car one night, in the hopes of finding out how the old man pays the bills.  Through a hole in the wall, at feet level so all he can see of his dad are his shoes, he witnesses the brutal, tommy gun murder of a bootlegger.  This is the moment that sets the film down its road.  Mendes handles it perfectly, allowing the audience to experience the scene as Young Mike does: the visceral destruction and the sorrow of it all, the sonic boom of guns going off in unison, twinkling as bullet shells hit the floor.  Watch how this scene, with its over-the-top cacophony of sounds, is contrasted by a later shooting.  Scored only by the powerful rhythm of the ocean, which sounds like the breathing of a giant, and bathed in white light, whereas the earlier scene was set on a rainy night, the emotional resonance of this scene is heartbreaking.  It's a skillful cinematic moment, made more impressive when one realizes it was filmed by a man making only his second movie.<p>Hanks is quiet and reserved as the cold-blooded mob killer.  It's not a very glamorous role, though.  Sure, he shows prodigious talent at his job.  And he gets to stomp around armed with a cool noir get-up: fedora, overcoat, tommy gun.  But he looks worn down, dirty, unshaven, and, quite frankly, pudgy for the majority of the film.  No matter.  Because even when he's not saying anything, Hanks manages to say everything.  His eyes do much of the work here, replacing the charm that he usually uses to get through big parts.  It's not as fine a piece of work as his best performance, "Saving Private Ryan", but it's got many of the same characteristics, and is surely in the same ballpark.<p>Newman, relegated to playing supporting character parts these days, proves he still has the chops to rise to the occasion.  Rooney must be a lovable old coot (he is), a distant father (he is), a feared dictator (he is), a man capable of menacing anger (he is; to my surprise, Newman still has the force of will to bang on a table and make the whole room feel it), and one who can just as easily resign himself to his own fate (he does).  The silver in his hair and the wrinkles on his face may age him, but that low, tremulous voice help him deliver another in a long line of vintage Paul Newman performances.  He's still a treasure.<p>Jude Law has a fairly enigmatic part.  Best known for works where he is the definitive male object of desire, here Law sports a thinning hairline, unkempt fingernails, and rotting brown teeth.  I question the choice of casting Law for this role, like I question the choice of casting the gorgeous Cameron Diaz in "Being John Malkovich": why not just get an uglier actor?  But, like Diaz, Law acts his way into my good graces (just like he always does).  His photographer/killer moves like an agitated cat.  Even though the character is somewhat two-dimensional, Law manages to bring him to life.<p>Sadly, these three actors, some of my favourites, don't get many chances to shine together.  But when they do, you aren't going to find anything better.  A cast full of fine actors supports them.  Stanley Tucci is reserved and business like as Capone right-hand man Frank Nitti.  Daniel Craig does well showing the envy and pettiness of Connor Rooney, a son tormented by a father who'd prefer he was a different man.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, an actress of stunning power, has absolutely nothing to do here.  If I counted right, she has but three lines.  Shame, that.  And young Tyler Hoechlin doesn't do anything outstanding as Young Mike, but that's probably for the best.  Inexperienced kid actors who try too hard get on my last nerve.  Hoechlin plays it close to the chest and it works.<p>Although greatly marred by an opening and closing narration, which felt forced, tacked-on, and unrealistic in a film rife with harsh reality, "Road to Perdition" is a fine technical piece of work.  While something intangible keeps it from becoming a great film, one that you can clutch to your bosom as an example of the human condition writ large, it still manages to be very, very good.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Normally I write fairly long reviews, but I think I can get through this one pretty quickly.  The plot of 'Road to Perdition' is not especially remarkable.  It involves well-worn themes from Mafia films like honor, revenge, family and the desire to get away from this violent world, and the characters are nothing particularly new either.  (Tom Hanks is the cold, workmanlike killer, Daniel Craig the crazy wild card protected by his position as the son of Paul Newman, who is the surprisingly warm and kind mafia boss who is, nevertheless, utterly ruthless at heart etc.)  There's certainly nothing wrong with this plot, and it has some fine lines and a few particularly affecting scenes, but it's nothing to get to overly worked up over.  Still, the sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable.  The performances are all perfect, the score, while perhaps overly conventional, is powerful and emotive, the cinematography is consistently stunning and the period detail is utterly convincing.  Again, this is a world we've seen before, but it's more fully realized then ever before, and it makes the film nearly mesmerizing even in the scenes where little is actually going on.  Also, there's one scene late in the film, a firefight in the streets during fierce storm, which is simply breath taking.  It's definitely one of the most powerful examples of pure cinema I've seen in a long time.<br /><br /> Yeah, that's it.  Just a stunningly well made film.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>Max Allan Collins, the former writer of the Dick Tracy Comic Strip wrote the graphic novel this story was based on.

Collin is a pathetic and screwed up big baby who is grown jealous of his father's affection towards Sullivan. He carries out the job of finishing Sullivan and his family succeeding in killing his wife, played by Leigh, and younger child. Both Michael and Michael Jr set out on a trip of high stake bank robberies to avenge the death of their other family members, attempting to pay off Al Capone's lieutenant, played by Tucci, to end their protection of the Rooney's. While they are on their crime spree, the cold-hearted killer creates a special bond with his son, and slowly redeems himself. In the meantime, Capone's lieutenant had already hired a spooky hitman named Maguire, played menacingly by Law, to puruse the Sullivans and finish them both. Sullivan realizes that he must do all he can so his son will never follow in his footsteps.<br /><br />Perdition is an awesome film, with incredible cinematography, a heart-warming storyline, and great performances by the entire cast.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Road to Perdition is a story of betrayal, affection, respect, and heartbreak, as Tom Hanks, Jude Law, Paul Newman, and Tyler Hoechlin [the young kid] come together in this intriguing film.....<br /><br />Tom Hanks stars as Michale Sullivan, a hit man who works for an older man named John Rooney [Paul Newman] in the early 1930's. When Sullivan's oldest son [Tyler Hoechlin] witnesses an unplanned murder on one of Sullivan's mob hits, Sullivan is determined to have his son keep it to himself.<br /><br />However Hanks character's world is turned upside down as he is betrayed by his mob family and his wife and youngest son are killed in fear that the kid will tell the police of the mob hit. Sullivan takes his remaining son and goes on the run, always looking over his shoulder and swearing revenge on the man who killed his family [Who also was Rooney's son in the first place.]<br /><br />Paul Newman portrays John Rooney, the mob boss himself, a man who is nearing the end of his time, but is still intimidating and powerful none the less. He himself has great respect for Sullivan, and even cares for him like a father would for a son [Ironic, isn't it?]<br /><br />The main plotline is both Sullivan and his son on the run, looking for a new safe place to live. There are other littler plot lines that keep the movie entertaining:<br /><br />From Sullivan teaching his son to drive the car so he can rob banks to get money to keep them alive, to even Rooney hiring a hit man/photographer [Jude Law]to track down the two runaways and kill them. So many great actors, one movie that will assure you the acting will never get dull.<br /><br />Not to let too much info get out [in case you haven't seen the movie yet] I will say that the interaction between Newman and Hanks near the end in the church is absolute gold, where both men have their final respects and say what they think about each other.<br /><br />Jude Law gives a chilling performance as a photographer who takes pictures of the dead because he was always captivated by the way they looked like and how they lay still. His interaction with Hanks in the diner is chilling, telling Hanks what he thinks of his line of work as a photographer as he loads a camera [and also a gun under the bench.]<br /><br />The ending is surprsing [At least I thought so] and a powerful message from the son gives this movie a 5 star rating.<br /><br />The extras include commentary by the director, Sam Mendes, and also some of the actors.

It's incredible that he still can continue transmitting those qualities while assuming the role of an assassin in Road to Perdition.<br /><br />According to the dictionary, perdition is hell, the loss of the soul, the eternal condemnation. But this movie is more about the fight not to lose oneself in that way. More specifically, it is about a father who0s in the road to perdition and wishes his son never has to cross it.<br /><br />A father and a son united by tragedy embark in a violent trip through America in the winter of 1931. Before the trip, both men practically didn't know each other. 12 year old Michael Sullivan Jr., and its brother Peter little know about their father Michael and his work as an assassin for the local Mafia head, John Rooney (Paul Newman). This man, whose power is compared with God's, has served like a paternal figure for the Sullivan family. His son Connor has felt always envy of the relation between his father and Michael; and these feelings bring violence after Michael Jr. witnesses a crime perpetrated by his father and Connor, an event that makes Connor decide to kill Michael's wife and their sons.<br /><br />Fearing for his life and thirsty of revenge, Michael flees with his surviving son. Their 6-week odyssey allows them to develop the intimate relation they never had before, a relationship that makes Michael think that he doesn't want his son to follow his steps.<br /><br />From the beginning, we know this will be a tragic history. Deliberately slow, Road to Perdition constructs the foundations of its outcome, one that's not arranged with Hollywood conventions but one that feels correct and appropriate, given the erroneous lives of the characters.<br /><br />Each element of Road to Perdition reflects a unified vision and meticulous attention in the details, from the wardrobe, props, to the magnificent cinematography and artistic direction which try to relive the Depression era in the United States.<br /><br />As Sullivan, Tom Hanks interprets his closest version of a villain. His humanity, demonstrated in the relation with his son, smoothes the character to such points that sometimes we forget he is a ruthless assassin. Paul Newman is more than magnificent like Rooney, a man able to feel an immense love by Sullivan, but not sufficiently strong as the familiar bonds. Jude Law gives a macabre touch to Maguire, the contracted assassin to kill Sullivan, whose hobby is take photos from his victims and sell them.<br /><br />All the crew, from the producer to the director, Sam Mendes, wants to make clear that this is a history of parents and children, crimes and punishments, errors and amendments. Nevertheless, Road to Perdition is very cold and distant, unable to involve us with the destiny of their characters. All the pieces fit with too much perfection. Each scene is coldly calculated, each phrase, each silence. It's a film that could have involve us more in the emotional plane, but their creators seem to have resigned to do so when they reached half of the road.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AVV9LV9UXT6F.html">A2AVV9LV9UXT6F</a><br/><p>This movie is rather slowly paced, but largely makes up for it with excellent performances from most of the actors, a first rate musical score, and absolutely gorgeous locations and cinematography (the only movie I know of which visually represents the period as well or better is "Miller's Crossing").  The only thing I am really disappointed with is the ending.  I know the exact dramatic reasons that prompted the writer and director to make it the way they did, but the ending is all too predictable, and I really can't admire anyone who is too squeamish to try and defend himself from his own inevitable murder.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>With all the critical praise and the handful of Academy Awards that were bestowed on American Beauty, director Sam Mendes had a lot to live up to with his follow up film.  Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, Road to Perdition tells the story of Irish mob hitman Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who, along with his pre-teen son, are on the run while he seeks revenge on his former partner who murdered his family.  Hanks gives one of his better (but not his best) performances as he tries to against his typical good guy roles (a la an Oscar winning Denzel Washington), but in the end he comes out being a likeable character nonetheless.  Paul Newman (in an Oscar nominated performance) chews up as much screen time as he can, but his best moments are when he and Hanks share the screen together.  The standout performance however, goes to Jude Law as a picture taking hitman sent after Hanks and son, and while his screen time is limited, Law is simply chilling and gives us the film's most memorable role.  Mendes' directing is slow paced, but that doesn't take anything away from the film thanks to the gorgeous cinematography that set this tale of redemption and revenge apart from other films of its' genre.  All in all, I strongly suggest Road to Perdition to anyone and everyone, although some will say that this is not for all tastes.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>I read the Graphic Novel Road to Perdition by Max Allen Collins and Richard Piers Rayner when it was released by DC Comics' Paradox Press imprint years ago. To say I was blown away would be an understatement. This was one of the finest works of literature I have ever encountered. In any medium. PERIOD. It really distressed me that Collins and Rayner weren't getting money and awards heaped on them. No one seemed to have read it but me! Well, I guess it doesn't matter how many people read it after all, because apparently the RIGHT people read it, since it's now a big summer movie.<p>  Road to Perdition tells the story of Michael Sullivan, a mob button-man in prohibition-era Chicago, forced to go on the run with his young son, after the son sees Sullivan and Connor Rooney, the son of a powerful Mob-Boss (Wonderfully played  by the great Paul Newman, who will probably get an Oscar for his part), carrying out a mission that goes horribly wrong, due to the trigger-happy Conner.  The book and movie echo the classic Japanese Manga Lone Wolf and Cub, as father and son face incredible odds, leading to a fateful climax that will decide the boy's future. Jude Law is excellent as the Homicidal crime-scene photographer sent after the Sullivans, and Stanley Tucci does his usual great job as Frank Nitti. It's too bad that Anthony LaPaglia's Al Capone was left on the cutting room floor, as Capone's presence loomed large in the book. <p>  The adaptation, by David Self, veers WAAY off from the source material; The movie is much "Smaller" than the book, and omits the Capone Hotel massacre, the riverboat heist/fire, and changes the fate of young Michael to a more bland one. Overall, it's a very good movie, but as usual, the book was better. I can't urge you strongly enough to read Road to Perdition, published by Paradox Press; If you like the movie, you'll fall in love with the book.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>In this fine Prohibition-era film, Tom Hanks plays a mob hit man who, throughout the course of the film, transforms his life from killing to caring.  Michael Sullivan (Hanks) is the right-hand man for crime boss John Rooney, played superbly by veteran actor Paul Newman.  But when Sullivan's young son Michael Jr., played by Tyler Hoechlin, witnesses one of his father's hits, he must choose between his real family and his crime family.<p>Upon finding out that Sullivan's son witnessed the hit, Rooney's son Connor, played by Daniel Craig, has Sullivan's wife Annie (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and son Peter (Liam Athen) killed.  This fills Michael with rage and revenge against his former crime family, but also fills him with a new-found sense of love and responsibility for his son Michael Jr.<p>The acting throughout the film is excellent.  Hanks turns in one of his best acting performances as Sullivan, while timeless Paul Newman is wonderful as John Rooney.  Jude Law is also a standout as Maguire, a chilling hit man/photographer.  I would rate this film on the level of other Hanks films such as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.  You must watch the film carefully and let the story develop, but the ending is worth the wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>You have to be a little wary whenever a movie starts with a nostalgia-drenched voiceover by an adolescent boy...***Uh-oh!  Warning, warning!!***  Will the director have what it takes to rise above this pitfall?  You'd think that Sam Mendes, whose direction of "American Beauty" showed remarkable narrative and textural depth and admirably original ironies, would be one of the guys who could redeem themselves after such a palpably weak introduction.  However, this would-be arthouse crime thriller relies too heavily on its measured tempo and soft-edged presentation, but doesn't back it up in the end.  This is, we are clearly and unceasingly telegraphed, a Thinking Person's Crime Film, and as such falls readily into the category of melodrama.  Tom Hanks, ever likeable, plays (oooh!) a bad guy... sort of, but not quite.  A seasoned gunsel for the local Irish mob, Hanks finds himself a victim of his boss's own dirty laundry and, with his life ruined and in peril, he goes on the lam with his 12-year old son, forming a one-and-a-half-man army against the Mob.  This movie is well produced and engaging (and beautifully shot, by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall), but ultimately it's just another hollow glorification of gun culture, masquerading as a morality tale.  I enjoyed watching this film, but felt empty and unnourished as it slid slowly to a halt, and as soon as I started to think about it, even a bit resentful.  This is the sort of Boy Film where it's easier to kill a man's family than to fully construct them as realistic characters, and in which the logic of violence too easily overcomes the reality of emotion -- sort of like a movie version of that old Harry Chapin song, "Cat's In The Cradle," but with lots of guns and a "happy" ending where the son realizes what a mensch his gangster dad was.  Paul Newman is grave, charismatic and not very prominent as the Midwestern crime boss, while Jude Law is squandered in his role as a sadistic hitman.  However, somebody really oughtta cast the kid, Tyler Hoechlin, in some movie along with Leonard DiCaprio, either as a relative or as a younger version of Lennie... they have a very similar sleepy-eyed look.  Other than that, I didn't get much out of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This movie was a punch . Sam Mendes kept every detail ; the art direction is wondeful , the photograph is A.1 , the story is not only very original in this genre , but effective , it doesn`t have any hole . Why did this film din't have a best place in the Academy Awards? Why didn`t Paul Newman win the prize as best support actor?<br /><br />The shot scene under the rain with a veil of expressive silence is a classic!The crudeness is its peak and the tension is of first order but ...<br /><br />The great mistake ; the only hole of this picture is (believe or not) Tom Hanks .<br /><br />Tell me : I have a deep respect for Hanks he`s a good actor undoubtly , but Do you really think he is capable to play a gangster role ? ; he doesn`t have the hard face for that role . And believe me there were another names ; Think in Tom Berenger , Ralph Fienes , Tim Roth , Edawrd Norton , Jean Reno , John Malkovich or Sean Penn for instance to play this character . The story with Hanks is so incredble , so false , because he simply is out of his acting landing .<br /><br />This wrong choice made this film has lost a part of its greatness .

In each city, the ethnic group in charge of criminal activities depends on the surroundings.  In the mythical midwestern city where the film starts out, the Irish Rooney family is in charge.  The film opens as Rooney patriarch, John, (Paul Newman) is hosting a wake for one of his "fellows".  The young Sullivan family (Hanks, Jennifer Jason-Leigh and two sons) is in attendance, and it becomes quickly evident that Rooney treats Michael Sr. (Hanks) as a son (he participated in Mike's coming of age, has employed Mike, and Mike seemingly is his most successful bagman and enforcer), and Michael and Peter (Tyler Hoechlin & Liam Aiken) as grandsons.  The men of the film, with the exception of Rooney's disreputable son Connor (Daniel Craig) are taciturn and solemn - all business, cold and bleak.  Hard men, for hard times. <p>Mike Jr., at 12, is convinced his father is more than just an ordinary man, but can already feel the strangeness of suspecting that what his dad does for a living doesn't fit with the religious and moral code so evident in the Sullivan household.  He hides in the car one night as his father and Connor set out for a "discussion" with a disenchanted member of Rooney's organization.  The film erupts with the violence that Mike Jr. witnesses.  Soon, both Sullivan's are on the run from the Rooney organization, which has closed ranks to protect Connor, seemingly because they cannot trust Mike Jr. to keep what he saw a secret.  Mrs. Sullivan and Peter are assassinated by Connor and the two remaining must find a way to stay safe and to gain their revenge.  The tragic tale that follows is less about the storyline and more about the parallels of father/son relationships.  <p>Mendes earned, with his reputation, the right to work with some of the best in the business.  Hanks always rises to perform as a master when surrounded by a talented ensemble, and particularly with an actor/actress of Newman's caliber.  Hanks is self-contained, communicating with his eyes and his instinctive reactions to events.  His scene at the piano with Newman, and his victory in the rain against Newman's men are both masterful displays of acting prowess.  He's not alone in these scenes, and Newman is memorable here - easily slipping from engaging man among men to fearsome patriarch to a father torn by anguish over competing responsibilities to family - should he value his own flesh and blood more than the "son" who is his by demeanor, ability and character?<p>Young Hoechlin, as Mike, Jr., is either one of the finest young actors we have seen, or, more likely, a truly successful student of Mendes/Hanks - he conveys much of what we learn about him with his eyes and his gestures.  Jude Law has a scary turn, as a smarmy contract killer, and too little is seen of Stanley Tucci as a Chicago mobster, and of Jason Leigh.  Both, however, get more screen time than Anthony LaPaglia, who was cast as Al Capone, but all of the film of his character ended up on the cutting room floor.  <p>Strong performances make memorable characters, but the plotline of "Perdition" is thin.  Mendes enhances the film with its own bleakness.  The sound and the lighting capture the suspense - both are almost visceral in the violent sequences, and the cinematography of Conrad Hall is evident in the transition of camera shots - the film manages to feel like a series of artistic masterpieces wound together as a film.  Each time two characters meet in a one on one sequence (be it Connor warning young Michael, a kindly farmwoman who confronts Mike Sr. with the knowledge of how much he means to his son, or the dawning awareness of the danger in a roadside diner where Law's Maguire  and Sullivan meet) the film draws you in to the sequence as though it were really unfolding before you.<p>There will be many filmgoers who are amazed by "The Road to Perdition", and many who will reject it because it was billed as a successor to "The Godfather", and, aside from the mob plot and the tales of family revenge and relationships, the two have very little in common.  "Perdition" takes place over 6 short weeks - "The Godfather" unfolds over two decades.  The sense of golden unreality that captured viewers for Puzo's rich storyline is missing from the quick sketch of the harsh midwestern mob life in the 30's. <p>Hardest for me as a filmgoer is the film's ending.  A little short on plot, it leaves us with an implausible, if necessary conclusion.  We've guessed it all along based on the way Mendes introduces the film, but the closing sequence, (again, beautifully filmed) is melodramatic and unrealistic.  Mike Jr. would have taken the action he had to take to survive.<br /><br />For adult moviegoers this summer, it is a quietly powerful film choice, beautifully made.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>Fascinating scenario, wonderful screenplay, some marvelous performances and beautiful to look at. So, why didn't I love this movie? I'm not certain. There was a sense of something &quot;false&quot; throughout every frame which I remain unable to put my finger on. This bothers me.<br /><br /> I hate to call something a turkey, but this movie - which seemingly has most of the elements of a great picture - fails to pull them together into a cohesive whole. Here, we must blame the director. There are, to be sure, some wonderfully riveting performances by an almost uniformly excellent cast, but these performances feel like they belong in another, more deserving, and ultimately better movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Despite an outstanding cast (Tom Hanks, Jude Law, Daniel Craig and Paul Newman's final screen appearance), under-explored setting (organized crime in the depression-era midwest) and very solid inspiration (it's directly and admittedly influenced by Lone Wolf and Cub), this never quite congeals into anything more than a dull, formulaic revenge picture. Hanks, usually the beating heart of a film, is chained down by a dry, emotionless turn as a distant father figure whose young family is virtually wiped out by an out-of-control colleague. On the path to revenge he tries to reconnect with the only other survivor, his twelve-year-old son, but the two have such a faint rapport that the inevitable payoff lands on a flat note. Craig and Law are worthwhile in their roles as quirky, irredeemable psychopaths, but get so little screen time it's tough to develop an appreciation for the nuances of either. For the majority of the run time we're just tailing Hanks, at his most wooden, as he systematically wipes out the opposition. Bland, redundant, over-long material that misuses its many blessings.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>I expected to find this film dull and my interest level unsustainable, but it was unexpectedly dark and unexpectedly interesting. The story follows Michael Sullivan (an unusually subdued Tom Hanks), an Irish mob hit man who also happens to be a devoted family man, working hard at maintaining a strict separation of work and home lives. When his older son witnesses one of his father's hits, the attempts to keep work and home lives separate are foiled as other hit men from the same crime family (that of John Rooney, played with an expert balance between patriarchal authority and power by an icy but somehow still, at times, warm, Paul Newman) murder Sullivan's wife and younger son. Sullivan goes on the run with his older son, both seeking revenge and seeking a surefire way to protect his son's life and prevent his son from traveling the same path he has. The film was well handled, subtly suspenseful and never dry, which helped it exceed my expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Sam Mendes<br />Cast:  Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, Tyler Hoechlin, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Graig.<br />Running Time:  117 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence and language.<p>Director Sam Mendes has the extraordinary talent of weaving stories on film that can be used on many different levels.  His first main feature, &quot;American Beauty&quot; was an exhilerating tale that on one level was a satire of surban life, while also a dark, melancholic depection of the meaning of life and how beautiful each small essence of it can be.  &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;, his next feature, has a simlar tone to it and is a film that is layered similar to an onion.<p>Tom Hanks is good (yes, only good--his efforts in films such as &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Castaway&quot;, and &quot;The Green Mile&quot; were slightly better) as a gangster who works for one of the most powerful (and crooked) men in the city (played by Paul Newman in a limited role, unfortunately).  When his son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses an accidental murder of one of his father's colleagues, the duo must leave town in order to survive the aftermath of the ordeal.  Jude Law gives a great performance as the eerie photographer who is hired to not only track down the father and son, but kill them because of the information they are not supposed to know.<p>&quot;Road to Perdition&quot; is a powerful tale that captures the essence of the extraordinary possibilites presented in a father-son bond.  It is a film that shows the corruptness of the business world at the time (the film was depicted around the time of the depression), but ultimately unfolds as a journey about vengeance, redemption, and love.  Although not as superb as some critics may have claimed, it is still a motion picture that will satisfy fans of Hanks and Mendes, although those who are anticipating a powerhouse role from the aging Newman will be disappointed--he is not as integral part of the film as you would think.  The finale is exceptional.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>This movie is about finding redemption.  Hanks plays hitman Mike Sullivan, who knows that what he does is not going to save his soul.  He is hoping his son will not follow his footsteps though.  After his oldest son witnesses his fathers work, his wife and younger son  are killed, although it was supposed to be his older son who was to be killed.  Retribution is sought and Sullivan recruits his son to help him carry out a plan to do so.  All the while, Sullian is growing closer to his son and realizing that his estrangement was due to his fear that he would grow up like himself.  The movie is paced slow and it is dark.  The scenery and the sets are detailed beautifully for the period and Newman and Hanks give very solid performances.  There are a lot of Father son dichodomies in this movie.  Four different relationships span the plot and it shows many different character reactions and behaviors.  This is not to be compared with Godfather or any other mobster movie.  There is not a lot of action, but there is enough.  Be patient and you will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>Frankly, I managed to avoid "Road to Perdition" during its theater run, mainly due to the reviews and complaints I'd heard about the movie. Well, lesson learned: don't believe everything you read or hear about a movie. This movie deserves accolades and applause for being one of the best movies made last year.<p>"Road To Perdition" is the story of a man with a mission to avenge the death of his wife and son, all the while reconnecting to the remaining son he never knew. Tom Hanks leads this all-star cast, Jude Law, Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Jason  Leigh, and including the amazing Paul Newman who plays his role with dignity. Some people claim they can't see Hanks as a gangster, but he plays his role with both reserve and dignity. He is an actor, first and foremost, and he can carry off any role he plays.<p>But let's get to the real reason this film is amazing. First the script. Bringing back a 30's gangster drama, with a strong emphasis on drama. Sure there is a lot of killing and death in the film, but it is vital and relevant to the plot. It's a very strong story, as Hanks needs to do what he needs to do to carry out his new mission in life. From the moment the film opens to the closing credits, it's strong and real. <p>Some people complain about the pacing. While it is slow, it is the characters that drive it that speed, and spending every second with them is an amazing experience. If you want a shoot 'em up, crash and dash movie, move on: this movie isn't for you.<p>The true star of the film, though, is the incredible direction of Sam Mendes, and the absolutely beautiful cinematography. This is a film to be cherished, relished like a fine wine. Each scene is perfectly crafted to convey its purpose and meaning to the highest degree. It almost seems like you can watch each frame with the sound off, and it still resounds with strong emotional impact. Mendes has set a high bar in the art of filmmaking with his newest contribution.<p>The road was an incredible journey from start to finish. Sit back, relax, and enjoy this cinematic masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/AO3JW5VHT2GQ.html">AO3JW5VHT2GQ</a><br/><p>Summary:<br />Michael Sullivan, Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) has a hitman for a father, Michael Sullivan Senior (Tom Hanks), but doesn't know it.  When Michael Jr. follows his dad to a job to find out what it is his dad does, he is caught by his dad and his dad's boss's son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig (I)), who is the heir to John Rooney's (Paul Newman) fortune.  To cover his tracks, and perhaps out of jealousy, Connor tries to get Michael Senior killed while he kills the rest of the family, including Michael Jr.  But Michael senior catches on to the plot and gets away while Michael Jr. doesn't happen to be home when Connor makes his hit, killing instead Michael senior's wife and other son Peter.  Michael Senior is smart enough to know that he has to skip town, but he also has to avenge his wife's death by killing Connor.  So, the two Sullivan's leave but another hitman, Maguire (Jude Law), is sent to kill them.  Michael Senior tries to bait the Chicago mob bosses to give up Connor Rooney by stealing their money but it doesn't work.  Eventually he realizes that the only way to kill Connor is to kill Connor's dad, John, so the Chicago mob bosses will stop protecting Connor.  Michael Senior avenges the murders and gets away only to end up with Maguire still hunting him.<p>My Comments:<br />This is a remarkable movie.  The acting is superb.  The music is impeccable.  The cinematography is stunning.  It is just an all around wonderful movie.  There is one scene in particular that was just so well done that I'm still amazed.  It is when Michael Senior kills John Rooney.  John and his henchman are crossing the street in a torrential downpour when Michael opens fire.  Instead of hearing both the rain, the gun shots, and the sounds of dying men, all we hear is music as Michael, in slow motion, kills five or six of John Rooney's henchman.  It isn't until John is the only one left standing that the actual sound comes back up and then, when Michael finally kills John, we hear everything.  <p>I was thoroughly impressed with the story.  It seemed completely logical and plausible and worked very well.  The movie was tasteful enough not to show gratuitous violence.  Sure, the movie is violent, but there is really no reason to show a lot of it, leaving most of the violence to the audience's imagination.  The focus is the story.  And, the setup to the story is superb.  Michael Jr. is telling the story in retrospect, and discussing whether or not his father, who was a hitman for the mob, was a good man or not.  In the end, Michael Jr. doesn't say whether or not his dad was a good man, that is left up to the viewer to decide, but he does claim him as his dad, which says plenty.<p>Overall, I loved this movie.  If you don't particularly care for violence or are not interested in the mafia, then you may not like this movie as much as I did.  But, you'll probably still be entranced by a very compelling and touching story.  A definite must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The publicity for "Road to Perdition" is all about actors Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, but it did not take long into this film for me to decide the two stars are cinematographer Conrad Hall and composer Thomas Newman.  Both are deservedly up for Oscars for this 2002 film because "Road to Perdition" is ultimately pictures and music.  Hall died last month and won his second Oscar for his previous film, "American Beauty," and it will be interesting to see how those two factors affect the voters, but this is a gorgeous film.  Almost as strong is the music by Thomas Newman, although the piano duet played by Hanks and Paul Newman was written by John Williams.  It is not surprising that several of the pivotal scenes of the film are without dialogue, or with the spoken words muted, because the performances are etched more by visuals than words (and the standout performance of the film is Jude Law).<p>The film is based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner, which was clearly inspired by the epic Japanese manga "Lone Wolf & Cub" by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima, the final volume of which was just published in the United States. The parallels are in general terms: a skilled assassin forced to flee with his son, but planning vengeance.  Instead of feudal Japan the story is set in the Great Depression in and around Chicago.  However, while "Lone Wolf & Cub" provides the essential premise of the film the end game is decidedly different (think John Wayne's final film "The Shootist").  The final pivotal scene of "The Road to Perdition" represents the film perfectly: I knew what was going to happen but it was photographed beautifully.  Again, you might be seeing Tom Hanks, but you are thinking Conrad Hall.  Talk about going out at the top of your game: a beautiful legacy.</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>What a way to start a day. I saw this in a typically sun shiny morning and I can tell you if you are up for a depressing yet wonderful film to jumpstart your day, I suggest Road to Perdition.<br /><br />The film is about a mob gangster Michael Sullivan who was betrayed by his boss bceause his son, Michael Jr inadvertently witnesses a murder. So, to tie all loose ends, mob boss John Rooney decides to kill his loyal right-hand man. But when Connor Rooney, John Rooney's son, mercilessly kills his family (only his older son Michael Jr surviving), he decides to go on a vendetta to avenge his family's death.<br /><br />The story is not your typical gangster film. There's no police cops to arrest mob bosses here nor drug cartels for that matter. The story is focused on Michael Sullivan's revenge on the people who betrayed him. Sam Mendes and the writers managed to excellently blend a father-and-child story angle in a gangster themed story.<br /><br />The performances were great. Tom Hanks as usual delivers, Jude Law unexpectedly sent chills down to my ancestors as a creepy looking psychopath/photographer. Paul Newman as the aging mob boss was great as well. One minute you hate him for betraying his loyal right-hand man, the next minute you don't want him to die soaking wet.<br /><br />Daniel Craig, before James Bond, portrayed an annoying scheming mischievous son to a mob boss. He had it coming to him. Yes, he was spot on with his performance too.<br /><br />The best scene in the entire film would probably be when Michael Sullivan ambushed John Rooney and his mob thugs drenched in rain. Sam Mendes did this slow-mo shot when Michael was shooting them with a machine gun in a distant house and the thugs were like dropping like flies and John was by the car, with his head down realizing his grim fate. Michael killed all of them except John. So, he approached him with gun in his hand, John turns to him, almost into tears and utters what probably is the best line of the film: "I'm glad its you". Michael with a sad look then shoots him down.<br /><br />That scene will stay in my head forever. It was emotional, sad, depressing and it almost wanna make you cry but somehow you feel that the Michael character is doing the right thing. Very poetic scene to be remembered for ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 5.0<br /><br />I'd never seen the movie until a few years ago when a friend of mine let me borrow it on DVD. I had little expectations going in, other than the fact that Tom Hanks (of all people) was playing a hitman. I hadn't (and still haven't seen, at the time of this review) American Beauty and only knew who Sam Mendes was by name, and not reputation. Back then, I thought the movie was pretty good. I saw it mostly as a revenge-themed story, liked the bits of character development throughout, and enjoyed the overall aesthetic feel of post-Depression 1930s gangster-dom. Today, after having developed a better sense of awareness and taste for a film's writing, I am completely blown away by the level of depth in story and character on this subsequent viewing. Plot summary aside, I find Road to Perdition to be everything I remember and so much more. It's a coming-of-age story for sons, a resolution for fathers, a testament to the brutality of violence, and an emotional tale about the preservation of innocence all brilliantly disguised in the form of a revenge thriller. I was particularly engrossed by the parallel relationships shared between father and son through all forms: Sullivan and his son, Rooney and his son, then Rooney and Sullivan Sr. The similarities shared between the father-son pairings make for some very quaint and believable bonds, while still managing to make these characters empathetic. Without revealing too much, the story possesses a lot of thematic value and is a very moving drama that tells a masterful story through a lost setting that we just don't see much of anymore (that is, the 1930s gangster era). Tom Hanks is in top form as Sullivan Sr. with outstanding support performances by Daniel Craig, Stanley Tucci, Jude Law, Tyler Hoechlin, and the late Paul Newman. It's great that the film won an award for Cinematography and was nominated for some other technical categories, but nothing for Best Picture, Director, or Actor? Oh well, regardless of Oscar snubs, I'm happy to say this is definitely a new all-time favorite for me now.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />As mentioned, Road to Perdition won an Academy Award for Cinematography, and with good reason. The picture looks gorgeously bleak. Colors are subdued, with a lot of grays, charcoals, and solid blacks being the focus. Primaries don't make much of an appearance apart from the happier moments outside in the sunlight or in any scenes where blood is present. But despite the photography, they look as good as can be. Skin tones have a very natural presentation to them and never feel too pale or over-saturated, providing for some very fine textures in hair and face wrinkles. By far the most eye-catching aspect of the camera work is the black levels. Blacks are super deep and inky, with some especially excellent line and shadow delineation amidst the many, many darkly-lit scenes and layers of clothes being worn. The detail is so great, and I was really impressed at being able to see all the little things I don't think I ever noticed on the DVD, like the scene where Hanks goes into the night club and you can clearly see the paper over the gun and lamp shades shaking to the music, or when Hanks is walking on the street in the dark and you can see all the linings between his vest, suit, and overcoat. The image is one of the finest I've seen on BD to date. Unfortunately, while just about everything else is preserved, the only detractor would be the very frequent amounts of dirt and debris throughout. Aside from that one little mishap, the picture is essentially perfect.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Unlike the video, however, the audio comes across just fine and dandy. As soon as the film started and I heard the sound of the waves crashing, I knew I would be in for good things from a sound perspective. Buoyancy is a word I use a lot for audio descriptions and is a term I like to think of as identifying a quality of "pop" to the presentation, much like the editors and critics use for the video portions of a review. Well, the DTS-HD track here really does have a pop to it, and right from the get-go. Directionality and separation offer all kinds of goodness from proper placement to panning, to flawless mixing between dialogue and music. The sound crew was nominated for a couple of Oscars in both mixing and editing, and this BD shows exactly why. Every subtle sound, high and low, front, left, right, and back are handled with a great amount of care and detail. The dialogue is always pitch-perfect and never distorts through the center, while the occasional background noise, street crowd, blowing of wind, and car engine add a good deal of depth to the city of Chicago. Thomas Newman's score (another shocking fact to know he hasn't won an Oscar yet) sounds wonderful and emotionally stirring, propelling the drama on-screen, yet never overpowering the dialogue or sound effects. And as for the sound effects, gunshots dominate the sound field and conquer with just cause when need be. I believe this is my first time hearing a Tommy Gun in lossless audio, and boy is it frightening. LFEs are mostly inherent within the music, background and score-wise, but have a particularly great moment during the passing of a subway train when we first meet Jude Law's character. This is definitely reference material.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />From the DVD we get the basic making-of featurette, deleted scenes with optional commentary, and extremely poignant feature film commentary by Sam Mendes. The making-of is really as basic as it comes and isn't much to talk about. The deleted scenes provide a little more context to the story that we might not have known, yet are still surprised by. And the commentary by Mendes is as good as they come. Next to Michael Mann and Christopher Nolan, this one of the best commentaries I've heard. He's very into the explanation of the film, both from a technical and literary viewpoint, and really gets in-depth with a lot of the explanations concerning what he wanted to convey on-screen, how he did it, or why/how it's different from the original graphic novel. New to the BD is an introduction by Mendes to this new and impressive Blu-ray edition, a retrospect on the life and career of the film's master cinematographer, the late Conrad L. Hall, and an interactive library explaining some of the period elements of the film. At this point, I'm just now making it a habit of getting to know some of the technicians behind the camera, in addition to the many other important names I feel are important. And I have to say, after seeing the feature on Mr. Hall, my interest in the man has really peaked now. Before seeing this film, I knew photography could make a world of difference in the way a movie feels. And for as good as his craft was in Road to Perdition, I really am curious to see his other works at some point. As for the new library archive, I found it very interesting in terms of content, but the tiny screen thing was a problem. I'm pretty sure it can't be blown up, but personally, I wish they had just put it all together as a regular HD featurette. For what it is, though, it's full of some pretty good, albeit sparse, information.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />I thought the movie was pretty good when I first saw it. But knowing what I know now, and with the help of Blu-ray, I have to say I really love the film. It's a character drama that's full of heart and really draws a lot of empathy from me, personally. With Grade-A quality in all aspects of both technical and literary departments, the film is an extreme joy for me to watch, thanks in huge part to the cinematography, cast, and score. The A/V specs are definitely the pinnacle of BD technology, and it's nice to even get a blessing from Mendes himself (an admitted skeptic, initially). Add to that a great set of special features, and you have yourself a must-own piece of film-making brought graciously to you by Paramount.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the DVD Widescreen edition(20th Cent Fox/Dreamworks) of "The Road To Perdition"...<br /><br />There are so many informative and perceptive reviews here pertaining to this film and the incredible cast, and I don't want to repeat what's already been said, so basically I am going to review the DVD package itself for those who may be interested. I can hardly restrain myslef though, from saying that I loved this dark and thought provoking character study of an icy killer, who we watch slowly melting into a warm human being and caring father as the film progresses. It is one of those rare films I wanted to watch again immediatley.<br /><br />This DVD package, is what all DVD packages should be. It has everything possible available to make it a joy to view by all.<br /><br />The picture in anamorphic widescreen is always crystal clear. Considering that much of the story takes place on dark and stormy nights this is a big plus. The colors of the film, which are more muted then most films these days, really make you feel like you are back in the depression era, and are well defined on this DVD. The sound is excellent in the DD5.1. There is also an option for 2.0, or French 5.1. Every raindrop, every footstep, every rat-a-tat-tat of the tommy guns, and every word of dialouge clear and distinct. There are subtitles in English, French and Spanish, and has descriptions spoken for visually impaired as well. It may be viewed with or without commentary by directed Sam Mendes, and has the option of the commentary in Spanish and French as well(written words).<br /><br />Special features include an informative and entertaining 25 minute look at the "Making Of" documentary, with thoughts from the cast, the director, and we are fortunate enough to hear the thoughts of cinematographer Conrad Hall, who's filming was as dramatic as the story. There are several deleted scenes, which may also be viewed with commentary, and may fill in some questions about the storyline for you. Also included are cast and filmmaker bios, production notes and a photo gallery. There was also an option for the CD soundtrack, which I got all jazzed about,(I thought I could isolate Thomas Newman's magnificent score), but this turned out to be just an advertisement for the CD. The price is more then reasonable compared to what you get(or don't get) on other DVDs.<br /><br />The exquisite cast, including Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Jude Law, will have you mesmerized. The film will leave you thinking. The DVD, impressive.<br /><br />Enjoy....Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>I'm not a fan of gangster movies, but this one seemed to have heart and was far from a "turkey."  It shows the bloodlust that mobs are suseptible to, a bloodlust that is like a fire you cannot put out, kind of like Iraq.<br /><br />Tom Hanks was spectacular and mob characters were very believable to me.  Paul Newman was also excellent as a mob boss.<br /><br />The mob mentality is a chilling one and it was portrayed well in this film.  Alittle too much killing, but very realistic.</p></br><a href="../users/AK61LQI92GTCH.html">AK61LQI92GTCH</a><br/><p>Wow, is THE ROAD TO PERDITION a slow moving movie.  Deliberate, ponderous, lugubrious.  Take your pick, this is one slow flick.<br /> It's 1931 and Tom Hanks plays Chicago hit-man Mike Sullivan, The Angel of Death, and surrogate son to mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman.)  When Sullivan's son Mike Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) observes his father and Rooney's son Connor (Daniel Craig) bump off a clutch of gangsters everything changes.  Connor, motivated by a mixture of sibling jealousy and a need to keep the killings a secret, decides to wipe out the Sullivan family.  He succeeds in murdering Sullivan's wife and youngest son, but misses Mike and Mike Jr.  The surviving Sullivans escape and embark on a journey of revenge and survival.<br /> THE ROAD TO PERDITION was taken from an illustrated novel, and I understand the filmmakers responsibility to the source material, but I would have dropped the kid and abandoned the notion of telling the story of the son's point of view.  At this point in Hanks' career it's difficult enough to accept him as a physically imposing, inarticulate brute.  Viewing him through the eyes of his emotionally distant son doesn't help.  Hanks is an incredible actor, but he's also a movie star cast against type in this one.  The story doesn't allow him the opportunity to convince us of his character.<br />  It looks great.  Cinematographer Conrad Hall is a genius, especially when it comes to filming rain.  The sets are gorgeous, the feeling of depression-era America is well captured.  Unfortunately the movie takes forever to sprout wings, and even then it doesn't fly.  The wonderful Jennifer Jason Leigh is barely seen and largely wasted as Sullivan's wife.  There's are whole scenes that go nowhere in particular (the wake scene, for instance) and seem intended to do nothing more than establish atmosphere.<br /> I could go on, but I'll simply say that considering the talent involved this was a big disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>This movie is so absolutely heartbreaking, the ending did nothing to lighten the mood of the film. Even so, Road to Perdition is a wonderful movie of how one mans decisions can decide the future of his family and those surrounding him.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is wonderful as the hitman working to feed his family while keeping his two boys from finding out what he does. Out of curiousity, the elder of the two decides to follow his father to work, just to discover the horrible truth of his work. To keep the secret safe, the boss's son is sent to kill the son, but ends up killing the younger son along with his mother. So begins a race to stay ahead of death and destruction, and Tom Hank's ultimate goal to save the soul of his son.<br /><br />Jude Law plays the crazy hitman who has a passion for photagraphing his dead victims to grace his walls, and who is sent after Micheal Sullivan and his son. What transpires between these three is the height and ending purpose to the entire movie. Sad, but with shades of hope as the sons life is forever changed for the better.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>After having made a career out of playing every kind of good guy character imaginable, Tom Hanks finally gets to strut his stuff as a bad guy - of sorts - in "The Road to Perdition," Sam Mendes' excellent follow-up to his Oscar-winning "American Beauty" from 1999.  Of course, no one is ever going to believe Hanks as a TOTAL villain and this fact works perfectly for the role he has been called upon to play here - that of Michael Sullivan, a family man with two young boys who also happens to work as a hit man for crime boss John Rooney, an aging father figure who raised Michael as one of his own.  Sullivan's children, Michael Jr. and Peter, are in the dark as to just what it is their father does for a living, but when the older boy, Michael, witnesses one of his dad's on-the-job hits one night, he ends up putting both his and his father's lives at risk.  Suddenly, the two become fugitives, trying to stay one step ahead of the mob while Michael Sr. works on exacting revenge from Rooney's son, Connor, who both tried to have both Michaels rubbed out and succeeded in killing Michael's wife and younger son in the process.  <p>"The Road to Perdition" deserves immense praise for featuring a less-than-savory figure as its central character.  Apart from the Hanks persona, which confers a certain automatic likeability factor onto this gangster protagonist, the film also builds the case in Michael's favor by having him be so much better than anyone else around him.  With the exception of the crime boss himself, Michael is the only one of the killers who seems to have even an iota of redeeming value to his character.  However, the film does not flinch from showing us the brutal harshness of the life fate has chosen for Michael, nor does it absolve Michael of the guilt he obviously must accept for the actions he performs.  Unlike many films, "The Road to Perdition" does not shy away from acknowledging the ... complexities of the character with which it is asking us to identify.  Our identification is, however, instantaneous with Michael Jr. who witnesses all this first hand and who, as events unfold, comes to understand a little something about the universal nature of father/son relationships, about the teaching and learning that takes place in the course of filial bonding, about a father's hope for a better life for his son, and about a father's instinctive need to fight for and protect his own flesh and blood even at the risk of his own life.  And Michael Sr. learns a thing or two as well about what fatherhood is really all about.  Ironically, these truths are also reflected to a certain extent in the chilling relationship between John and his own ruthless son, Connor.  These two relationships provide some intriguing parallels and contrasts which help to enrich the overall theme of the work.<p>Despite the fact that the film focuses on the growing relationship between a father and a son, Mendes never allows sentiment to take over.  The few scenes charting the growing bond between the two Michaels are kept low-keyed and subtle and the movie erupts frequently into shocking displays of graphic violence.  One scene, in particular, in which the older Michael is ambushed in a hotel room, is extraordinarily suspenseful, executed with assured, split-second timing by director Mendes and editor, Jill Bilcock.  Mendes shows himself to be a master of the subtle moment as well, since the other great scene in the film involves a late night chat between father and son, a near-wordless encounter that underlines the growing love and respect that father and son are developing for one another.  The quiet, hushed tone of the scene provides an effective counterpoint to all the rat-a-tat-tat moments that might otherwise have come to dominate the proceedings.<p>The performances could not be improved upon.  Hanks manages to be both stolid and emotionally vulnerable as the father who realizes that, although it may be too late to keep himself from going to "perdition," it is not too late to keep his son from making the same mistake.  Newman creates a stunning portrait of an old man who can seemingly operate on two contradictory levels at the same time: one as a man capable of immense warmth and filial devotion to those he cares for and the other as a man ruthless enough to maintain his grasp on the life he's made and the position of power he's attained at any and all costs.  Jude Law achieves a perfect creepiness as the steely-eyed, sadistic and psychotic hit man sent out to dispatch both Michael and his son.  But the real acting honors go to young Tyler Hoechlin who manages to upstage even these seasoned professionals as Michael Jr., conveying in his every move, gesture and facial expression the innate innocence, warmth and intelligence of this 12-year old boy.  Hoechlin understands the quiet power that can be achieved through a look and a glance.  Wisely, the film's writer, David Self, makes young Michael an almost completely reticent character.  Most of the learning and recognition that comes to Michael over the course of the film is reflected not in his words but in his face.  As a result, little Michael is a character who lingers long in one's memory, for he ends up making an indelible mark on one's heart. <p>Mendes does an exquisite job capturing the bleak nature of the film's early-`30's setting, although one could probably do without some of the rather improbable Bonnie and Clyde parallels that the story unfortunately wanders into.  Still, that is a minor complaint about a film that works on so many different levels simultaneously.  Beautifully crafted and brilliantly acted, "The Road to Perdition" is a quietly powerful film that draws us into its world in a most interesting and persuasive way.</p></br><a href="../users/AEVNUEDRGTC4P.html">AEVNUEDRGTC4P</a><br/><p>Road to Perdition is a pretty stiff flick.  It aspires to be an art house picture complete with pretentious cinematography.  It features a criminal father who tries to teach his son all the usual important life lessons that so many movies also teach.<br /><br />Road to Perdition is based on a "graphic novel" that is synonymous for a comic book that is expensive, long, pretentious and done in black and white.  This particular work purports to be based on real people, but in reality, the only things real about it is the names of the characters and the names of the places that it is set in.  Otherwise, both the original graphic novel and the movie that is based on it have zero connection to real history.<br /><br />Road to Perdition has the kind of illogical plotting, numerous murders, lack of real women, goofy psychology and a general lack of insight that so many other Hollywood crime flicks have.  Basically, this movie is an exercise in absurdity.<br /><br />For instance, in order to get a shot at the man who murdered most of his family, the killer hero (Tom Hanks) decides to try to force the Chicago mob of Al Capone to release the man by stealing from Capone.  In real life, Al Capone always struck back at those who stole from him.  He never negotiated with those who sought to torment him.  The real Capone would have made short work of Hanks's character.<br /><br />There are other unrealistic elements to Road to Perdition.  Real life gang killers are a hard drinking, hard living lot who beat their women and pay cold shrift to their children.  Tom Hanks's killer is a quiet, solemn man who is a devoted family man.  A real life serial killer would never, ever apologize to his nine year old son for missing his school concert.  Also, Jude Law's killer reporter character who kills people and then takes their photographs and sells them to newspapers is a villain who much better would fit in a Batman type movie than in the oh so realistic Road to Perdition.<br /><br />All in all, Road to Perdition is just another Hollywood crime flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I thought the pace was perfect. The movie is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks with perfection who is a sort of hitman/ killer working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He disslikes this job but does it because Rooney payed for his house and helps him financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But, his children are unaware that this is his job, and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him, he is placed in an awkward position. And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge. They rob abanks and much more and build a bond. They're the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always as well as Jude Law who plays his creepy role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Emotionally distant, this film's major characters didn't endear themselves in any way.  Even the ostensibly sympathetic characters are blank and unlikable.  Granted, we're dealing with gangsters and their immediate hirelings and bodyguards, but unlike, say, the Godfather saga, there was no one really compelling.  Hanks is a beloved husband, and hit-man, an amusing stretch I know.  He works for Irish mobster boss Paul Newman, Hanks' 12 year old boy sees a gangland hit he shouldn't forcing the two on the road after the murder of the rest of Hanks' family.  Hanks then wreaks revenge, seeking the death of Newman and his [Newman's] son who did it.  A pale version of the Japanese manga Lone Wolf and Cub, the story follows to its inexorable conclusion, especially factoring in a creepily balding Jude Law as the assassin hired to track down Hanks and terminate him.  There were some nice cinematic touches like the Tommy gun flashing out of the shadows during Hanks and Newman's final showdown in the rain.  Hanks trades in bland hero for bland bad guy and the story never really connects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>I can't say enough of how incredible this movie really is. It's absolute a riveting tale of what it truly was like for the criminal underworld. Many movies seem to glorify 1930s gangsters but Road To Perdition shows a much more real life point of view of how deadly life in the 1930s criminal underworld really was. WARNING: This movie is not for the faint at heart or the shallow-minded! The cover art of the movie trailer sets the overall mood of RTP: Dark, bleak and dramatic.  <p>The story is of a criminal gang leader whose organization is being torn apart because of his son Connor Rooney going on shooting sprees for no particular reason. The main charachter Mike Sullivan, played by the talented Tom Hanks, is a hitman who works for the elder Rooney(played by Paul Newman) who has to hunt down Connor after his wife & one of his sons is murdered. Sullivan Sr. also has to protect his older son and now only surviving child, Michael Sullivan Jr. and prevent him from living a life like his father is. Another villain, played by Jude Law, is a murderer who photographs his victims as they die and rejoices at the scene. Sullivan Sr & Sullivan Jr. drive around the country robbing banks while escaping the hitman played by Jude Law. <p>The conflicts in the movie truly bring out alot of emotions and create lots of suspense and emotions. The ending is very moving and will bring you to tears. <p>By far one of the best movies and it truly deserves getting at lease on Oscar Award.</p></br><a href="../users/A29IYGR7SNPRIV.html">A29IYGR7SNPRIV</a><br/><p>Everything about this film works perfectly. The lighting, the sets, the location, the clothes, every single detail is completely appropriate to the era (1931). The cast is a flawless blend of British and American actors, all of whom turn in beautifully controlled performances. It is a film completely devoid of false sentiment, even, in an odd way, of excessive violence. The climactic scene is done in an almost balletic silence, with only one spoken line. Scene after scene is framed and lit in a fashion that evokes Edward Hopper paintings. This is, above all else, a story about fathers and sons; actual father and sons, surrogate fathers and sons. Paul Newman is wonderful as the conflicted father of a reprobate son (played with great fidelity by British actor David Craig), torn between his love of Michael Sullivan, his son in spirit, and Connor, his son in fact.<p>Hanks offers a fine, controlled portrayal of a man betrayed by the father figure (Newman) to whom he believes he owes everything. And young Tyler Hoechlin is equally wonderful as Michael Junior. Jude Law, the ultimate chameleon performer, turns in a creepily effective performance as the photographer/killer hired to wipe out Hanks.<p>There are moments of great humor (Hanks teaching his twelve-year-old son to drive) and others of great joie de vivre (a Gaelic dance sequence at the wake that opens the film), and moments of classic fraternity--young Michael Jr. reading in bed by flashlight, being questioned, to his annoyance, by his younger brother.<p>There is so much to commend this film: the exquisite lighting, the tight editing, the perfect soundtrack, the casting, the directing. In short, everything. Don't miss this. Sam Mendes seems to be a young man who gets it right every time.<br />Most highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Dark, moody and tragic, ROAD TO PERDITION is a masterfully made and engrossing film.  Its most powerful scene is when Tom Hanks as the hitman Michael Sullivan takes out Paul Newman's hitmen on a raindrenched street; there is no dialogue, no accompanying soundtrack, just slowmotion of the shootings and the knowledge Newman has of what lies in store. It's ultimately chilling and fascinating in its execution.<br />Tyler Hoechlin shines as Michael's young son who witnesses his father at work in the execution of a member of Newman's brood.  Ciaran Hinds (so good in &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; and &quot;Sum of all Fears&quot;) is the victim; the killer is Newman's spoiled son, played well by Daniel Craig.  When Craig has Hanks' wife and youngest son murdered, this tale of vengeance spins into its ultimately tragic denouement.<br />Jude Law is frighteningly chilling in his portrayal of a photographer who loves to photograph the dead, and is hired to take out Hanks.  Stanley Tucci is superb as Frank Nitti, Al Capone's henchman.<br />Tom Hanks is excellent, too, as a father who hasn't taken the time to know his son, and whose life of killing catches up with him.  Watching him grow in his love for his son makes for some emotionally devastating scenes, and the ending is powerful.<br />ROAD TO PERDITION is first-class film making, beautifully filmed and scored.  I found it to be very moving.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>The movie is not your standard, &quot;Save the boy!&quot; type of flick.<p>The plot is new. There is alot happening, mostly a gangster\hitman(Tom Hanks) who is supposedly a hit for another hitman. He decides to take his son along, who we find out has a bad relationship with his father in the long run.<p>The best thing about this movie is the acting. Tom Hanks plays his part well, and we come to like him as a solemn, not so much stoic, but humble man. His son is the farmer type, as seen in the movie. His son is also a bit, well he is naive. I can't describe him in one paragraph.<p>The action is good. There are plenty of gun fights, some cars, and the occasional shoot em up action scene. But then theres the end. The movie rolls straight up a hill, and stays that way. I loved the ending as much as the middle of the movie. The beggining is good, but don't stop watching the movie till' the end.<br />Overall---&gt;5 Stars<br />  ___P??f???___</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>This would have been a great film had it not been for Tom Hanks.  Sorry Tom, but you just can't pull-off playing the heavy, not here at least.  Hanks certainly has proven himself as a competent actor in past films like &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;Castaway,&quot; but here I can't buy him either as a concerned father or an inner-circle gangster.  Perhaps he was hoping to shed some of his heroic underdog persona for something more enigmatic and dark, but it doesn't work here.<p>Jude Law, on the otherhand, is delightfully menacing.  The rest of the cast holds their own as well.  The writing and the themes work despite Hanks' performance.  I would love to see this remade with a less well-known and indentifiable lead.</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>I mean it's no masterpiece, but it's a really good movie.  Tom Hanks has been better many times, and is quite frankly miscast as a big old tough guy.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, well, she's my favorite actress (Unite ladies!), but it's unusual that she doesn't have a few more scenes.  I keep forgetting my favorite actress is in this movie.<p>Jude Law and Paul Newman literally walk away with this movie.  I'm not sure why Jude wasn't nominated alongside Newman, after all he was nominated for Mr. Ripley a few years ago.  But Newman dominates this movie with his gruff old-timer persona.  What a legend, and a real rare gentleman from what I'm told.<p>This is an Oscar winning film, as the stunning cinematography was recognized.  And rightly so, because this is a beaut.  For weird reasons, the sound was nominated which is kind of silly because the movie is so quiet I found myself lulled to sleep in some of the boring spots (trust me, there are a few).  <p>I hate special features on dvds, so I was glad to see that there are not many included on this release.  They are just a waste of time and I never view them.  Why would I want to hear somebody talk while I watch the movie?  Commentary tracks are annoying, and that's not just my opinion.  I put this one on for about 3 minutes, just to hear how pretentious Sam Mendes British accent is.  And it certainly is.  If you really want to watch this movie in style, get some Newman's Own snacks like his awesome Orange chocolate chip cookies, which I understand he personally supervises.<p>This movie is not ever going to be looked at as a classic of the gangster genre, and the violence is unfortunately subdued.  Ever since Goodfellas gave us such in-your-face bloodiness, it has become a contest to see who can really top the gore quotient.  Well, this one falls far short and will likely leave hard-core gangster film fans very dissapointed.  But the music is almost enough to make up for it, and was deservedly nominated for an Oscar (AKA Academy Award).<p>A fool will buy this, but a real smart person will rent it, maybe more than once over time.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>No! This definately is not another Bob Hope/Bing Crosby Road picture.  I was very disappointed by this Tom Hanks/Paul Newman movie.  I will say that Tyler Hoechlin did a fine performance and I hope we will see him in other films as he becomes mature as an actor.  It was good to see Paul Newman in a movie again even though he does play a "heavy".  Seeing Tom Hanks as a "heavy"/father sends chills up my spine, however one of his early films, he did play a murderer.  It was a terrible movie to watch, but it did hold my interest.  The DVD contains many deleted scenes which I thought some should have been included in the film.  Many scenes with Jennifer Jason Leigh were cut out.  Interesting production notes.  Best to watch this film in the standard version.<br /><br />  Tyler Hoechlin went on to be a regular in the tv series, "7th Heaven" (1996-2007) as "Martin Brewer" from 2003-07. Recently in Hall Pass (2011) and is in the MTV tv series, Teen Wolf.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>I am bewildered by the unanimous positive critical response to this movie. It's "The Godfather" meets "Father Knows Best" with a virtual bloodbath of gangster executions warmed over by a "Dad, can we have a man to man talk" mentality. The director screams "PERIOD PIECE!" with exquisitely manicured 1930s set designs that upstage the crummy little story of a boy being taken under the wing of his viscious but kindly gangster father. Jude Law playing a profiteering hitman/photographer is the only redemption here, his deranged characterization is the true spirit of this movie. I would have much preferred watching his life story for over two hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I've read a lot of reviews for this movie stating that it is an excellent film and some even call it one of the best movies of all time.  I couldn't disagree more.  I found this film to be a disappointment.  Tom Hanks & period-gangster style films just don't go together.  When I see Tom Hanks, I see him in Big.. not as a serious actor.  In "Road To Perdition" Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a born and bred gangster in the 1930's, who is forced to abandon his lifestyle when his wife and one of his sons are killed and he is forced to protect the elder son, a witness of a killing.  The story does leave something to be desired. Predictable and hackneyed plot, with pretty weak story development.  I'm a big fan of movies like the Godfather & Goodfellas but this one just plain stinks.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>When you bring together such talent as Paul Newman, Tom Hanks and Jude Law, it is almost expected that the movie will be a masterpiece.  Tom Hanks alone, whose body of work includes such incredible performances as Philidelphia, Forrest Gump and Castaway, is an exceptional talent whose abilities are unmatched in Hollywood today.  He possesses the rare gift of truly suspending disbelief by completely immersing himself in the role he plays.<p>In this film, Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a hit-man working under the thumb of John Rooney (Paul Newman), a powerful crime-lord operating in a rural Illinois town during the early 1930's.  When Sullivan and Conner Rooney (Daniel Craig) are sent on a &quot;hit&quot;, Sullivan's son Michael (Tyler Hoechlin) tags along, concealed in the rear of his father's car.  When he witnesses a murder, he is discovered by Connor and his father, and is sworn to secrecy.<p>John Rooney is enraged at Conner, whose actions went against his father's intent, and he publicly humiliates him while embracing Sullivan as the son he never had, and so Conner exacts revenge out of jealousy, taking out a hit on Sullivan and his family, again acting against his father.<p>Conner succeeds in killing Sullivan's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and youngest son, but misses both Sullivan and Michael junior.  Upon the discovery of his wife and son's murder, Sullivan vows vengance for their deaths and sets out to find Connor and John Rooney, who have now gone into hiding under the protection of a powerful crime lord in Chicago.  When Rooney learns of Sullivan's intent, he unwillingly contracts a hit-man (Jude Law) to eliminate Sullivan.<p>From this synopsis, one might deduce that this is simply another mob movie, in league with such films as Good Fellas or perhaps even the Godfather.  But what makes this a great film isn't its similarities to the other forementioned classics, but its bold stance to humanize the face of a mobster.  Hank's character is likeable, exhibiting a humanity and a vulnerability not normally portrayed in the hit-man stereotype.  He isn't simply a goon in a fedora and black trench, but a father and husband, whose resolve is shattered when he loses the people closest to him.  His relationship with his son is a pivotal part of the plot, as he must balance his hunger for revenge with the need to protect his boy.<p>Paul Newman also brings a level of depth to the movie which makes him a complicated and difficult character, someone audiences will both pity and hate, and he is played with a level of intelligence and believability that makes him a delight to watch. <p>The ending is a little disappointing, and, though I won't spoil it, I will say that it left this reviewer a little let down.  As Hollywood directors have become infamous for doing, there is a suprise ending that, though plausable, adds little to the story, save for the fact that it brings closure to the story's precept that the narrator states in the beginning of the film.<p>Still, this film deserves the highest rating that I gave it.  It is a first class collection of performances built on a very engaging storyline of power and corruption in 1930's mob manipulated America.  <p>Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>the hype when this was released had this as one of the big movies of the year, but for once the public caught on and this silly thing has disappeared from consciousness.  tom hanks continues the downward arc of his career, and paul newman is utterly unconvincing as the patriarch of a crime organization.  what pretends to be a metaphor for the american family is little more than a 2 hour yawnfest; watch "the godfather" for the 27th time instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I suppose Tom Hanks and Paul Newman signed on for this wreck in the wake of Medes' Oscar winning "American Beauty."  I have to wonder what they thought when they viewed the outcome.  Yikes!  Each of these men is so charming, if left alone, it takes some effort to make them look as bad as they did here.  Newman gets away with more because he is still so handsome and he doesn't have as many scenes as Hanks.  Hanks' method of acting here is to furrow his brown (see the DVD cover) and never let it unfurrow for the rest of the film.  When he shoots people his brow is furrowed, when he gets shot, his brow is furrowed, when he is hugged by his son, his brow is furrowed...you get the picture.<br /><br />The cinemetography is striking but even that looks overly pretentious in this callow, stupid film.  Mendes has greatly over-reached here and he failed big time.<br /><br />I have to say a word for Daniel Craig who does a very good job as the bad son.  Jude Law, a favorite of mine, is so creepy that he's laughable.  He does a wonderfully elegant fall though.  The ending, supposedly a heartwarmer, does little to make up for all the bloodletting that you have to sit through to get to it.  Maybe just fast forward to the last two minutes...and spare yourself the rest.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>There's a star-studded cast in this film, directed by Sam Mendes of "American Beauty" fame.  And there's some excellent cinematography.  It's about gangsters in the 1930s, with emphasis on father-son relationships.  I was prepared to enjoy it. I didn't.<p>The story takes place in 1931, and Tom Hanks is cast as a mob enforcer who works for the boss, played by Paul Newman.  When Hanks' 12-year old son, Tyler Hoechlin, is witness to what his father does, the plot is set in motion.  There are tragedies galore as each character meets an awful fate, some at the hands of Jude Law, cast as a killer who photographs his victims.  With high drama like that, I should have been sitting on the edge of my seat instead of yawning and looking at my watch.<p>The cast tried, they really did.  All the acting is wonderful.  But the screenplay moved too slowly.  And the director had most of the scenes take place in the rain or snow or bitter cold.  It was all heavy stuff, without a bit of lightness.  I never did identify with any of them, as they just were a little too soaked in tragedy to be real.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Speilberg ruined it. That is quite a comment isn't it given that Speilberg is only credited as part of the Dreamworks team which produced this picture. The fact is that the man's hands are all over this one in the same way that he "directed" Poltergeist - but didn't. Speilberg has often been accused of using too much "over-sentimentality" in his films. I would semi-agree with this analysis but it doesn't show through too often which is fine - except here in this picture that is dripping and oozing sentimentality from every single frame. I am sorry but this film is tugging at heart strings from the word go and is pulling every trick in the book to try and get the emotional out of you. It reaches a point about twenty minutes into the film where you just say - "Okay, okay I get it, now please, the story, move on with that and some character development, thank you." - but Speilberg is there behind an Oscar-begging Mendes (isn't one Oscar enough??) saying "Go on boy you can do it, tug those strings, more! More! Pluck `em till they have a stroke!"<p>The fact is that this film does so much on the sentimentality front that it is not just annoying, but downright damaging to the movie and everyone who has anything to do with it. It is a misfire in direction, acting and production. How can you take a great story, a great concept, and flat out destroy it from frame to frame by seeing how much sentimentality the audience can take. Even the "Junkie sentimentality Oscar committee" are going to barf at all the cheese - and they did. They snubbed this movie because it obviously stood there before them saying - come on gimme the gold! AND IT DOES JUST THAT! How embarrassing! There is nothing worse than begging for an Oscar and boy does it beg!<p>It simply does not make any sense that no one in the studio said - "Hey, listen guys Don't you think we should tone down on the old sentimentality here for a moment because it is extremely distracting?&quot; It seems that no one even considered that this piece of cinema was about to go to mush under all the mushyness. Road to Perdition IS the undisputed champion of cheese. It sets the benchmark in cheese to which all other cheesy movies will be measured against. <p>I can not emphasize how the plot - something about a hitman and his son avenging the death of his family - is killed flat out after twenty minutes of sentimentality. Do you like the way I use the world sentimentality over and over again in this review? Doesn't all the sentimentality just burn it out? Are you tired yet of all the sentimentality? Do get the picture? It is so bad that it even KILLS Newman's fantastic performance, the astonishing cinematography and the set design. It just drowns it all in a sea of fake tears.<p>Avoid like the plague unless you are a sentimentality sponge of epic absorption properties. It goes to show that even the best in the business can still fail to understand what makes the audience tick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>I knew it was a bad sign when I kept glancing at the DVD timer while watching this.  The pacing of the film is so incredibly slow that a person can take extended bathroom or snack breaks, leave the film playing, and not miss substantive plot developments.  After the first hour, I know I did!<p>Hanks' sensitive gangster is about the only glimmer of interest in this otherwise lackluster film that is so in love with its visuals that it forgets to include more than a rudimentary plot.  A forgettable film in many respects.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>I was enthusiastic about seeing this film.  The cast and story really held a lot of promise, and reviews I had read up to that point were promising.<p>While it was a text book 'good film,' I just couldn't buy Tom Hanks as an assassin.  I certainly don't fault Hanks for this, but the way the character was written, I didn't see much opportunity to develop that aspect of a redemptive-cold blooded killer.  If this premise doesn't work for the main character, suspending disbelief for the rest of the film is a little difficult as well.<p>And the pacing.  While it's not a lightening-charged piece of entertainment, the pace is slow and methodical.  But sometimes it gets so slow that your mind is given ample opportunity to wander.  A well-constructed film doesn't give you the chance to do that.  I felt this could have easily lost 30 minutes and been better for it.<p>I can't give this a hearty recommendation, but if you insist, it's not a bad film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>When Michael Sullivan's son and wife are murdered, Michael takes it too personal.<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a very credible gangster from the 1930s and is supported by the strong but not too lengthy appearances of Paul Newman and Daniel Craig (who went on to become the newest 007 James Bond).<br /><br />Although set in the 1930s the style is modern and the sequences paced to entertain.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>I have spent a lot of time in this space writing about my corner boy experiences growing up in my old Irish and Italian working class neighborhood in the late 1950s and early 1960s. I have also spent some time talking about the corner boys who just immediately preceded us in the early 1950s. Pretty tame really although if you were on the receiving end of a vicious beating, got your money stolen in some back alley, or had your personal household possessions ransacked or stolen by some midnight shifter your perspective might not be so romantic. The "corner boys," Irish and Italian mainly, of 1930s Great Depression Chicago though, as portrayed in the film under review, The Road to Perdition, make all that other stuff seem "punk" by comparison.<br /><br />Of course the motives to join a gang of lumpenproletarians in all cases were the same then, and today. That is "where the money was" to paraphrase the old-time famous bank robber, Willy Sutton. No question all those guys in the 1930s and later were (and are) from hunger. But also looking for the quick dollar and the "no heavy lifting" life not associated with steady working class factory every day values. Equally true is the fact that there are always more "hungry" guys than the market can bear which leads to two things-external "turf wars" between gangs and internal turf wars over who controls what within gangs. And that is the heart of this story.<br /><br />The problem for Tom Hanks, a trusted, very trusted, enforcer (read: "hit man") for Irish mob boss Paul Newman (he of many such corner boy roles going back to Cool Hand Luke and before) is that Newman's psychotic son wants his share of the goodies as befits a son and heir apparent. Needless to say that things get dicey, very dicey as they maneuver to the top, including the gangland-style execution of Hanks' family that was suppose to include a son, the narrator of the film, who is forced to help Hanks' seek the inevitable revenge required by the situation. In the end though Tom Waits is right in the opening line from Jersey Girl- "Ain't got no time for the corner boys, down in the streets making all that noise." A nice cinematically-pleasing 1930s period piece and what turned out to be a great farewell performance by the late Paul Newman.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I feel really sad for Sam Mendes.  I guess I really shouldn't, since he won a Directing Oscar on his first shot out the box in 1999, but in this particular case I feel really bad for him.  Much like the Coen brothers in 1990, Sam Mendes made a wonderful Gangster movie that was trampled over by an inferior one; both by Martin Scorsese.  Sure, `Road to Perdition' is no `Miller's Crossing' (which is a masterpiece), but then again `Gangs of New York' is far from `GoodFellas'.  Truth be told though, `Road to Perdition' is much more controlled, complete and enjoyable than that scattered mess Scorsese campaigned for a Best Picture nomination.<br /><br />The film centers on Michael Sullivan, a strong arm for an Irish mob in depression era Chicago.  When his son, Michael Jr., witnesses a murder he becomes a liability, one that John Rooney, Michael's boss, can't allow.  When Michael's wife and youngest son are murdered at the hands of his `family' Michael and his Michael Jr. travel down the road of revenge, vowing to set matters straight.<br /><br />But it is far from an easy journey.<br /><br />Emotionally, `Road to Perdition' has a lot going for it.  It is a film bent on exploiting the contradictions between the life of a mobster and the life of a father.  Michael Sullivan is a man going to hell, but his only desire is that his son makes it to heaven.  While it seems like a simple enough morale, the way in which Mendes transfers it is deeply moving.<br /><br />But the film, above all else, is a technical marvel.<br /><br />`Road to Perdition' is visually stunning, a sublime directorial piece by Mendes.  It reminds me a lot of his recent `Revolutionary Road' in the way he was able to really connect with the era, not just the story.  Everything is so clean and so authentic; from the cars to the d&eacute;cor of the homes to the look of the skin on the man you are staring at.  Everything about this film lives and breathes the era Mendes was attempting to capture.  The score and the glorious set pieces also help in that regard.  Another testament to Mendes's impressive direction is the performances he gets from the ENTIRE cast.  This is one of the strongest ensembles of the year, for each and every player, no matter how small, adds so much to their scenes.  One that is truly impressive is Hanks, who I am vocally NOT a fan of.  What I really appreciated about his performance was the way he very slowly came out of his dark shell.  It was such a realistic and ultimately heartbreaking transition because we saw him become a father for the first time.  This had a lot to do, I'm sure, with Mendes's instructions, and his pacing of the film (while some may find it slow) truly helped establish this man's emotional journey.<br /><br />Hanks is not the only star here though, as I mentioned, everyone is great.  Paul Newman is the films standout, without question.  His paternal conflictions are so reaching and so moving, especially as the film draws to a close.  Jude Law is a horrific mental image who never fades away (giving me chills right now) and Daniel Craig took advantage of his personal charm in creating an arrogant child in a man's body.  Even bit parts like Stanley Tucci's or Jennifer Jason Leigh's or Anthony LaPaglia (who was cut from the film only to make his way back if you catch the right `version') are all spot on.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, this is no `Miller's Crossing'.  The film, while great and far better than Scorsese's overhyped disaster, is not perfect.  I personally did not like the subplot involving the bank robberies and actually found the bizarre approach to those scenes almost off-putting.  They construed the eerie vibe the film was maintaining by trying too hard to insert a comedic edge.  Thankfully it was short-lived, but it is there and that upsets me.  I actually could have gone with a little more length in the film as well; maybe a few more scenes fleshing out the relationship budding between father and son.  I think that it would have aided the film in comparing the relationship between Michael and his son with the relationship between Michael and Rooney, who was obviously a father figure.<br /><br />The film is still stunning in many areas and a very, very engrossing and entertaining film.  I highly recommend this to any fan of the genre or the actors or the director (I am really impressed with his small yet diversified resume), for they are all at the top of their games.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was surprisingly good given that it's based on a graphic novel, so I didn't expect it to have the depth and subtlety of something based on a novel. But it's a fine movie nevertheless. And a movie starring both Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, as well as Jude Law, is certainly one to make one sit up and take notice from the standpoint of the cast.<br /><br />The movie chronicles the fall from grace of Mike Sullivan, a hit man working for a local mob boss, played by Paul Newman. Sullivan's life up till then has been a priviledged one, especially for the Depression era--his family lives in the biggest house on the block, and he is relatively prosperous. He is said to be respected by his cronies and a couple of times people in the movie compliment him on his doing "good work." But despite his esteemed position in the mob, Sullivan's life starts to unravel as a result of one unfortunate event, caused by his boy, which wasn't his fault. Now Sullivan is the hunted victim, who eventually returns to wreak his vengeance. At that point the danger lurking beneath the otherwise highly polished surface of his comfortable life becomes evident. The movie is really another variation on the theme of those who live sword eventually die by the sword.<br /><br />The DVD discusses the making of the film and includes a lot of extra footage with many deleted scenes, probably 8 or 10, more than I've seen on most DVDs. Some fans of the movie might be interested in all this missing material. I watched most of them just to see what was edited out. Also there are comments on the making of the movie that I found interesting.<br /><br />For example, the costume designer had an especially hard time duplicating the clothing of the period, which was the early 30s. He said that they had trouble finding good examples from the period, and that the style of the time was sort of plain compared to what came before during the Roaring Twenties and after. They also couldn't find the right sort of heavy cloth used at the time. They finally found a manufacturer who was able to do a special order for them so it was basically custom made for the movie.<br /><br />The movie was shot on location in Chicago, using some historic locations, and in the Illinois countryside. I was born in Chicago so I had a little interest in that. Most of the movie is shot in winter, and one time they were actually shooting in 30 below zero and everyone was freezing. Overall a fine movie that does justice to the original graphic book.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>Great movie falls shorts of my expectations<br /><br />This was a great movie don't get me wrong but the critics made it to be like the godfather (not many movies are). Never the less Tom Hanks and Paul Newman turn in class A performances but the films best perfomances are made by Jude Law as the Hitman/photographer and by Tyler Hoechlin as Tom Hank's son. The Cinematography was superb, they did a magneficent job recreating depression era Chicago.

Also, it is very much about a father's relantionship with his son.  Tom Hanks is very effective as the Irish mob hitman.  You can truly believe he is this great family guy, but also that he is capable of doing such terrible things.  Paul Newman also is very good in his role as the boss.  Well crafted and directed.  Check out the original graphic novel of the same name by Max Allan Collins if you would like to see the differance from paper to screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This film is an enigma to me.  It has all the elements of a great film yet ultimately it has no resonance for me.  Tom Hanks is excellent as the hitman on the run from his former employers.  Paul Newman, in the twilight of a great career, is even better as the mob boss.  The few scenes that Hanks and Newman share are pure cinematic dynamite.  Tyler Hoechlin as Hanks' young son is a natural.  Jude Law delivers another good character performance as the hired gun/free-lance photographer.  In smaller roles Daniel Craig, Dylan Baker, and Stanley Tucci also do good work.  The direction by Sam Mendes is crisp and the story moves pretty good.  The art direction and the cinematography are breathtaking.  I think ultimately why this film fails to achieve greatness is that at it's heart it is a cold one.  Despite the efforts of the top-notch talent in front of the camera and behind it they cannot muster enough empathy for a story that involves heartless gangsters.  These criticisms aside, the film is worth checking out for all the things that do work.  This film is a disappointment, not a failure.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Road to Perdition, based on the 1998 graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, is the first film for director Sam Mendes since his Academy Award winning film, American Beauty. The film is also a first for one of its stars, Tom Hanks. As promoted by Dreamworks Pictures, this is the first time where you see Tom Hanks as a villain in a feature film. Tom Hanks alone should be a big draw for many moviegoers but who can argue with world of marketing. The film also features some other big stars outside of Tom Hanks. They would include Paul Newman, who worked The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and Jude Law, whose works include A.I. and Enemy at the Gates. But will these big stars be a big enough draw to have moviegoers sit through a depressing gangster film?<p>The story that Michael Sullivan is caring and loving husband and father. Set in early 1930's in the city of Chicago, Sullivan works for Mr. John Rooney. Michael never had a father, so Rooney raised him as his own and taught him the ropes of the business he was involved with. Now all grown up and having a family of his own, Sullivan's life changes in many dramatic ways. His oldest son, curious of what his father does for a living, sneaks into the back of his car the night of one of his jobs. The young boy witnesses the accidental murder a man and discoveries that he father is part of the mob. Sullivan assures Rooney that the boy will remain silent but the mob is not so sure. To secure silence they murder Sullivan's wife and other son. This sends Michael Sullivan on an unpredictable journey to the town of Perdition as he tries to save the life of his son and seek revenge on the people he once called family. Road to Perdition's story is very well done though long. The film has plenty of gunfight sequences but for long stretches there are moments that just seem long and boring with continuous talking. Not to say the dialogues is bad, not at all, but to say that there seems to be too much in certain areas.<p>The acting is top notch in Road to Perdition with the all-star cast advertised very prominently. Tom Hanks performs exceptionally well, as usual. I do not agree that his character is actually a villain in the film. How is he a villain when he tries to save the life of his son? Just because he is a gangster makes him a villain? One can make an argument for either side but it can be said there is a middle ground for his character. Paul Newman gives one of his best performances as the head of a mobster family. His lines are probably the most memorable in the entire film not because of where they are featured but for the emotion he uses to say those lines. Jude Law is well placed as the "Reporter", though I believe his character wasn't as necessary as most of the other characters in the film. Other supporting characters were well done but not hugely outstanding in the film.?<p>Road to Perdition is a good film but not a great film. It is a film that is just a normally good popcorn flick and nothing beyond that. The dialogue was good and the story was interesting but there are some conflicts with what happens in the film. Most of the characters in the film are gangsters and know they are involved in a life of murder and greed but when bad things happen, they seem all shocked that it is happening to them. You weren't expecting that? Also, some of the characters, including the boy who plays the son of Michael Sullivan, seem pretty dull and don't really do anything to show a hugely exceptional performance. Another problem was the relationship between Sullivan and his son. You don't really get to see much closeness between the two and yet in the end, they both seem to be on good terms. There were some signs but not a huge lot. Outside of those small scrabbles, the film is very well presented especially with the beautiful sets and the great use of cinematography. Road to Perdition should at least be checked out on DVD or VHS once for its artistic merit.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movies of 2002. Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is an enforcer in a 1930's Irish mob, led by kingpin, John Rooney (Paul Newman). Things are somber yet smooth until Sullivan's son witnesses a hit. The status quo is destroyed. No one is really comfortable with Sullivan's son being alive to tell the tale, yet Sullivan is like a son to his boss, John Rooney. Thus the conflict and the engine that drives the movie forward. <p>This is really a beautifully done movie in about every respect. The first striking thing is Tom Hanks cast as an Irish hit man. There is something about Tom Hanks that is mesmerizing on the screen, something extremely watchable. After enjoying him in different roles, like in Saving Private Ryan and Castaway and particularly this role, the best way to describe this quality is there is a depth of thought present in Hanks at all times, combined with a complete natural quality in front of the camera. It is a great piece of casting, setting Hanks against type as a man of violence, and it works in spades. Paul Newman has the role of a lifetime as John Rooney, "son of the old sod" and gang leader. Newman brought just the right blend of authority, power, and Irish melancholy to the role. The relationship between Sullivan and Rooney seems so believable, so understated and sincere, it is one of the most moving things about the movie. <p>This film is about fathers and sons, and there are three father/son relationships at stake here: Sullivan and his son, Rooney and his son (played with crazed zeal by Daniel Craig), and finally the relationship between the boss and his prime enforcer. In character parts, Stanley Tucci brings his usual dignity to the mix as  Frank Nitti, and Jude Law is creepy and nearly unrecognizable as Maguire, the contract killer sent to deal with Sullivan and son. <p>The other striking thing for me was the interesting and unique way the film dealt with violence. Nearly all the violence was off screen or just out of shot. The blood squirting plasma-sacs were at a minimum in this movie, and the scenes were so much more powerful for it. It particular, the Tommy Gun scene, where Hanks uses this weapon from the shadows (those that have seen the film will know which scene I mean) was shot with no sound except the musical soundtrack. Hank's gun just produces a strobe of silent flashes from the darkness. I believe this scene just as innovative as any of Sam Peckinpaw's "ballet of death" scenes from the late 60's and 70's. A great film with a gripping, well-rounded story. Clean and perfect all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>You just KNOW this movie can't end happily ever after, and of course you would be right. But even knowing the inevitable outcome doesn't prevent or can't stop you from watching each additional step down the road to perdition.<br />Tom Hanks is a good enough actor to rise above his real and personified usual casting as a good boy; in this movie, he's the hit man for a mobster, but he's also a loving husband and father. Things in his life and that of his family go horribly wrong when his son sees a mob execution and realizes what his father really does.<br />Paul Newman just doesn't make a bad movie, and this is no exception. He plays the aging but still powerful Capo di Tutti Capi, faced with terrifyingly divided loyalties between the weak and useless son who is his by blood, and Hanks, the strong and loyal 'son' who is his by love, affection, and admiration.<br />Horrific scenes of bloodshed, but even more difficult to watch is the inevitable erosion of love and respect between Hanks and Newman as they both ultimately realize that blood is thicker than water.<br />Spectacular, and there's a great cameo bit by Jude Law playing the creepy weird sort of groupie photographer of crime scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVNA57PI4DLV.html">ACVNA57PI4DLV</a><br/><p>Road to Perdition has the spirit of a film noir : put a character in a bind, and then watch as he tries to get out and sinks himself further and further. There is some attraction to that kind of material. Here it is brainless, contrived, violent and ultimately uninteresting (apart from Hanks' plan to rob banks in a rather unorthodox way). Its esthetics, however, is quite colorful : it may not be a very interesting movie, but it's really beautiful. <p>Tom Hanks, as an Irish mafia hitman, is dependable as usual. The movie is wonderfully acted, and the visuals, as Ebert says, are &quot;a limbo of darkness, shadow, night, fearful faces half-seen, cold and snow&quot;. One could not hope more from Sam Mendes' direction (who also did American Beauty). The problem is that there is no story behind it. As we watch it, the painful truth that no one will survive this ordeal is obvious, and we only wait in apprehension for the loud bullet shots to end it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>Set in the Winter if 1931, ROAD TO PERDITION is director Sam Mendes' follow up to his Oscar winning AMERICAN BEAUTY. ROAD TO PERDITION is based on a graphic novel written by Max Allan Collins and illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner.<br />In a fine departure from his usual roles Tom Hanks plays ruthless gangster Michael Sullivan, who finds his life turned upside down when his son Michael Jr (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses a bloody murder in which he was an accomplice. As if this isn't bad enough Sullivan also soon finds his own "Family" have issued orders for a hit on him. ("This house is not our home anymore. It's just an empty building" Hanks tells his son). This leads father and son on a cross country trip to evade their pursuers where Michael Sr discovers he may have a chance to turn his life around.<br />Paul Newman deserves a mention as he is sensational as Hanks's father and mentor. He just seems to get better with age. There are a couple of bloody sequences, especially at the climax; but ROAD TO PERDITION is basically a film about loyalty and redemption. The pace is a bit slow in parts but Conrad L. Hall's stunning cinematography more than makes it for it. Well worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Road To Perdition" is a fine Saturday matinee for adults; it's appealing as a gangster potboiler, and, if choose to seek a little longer, it's appealing intellectually. I think of the Coen Brothers' "Miller's Crossing," a stylish movie only enjoyable on the first level and not the second, whereas this vehicle has deeper and darker shades upon which to ruminate.<p> Tom Hanks is a hitman and Paul Newman is his local mob boss in 1920s Illinois, a state run by the Capone crime family in Chicago. Hanks has two sons and a wife, and Newman has his son and is a widow. Newman's son, Connor (Daniel Craig) was born with a brutal streak mixed with a grown boy's petulance. You put a gun in the hands of a man like that, and innocent heads will roll. <p> They do, sure enough, and all would be well if one of Hanks' son weren't there to see it. Connor wants the kid dead, Hanks dead, the whole family dead. He settles for two of the four. Hanks and son are forced on the road to survive, bond and plot a means of vengeance. Newman hires a traveling hitman, played by Jude Law, to track down Hanks and son.<br /><br />Now, onto the deeper, darker shades:<br /><br /> 1. The movie works, I think, if you understand Hanks' character is essentially na?ve; that is, he fails to understand the ingrained violence in his business -- yes, even though he is a hitman -- and what it might mean for even a man who does his job well. It's hardly fair that, when Hanks asks for Capone's help, assistant Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci) has to turn him down despite not wanting to. That's the illogic of the mafia; it consistently does things adverse to its well-being to stay in lockstep with its quirky "code." In this significant way it differs, say, a government. <p> Hanks does not play a smart man. He is a simpleton, actually; once he understands the low odds, his recourse is just to kill them all. It's his only recourse, but a smarter man might have tried other things. It's important to note that pleading to Capone is not another thing, but a false illusion Hanks' character initially has.<p> 2. You have to accept the Greek tragedy structure. Law's character, essentially, is death, and he waits at the end of the movie as if he was always going to be there. He haunts the film. His own death is appropriate, because death will manifest itself in someone different. Law's character was merely a vessel. This idea is considered nicely in our introduction to the character; Law walks toward us and stays oddly in proportion with his surroundings; an optical trick by Conrad Hall, it's as if Law is entering from the netherworld.<p> The tragedy structure also explains the things that are inexplicable. Why Newman would protect his worthless son, for example. Normally, mafia sons are expendable, especially in movies; consider "The Godfather, Part II."<br /><br /> 3. This is the best looking film of the year. Couldn't you just spend a week haunting all the sets in this film? I'd like to credit director Sam Mendes, and I will, but only because he allowed the cinematographer, the departed Conrad L. Hall, the freedom to be a virtuoso. Hall simply understands the camera; the overhead angle that opens the Tommy gun scene is obviously his idea, as is Law entrance.<p> When awards time rolled around, "Road To Perdition" was overlooked, maybe because the story was a bit much. But its place on the list of many movie fans will linger, because there's much to ponder. In retrospect, this should have been a winter release, where it could reaped, oh, eight to ten nominations. What we have will have to do, but this was an outstanding film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Around the time in which Perdition is set (1931). Robinson ( Little Caesar), Cagney (Public Enemy) and Muni (Scarface) were making the mold for the gangster picture which Bogart, Raft, Ladd, Widmark, and many others filled with their particular style and talents. Here we have truly 1931 brutality in a studied 2002 manner. In a supporting role (though receiving star billing), Paul Newman gives an Actors Master Class performance, Tom Hanks, the star, bulked up to increase his menace, subdues it to businesslike killing, while the rest of the cast is exceptionally good. Costuming is effectively period, while the music enhances the  unrolling plot at every point. While nothing is outside the stereotypes set by 1931, the plot and tone of the film are redolent of the contemporary mood. If the genre appeal to you, this is a worthwhile way to spend your time.</p></br></body></html>

The casting of relative unknowns at the time was daring but it paid off with fine performances from Australians Guy Pierce and Russell Crowe.  Kim Basinger fully deserved her Oscar for her work and special mention has to be made for James Cromwell's work too.<br /><br />As for the blu-ray itself while the picture and sound quality aren't reference-grade as far as the best I've ever seen in 1080p they are still very good and together with the excellent special feature documentaries does make this a great way to view a true film classic.<br /><br />Recommended for all fans of great film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>This was the best film made in '97 but like "Chinatown," another noir, it is destined to become one of the finest movies not to take the Oscar home. Curtis Hanson took James Ellroy's novel, a book many doubted could be translated to the film medium, and crafted one of the finest adapted screenplays ever written. He then brought on board a couple of Aussie unknowns, a gorgeous star who had never lived up to her potential, and one of the finest actors working in film today. He then began filming one of the darkest noir films of all time in the blinding L.A. sun.<br /><br />The end result is a dark and twisted tale of personal redemption told against the backdrop of the bright lights and sunshine of Hollywood in the early 1950's. Hanson contrasted the brightly lit exteriors with Ellroy's dark storyline of police corruption and Hollywood decadence. This is a movie about facade, not just Hollywood's but our own personal front as well.<br /><br />Russell Crowe became a star as Detective Bud White, a tough cop willing to do whatever was necessary, which was in stark contrast to his politically minded colleague Guy Pearce. He finds Bud archaic, representing everything about the force he wants to change. What may stop him from doing so is his investigation into the murder of several people at The Night Owl cafe, one of whom is Crowe's partner, kicked off the force after a well publicized jail brawl christened given the handle "Bloody Christmas" by the papers.<br /><br />Crowe and Pearce come at it from different angles but the road for both leads right to beautiful Kim Basinger and a millionaire in the lush Hollywood hills played by David Strathairn. There is a reason Basinger looks a little like Veronica Lake the first time we see her in this film; she's supposed to. Hollywood legend has it that a string of expensive call girls were cut to look like stars during the 1940's and early 1950's and Hanson has made this darker side of Hollywood part of the story. Basinger is one of the lucky ones; close enough to the actual look of Veronica Lake not to have been cut on.<br /><br />Crowe falls for the real girl inside Basinger, but in spite of her opulent lifestyle, her low self-esteem comes to the forefront when she sleeps with Pearce in an attempt to "help" Crowe. We realize as she nearly destroys Crowe by doing so that she perceives herself as a whore on the inside, beneath the facade. Her logic is as twisted and tainted as the corruption Crowe and Pierce are about to uncover as they follow the trail linking Basinger's boss Strathairn to the Night Owl killings and the vice surrounding them on every side.<br /><br />Basinger may have garnered the Oscar for her role, but Crowe's performance as the tough cop with some soft spots after all is something you'll always remember. The coolest job done here, however, is by Kevin Spacey. Hanson told him before filming began to think Dean Martin and he'd have it down pat. Spacey did just that, playing the ultra cool cop, the one in the tabloids for his Hollywood connections. He is a consultant on the TV show "Badge of Honor" (think Dragnet) and is hooked up with slimy but likeable Danny DeVito, a writer for a Hollywood tabloid. Spacey grabs the spotlight and DeVito gets the headlines as Spacy collars Hollywood stars in compromising situations, DeVito's camera flashing.<br /><br />Spacey seemingly has it all, but like the rest of this film, it is just a facade. While sitting in a bar listening to Dean Martin in the background he looks up into the mirror behind the counter and doesn't like what is staring back at him. He has all the tools to be a great cop but he knows he has sold his soul for the fifty in front of him. He becomes involved in the case because of a murder in a hotel room he feels responsible for that leads right back to the Night Owl, and hooks up with Pearce to redeem his soul. You will never forget the name "Rollo Tomasi" or what it means for Pearce, and ultimately Spacey in this film.<br /><br />Adding to the atmosphere more than just a little is the score by Jerry Goldsmith, his finest work since "Chinatown" and just as haunting. It does more than help enhance the atmosphere, it truly is the atmosphere of this one of a kind masterpiece. This film has the kind of ending dreams are made of and someone holding up their badge to the oncoming rush of cop cars in the Hollywood hills at night is a scene you'll never forget.<br /><br />There is not a bad performance in this film. It is complex and riveting. This is a region two edition for those who need that venue. If you haven't seen this before, don't rent it, buy it. You'll watch it over and over. But don't tell anyone. This is Off the Record, On the QT, and Very Hush Hush!</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>This latter-day descendant of film noir may be the most perfect movie to come out of Hollywood in my lifetime. Great story, excellent cast, show-stealing performance by a then little known Russell Crowe, classy soundtrack, violence that still manages to shock jaded modern sensibilities, and above all enough twists and turns in the masterful plot to surprise the innocent and smug alike. A fabulous achievement in filmmaking, and a rare example of a movie that is every bit as downright good as it is monumentally great. I could see LA Confidential fifty more times and never grow tired of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>1997's "L.A. Confidential" is a film noir easily worthy of its hardboiled 1940's predecessors such as "The Maltese Falcon."  "L.A. Confidential" features a complex plot, a set of morally ambiguous heroes, a damsel in distress, and some terrific retro sets and story lines.<br /><br />The centers around three 1940's L.A. detectives, superbly played by Guy Pierce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey.  The length of the movie (over two hours) allows them to be painted in subtle and very human shades of gray. Guy Pierce plays Ed Exley, son of a prominent retired policeman, smart and slickly ambitious.  Russell Crowe plays Bud White, a two-fisted cop out to fix the wrongs he witnessed as a child.  Kevin Spacey plays Jack Vincennes, technical advisor to Hollywood crime drama producers and cynical enforcer of the Hollywood code.<br /><br />A seemingly minor Christmas-shift crime draws the three men into a complex scheme of official corruption and coverup, featuring Kim Bassinger as a high-priced hooker who portrays prominent actresses, Danny DeVito as a gossip columist, and James Cromwell as a shady Chief of Detectives.  The three detectives, each for his reasons, finally measure up to their oaths as policemen.  They will pay a high price for doing the right thing.  One is murdered, one is seriously wounded in a thrilling and horrifying gunfight that is the climax of the movie, and one only just escapes death and disgrace by outthinking the man at the center of the coverup.<br /><br />This movie is very highly recommended as superb entertainment in the classic film noir genre, presented by a talented cast and featuring a fascinating plotline.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>It took me several recomendations before I decided to take a look at this film. At first with reservations upon learning the leading roles belonged to a couple of unknown Aussies, one of them (early on) even gives the impression of being nothing but a wimp. Let's just say by the end that impression had changed more than a bit and when the police captain says "I wouldn't want to be him for all the whisky in Ireland" I was in total euphoria.<br /><br />The plot is so dense and there are so many speaking characters yet they are all perfectly cast and memorable.<br /><br />Rumor has it a new special edition is on the way, however, the DVD out there is hardly short on features, I specially like the Guy Pearce / Russell Crowe screen tests. It's hard to tell how Director Curtis Hanson saw their greatness under all that hair.<br /><br />One of the best movies I've ever seen.

The movie does a really good job of shedding light on American society during that period.<br /><br />Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Danny De Vito, Kim Basinger, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The plot, the setting, and the dialogues, are all WONDERFUL!<br /><br />Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br /><br />In conclusion, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>I feel like i was one of the last people on Earth to see this movie. I finally saw it yesterday and i was blown away by the amazing performances by Guy Pierce, Russel Crowe, and Kevin Spacey. I especially like Russel Crowe's attitude in the movie, he plays a really tough cop (...). Guy Pierce plays as a cop too who rats some of his fellow officers in a police brutality event. L.A. Confidential is about a corrupt police prescient in the 1950's. A good story line with good quality action, especially from Russel Crowe. the ending has a good twist too.

Confidential" is a cop story told the way it should be--intellectually, right in your face, and with a spice of humor.  Based on the bestselling novel by James Ellroy, this crime caper is a masterpiece of suspense, sensuality, and straight-up heroism.<p>After a holiday mishap at the police station in which several officers brutally beat up inmates and a killer maniacally shoots and kills numerous victims at a local bar, detectives Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe search for answers.  Spacey is a high-profile cop who benefits from raunchy tablod writer Danny Devito's busts of movie stars and political figures, while Crowe is wonderul as the straight-laced detective who finds his life in shambles of corruption as he gets closer and closer to the truth, and also as he gets more involved with one of an enigmatic millionare's erotic hookers (Kim Basinger in a knock-out role).  Guy Pearce plays the up-and-coming son of a police station legend who will do whatever it takes to get a promotion, including selling out his colleagues and stealing their girls.<p>Excellent adaptation of the wonderful novel, using the cast to create a rigorous, enveloping story that will keep audience's guessing until the very last second.  Bold, telling performances from the entire cast, especially Crowe (which should have been at least Oscar-nomination worthy) and Pearce (who steals the show from Crowe time to time).  Action-packed, character driven, and as smart of a crime drama as you will ever find.  Certainly one of the best, if not THE best of its kind made in the 1990's.  Was very unfortunate to be overshadowed by the juggernaut "Titanic"; could very well of won Best Picture.  The DVD has some special behind the scenes documentaries--check out "Off the Record"--which contains interviews from the film's creators, lead actors and novelist James Ellroy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>I wanted to watch this movie right from the moment of its release more than six years ago, but for one reason or other I never got around to do it...until now. Luckily I did not continue procrastinating, because this is probably one of the best movies in the film noir category.<p>The story, based on the novel by James Ellroy, starts with Danny De Vito's narration of the latest events in the city of angels, which include the arrest of Mickey C, head of the organized crime. I have always enjoyed listening to De Vito narrate a story, and as happened in &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;, I was enthralled from the beginning. De Vito plays a journalist working for a tabloid called Hush-hush, who has several contacts inside the police department that give him exclusives in exchange for publicity. One of these is Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a classic &quot;ladies man&quot;, interested in fame and in the Hollywood world much more than he is interested in police business. Vincennes works in the same precinct with Sergeant, soon to be Detective Lieutenant, Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and with Officer Bud White (Russell Crowe). Exley is the typical &quot;go by the book&quot; guy, son of a famous officer murdered years ago in a crime that was never solved. White is a cop whose main interest is helping ladies in distress, playing a typical knight in a shinning armor. After a situation at the police station ends up in disaster, the relationship among the three policemen is turned into a confrontational one when White's partner is forced to quit his job.<p>Shortly after those events a multiple murder in the Night Owl will have the three policemen desperately trying to solve the same crime and facing a well-oiled criminal organization. At this point the plot and relationship between the characters acquire an amazing depth and keeps the audience guessing right until the end. The performances of Spacey, Pearce and Russell are laudable, and the appearance of Kim Basinger, as a high-class prostitute, adds the missing element to complete an extraordinary cast. The movie has everything one in this genre should have, suspense, action, mystery, thrills, betrayal, love and even humor! I will probably watch this movie again soon because I know I will enjoy it a second time. If you have not seen it yet, I recommend you do it as soon as possible.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Proving to be much better than originally anticipated, L.A. Confidential was a hit with critics and managed to win Oscar's for Kim Basinger (Best Supporting Actress) and screenwriter Brian Helgeland.  Based on a series of James Ellroy's novels which takes place in 1940's Hollywood; L.A. Confidential manages to be one of the best mainstream film noirs in recent memory, and thanks to the brilliant directing by Curtis Hanson and the memorable ensemble cast (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, and Danny DeVito) helps make this film something truly special.  The DVD itself is one of Warner Bros.' better DVD packages; containing multiple parts of behind the scenes material that is actually worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>L.A. Con fidentail is great movie. It deserved the Oscars it won. I have to admit I first saw the movie because I do like Kim Bassinger. She had me hooked from the first time I saw her in Batman. She is fantastic and so dang hot. This is a great tail of murder, mystery, and betrayl. Just watch the movie for the acting. Kevin Spacey and Russel Crowe are fantastic. They are easily two of the best in the business. Guy Pearce also has a great performance. He's so great he suprised me he was so bad in The Time Machine. You got to see L.A. Confidential. If you love murder, betryal and mystery then it's the perfect movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>Simply put, this film can't earn less than 5 stars; it's a seamless piece of work that should really have run off with more awards than it got.<p>The performances are universally excellent--and maybe the casting director has to take the credit, maybe not--so it's hard to pick a singular stand-out lead in the whole piece.  And Kevin Spacey is generally so good, we kind of take it for granted here.  Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce as virtual unknowns in a Hollywood picture convince you very early on that they belong in the film.<p>Shot on location in Hollywood, with all the appropriate setpieces, hairstyles, mannerisms, this is a film that (minus the profanity and nudity) could have been released 40 years ago to similar acclaim.  <p>It won a well-deserved Academy award for its screenplay, but from top to bottom, this film is a perennial and should find its way into every DVD player until the end of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>Until this film hit the silver screen, James Ellroy's books were famously (and quite understandably) considered to be unfilmable: they're so epic in scope and byzantine in plot they would make filming a Tolkien trilogy seem like a doddle. <p>But records and rules were made to be broken, and this film version of Ellroy's LA Confidential shatters that conventional wisdom and brings Ellroy's vision vivdly to the screen.<p>It's a top-notch cast into the bargain; while headlines may go to Bassinger as femme fatale, Pearce and Crowe and rookie cops at the centre of the maelstrom, make sure you keep an eye on the surrounding cast - to my mind this is really what gives the film its zip and zing. James Cromwell - yes, the kindly farmer from Babe - avoids the danger of being typecast in that role, to say the least, as a truly dastardly police commander; Kevin Spacey is all satin and schwing as the smooth-talking celebrity cop Jack Vincennes, but crowning the whole shooting match (a term I use deliberately), and more than anything infusing the movie with Ellroy's hipster '50s attitude and credibility is none other than Danny de Vito, having the time of his life as the editor of Hush Hush Magazine.<p>This is a really, really slick show, from beginning to end. Where Curtis Hanson has been especially canny is in paring down some of the excesses of Ellroy's plotting (it has always struck me as odd that a writer with such a deliberately sparse, stacatto, writing style gets so carried away with his plots) so as not to tax credulity or the "Oh Come On" factor, and has landed up with a tense, riveting, brutal, but at the same time knowing and witty, thriller.<p>This is a must for any fan of modern cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>L.A. Confidential is the movie that should have won Best Picture for 1998 over Titanic.  Titanic is good, but this movie is easily superior, with the intelligence and depth to be great not just once, but after repeated viewings.<p>I have watched this movie four times since it first came out and have always been totally wowed over by it.  The depiction of the dark side of 1950s Los Angeles is vivid, the characters are multidimensional, the story complex but not confusing.  <p>Despite the way this movie is marketed, the two principal actors are not Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger, but relative newcomers Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce who have both gone on to do other great films.  (Ironically, Titanic star Leo DiCaprio - the two movies are linked to me- despite his elevated prominence after that movie, has had his career come to almost a dead halt).<p>A way to measure the difference between a good movie and a great movie is what you are thinking after watching it.  Do you think, "It was good, but it had this flaw or that flaw" or "It was good, and I especially liked how it did this or that"?  In other words, after viewing it, do you start catching flaws or catching subtleties?  L.A. Confidential fits into this latter category, a movie in which you can always find new and great things, and if you enjoy crime movies at all, this has to be on your viewing list.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>I can't believe I hadn't seen this film until recently! This is one of the most intelligent and original dark comedies I have ever seen! It is a tale  of corruption -- police, politicians and the press -- and the people  involved. Set in Hollywood during the 1950's, the film illustrates police  corruption. There are many phony policemen, one of whom is Kevin Spacey's  character. He sells information to a sleazy tabloid journalist (played by  Danny Devito). The backdrop of the film sort of reminds me of Chinatown --  the best Technicolor noir film I have ever seen. The actors are incredible.  Kevin Spacey and Danny Devito are amazing, as are Russell Crowe and Guy  Pearce. But the real treat in this film is Kim Basinger; she earned that  Academy Award. This is a compelling and brutally honest thriller that  should definitely be owned.

Confidential," directed by Curtis Hanson, is an intense, compelling drama starring Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce.  It's a time of growth in Southern California; freeways are on the drawing board, glitz and glamor abounds in Hollywood, and there's a lot of money to be made, especially for anyone with the right connections.  But there's a dark undercurrent running throughout the city as well.  The criminal element is thriving under the auspices of gangster Mickey Cohen, and it's a time when certain officers of the law tend to mete out their own, personal brand of justice, which doesn't necessarily land them on the right side of the fence, nor of the law.  There's graft within the L.A.P.D., and a prevalent misuse of authority and lack of ethics that begins at the top, filters down and permeates the entire force.  And when Cohen finally goes to jail, a number of his "associates" begin turning up dead, and strange and untoward things begin to happen in and around Hollywood.  Finally, a nocturnal massacre at a place called the "Nite Owl Cafe" kicks off an investigation that ultimately involves two young officers, Bud White (Crowe) and Ed Exley (Pearce), and a veteran of the narcotics squad, Jack Vincennes (Spacey).  And it isn't long before the proverbial can of worms is wrenched open and, needless to say, many lives are soon destined to be changed forever.  Working from an intelligent and extremely well written script (co-written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by James Ellroy), Hanson delivers this tightly woven, intricate story with a deft hand and an eye for detail that transports the audience to another time and place.  At the heart of the tale are White and Exley, both of whom are passionate about their work and the pursuit of justice, though they differ greatly in their respective methods and basic perceptions of how things should be and why.  And it's this contrast in personalities that becomes the impetus for the drama; what makes these guys tick, and which buttons can be pushed (and by whom) to get them going.  It's an examination of the complexities of human nature, and Hanson handles it all with skill and precision.  If you hadn't noticed Russell Crowe before this film, you will forever after.  His screen presence here is explosive, and he brings an intensity to his character that is almost unsettling.  You can see it in his eyes; the turmoil lying just beneath the surface, ready to erupt at any moment.  You can feel it just watching him.  It's a dynamic, multi-layered performance that is unforgettable.  Guy Pearce turns in a notable performance as well, entirely credible and believable, though he lacks Crowe's charisma and presence.  But, admittedly, the character of Exley doesn't command the sympathy that White's does; White, despite his propensity for violent action, exhibits a vulnerability that is absent in Exley, who comes off as rather cold and inaccessible.  But again, it's the differences between these two that gives the movie it's momentum.  Kevin Spacey also turns in another outstanding performance as the slick, self-assured "celeb" of the force, Jack Vincennes, the cop whose ethics have become self-serving and who's lost sight of why he joined the department in the first place.  Spacey readily conveys the fact that there is more to Vincennes than meets the eye, which we discover as the story unfolds.  And it's when we learn what's hidden beneath the surface that we realize what a terrific job Spacey has done in bringing this character to life.  And, not to be outdone by her co-stars, Kim Basinger (Lynn Bracken) turns in a performance as a Veronica Lake look-alike that won her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  With a supporting cast that includes Danny DeVito (Sid), David Strathairn (Pierce Patchett), Ron Rifkin (D.A. Ellis Loew) and Matt McCoy (Brett Chase), "L.A. Confidential" is an entertaining, absorbing drama that will linger in your memory for days after you've seen it.  Filmed on location in and around L.A. and Hollywood, this is a superlative piece of filmmaking that must be seen, especially by anyone who truly loves movies that are made the way movies "ought" to be made; this is one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>This was the best film made in '97 but like "Chinatown," another noir, it is destined to become one of the finest movies not to take the Oscar home.

Confidential is a "guy thing," a well-directed, fast-paced thriller with a Los Angeles atmospheric feel comparable to say "Chinatown" or "Sunset Boulevard."  Director Curtis Hanson brings the fifties L.A. milieu to life with music, authentic appearing sets and a story that focuses on crime and corruption, false glamour and moral disillusionment as only the City of Angels could play it.  Things get a little bit comic book toward the end, but the characters and story and the rapid-fire one-liners will keep you glued to the screen.  There's a lot of  Raymond Chandler's L.A. here.<br /><br />"Confidential" was the name of an "expos&eacute;" magazine published in the fifties in the L.A. area.  I recall seeing it as a kid in liquor stores at some distance from the comic books.  It used green lettering on its first page (the only page I ever saw).  In this film the magazine is called "Hush-Hush," and Danny DeVito is appropriately cast as its sleazy editor and publisher.<br /><br />Kim Basinger appears as a Veronica Lake look-a-like prostitute and plays it like Lauren Bacall from a Bogey film, but without comparable wit or grace.  James Cromwell is the personification of evil as the morally sick Capt Dudley Smith.  Russell Crowe as Bud White, the justice-dispensing cop with a brutal temper and a soft heart for battered dames, gives an excellent performance.  Guy Pearce as Ed Exley, the cop with glasses who doesn't care what the other cops think is also very good.  Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes, the cop whose thrill is to be part of the TV production "Badge of Honor" (that's the old "Dragnet" series with Jack Webb from the fifties), is also good.<br /><br />In short, the cast is excellent and is probably the main reason this classy "shoot 'em up" is so highly-rated.  It was number 49 on IMDb's top 250 last time I looked.<br /><br />A question to ask while watching this is, was the LAPD really this corrupt?  Quick answer: yes.  Next question, why?  Answer, because all police departments, like all governments eventually become infested with corruption and must to cleaned out or overthrown.  Why?  Quick, but non-illuminating answer: human nature.  Even you and I, if we had to deal with criminals on the one hand and the bureaucracy of the justice system on the other, day after frustrating and cynical day, might very well take on the values and persona of our surroundings.<br /><br />Some authentic period piece phrases heard in the movie: "Just the facts, Jack"; "taco bender"; "just another Hollywood homocide"; "maybe that's why he's under a house in Elysian Park and don't smell too good" and of course the "confidential" tabloid blurb: "Off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush."<br /><br />One last thought for Director Hanson: Here's a lyric from a fifties tune that should have made the sound track: "Confidential as a church at twilight/Secret and moving as a lover's prayer/My love for you will always be confidential to me."  They used to moon over that one in the barrios, circa 1955.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>The crux of L.A.Confedential's subject is the corruption brewing in the Los Angeles area during the 50s. The corruption comes in many forms: the police, organized crime, politics, and tabloid journalism. The film centers around three vastly different police officers: Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce),Bud White (Russell Crowe), and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey). Exley is a "by the book" officer who has ambition to be a great detective like his father. Bud White is an aggressive, hostile type with a short temper and a tendency towards violence. Jack Vincennes is a smooth talking, cool type who knows how to work the system, being in cahoots with the editor of the tabloid magazine.<br />When a brutal murder takes place at the Nite Owl restaurant, it seemingly links all three officers, who do some investigating on their own into what took place. What they find is a link to another world of serious corruption, where it is difficult to figure out who's being honest and who is a backstabber, what is lie and what is truth. There are cover-ups into crimes, and some police who have crossed over to the other side.<br /><br />If there was one annoyance, it was the voice-over  narration by Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), editor of Hush Hush magazine. Much of the character's narration didn't really add much to the story, because basically we knew everything he was narrating, so it was unnecessary. It just came across as a bit cheesy.<br /><br />Still, what makes L.A.Confidential work as noir is the mood created with the 50s atmosphere, the variety of detective types, and the building suspense as the film heads to its final confrontation. While the ending wasn't entirely original, the film was still one of the better films of the 90s, one to go back to.</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>I just finished watching this for the first time in a long time. This is an EXCELLENT film noir. Its not often a modern day noir hits the jackpot but this did. This movie takes place around the time where classic Film Noirs were being made. The pace is swift, the acting is fantastic, all the stars were perfect in their roles. Excellent story. It reminded me of the great Cagney, Bogart and Robinson gangster/noir movies. It might take a few times to understand it all, but you will be truly rewarded with a fantastic movie, a must of fans of Film Noir.the cast - Kevin Spacey,Russell crowe,James Ellroy,Kim Basinger are just FANTASTIC. Highly recommended. Not too terribly gory for those with a squeamish stomach. Great DVD with bonus features galore...</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>I don't care if TITANIC won the 1997 Oscar for Best Picture.<br /><br />For my money, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL Is the best film to come out of Hollywood in the last twenty years.<br /><br />This is prime film noir.  In future history books of the cinema, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL will be ranked right up there with the great ones, such as DOUBLE INDEMNITY, OUT OF THE PAST and THE BIG SLEEP.  And, as much as I admire and consistently enjoy those classic movies, I think that L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is the finest of the lot.<br /><br />Adapting James Ellroy's intricately-plotted, sometimes confusing, novel was certainly a monumental task for writer/director Curtis Hanson and his screenwriting collaborator, Brian Helgeland.  Not only did they have to bring to life  more than a half-dozen key characters, but there were also several intertwined  plot lines to juggle.<br /><br />Hanson and Helgeland have done an admirable job.  Their characters are real and, although the story is complicated, by the end credits, everything is explained.  There are no loose ends.  Truly, the movie is better than the book.<br /><br />Set in a superbly re-created 1950's Los Angeles, the film's primary storyline concerns the real reasons behind a mass murder in the Night Owl Cafe.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey, three police detectives of widely different backgrounds and agendas, ultimately join together to battle police corruption, the Mob and, at times, each other.  Along the way, they interact with some fascinating folk, including a hooker who looks like Veronica Lake (Oscar winner Kim Basinger), her rich pimp (David Strathairn) and the editor of a nasty scandal magazine (Danny DeVito).<br /><br />James Cromwell also co-stars as a police captain who is willing to break the rules.<br /><br />?

It is strong everywhere.  You cannot point to casting, or directing, or acting, or writing, or cinematography, and say "that's not as good as the rest." It's uniformly great.  Guy Pearce was fantastic in a definite breakout performance; Kevin Spacey was dead on and Russell Crowe was completely convincing as the muscle head with he heart of gold.  See, there I go -- I can't criticize any of the actors relative to the others, they were all outstanding.<br /><br />Anyhow, buy this movie for your collection and you won't be disappointed.  The DVD transfer on my copy was excellent, although I wish it had additional features.  It's well worth full price.

They also have a nearly 1  hr  TV  movie/pilot called LA CONFIDENTIAL starring Keifer Sutherland which is fun.  There is also a bonus CD disc of music which is icing on the cake.  I just spent a few hours watching all the bonus features and will absolutely watch them again ( a rarity) and as I  said..the movie never  looked better..I've only checked out a bit of the commentary which has a staggering  number of contributors and should make another viewing  of the movie with it running a fun trip indeed.

One who joined the police force because he was unable to save his mother from being killed by an abusive husband, but who now uses violence not only against wife-beaters but whenever called for by his superior officers; be it to beat a confession out of a suspect<br />or to discourage criminals from settling in town?  Or one who joined the police force to emulate his father, a department legend; to go after "Rollo Tommasi" (the guy who thinks he can get away with anything), but who thereafter lets his career and department politics dictate his actions?  Or, in the end, is it the one who has let corruption wipe out so thoroughly the reasons why he once joined the police force that he doesn't even remember a single one of them, but who for once in his life still finds it in himself to go after real criminals, even at the risk of his own life?  This is just one, although maybe the central question asked in "L.A. Confidential," the movie based on James Ellroy's novel with the same name.  And as does the book, the movie refuses to provide an answer to this and the other questions it asks.<br /><br />The story is set up by tabloid editor Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), who during the movie's opening credits gleefully sums up the L.A. clich&eacute;s that still hold true today: "Come to Los Angeles!  The sun shines bright, the beaches are wide and inviting, ... there are jobs aplenty, and land is cheap.  Every working man can have his own house, and inside the house a happy, all American family.  You can have all this, and who knows, you can even be discovered - become a movie star or at least, singer.  Life is good in Los Angeles: it's paradise on earth."  Laughing sarcastically, however, he adds:  "That's what they tell ya', anyway, 'cause they're selling an image.  They're selling it through movies, radio, and television."  Then Hudgens proceeds to tell the story of crime boss Mickey C.'s arrest, which left the void in the City of Angels's organized crime scene that sets the stage for this movie's story, and concludes with his tabloid's tag line:  "Remember, dear readers, you heard it here first:  Off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush ..."<br /><br />And as indicated in these opening lines, nothing is as it seems in this 1950s' version of a Los Angeles populated by hookers cut to look like movie stars and cops with more or less disreputable alternative sources of income.  As the story progresses, its three heroes - career-driven and pseudo-correct Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), tough-fisted and golden-hearted Wendell "Bud" White (Russell Crowe) and nonchalant, corrupt "celebrity crime stopper" Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) - become unlikely allies in their search for their city's most elusive commodity: the truth.  Shades of gray abound, and even the end, which (unlike the novel's) has at least some redeeming aspects, is not a happy ending by a long shot.<br /><br />Just as many people longingly remembered the days of "The Maltese Falcon," "The Big Sleep" or, for that matter, "Chinatown," proclaimed "they don't make 'em like that anymore" and were ready to announce the death of the noir genre, along came a group of new directors and screenwriters and breathed new life into patient.  "The Usual Suspects" is one excellent example, this one is another.  Unlike other noir stories', this tale's heroes are no private detectives; but all the classic elements of a film noir are there, from a damsel in distress (Veronica Lake-look-alike hooker Lynn Bracken, award-winningly portrayed by Kim Basinger) to crime, corruption and abuse of power, and to dimmed lights and hard boiled dialogue with many memorable one-liners.  In a year overshadowed by the success of the vastly overrated "Titanic," "L.A. Confidential" managed to at least collect the Academy Awards in the best supporting actress and best adapted screenplay categories (Kim Basinger and Brian Helgeland/Curtis Hanson, respectively; the movie had also been nominated in the best picture, best director - again Curtis Hanson -, best original score - Jerry Goldsmith -, best cinematography, best art direction and best editing categories).  And while the 1990s have seen a revival of the noir genre, this one is a standout even among the new films noirs the past decade has brought us.  It made the careers of its writers, director and two of its stars (Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe), and boosted those of several others of its cast members (Kim Basinger and Kevin Spacey, to name just two).  I am sure it will find its eternal place in the annals of Hollywood, alongside its famous predecessors.  There are way too few movies like this these days - if you haven't seen it already, go and buy or rent it soon.  This is modern noir at its finest.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446674249">L.A.

Weekly film section, presented L.A. Confidential, one of her favorite movies, for the Cal State Northridge Cinemateque Critics Series, where I saw this film a few weeks ago. The film was followed by an insightful Q & A between Dargis and David Kipen, a book critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, and continued with answers to questions from members of the audience.<br /><br />As mentioned by Dargis, L.A. Confidential was released in 1997 to huge critical acclaim. It went on to be nominated for nine Academy Awards and is now considered a key film for the 90s. In fact, in answer to a question from an audience member, Dargis feels that had Titanic been released another year, L.A. Confidential would have garnered all the major awards of 1997. Although it didn't, it is still widely regarded as one of the best movies of that year.<br /><br />Based on the novel by James Ellroy, the film is a dark and gritty noir set in 1950s Los Angeles and deals with police corruption and Hollywood sleaze. The seemingly idyllic Los Angeles of the early 1950s provides the glitzy backdrop for the grisly crime that is the focus of the story: a bloody shotgun slaying of the patrons at an all-night diner. One of the victims was Dick Stensland, a subpar police officer forced into retirement after a drunken brutality incident not long before his death.<br /><br />Heading the investigation are three very different cops. Stensland's former partner, Wendell "Bud" White (Russell Crowe), a man willing to break the rules to seek justice; Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), an ambitious but naive golden boy who is willing to do almost anything to get ahead; and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a slick operator who collaborates with a celebrity magazine to insure high-profile arrests.<br /><br />What follows is a powerful and stylish mystery with an ever-twisting plot that continually surprises the audience without insulting its intelligence. The compelling blend of L.A. history and pulp fiction makes for an intense and fascinating film that definitely deserved more audience attention than it got.<br /><br />This is my second viewing of the film, but my first as a student of film. With Dargis' commentary following the feature, I now have a deeper appreciation for this unique motion picture and liked it even more upon second viewing. A rich and complex mystery full of astonishing performances (including an Oscar for Kim Basinger's supporting role), this will definitely be remembered as a landmark film for the 90's. Its comparisons to Chinatown are inevitable. This is modern noir at its finest.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>This was the best film made in '97 but like Polanski's "Chinatown" it is destined to become one of the finest movies not to take the Oscar home. Curtis Hanson took James Ellroy's novel, a book many doubted could be translated to the film medium, and co-wrote one of the finest adapted screenplays ever done. He then brought on board a couple of Aussie unknowns, a gorgeous star who had never lived up to her potential, added perhaps the finest actor working today, and began filming one of the darkest noir films of all time, in sun drenched daylight.<br /><br />The end result is a dark and twisted tale of personal redemption told against the backdrop of the bright lights and sunshine of Hollywood in the early 1950's. Hanson contrasts the brightly lit exteriors with the dark storyline of police corruption and Hollywood decadence. This is a movie about facade, not just Hollywood's but our own personal facade as well.<br /><br />Russell Crowe became a star as Detective Bud White, a tough cop willing to do whatever is necessary, something the political up and comer Guy Pearce finds archaic about the force and wants to change. What may stop him from doing so is his investigation of the murder of several people at "The Night Owl" cafe, one of whom is Crowe's partner, who recently "retired" after a well publicized jail brawl christened "Bloody Christmas" by the papers.<br /><br />Crowe and Pearce come at this from different angles but the road for both leads right to beautiful Kim Basinger and a millionaire in the lush Hollywood hills played by David Strathairn. There is a reason Basinger looks a little like Veronica Lake the first time we see her in this film; she's supposed to. Hollywood legend has it that a string of expensive call girls were cut to look like stars during the 1940's and early 1950's and Hanson has made this darker side of Hollywood part of the story. Basinger is one of the lucky ones; close enough to the actual look of Veronica Lake not to have been cut on.<br /><br />Crowe falls for the real girl inside Basinger, but in spite of her opulent lifestyle, her low self-esteem comes to the forefront when she sleeps with Pearce in an attempt to "help" Crowe. We realize as she nearly destroys Crowe by doing so that she perceives herself as a whore on the inside, beneath the facade. Her logic is as twisted and tainted as the corruption Crowe and Pierce are about to uncover as they follow the trail linking Basinger's boss Strathairn to the Night Owl killings and the vice surrounding them on every side.<br /><br />Basinger may have garnered the Oscar for her role, but Crowe's performance as the tough cop with some soft spots after all is something you'll always remember. The coolest job done here, however, is by Kevin Spacey. Hanson told him before filming began to think Dean Martin and he'd have it down pat. Spacey did just that, playing the ultra cool cop, the one in the tabloids for his Hollywood connections. He is a consultant on the TV show "Badge of Honor" (think Dragnet) and is hooked up with slimy but likeable Danny DeVito, a writer for a Hollywood tabloid. Spacey grabs the spotlight and DeVito gets the headlines as Spacy collars Hollywood stars in compromising situations, DeVito's camera flashing.<br /><br />Spacey seemingly has it all, but like the rest of this film, it is just a facade. While sitting in a bar listening to Dean Martin in the background he looks up into the mirror behind the counter and doesn't like what is staring back at him. He has all the tools to be a great cop but he knows he has sold his soul for the fifty in front of him. He becomes involved in the case because of a murder in a hotel room he feels responsible for that leads right back to the Night Owl, and hooks up with Pearce to redeem his soul. You will never forget the name "Rollo Tomasi" or what it means for Pearce, and ultimately Spacey in this film.<br /><br />Adding to the atmosphere more than just a little is the score by Jerry Goldsmith, his finest work since "Chinatown" and just as haunting. It does more than help enhance the atmosphere, it truly is the atmosphere of this one of a kind masterpiece. This film has the kind of ending dreams are made of and someone (I won't give it away) holding up their badge to the oncoming rush of cop cars in the Hollywood hills at night is a scene you'll never forget.<br /><br />There is not a bad performance in this film. It is complex and riveting. If you haven't seen this before, don't rent it, buy it. You'll watch it over and over. But don't tell anyone. This is Off the Record, On the QT, and Very Hush Hush!</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>There's a moment in Curtis Hanson's 1997 peach of a film when Guy Pearce playing good-guy cop Ed Exley enters The Night Owl caf&eacute; to check up on possible multiple homicides in the early hours of the morning... As he does, the camera pans across the Formica counter and the nearby tabletops, the saltcellars, the napkin dispensers, the circular seats, the candy vendors... There's tons of stuff in a few seconds - all of 1950s - the attention to detail is mind-blowing... Hanson had made a $15 million dollar movie look like it cost ten times that and I'm thrilled to say that this BLU RAY version of "L.A. Confidential" does exactly the same.<br /><br />While it's not "Zulu" or "2001: A Space Odyssey" perfect in terms of print - other people's reckoning of 4.5 out of 5 is accurate. I'd estimate that 80-90% of the time the picture is glorious and even when it's a little soft in places, the rest is `so' good, you hardly notice. Also, as you re-watch it, you realise just how good LAC was and what a superlative job Hanson did in bringing the seedy underbelly of Hollywood and the LAPD of the time to the screen. Everything fits on "L.A. Confidential" - the incredible ensemble cast you couldn't buy for love or money now - the chemistry between them all - the ruthlessly realistic story and spunky adaptation of it, the beautiful night locations, the dapper clothes, the colours - even Jerry Goldsmith's music - mellow brass followed by staccato piano fills - was absolute genius! It all worked - and now it looks the business too.<br /><br />Watching Crowe and Basinger in the main feature in all their beautifully filmed sizzling glory is a treat for sure - but the list of extras is equally impressive too.

The best parts of the movie are Kim Basinger in an Oscar winning performance for her role as a Veronica Lake lookalike hooker and Russell Crowe as a fearsome cop who finds a surprising capacity for love.<p>The genius of the film is the three inter-related stories (hookers cut to resemble movie stars, missing heroin and a murder investigation) in LA of the early 1950's. Cops, prostitution, corrupt politicians and gangsters all touch each others lives and in the tabloid press in surprising ways.<p>The acting is terrific with James Cromwell, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pierce and Danny DeVito all selling their souls for ambition - and the price to be paid; deserved or not. The costumes and set design are first rate. If you like film noir, or just love well-crafted movies you'll have to look hard to find a better film.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>"LA Confidential" can confidently be called the mother of all film noirs; Lord help whoever tries to top this one.  Set in Los Angeles in the early 1950s, "Confidential" deals with an incredible case of police corruption which is unearthed little by little as the dead bodies pile up.  There are so many terrific performances in this movie (Kevin Spacey as the jaded vice cop, Russell Crowe as the Rambo wannabe, Guy Pearce as the straight-arrow lieutenant, James Cromwell as the venal police captain, and Kim Basinger as the call girl with a heart) that they would have had to hand out Oscars by the bucketful to do justice to everyone who deserved one.  Of the minor characters, my favorite was Danny DeVito as the sleazeball sleaze magazine editor, whose talent for telling all finally does him in.  There are a few real-life characters being played in this film; who in the baby-boomer set doesn't remember Johnny Stompanato, the small-time thug and sometime paramour of Lana Turner who was murdered by her daughter, which was ultimately dismissed as justifiable homicide?  The main characters in the film are so compelling as to be totally mesmerizing.  Lieutenant Exley, played by Guy Pearce, tries earnestly to steer a straight path through the miasma of corruption running rampant in his precinct, even as he boosts his own career through rampant self-promotion.  Kevin Spacey is great as Seargeant Jack Vincennes, who is mired so deep in the vice squad that he is becoming as jaded and venal as the human slimeballs he mixes with, until he stumbles onto the key players of the corruption within the LAPD, and James Cromwell practically oozes evil as the loathesome Captain Dudley Smith.  But the film really belongs to Russell Crowe and his portrayal of Officer Bud White; with his take-no-prisoners mentality, he seems to represent everything that is wrong with the LAPD (vicious, corrupt, violent, insensitive); but with White there is a limit, and when he stumbles into the rot in his department, his better instincts take over.  There is blood and gore galore in this film but the story is so well told that none of the violence is gratuitous.  It's a story of people doing a mean, dirty job with honor or dishonor.  This movie defines film noir as it has never been defined before, and it ranks as one of the greatest films of the past decade.  The acting, directing and production can only be described in superlatives.  It's a winner on all counts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>I almost skipped this movie during its theatrical run because the trailer for it was such a jumbled mess.  It left me confused about what kind of movie it would be.  But after it made so many Top Ten lists (not the David Letterman kind) I had to see it, and BOY WAS IT GREAT!!!!!  Complex, noir-ish, well-acted, well-written...  Fantastic on every level.  An intelligent, action-packed, suspenseful nail-biter.  Here's the one problem, though:  Between seeing it twice in the theaters and numerous time at home on DVD, I'm left wondering if there is a cut of it I haven't seen yet.  For some inexplicable reason, Kim Basinger won Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars for this movie.  I've watched this movie a number of times and I cannot recall, even when I was deliberatly watching for it, ANYTHING that she did in this movie to warrant a nomination, to say nothing of a win.  Julianne Moore in BOOGIE NIGHTS that year -- now THERE was an Oscar-caliber performance!  But I didn't see anything in Basinger's role or performance that merited that kind of achievement award.  Maybe I have a "bad pressing" of the DVD.  Maybe there are scenes missing that everyone else has seen except me.  Yeah, right.  Can anyone out there help me on this?  Basinger's felony theft aside, this DVD packs a lot of punch for your purchasing dollar -- a great film, interesting commentary and behind-the-scenes stuff, and a "virtual tour" of the Hollywood of old.<br />I hope Julianne Moore filed a police report the night that Basinger won the Oscar, because Moore was ROBBED in broad daylight!</p></br><a href="../users/A7PBI5HADJYER.html">A7PBI5HADJYER</a><br/><p>Modern film-noir about three cops investigating a murder at a coffee shop are intertwined in a situation far more complex than they were led to believe.  Brilliant thriller has it all: mystery, suspense, action, romance, humor, drama, and it's all placed into one ingenious, engrossing mix in the hands of director Curtis Hanson.  Hands down the best film of its genre and one of my personal favorites.  The three leads (Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey) deliver sharp, terrific performances.  Excellent score from Jerry Goldsmith.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>"L.A. Confidential" is the story of three Los Angeles police officers who work in a rather corrupt department in 1953.  Bud White (Russell Crowe) has a violent temper and is not above beating up a suspect to get answers.  Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) loves the spotlight; he's the technical consultant for a TV show and takes bribes from a gossip columnist.  Exley (Guy Pearce) is a young, straight-arrow cop who wants to live up to his late father's reputation.  Together, they investigate some murders that may involve a high-priced call-girl (Oscar-winner Kim Basinger).<br /><br />This movie is often described as a "film noir," and that kept me from seeing the movie for a long time.  But I do like the movie a lot; the actors are all wonderful and there are several twists to the story.  It is an ensemble piece; the four stars give exciting, yet understated performances, and James Cromwell, as the police captain, and Danny De Vito, as the tabloid writer, are also outstanding.  This is a trip back to days of "Dragnet," with interesting characters, some violence, and lots of suspense.  Heartily recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>As someone who lives in LA, it was a flash to the past with this film. I can not recommend this film too much! Some films just seem to have the magic touch, where everything seems to push it toward excellence. The writing , photography, location selection, musical score, direction, the selection of the cast,the actors dedication in this film are top drawer. This film just shows what Hollywood could do but usually does'nt.<br /><br />This film I believe will stand the test of time as one of the great classics of film.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Winner of two Academy Awards, and nominated for seven others, LA Confidential was the surprise thriller of 1997. Prior to American Beauty and Gladiator, Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe starred in this seedy crime and suspense film - one of the best of the decade. Set against the backdrop of 1950's Hollywood and the celebrity culture of that era (quite indistinguishable from the celebrity culture of this era), LA Confidential projects a LA police department filled with corruption and a town obsessed with acquiring fame, money, and celebrity at any cost.<br /><br />When members of imprisoned mob boss Mickey Cohen's gang start showing up dead, it's up to three cops on the LA police force to get to the bottom of the mystery. Their superior, Capt. Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) convinces wiseguys from other parts of the country to go home. It seems that someone is moving in on Cohen's underworld territory, but who? The police are led to the home of wealthy developer Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a prostitution ring of Hollywood look-alikes.<br /><br />The investigative task falls to three cops, each of whom goes about his business in a different way. Deputy Lt. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) is a by-the-book officer, following in the footsteps of his dead father - a former cop himself who was mysteriously murdered. Officer Wendell 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe) is a vigilante agent of law enforcement who believes in personally exacting justice and punishing those who fail to subscribe to his own perceived morality. As the son of a wife-beater, White has zero tolerance for abusers of any type. And rounding out the three is Sgt. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a self-absorbed cop in search of Hollywood celebrity (he consults for TV shows on the side) and money. In the end, these three men of differing realities must come together if they hope to uncover the truth surrounding these mysterious killings.<br /><br />In the meantime, the conflict between the three men and Capt. Smith heats up. Each must wage a personal battle against the fraternity culture of the police force, the bureaucratic machine, and the rampant corruption that infests every corridor of city hall. Along the way, Bud White strikes up a relationship (as does Exley) with one of the prostitutes from the investigation, Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), which complicates the investigation and compromises his judgment. But when a break in the case takes place, Exley and White put their differences aside and work together to solve the case...<br /><br />With a surprise ending that's one of the best of the decade, LA Confidential is a cinematic masterpiece. Wrought with symbolism, and sporting a well-written screenplay, the film captured critical acclaim as well as box office success. Highly entertaining, and dripping with suspense, LA Confidential more than qualifies for its designation as a must-see film. If you haven't seen it, then don't wait another minute longer...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>I've been watching movies for almost 60 years, and "L.A. Confidential" is one of the most wildly entertaining films I've ever seen. It was so much fun, I didn't want it to end. (It's anything but a comedy -- but it's fun.)<br /><br />The story borrows elements commonly found in "hard-boiled" detective fiction: loose dames, prostitution and pornography, homosexuality, police corruption, murdered partners, etc, etc, etc. It is, at least superficially, a broad re-imagining of "The Big Sleep", with an idealistic (but ambitious and hard-nosed) police officer (roughly) standing in for Sam Spade. Of course, given the nature of such novels, these similarities are to be expected. (There is no murdered chauffeur, however.)<br /><br />The director wanted to stay away from "noir" tone and clich&eacute;, and he succeeds. Though set in 1953, "L.A. Confidential" seems modern. The performances -- from actors largely unknown at the time -- are perfect. One could not even imagine better.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is a beautiful transfer, well-capturing the varied visual moods of LA and surroundings (as discussed in one of the excellent supplements). Some moments, though, appear to have been badly underexposed (as suggested by gray, rather than black backgrounds). Whether this was intentional is not clear, and it doesn't really detract.<br /><br />Unless you're offended by the violence or subject matter, unreservedly recommended.<br /><br />There is one rather surprising error -- "When Worlds Collide" was released in 1951, not 1953.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>L.A. Confidential has everything, 1950's setting in Los Angeles, the L.A. Police Department, beautiful mysterious movie look-alikes, a quirky dirt magazine reporter, smart quick dialogue,perfect ensemble, and unexpected traps in every corner.<br /><br />Director Curtis Hanson does a fantastic job showing the two-faces of Los Angeles.  His view of the city and the perfect tone of the dark, exciting story grab you at the start.  The city of dreams is caught as well as the dark side.  The beginning is narrated by Danny DeVito who elaborates on L.A. glamour, sun and fun, ritzy homes and Hollywood celebrities and hopefuls.  Danny plays a reporter for "Hush-Hush" magazine so he also shows the duplicity of L.A. with its high-class hookers, murders, and corrupt cops.<br /><br />L.A. Confidential shows how hard it is to know who you can trust, who is watching your back or the criminals.  There are three detectives (Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey) who are smart and clever in their own unique ways.  They are investigating a coffee-shop mass murder and as each thread of evidence unravels, they discover more and more corruption in the Police Department.<br /><br />The three detectives use their own unique personalities and tactics to delve into the investigation of a mass murder at a small coffee shop.  The tenor and quality of the movie holds up throughout.  The pacing is quick and the viewer needs to give each scene total attention as the threads of evidence and relationships are tightly and well woven.<br /><br />Kim Basinger is fantastic as the Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute.  She knows how to deliver and it gives the film a integrity that is hard to replicate.<br /><br />All the actors do a top notch job - Basinger, Crowe, Cromwell, DeVito, Strathairn, Spacey, Crowe and Pearce.<br /><br />A standing ovation for the perfect screen version masterpiece mystery!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A worthy successor to Chinatown and the movie that should have won Best Picture in 1998, L.A. Confidential is an elegantly directed and expertly acted movie (before Kevin Spacey blew up and Russell Crowe became Russell Crowe) that rewards those who watch it more than once, but please just make sure you watch it at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>I keep getting this confused, when people are talking about it, with Chinatown - and no wonder. The similarities are striking, but the biggest is that both movies are terrific.<br />LA Confidential is a gritty tale of scandal, betrayal, corruption, and that essential ingredient: sex.<br />Incredibly well-acted roles by a host of actors: Kim Basinger, Russell Crowe, Buy Pearce, the inimitable Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito - and that only scratches the surface.<br />Plenty of reviews go on and on about this movie - and for good reason.

I don't like her acting in most other films</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"L.A. Confidential" - a classic modern Film Noir - depicts a 1950s Los Angeles riddled with corruption and vice, where no-one can be trusted. Bud White (Russell Crowe) and Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) two "clean" cops with totally contrasting approaches to their work take a stand. Writer/Director Curtis Hanson and Co-Screenwriter Brian Helgeland superbly capture the flavour of the period. The casting is perfect right down to the small roles - and it is ironic that two Australian actors playing the "good" cops should work so well in this most American of genres.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>Prior to making this film noir classic in the tradition of "Chinatown", Curtis Hanson made 2 films which helped along with this film to elevate him to the A-list of directors--"The River Wild" & "The Bedroom Window" (a film noir in the tradition of Hitchcock).  With the success of this film (several Oscar nominations with a win for Kim Basinger and Best Picture/Director nod), Hanson went on to make the under-rated "Wonder Boys", "8 Mile" w/Enimen and the chick flick "In Her Shoes".  But none matched the success of this classic film noir based on a James Ellroy novel. Why?  For one thing he had a fool-proof cast with veterans, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito & James Cromwell matched with the 2 new Australian newcomers, Russell Crowe & Guy Pearce in their first all-American roles. Also Kim Basinger delivered a poignant Oscar winning performance as Hollywood prostitute who is redemned by her relationship with Crowe's character, Bud White.  Another plus is the sharp dialogue courtesy of Ellroy and the great score by Jerry Goldsmith.  If you liked "Chinatown"(which Goldsmith also contributed a memorable score) then you'll like this one.  Devotees of the book may balk at the happy ending of the film versus the book but perhaps that would've lessen the films chance for box off success--who knows. If it where not for the movie about that big boat that sank, this film would've copped the Best Picture Oscar!!  I can't wait for the Blu-ray release of this classic!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>A truly great "cops and robbers" movie has to have a strong plot, plenty of suspense, tough guys on both sides, a love interest, good directing, sharp dialogue, and enough twists and turns to keep us off-balance.  We don't always have to understand every step but we have to be able to put it together in the end.  Icing on the cake is when the acting is top-notch as well.  There have been a number of such movies over the years and I was very happy to see in "LA Confidential" the evidence that Hollywood can still make them.<br /><br />The term "Film Noir" is somewhat overused these days but it applies to "LA Confidential".  What makes it all the more interesting is how the film noir motif is coupled with modern-day perspectives on such things as race, vice, and ambition.  This movie would have been a good 30 minutes shorter if made in the 1950's but it is a better film for its' extended analysis of its' surroundings.  The mystery becomes more personal as we get a better understanding of the characters.  That, too, is aided by the quality of acting.  For me, the top kudos go to Kevin Spacey (who hasn't always impressed me in other movies) and Kim Bassinger.  Newcomer Guy Pearce was probably a bit mis-cast and James Cromwell may have had too much trouble trying to shake off his character in "Babe".  Russell Crowe gives one of his better preformances and is more audible than he is in later movies.  The ubiquitous Danny DeVito got to be a bit much at times but we were supposed to dislike him anyway.  Altogether they keep us rivited to the action on film all the way to the very end.  In the process we get comments on racial injustice, police corruption, immorality in high places, yellow journalism, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />This is a movie I enjoy seeing again.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>What a throwback to the golden age of Film Noir! Even though the film is in color the drap texture and cinematography works wonders on the screen and the disc is a great transfer of a great film.

Not a great deal was paid attention to the films anti-hero, the guy who's presence makes every scene pop with an understated intelligence. His name is GUY PEARCE! This is his film and he knows it any guy that can take a scene from Crowe has to be good.This film won some Oscars but the one who stand out for a win is Basinger; for an actor who usually does ... her performance is a sleek as her hair!

Confidential was a good movie, but it wasn't great. Kevin Spacey is always good, but you'll see better Spacey roles in K-PAX, American Beauty, The Usual Suspects, Seven, Outbreak, and pretty much ANYTHING else with him! He certainly wasn't bad in L.A. Confidential, he just didn't stand out so much. Russell Crowe was fine in this as well. He has certainly improved his performance though with The Insider, Gladiator, and A Beautiful Mind. Guy Pearce was great in this, and he delivered the finest performance of the film. His better roles are Memento and The Count of Monte Cristo. Danny DeVito was his typical self. He is never a let down, but his better roles range from Matilda to Batman Returns to Hoffa. And then there's Kim Basinger. I LOVE Kim Basinger, but I have absolutely no idea why she won an Academy Award for this. I would have thought that this was one of her worse performances. Watch anything else with her, and her acting will stand out more than this! She was up against Minnie Driver's performance in Good Will Hunting for the award, and Driver was far more deserving of the award. Don't get me wrong, L.A. Confidential was a fine movie with fine performances, it just was not Oscar-worthy in any way. It wasn't amazing. It isn't a kid movie, and its R rating reflects violence, language, and some brief sexual images. This was fine to watch once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film opens in 1950s Los Angeles and introduces the people in this story. There is a pot bust of two minor movie stars, well planned to provide headlines. Some men are arrested for assaulting two policemen, and many officers beat them as summary punishment. Photographs of this create a scandal. The meeting tells how the deal is done: some win, some lose, and justice is done. Standards will be upheld for the future. There are two gunmen who are bumping off Mickey Cohen's gang members. Then there is a slaughter of people at a late-night restaurant. A senseless killing or a planned rub-out?<br /><br />The police investigate those connected to the people killed at the restaurant. Suspects are arrested, they have to get them to talk about what they did. Various methods are used. They get a lead and find another suspect. Detective White stops another criminal. Then the three suspects escape somehow. They are tracked down and a shoot-out finishes them off. "Shotgun Ed" wins an award for heroism. We see how a reformer politician can change his mind about a highway project. There is a plot to embarrass the D.A. by getting a young actor to meet him. When Detective Vincennes shows up he finds the young actor dead! Detective White follows up on Susan Lefferts and finds something in her Mom's basement. Exley and Vincennes investigate another case. Exley visits White's girlfriend and learns more about her. Vincennes makes an error in judgment, his last. Then pictures are given to White to enrage him. Exley does research on the murdered former cop Meeks who was found in the basement. Exley and White talk to the D.A. and get him to cooperate. Dudley Smith and Patchett may be in cahoots.<br /><br />Someone calls Exley and White to arrange them to meet at a motel; this is a trap. [All those shots and no one to hear them?] The two detectives hold off their attackers. There is a final resolution to the conflicts at the ending. Exley tells the facts about the crimes, there will be another cover-up, and another award for Lt. Exley. A happy ending? Sensational action masks a weak story.<br /><br />Scenes take place at night since outdoor scenes would show present-day LA. The film did not create the LA of 50 years earlier. It is loosely based on some real events from that era. One book about the "Black Dahlia Avenger" said newspapers and reporters cooperated in the 1940s, there would be no embarrassing pictures then. The ruling powers wanted new highways, no blackmail was needed. One anachronism was the powered garage door of Patchett. A real history book will give the facts about LA in that time, it would be better than fiction. Is the film better than the novel?</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>L.A. Confidential revives the glorious tradition of the film noir genre, or at least it tries.  It stars some of the most famous actors of the last few years, but none of them are interesting.  Basically it is the story of an honest cop caught in a corrupt police department.  Sound familiar?  A certain actor by the name of Al Pacino starred in a certain movie called 'Serpico'.  There are numerous fights and shootouts distracting the audience, making them forget the jumbled mess of the story.  'L.A. Confidential' jumps from one small story to the next without any kind of coherency.  There seemed to be no focus at all .  A love triangle exists between Bud White and Kim Basinger, but it is flat and contrived, and the only thing Basinger is good at is looking pretty.  All of a sudden the honest cop has sex with her.  Why in the world did he do this and what purpose does it serve?  I know what purpose it serves; it keeps the audience awake and distracts them even more.  An implausable shootout happens in the end where all the good guys survive and bad guys die.  And in the end the pretty girl kisses the hero.

Set in Los Angeles in the early 1950's, L.A. Confidential is a violent but gripping thriller which examines the dark underbelly and corruption of the city of LA, at a time when it still held a beautiful movie star image. Principally, this is the story of 3 very different cops, Bud White (Russell Crowe), Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) and Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), who have totally different ways of getting the job done. Each with their own agenda, each with their own character and each corrupt to a differing degree, their paths cross in this intricate but brilliantly plotted movie as they seek to find &quot;the coffee shop killers&quot; and solve the mystery of high class prostitutes &quot;cut&quot; to look like movie stars. Brilliantly directed by Curtis Hanson and based on a James Ellroy novel, LA Confidential also boasts an outstanding supporting cast including, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, Danny Devito and the Oscar winning Kim Basinger. The best film of 1998 and perhaps even the best film of the nineties, LA Confidential should have walked off with a barrowload of Oscars. Better than a thousand Titanic's (if you disagree you're wrong) , LA Confidential never fails to hit it's mark and is simply unmissable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>This stunning 1998 film got sunk by a certain vessel called TITANIC.  Curtis Hanson's brilliant adaptation of the James Ellroy novel did win two Oscars:  it's script by Hanson and Brian Helgeland and supporting actress for Kim Basinger.  But since TITANIC was such a "titanic" hit, LA CONFIDENTIAL lost the Best Picture Oscar, and it should have won.  There's nothing to find wrong in this blistering study of corruption, murder, prostitution and betrayal.  The male performers are simply outstanding:  Guy Pearce is mesmerizing as the idealistic cop who undergoes a metamorphosis; Russell Crowe is the "tough" cop whose fierce loyalty and brutality form his core; James Cromwell as the captain who takes Pearce under his wing; Kevin Spacey as the police consultant for the tv show, "Badge of Honor" and who suddenly sees the light when a male hooker is murdered; David Straithairn as the slimy founder of an elite hooker service; Danny DeVito as the magazine editor always chasing the big scoop; and of course Ms. Basinger who gives new meaning to the "hooker with a heart of gold" cliche.  She's the soft focus in this otherwise brutal film.  Although compared to CHINATOWN, I find LA CONFIDENTIAL an overall more engrossing film; it's rich in period detail, and has a brilliant cast.  Truly a classic film noir!</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>"LA Confidential" is a totally hardcore ride through the underside of human nature.  When I use "hardcore", of course, I refer to it in its adrenaline filled sense (as opposed to its "wonk-wonk" music meaning).  The setting of the film takes place in the "the gray area" between right and wrong.  There's so much deception and intrigue that it becomes practically impossible to guess as to what will happen in the end.<br /><br />Eventually, we see that, regardless of surface differences, the three main characters, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and Russell Crowe, are all united by their distain for the mercenary and extortionate atmosphere on the LA police force.  Early on, when we hear the chief say to Crowe, "I particularly admire your use of violence on the job," we know exactly why he acts as he does.  All three men have consciences and would prefer protecting and serving over the role they have been dealt.  They became policemen for the right reasons, but the wash of time eroded the clarity of what they stood for.<br /><br />Is this classic film noir?  Absolutely, and maybe better in quality than many of the classics.  The movie is so watchable that it seems to be over before it starts.  Not a shot or scene is wasted.  It's everything that a dud like "Cop Land" was not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>I saw this film on a holiday weekend when it first came out.  We were a group of five relatives and everyone had different tastes in film.  We finally decided to try this movie without much hope of anyone being too happy, but instead every single person loved it.  It is a thriller and a romance and a tale of good versus evil.  Set in 1950s Los Angeles and based to a small degree on actual events, this tale of corruption in Hollywood and the LAPD, with 80 speaking parts and 45 locations, deservedly won many awards. The cast is fantastic -- amazing that two young Australian actors held their own against veterans James Cromwell, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito -- but Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe made their big American splash with this film; Kim Basinger does her best work here, and the supporting cast is flawless.  Director Curtis Hanson preserves some of the elements of the traditional film noir, like voiceover, plot twists and hidden motives, while updating others, such as the use of more natural lighting and a more character-driven story.<p>DVD extras are plentiful and fun.  The soundtrack is in English or French, the subtitles in English, French or Spanish; there is also a music only soundtrack.  Extra features include: cast and crew credits; text and pictures covering the characters of Dragnet and Bloody Christmas, 1951 -- an event similar to that in the film; prices for various items in 1953; awards the film won; three television ads and a film trailer; a fun interactive map of 1950s LA; the screen tests of Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe; a 19-minute featurette, "Off the Record", with cast and crew interviews; and the 18-photos used by Curtis Hanson to visualize the project and to pitch the film to the producer and actors.<p>This is a terrific film and the many DVD extras make this edition even more attractive.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>There is a moment when career-climbing cop, Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), hears the name &quot;Rollo Tomasi&quot; and the camera is focused closeup on his face and his eyes and we see him shift, and with him, the whole movie shifts into high gear.  It is now one of the great, classic moments of recent cinema.  <p>Prior to that moment, Curtis Hanson and company had set the scene, believably and meticulously established the time and place (LA/Hollywood early 50's), delineated the main characters and given us a mystery within a mystery.  This was done with patience and care.  (And an overdue antidote to the sacharine view of the 1950's).<p>After that moment, the momentum and pace pickup and everything starts rolling as all the pieces begin to fall into place and we learn with our lead characters the thread that has tied all these disparate elements together, all leading to a helluva climax with one of the best shootouts ever staged.<p>I love this movie.  It truly does rank with Chinatown in the pantheon of all-time great modern noir mysteries.  There isn't a facet of filmaking that was missed or fudged in making this.  It is first rate in all departments (cast, cinematography, script, dialogue, set design, costume etc.).  Too bad it got lost in the phenomena of Titanic.<p>Anyway, like Chinatown, there isn't a thing I would change about this movie.  It's as close to perfect as you're going to get.  A true modern Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>As many people who collect DVD's know the movie studios are constantly rereleasing films in different packaging as a way to make more money. Sometimes the studios are guilty for squandering money from consumers when they release a film yet again on DVD, only with a different cover art and if the purchaser is lucky you might get some extra new bonus material. However, with the rerelease of "LA Confidential" the studio gave the film a complete overhaul, not only in the DVD art, but the film itself has been completely restored to impeccable quality and there are a ton of new bonus features. Buying this new set is like watching the film all over again!<br /> "LA Confidential" deals with the underbelly of Hollywood in the 1950's where sex, greed, political scandal, and murder are examined by a bunch of Los Angeles police detectives headed by a then-unknown Russell Crowe in one of his first big-screen acting gigs. Guy Pearce (known for playing a drag queen in "Priscilla-Queen of the Dessert) and Kevin Spacey are Crowe's partners-in-crime. The film is stolen by the convincing performance by Kim Bassinger who plays a sexy Hollywood starlette who happens to be a call-girl. This role won Bassinger the Oscar for Outstanding Supporting Performance by an Actress. The movie also won the Oscar for Best Screeenplay.<br /> Upon release in 1997 the movie was a huge financial success raking in nearly $130,000,000.<br /> The DVD is filled to the brim with extras including new interviews, commentary, and more and comes with a bonus CD that features music from the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Curtis Hanson's "L.A. Confidential," based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446674249">third book</a> in a series by James Ellroy, works so well because, unlike most neo-noir films, it's not a homage to the noir films of old.  In fact, it was probably the first true film noir to forget about its predecessors since the 1950s, the time period around which the film is set.  And it was just what a film noir should be: gritty, tough, unflinching, intricrate, and confounding.  Each of the film's leading actors, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey, as well as its lead actress, Kim Basinger, felt like they could've appeared in a film noir straight out of the 1940s.  It's this unnostalgic, straightforward approach that made "L.A. Confidential" so great.<br /><br />The storyline had a classic vibe to it: in 1950s L.A., three cops ferret out the corruption beginning to eat away at the police force.  How each of them does this differs.  You've got your good cop, played by Guy Pearce, a strictly by-the-book wannabe detective and the son of a legendary officer who died in the line of duty.  You got your bad cop, Russell Crowe, a violent star on the force, always on the edge and with a particularly nasty dislike for women abusers.  Then you have a cop who doesn't quite know where he stands, played by Kevin Spacey, except on the set of TV's number-one hit police drama "Badge of Honor," which he supervises.  One of the film's best scenes is when Pearce's character tells Spacey why he became a cop in an effort to convince Spacey to work with him.  Afterwards he asks, "Why did you become a cop?"  Spacey smiles sadly and sighs, "I don't remember."  Picking a favorite of this police trio is hard, because each is perfectly cast: Pearce as an inherently contemptable and ultimately honorable goody-goody, Crowe as an apparent maniac who is smarter than he looks and just trying to do what's right, and Spacey as the pitiful once-cop who's lost his way.<br /><br />But it seems like when most people remember "L.A. Confidential," they remember Kim Basinger, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.  She deserved it.  Basinger played a prostitute in high demand because she bears a strong resemblance to Veronica Lake (so does Basinger) - but there's much more to her than just a divine appearance.  Similarly, there's more to Basinger than just a fine body, and she proved it here with a surprisingly deep performance, particularly for a supporting role.<br /><br />With all that said, it's apparent that the film garnered much of its power from its sharp-cut characters.  There's no one who is clearly "good" the whole way through, but never once is a character in the grey: they're either good, or they're bad.  They are also some of the most realistic and human people ever to appear in a film noir.  The movie's script, by director Hanson and Brian Helgeland, finds a seamless balance between its characters and its story, and surprisingly holds very little of the snap, crackle n' pop dialog one expects in a film noir.<br />Jerry Goldsmith's score was the one homage the film allowed, with the same sort of morose brass you might expect in an old Bogey pic (and which distinctly recalls the same woeful trumpeting of Goldsmith's theme from Roman Polanski's own neo-noir, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSH">Chinatown</a>").  It was one of those elusive scores that adds life to each scene but also expands the film as a whole.<br /><br />There's something about the look of the film that hangs in my mind.  It may be the color scheme, which consists mostly of black but with the occasional surprise vibrance thrown in through a red or yellow.  Or perhaps it's the lighting, a bright light that makes what's in front of us perfectly clear and a surrounding black mist that begs the question: what does it hide within its shadows?  There is a scene in which Pearce's character pulls up in front of the Nite Owl bar.  That scene brings to mind the painting "Nighthawks" by Edward Hopper (which inspired the look of Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner").  Hanson took a very stylistic approach in his directing of the film, and much of that showed through its dark visuals.<br /><br />It wasn't all darkness, though.  One of the film's most memorable scenes involved an attempted interrogation by Pearce and Spacey at a popular club late at night.  They corner a mobster dating a girl they believe is a prostitute belonging to a popular company which advertises prostitutes who resemble celebrities, in this case Lana Turner.  As Pearce begins throwing out insults at the mobster and especially at his date, we notice Kevin Spacey holding back laughter in the background.  "A w---e who looks like Lana Turner is still a w---e," Pearce says.  The "prostitute" tosses her drink in his face and he stands there, soaked and incredulous, as Spacey says, "That IS Lana Turner."<br /><br />It came as little surprise that "L.A. Confidential" wasn't awarded the Oscar for Best Picture, but fortunately critics recognized it as one of the best films of 1997 and, more importantly, of the decade.  It wasn't only one of the best films of the decade, but one of the best films ever made, a stylish, gritty, cynical yet realistic noir drama that didn't look back at the classics which inspired it.  It didn't need to, because ten years later, we're still looking back at it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Hollywood in the 1940s: The LAPD is primed to forge a prestigious, competent public image when the incarceration of crime kingpin Mickey Cohen provides the opportunity to rid LA of organized crime.  Three officers symbolize the directions the department might take: Bud White (Russell Crowe), violent and flexible with his ethics; Ed Exley (Guy Pierce), a by-the-book opportunist; and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), plugged into the show business scene and eager to remain so.  A massacre at a coffee shop starts a series of events that will offer each of these morally conflicted men a measure of redemption.<br /><br />This film boasts a huge cast of characters and a complex storyline but never confuses.  Director/co-screenwriter Curtis Hansen deserves high praise, as does his marvelous cast.  This film has tremendous atmosphere and feels absolutely authentic.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>L.A. Confidential is a great film not because it is revolutionary, in terms of style nor approach, but because it is so uniformly excellent in every area. It is one of those films that stands in counterpoint to the director as auteur, although surely a different director would have made a different film. The point is that the material is so good that it's one of those can't miss films. It also exemplifies that the most revolutionary thing in art is greatness, especially sustained greatness. Any work of art, and any artist, has to be judged in this manner, since it is the only objective way to evaluate things. Notions like revolutionary or daring are too subjective. What was revolutionary often becomes clich&eacute;d. True originality resists easy mimicry and subsequent triteness.<br /><br />  A good example of this comes from two earlier films that this one is most compared to: Roman Polanski's Chinatown (1974), and Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994). While both of these are good films, neither is great. Chinatown is far less complex than L.A. Confidential, and almost wholly dependent upon lead actor Jack Nicholson's abilities. Quick- other than John Huston, name me an actor from that film. See? It's also a far less realistic film, and far more dependent upon style. Even more style-dependent is Pulp Fiction, a film almost devoid of realism. In fact, even though it is based on a novel, whereas Serpico was based upon real life events across the continent, and two decades later, L.A. Confidential is really an extension of that Al Pacino film's exploration of evil. Both show that all the cops are criminals of one sort or another. Only degree of criminality is in question. In both films, the leads win, but pay for victory with extreme loss. This is why Curtis Hanson's film is better than the two films it's most compared to by critics, and holds up well against the more realistic drama of Serpico. It's also why, compared to the violence, especially in Pulp Fiction, that in this film is never gratuitous. It always is at a minimum, within the bounds of character and circumstance, and advances the story, even if just in a small way. Also, the fact that all the cops, even the `good ones,' are criminals, is something just not seen in most films of the last few decades of Right Wing hagiography of all who wear uniforms.<br /><br />  When this film came out, in 1997, it was one of the few films that I ever saw twice in a theater. After having seen it once with a female friend, I recommended it to other friends, and went to see it again with them. In watching it a couple of times over the years, and for review, it is one of those films that has many things in its backgrounds, many moments that become `Aha' moments upon rewatch, and make the viewer re-evaluate just what the film is doing and why. This is the definition of depth. Yes, the film is not as existential as Ingmar Bergman's Shame, nor is it as innovative as Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, nor does it present reality as closely and achingly as Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story, but its uniform excellence, and ability to do even its genre moments well (I recall pumping my fist and going, `yeah!" when Exley shoots Smith in the back at my first viewing), and recast clich&eacute;s as something different (bright lights noir), are among the many reasons this film rises to greatness. I would not go so far as the hagiographizing Andrew Sarris, in casting all crime films as pre- and post-L.A. Confidential, because the film does as much to celebrate film noir as it does to recast it, but it certainly is one of the best Hollywood films of the last thirty years or so. It is also the high point of director Curtis Hanson's rather pedestrian career, and the only one of his films to ever come near and surpass greatness, another argument that auteurism is not the only way to get a great work of cinema made for, without the contributions of those mentioned, this film would likely still have been a good one, but great? I doubt it. Regardless, L.A. Confidential is a great film, one of the best crime drams ever filmed. See it. Or else.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In the 1950's Los Angeles is the seedy backdrop for this intricate noir-ish tale of police corruption and Hollywood sleaze. Three very different cops are all after the truth, each in their own style: Ed Exley, the golden boy of the police force, willing to do almost anything to get ahead, except sell out; Bud White, ready to break the rules to seek justice, but barely able to keep his raging violence under control; and Jack Vincennes, always looking for celebrity and a quick buck until his conscience drives him to join Exley and White down the one-way path to find the truth behind the dark world of L.A. crime. "L.A. Confidential" is brilliant. The screenplay and direction are second-to-none. The performances by the ensemble cast are also superb. When a movie evokes an era as well as L.A. Confidential does, people take notice. If you are a fan of crime-drama and detective stories, you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>This Curtis Hanson flick was sunk by TITANIC at oscar time ( though, I personally, much preferred this gritty, suspenseful, crime-thriller ). The movie has a dream cast, a tight-as-nails script ( by Hanson, and Brian Helgeland ), and fabulous cinematography. The dialogue crackles, and the characters include heroes in varying shades of gray ( Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce ), a fragile femme fatale ( Kim Basinger was never better ), and suave, to coldly monstrous villains. The action is well-paced, and the tension mounts steadily. I loved THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but L.A. CONFIDENTIAL blew me away.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Film noir continues to be one of the most difficult genres to make well particularly today (I'd note for purists that film noirs are largely in black & white a fixture of the genre). Film directors can't hide the flaws of a noir behind big explosions, car chases or visual effects. "L.A. COnfidential" probably isn't for everyone because it combines the film noir genre with a solid mystery and strong dramatic performances.<br /><br />Set in Los Angeles during the early 1950's, "L.A. Confidential" opens with a bang quite literally--Three very different detectives the by-the-book golden boy Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), the hard nosed violent Bud White (Russell Crowe) and the celebrity obsessed Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey)try and unravel the conspiracy behind a seemingly random shotgun slaying at a popular diner and how it is tied into the murders of organized crime kingpin Mickey Cohen's gang. The three detectives make a reluctant team hoping to solve the crime and achieve their own personal agendas in the process. They also must find out how Lynn Bracken (Kim Bassinger) a hooker who looks like Veronica Lake and a cavalcade of other hookers made up to look like Hollywood stars figure into all of this.<br /><br />Well directed by Curtis Hansen from a terrific script by Brian Helgeland and Hansen that manages to adapt James Ellroy's novel without betraying its story or atmosphere, "L.A. Confidental" was nominated for a bucket load of Oscars winning two for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress (Kim Bassinger). The entire cast is terrific from Crowe to Danny DeVito who plays Sid Huggins the editor of the scandal rag L.A. Confidential. Spacey plays oily Vincennes with confidence and style while Crowe embodies the brutal force of Bud White. Pearce who plays Exley the son of a highly regarded murdered police officer gives depth to a character that could easily have been cookie cutter.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks positively stunning particularly. How does this look in comparison to the 1998 original DVD release? There's greater detail and sharpnes. The original DVD was one of the best transfers of its era (and still holds up remarkably well). The new DVD also looks sharper but the Blu-ray manages to capture the golden cinematography Oscar nominated Dante Spinotti perfectly.<br /><br />We get a great mix of previously released extras ported over from the first "Special Edition" when DVDs were still being released in snapcases to some stunning brand new ones as well. The best here is the audio compilation of comments by the director, cast and crew. Although it isn't as fascinating as a scene specific commentary track, it allows each important member of the creative team to give their thoughts on shooting the film, the characters and the story.<br /><br />"Whatever You Desire" is a brand new 30 minute documentary on the making of the film. "Sunlight to Shadows" another new extra focuses on the cinematography. "The Cast" is pretty self explanatory focuses on the seven main characters and two relative "unknowns"-Pearce and Crowe. "From Book to Screen" gives us Hansen and Helgland discussing the difficulty of translating Ellroy's terrific novel to the screen without sacrificing too much of the story or characters. We also get two very neat extras--"L.A. Confidential" a 2003 pilot for a TV series that was to star Keifer Sutherland and a second disc that gives us a sampler of the soundtrack featuring the following songs: Johnny Mercer and the Pied Pipers -- "Ac-Cent-tchu-ate The Positive"<br />Chet Baker -- "Look for the Silver Lining"<br />Betty Hutton -- "Hit the Road to Dreamland"<br />Kay Starr -- "Wheel of Fortune"<br />Jackie Gleason -- "But Not For Me"<br />Dean Martin -- "Powder Your Face With Sunshine<br /><br />The DVD set has three discs if you count the sampler while the Blu-ray has two. A terrific 10th Anniversary reissue I'm glad this reissue wasn't kept off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>One of the most hard-hitting, compulsively watchable movies of the '90s is this complex story of crime and police corruption amid lavish life-styles in and around the Hollywood of the 1950s. Never read the James Ellroy novel but I understand it's even more complex and contains even more sub-plots than the film--so you have to admire the screenplay that manages to dovetail all the main details together in a way that leads to a smashing climax.<br /><br />Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey do standout jobs in the leads--and Guy Pearce is riveting as the intensely ambitious man who eventually joins forces with Crowe to solve the crime. James Cromwell is chilling as the Chief of Detectives, as is Danny DeVito as a tabloid journalist.<br /><br />Kim Basinger is good as the Veronica Lake look-alike--but did she really deserve an Oscar for this? This kind of hard-hitting shoot-em-up melodrama is a throwback to the Cagney and Robinson crime epics of the '30s--but the gore is more graphic and the sadism more intense. Not one for the kiddies--but mature audiences should find this a knockout.<br /><br />And yes, nice use of old pop hits--but "Accentuate the Positive" belongs to the early 1940s, as does Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo hairdo. The story is set in the early '50s, but by 1952 that Johnny Mercer hit was ancient history and Lake was no longer using that style.<br /><br />And one more minor quibble: the Lana Turner look-alike did not in any way resemble the real LT. I'm sure all of Lana's fans would agree on that one! Lana had a much classier look and finer features.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I hate violence and usually stay away from movies that have as much bloodshed at this one does.  I just picked it up in a hurry from the local library and stuck it in the DVD played for entertainment while I did a sink full of dishes.  At a few points I thought of stopping it but for some reason kept it running.  By the time I got to the pots and pans (I had a Lot of dishes) I was actually enjoying it.  Then, I sat down on the couch and started paying attention to it.  To my surprise, by the time the movie was finished I was wishing I had watched it more carefully from the top.<br /><br />Others here have written some great reviews, eg. that of Tom Benton, so I'm not going to bother to duplicate their efforts.  This is just to give encouragement to others who are not violence fans that they might actually like this, too.  What saves it, besides the exciting twists and turns in the plot, are the very well written characters.  The actors are superb in bringing these guys to life.  I disagree with those who complained about Kim Basinger's performance; I thought she was perfect for the role.<br /><br />For what it is, this is a very well made movie.  I certainly agree that it deserved an Oscar more than Titantic did.  I guess I'm with-holding one star, though, just on principle---it really did have an awful lot of blood and I have to wonder if it's a good thing to put these images into our minds. (spare me nasty comments, please! :-) )</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>Does it get any better than this? Film Noir in Color!  This movie is a film noir with natural lighting. This not only applies to the sets.

Watching Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pierce (playing cops as different as you can imagine) each pursue the same case in their own ways is captivating entertainment. Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and James Cromwell also turn in notable performances. I saw this in the theater when it first came out and I have seen it several times since then on DVD. It only gets better with each subsequent viewing. Note: If you love a move with great music, then you are in for a treat with this one.

That runs a close second to the 1994 debacle when "Pulp Fiction" lost the award to "Forrest Gump."  People make mistakes, and I'm trying to forgive them. Anyway, this gem of a film was nominated for 9 Oscars, and the Academy members saw fit to give it 2, one for Best Supporting Actress(Basinger) and the other for Best Adapted Screenplay.  The script is so razor-sharp that it is no wonder director Curtis Hanson collected what I think is one of the greatest ensembles in film history for the cast of the film.  Every actor here is excellent.  If I were a teacher of film studies, I would show this film long before "Citizen Kane."  This is classic film-noir with a bevy of interesting characters, an intricate plot with twists galore, outstanding direction and cinematography, and brilliant acting everywhere.  I simply cannot recommend this film highly enough.  This is a genuine masterpiece.  "You heard it here first, dear readers.  Off the record, on the Q.T., and very...Hush-Hush."</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Almost every character in the is film is corrupt. Reasons vary, of course, but there are the usual suspects: money, power, ego, greed, sex, ambition, and fear. This film probably launched Russell Crowe's career in the role of always cynical and sometimes dangerously violent Detective Bud White who has his own concept of justice just as Detective Harry Callahan does. White's partner, Detective Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), is far more calculating and self-serving, willing to advance his career at whatever cost. Detective Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is their associate and to me, the most interesting character in the film. He maintains a high level of efficiency without ever placing himself in harm's way. He serves as technical advisor to a television series and has a payola deal with Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito): let him know whenever a celebrity is about to be arrested so that Hudgeons can obtain an on-site  photo exclusive for his tabloid, Hush Hush. Meanwhile, having fallen in love with Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) who bears a striking resemblance to Veronica Lake, White learns about a unique prostitution ring whose other members also resemble other film stars. (One awkward scene in the movie suggests that Lana Turner was unaware of the ring.) Separately, White and Exley eventually penetrate more deeply and more dangerously the corruption in Hollywood during the 1950s, corruption which includes the L.A.P.D. And then....<br /><br />This is a classic, in some respects "noir" police film, ably directed by Curtis Hanson. Some have compared it with The Big Sleep, Chinatown, and even Training Day but I think there are more differences than similarities between any them. Basinger received an Academy Award for best supporting actress and Hanson shared an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay (of James Ellroy's brilliant novel) with Brian Helgeland. Years from now, this film may have more historical than dramatic interest but, so far, it has held up well as first-rate entertainment for those such as I who enjoy this genre of film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>Don't hate it because it's beautiful.

Kevin Spacey portrays Jack Vincennes, a flashy-dressing cop who advises a &quot;Dragnet-&quot;style show and, thanks to sleazy journalist Danny DeVito, gets to make headline-grabbing drug busts. And Guy Pearce is Edmund Exley, the ambitious cop whose fortunes rise as his righteousness declines; classic noir &quot;deal with the devil&quot; stuff where the clean-as-a-whistle hero ends up covered with the muck he starts to rake.  It also features perennial favorite character actor James Cromwell as Capt. Dudley Smith, Exley's mentor,  and a character very different from the kindly  farmer he played in &quot;Babe.&quot; <p> And what a plot- it propels itself through a vividly realized City of Angels where capped teeth and brightly-lit movie premieres alike hide dark secrets.  White, Vincennes and Exley get themselves thoroughly embroiled in organized crime, blackmail, prostitution, police and civic corruption and  murders.  Features an unforgettable ending as master politician Exley joins White in a motel room shootout and has to make certain moral choices that will forever alter his life and career, and the Los Angeles police force itself.

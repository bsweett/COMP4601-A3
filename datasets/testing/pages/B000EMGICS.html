"Rumor Has It..." could have been played a lot broader, especially when you are talking about Shirley MacLaine playing the role of the woman who was the model for Mrs. Robinson.  This could have been a farce (remember the sequel idea that Buck Henry pitches at the start of "The Player"?), but it ends up being a romantic comedy that actually places a premium on the characters more than the comedy.<br /><br />The movie is set a decade ago so that Sarah Huttinger is old enough to basically be Jennifer Aniston's age. As we all know from the trailer, Sarah discovers that her family is the basis for the Robinsons in the book that became the movie.  Her grandmother, Katharine Richelieu (MacLaine) is the original Mrs. Robinson, which makes Sarah's mother, Jocelyn Richelieu (seen only in flashback so that the image of Katharine Ross persists), "Elaine" in the configuration.  The immediate question is who then is "Benjamin Braddock."  When Sarah goes to visit her Aunt Mimi (an uncredited Kathy Bates) to find out about the skeletons in the family closet, lights come on and suddenly the finger of fate points to Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner).<br /><br />Obviously there are some differences between "The Graduate" and the story of the Huttinger family.  Instead of "Benjamin" rescuing "Elaine" at the church from marrying "Carl," what happened was a week before Jocelyn married Earl Huttinger (Richard Jenkins), she ran off to Mexico to be with Beau.  Then she came back, got married, and eight-and-a-half months later had Sarah.  Jeff Daly (Mark Ruffalo), who is engaged to Sarah, points out the implications of the math.  Consequently, Sarah has to track down Beau and ask the big question: Are you my daddy?<br /><br />Such a scene could be played for laughs, or certainly more laughs than director Rob Reiner goes for in this 2005 film.  What I found most interesting about this film is that the best moments are not really comedic and ultimately "Rumor Has It..." is waiting to give Jennifer Aniston her moment.  The first moment comes when she confronts Beau, but it is really his scene and before he ever gets around to going for the hat trick he deals honestly with her situation (Costner is building on what he accomplished in "The Upside of Anger" as a supporting player).  The second comes when her father tells her the rest of the story that she thought she knew.  Then we come to the end of the film when Sarah finally has her moment and actually the film I was thinking about at that point was "Notting Hill."<br /><br />"Rumor Has It..." is an enjoyable film because it is a gimmick film that does not overplay its hand (nice use of the opening guitar licks from "Mrs. Robinson").  It knows that these are not the character from "The Graduate," but that some-and not all-of them are real people on whom the story was based.  The fact that Jocelyn has been dead since Sarah was nine, and that Sarah is now older than her mother was when she died, become key parts of the dynamic.  The great irony here is that Sarah proves to be her mother's daughter, but not in the way she thought and not the way in which this movie would lead you to believe.  Team Aniston is still looking for a cinematic home run and this is not it, but it is nice ground-rule double and you have to admit, she is one of the best weepers of her generation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>Very slow and rather clich&eacute;.

The movie has engaging actors, Aniston and Costner are very good. I smiled rather than laugh through the movie. Aniston pulls off the character, who played by anybody else would be an unlikeable character. You still like Aniston even though she treats her boyfriend like trash for most of the movie. Costner plays it just right, handsome, charming, and a bit of a rascal. You believe the women of this family falling for him.<br /><br />The movie in the last analysis is cotton candy. You really don't care that much if the main character gets together with lawyer boyfriend. It was a pleasant way to spend two hours, but they should have played more Simon and Garfunkel music. It would have helped.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>This is a slightly above-average romantic comedy, but would have been much less so if it weren&#8217;t for the luminescence of the star power assembled by Rob Reiner.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston plays Sarah Huttinger, a cutesy-pie, ditsy and often confused young woman, who is engaged to a perfect man (Mark Ruffalo) but who is unsure of her feelings towards marriage.  Now living in New York, she and her fianc&eacute; travel to her hometown of Pasadena to attend her sister&#8217;s wedding, and while there, events lead Sarah to the shocking revelation that her family may have inspired the story of &#8220;The Graduate&#8221;, and that the timing of her birth raises a few questions about her biological father.<br /><br />Her mother having passed away when she was nine, Sarah confronts her grandmother (a show-stealing brilliantly cast Shirley MacLaine), and then sets off on a man-hunt for Beau Burroughs (an unbelievably charming and entertaining Kevin Costner), the man who inspired the Benjamin Braddock character.<br /><br />Doing her detective work efficiently, she tracks him to San Francisco, where he puts some of her fears to rest on the one hand, but stirs up a hornet&#8217;s nest with the other.  Her relationship with her fianc&eacute; deteriorates rapidly, but when she is called upon to calm her sister&#8217;s anxieties about marriage, she realizes that she should listen to herself sometimes on matters of the heart.<br /><br />A shaky script that is admirably supported by the cast, but all the kudos belong to Shirley MacLaine who made this movie watchable.<br /><br />Hey hey hey.- 3.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, June 12, 2006</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Is he or isn't he?

There, she meets millionaire playboy Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner) who had relations with both her mother and grandmother, an incident that might have influenced the '60s movie "The Graduate."<br /><br />"Rumor Has It" is a lackluster film from Jennifer Aniston that fails to take advantage of its interesting premise. The movie had all the right ingredients to be an entertaining ride. Good cast, good director, engaging premise and a talented screenwriter.  The film was not very funny and they recycled the same jokes over and over again. How many jokes about Pasadena can you have in the first twenty minutes?  The more serious scenes were deathly dull and this has a lot to do with the fact that all the characters were unlikable and uninteresting. The actors all appeared bored on screen and only one person gave a good performance.<br /><br />The ending was expected and a little unbelievable actually.  In the end, "Rumor Has It" is simply a weak film that's not really worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) flies cross country with her finance', Jeff (Mark Ruffalo), to be at her sister's wedding.  She narrates all her apprehension as she reflects that she has little in common with her wealthy Pasadena family.  Interlaced are scenes for the alleged inspiration of the movie, 'The Graduate,' and the key triangle romance between Dustin Hoffman's character, the mother and the daughter.  She believes she is the product of its inspiration.  This sets us up for a playful backdrop for the plot of 'Rumor Has It...'<br /><br />When she arrives all of her goofy alienation comes to haunt her, but it is during the wedding reception that she hears some suggestive information:  Her mother had an affair just before her wedding, and, doing some math, she calculates that her misfit status may be hereditary.  Her father may have been her mother's lover on a trist in Mexico just before she married.  Grandma Catherine (Shirley MacClaine) has all the low-down.  She has the year book that shows a picture of Class of '59 ladies' man, Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), her mother's fling thing before marriage.  Most of the film sets up the funny investigation as she meets her mother's lover.  (She passed away neatly enough when Sarah was nine, so Beau is her only recourse.)  We get mixed messages, but Sarah is taken on flight, romantically and literally, by this jet-set philanderer.  The answers do come about with a telling confrontation between Grandma are 'her' ex-lover, Beau!  Then, one of the best scenes is saved between father and daughter.  Showing beautiful tenderness, Jennifer Anniston proves that she's an actress who can, as in can be more than a skillful hair-brained comic screen presence.<br /><br />Shirley MacClaine is always welcome.  This time she dials it up two notches as an even more abrasive part than her classic Aurora Greenway role in 'Terms of Endearment'.  Bluntly crude, Grandma Catherine is blurt-out funny as are many of the lines delivered in this warmly engaging adult comedy.  Kevin Costner takes a stepping stone to his comeback with his low-key, yet suave performance as Beau.  (Although I think he is even better in his latest adventure 'The Guardian'.)  The treatment of possible incest and infidelity during engagement is given both sensitive and comedic treatment.  Often cutesy, but never banal, 'Rumor Has It...' is a rejuvenating film.  Rob Reiner, as usual, delivers a heartwarming comedic hand, and it is to his credit that the world often seems like a  better place after watching another one of his movies.

Kevin Costner is great once again and Jennifer Aniston gives what could be her best performance to date.<br /><br />For those that ever wondered what happened after "The Graduate" - after as in the next 30 years - then "Rumor" is a movie you need to see.  Funny, dramatic, it draws you in and makes you not want to miss a scene.

She goes home for her sister's wedding and discovers that her family is the real-life version of the Robinsons from the classic movie "The Graduate".  Though this seems highly unlikely, it serves as a rather interesting premise for the movie.  Since her mother died when she was nine, Anniston has searched for her own identity and she has wondered if her parents were truly happy in her marriage.  She looks for the answer to this enigma, and in dong so, she is able to make her own decision about her future.  This is a charming film with a delightful cast (particularly Shirley MacLaine as Aniston's grandmother) and is definitely a cut above most romantic comedies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>With Jennifer Aniston, it always seems you know what's going to happen in a film. There's never a mystery of surprise in any movie I've seen her in. Terrible acting. Kevin Costner and Shirley MacLaine's parts weren't any funnier. I'll save you time here. THIS REVIEW NOT HELPFUL.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D.html">A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D</a><br/><p>The Graduate is a classic cult film, and since this movie was based on it, I was hoping for the best, but not expecting much.  I was never more wrong!  Jennifer Aniston was refreshing, but I had dry heaves when she slept with a man her mother and grandmother did especially when she thought at first he could be her father.  That is just not entertaining in any situation.  Kevin Costner was good in his role, but the ewwww factor was too much.  Mark Ruffalo gave probably his best performance to date.  The most surprising performance was from Shirley MacLaine, and she was absolutely fabulous.  She held her own in every scene.  It didn't matter who she shared screen time with, she stole the limelight.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I know that the critical reception to "Rumor Has It" was very chilly, but something about the idea of the film really appealed to me.  The concept, the plot conceit, is a genuinely clever notion. Being a fan of "The Graduate," I was interested to see how well they would integrate the "characters" of that film with the "real life" counterpoints in this film.  I mean, come on, Shirley MacLaine representing Mrs. Robinson and Kevin Costner as Ben Braddock--seems like a great idea!  But, alas, when all is said and done--an amusing and well conceived setup did not equal a satisfying movie experience, for me.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston returns to her Pasadena homestead with her new fiance, played by Mark Ruffalo.  Plagued with doubts about her engagement, and seemingly disengaged from any real affection for her own family, she hears a rumor that leads her to suspect that the book and film of "The Graduate" were based on her deceased mother's experiences.  Confirming that her grandmother (MacLaine) was indeed the "Mrs. Robinson" character, she deduces that her mother had a fling prior to marrying her father.  Thus, with the notion that she might be the daughter of this man--she sets off to find the truth.  Encountering Costner, as the potential daddy and "Ben Braddock" character, she discovers truths about herself and her family.<br /><br />All of this plays out very routinely, but the supporting actors are engaging and comfortable.  It's always great to see MacLaine, but she offers nothing new or inventive in this performance--it's the standard brassy MacLaine persona we've come to expect.  Costner continues to embrace his middle-aged status and has, thus, developed into a far more interesting actor than he used to be.  (But for a more nuanced and astute role, check him out in "The Upside of Anger" with the luminous Joan Allen.)  And Mark Ruffalo, a great serious actor, continues to play lightly as a romantic leading man.  Recently cast with Witherspoon, Garner, and now Aniston in lightweight fluff--I do miss the more challenging roles he used to take on.<br /><br />But it is Aniston's character, to me, that is a despicable movie creation--one that I've seen all too frequently, but this one is supposed to be endearing.  Born into a life of privilege, she has accomplished nothing in her 30+ years and has become a self-involved and unpleasant "Woman-child."  She floats through her sister's wedding as if it's all some great inconvenience.  She doesn't think twice about mistreating a man who loves her.  She never acts on anything that doesn't blatantly promote her own self-interest.  I'm just so tired of it--it's not charming.  Don't get me wrong--there are plenty of "Man-child" movies too (more so, even) about men who still act as if they were adolescent.  But, think about those movies--the "Man-child" is an object of scorn and ridicule, we laugh at him.  But "Rumor Has It" doesn't ask you to laugh at Aniston's social ineptitude and selfishness--far from it--we're supposed to embrace it and identify with her as a real person.  Well, frankly, I wished everyone in Aniston's life would abandon her because of her behavior so that she'd learn to grow up.  But, of course, this is wish fulfillment--and she learns about life while retaining everything of value--there is never any consequence to being a nasty person.<br /><br />This gender double standard really bothers me, and the fact that I genuinely disliked the central character--obviously, I didn't care for this film.  Otherwise it would have been a fairly generic picture, but these two things caused me to feel strongly and negatively.  I am giving it an extra star for a good idea, but unfortunately, it didn't pan out for me.  KGHarris, 01/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I went to see this for Mark Ruffalo. Forget about Jennifer Aniston. I think Mark Ruffalo is the next big thing. This is a decent movie, but it's kind of slow and, well, just plain boring some of the time. And some of the time, you might just want to gag at the thought of a girl who sleeps with the same playboy that her mother and grandmother have also slept with. Yuck! I don't care if the playboy is played by Kevin Costner!<br /><br />Aniston plays Sarah, who is engaged to Jeff (Ruffalo) and living in NYC. Sarah has always felt like the oddball of her family. She's not quite blonde. She hates tennis. She has nothing in common with the people of her hometown, Pasadena. Her little sister is getting married, and even though Sarah is happy for her, she still feels out of place. That's when she begins to piece together the biggest mystery of Pasadena: Who exactly was the inspiration for the movie The Graduate? When she discovers that it was HER family, she goes on a wild goose chase to find the real life Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman's character in The Graduate). Turns out, that Benjamin Braddock is actually Beau Burroughs (Costner), and Sarah begins to wonder if there are genetic reasons for her familial displacement.<br /><br />This movie might not mean that much to you if you haven't seen The Graduate. Too much emphasis is put on this other movie, rather than the writer, directors, whatever actually focusing on THIS movie. Hell, it might not mean much to you if you have. It's an intriguing premise, but the whole let's-use-the-movie-The-Graduate-as-a-tag-to-get-people-to-see-this-movie, isn't that great of an idea. But still, if you like Aniston, Costner, Ruffalo, or MacLaine (who is the best part about this movie, aside from Ruffalo's goofy cuteness), check it out. RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Do you really care about another 30-something coming to grips with adulthood? Grow up. What a waste.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>There are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when I can see a bright future for Jennifer Aniston's light comedic talents, even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure "Friends" persona. She plays Sarah Huttinger, a likeably insecure New York Times obituary writer going home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie's wedding. Sarah is picture-pretty, 33 and engaged to a nice, unflappable guy named Jeff who accompanies her. At the same time, she's unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family. A ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family, her feisty, tart-tongued grandmother Katherine, who tells Sarah about her late mother's pre-wedding tryst in Mexico that gives rise to questions about Sarah's paternity.<br /><br />All the domestic shenanigans that ensue would probably be enough to fill this comedy's blessedly brief 96-minute running time, but screenwriter Ted Griffin hangs it all on the idea that Sarah's family may have been the inspiration for the Robinsons in Charles Webb's 1963 novel, "The Graduate", which of course, is the basis of Mike Nichols' classic 1967 movie. The tie-in must have sounded like a creative idea on paper, but something happened on the way to the screen that has taken most of the comic invention out of it. In fact, there is a pervasive lethargy throughout this movie, and director Rob Reiner is unable to overcome it because Sarah's dilemma of choosing between adventure and predictability never feels that emotionally resonant. The dialogue never feels sharp, perceptive or funny enough to pull off the inevitable comparisons with the earlier film. Moreover, the story is set rather arbitrarily in 1997 to make the timelines make sense with the stars' ages.<br /><br />Beyond Aniston, a strong cast has been set adrift. Playing Katherine like an even more embittered variation on Aurora Greenway, Shirley MacLaine crackles with aplomb as the possible inspiration for Mrs. Robinson, even when her lines are not as snappy as she thinks they are. As the aging but still magnetic Benjamin Braddock doppelganger, a high-tech mogul named Beau Burroughs, an overly sedate Kevin Costner barely registers in a smallish role. When he does, there is an insinuating, almost creepy quality in the way Beau's relationship with Sarah evolves. Until the end, Mark Ruffalo has little to do as Jeff but wait patiently for Sarah to resolve her personal dilemma. Richard Jenkins and Mena Suvari have even less time to make an impression in the underwritten roles of Sarah's passive father and bubbly sister, respectively. The 2006 DVD provides the original theatrical trailer (which gives away most of the plot) as its sole extra.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>A non-stop flight across country presents at least one big problem for the airlines: keeping the passengers reasonably happy and reasonably inert. Mass sedation is attractive but has other problems, and sometimes it's too early in the day for alcohol. The airlines' solution is to show movies like "Rumor Has It." It's amusing enough, safe enough for a cabin full of people with widely varying sensitivities, and 100% guaranteed not cause excitement of any kind. And it's available without a prescription.<br /><br />The premise is goofy, in a chick-flick kind of way. Sarah (Aniston), Katharine (Shirley MacLaine, and "don't call me grandma") and the family get together for the wedding of Sarah's neurotic sister. Somehow, Sarah digs into enough of the family girl-gossip to discover that Katharine was the original Mrs. Robinson, the one in the movie "The Graduate." She also comes to think (and hope) that the man who bedded both her grandmother and mother might be her biological father - and thus begins the quest.<br /><br />She of course finds him: Beau Burroughs (Costner). And finds him attractive, as did the two generations of women before her. And beds him, as did her mother and don't-call-me-grandmother. By screwing him, she also screws up her own relationship. After some inept running around, everyone ends up back where they belong, in a forgettably happy ending.<br /><br />There are a few amusing moments in the banter, including:<br />-- "Does every girl in my family have to go to bed with you?"<br />-- "They don't have to, they just do."<br />Aniston also delivers a bit of physical comedy that was almost enough to rouse a real laugh out of my torpid mind. (Don't worry, you'll recognize it when it comes.) Mostly, though, it's a two hour movie built around a ten minute joke. The almost-incestuous side of Sarah's affair with Beau creates some amount of tension, defused safely through humor and atoned for by Sarah's eventual contrition.<br /><br />On the whole, this movie delivers the three Ss that it was selected for: it's safe, silly, and sedative.<br /><br />--wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Aside from the black smudge that is Kevin Costner (who actually doesn't turn in an awful performance in this dud of a film), I expected a lot from the cast here.  I mean, we're talking about screen goddess Shirley MacLaine (I worship her), underrated supporting player Mark Ruffalo and America's Sweetheart Jennifer Aniston (you know, before we knew that Rachel Greene was the only character she knew how to play).  Anyways, this embellished fable that rests on the cuffs of a GREAT movie (`The Graduate') serves up an interesting concept with absolutely no real effort made to flesh out something remotely interesting.  `The Graduate' was sharp and witty and poignant and, believe it or not, charming.  This film NEEDED charm to sell its prose, and you would think that Aniston especially would bring huge heaps of it.  Instead, she delivers a dull and uninspired variation of her television persona.  MacLaine is a scene stealer (we all knew that) but there isn't much to steal here.  There are few films that meander on stagnancy quite like `Rumor Has It...' but this is one of those rare films that elicits almost no emotional response from me.  I can't say that I hate it, that I love it, that I like it, that I dislike it.

Costner does his charming bit well.  The story basically involves a young woman(Aniston) who is engaged to a lawyer(Ruffalo).  They are coming home for the marriage of her sister.  Aniston is very uncertain of herself and of her engagement.

It was apparently supposed to be set in 1997 (when it was filmed in 2004/2005, why I have no idea), and there's a really obvious mention about James Cameron's Titanic, which wouldn't have been out yet. It had already been mentioned that it was January 1997, which would mean the film wasn't even OUT yet. Hats also disappear clean off character's head from one shot to the next, hair goes from behind the ear to loose (that really bugs me!)<br /><br />Why exactly is Kathy Bates uncredited as well? Sure, she's hardly in the film but still! There's a lot of references to other films, the main one being The Graduate, which I haven't actually seen. Many reviewers have said that Rumor Has It is like a sequel to The Graduate. No it's not. It's just referencing it, and updating the story a little for a new generation.<br /><br />The film's basically about a girl finding out her grandmother actually inspired the film (why not the book? It was a book first! The book was mentioned once, and then she even watches a video of The Graduate) The Graduate. She discovers her grandmother & mother had a fling with this one man, who she promptly thinks is her father, but then discovers he's sterile, so has a fling with him too. (How many guys would have used the "I'm sterile" line just to get a girl into bed?)<br /><br />The thing that gets me is that you can see from the start of the film is that the relationship that Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) is in isn't gonna last. They're engaged - but she doesn't wear the ring. They try to join the Mile High Club, but fail miserably.<br /><br />The film's perfectly entertaining, it's not a bad movie and alright for a day off work, when the weather's windy and rainy outside. It's instantly forgettable, Jennifer plays her usual role, as does Mark Ruffalo (can we try showing some emotion, or a different facial expression please? Move aside Heath Ledger, I've found a new candidate!) I would give it a shot, but it's basically forgettable, and I wouldn't pay OTT prices for it.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the idea that The Graduate, both book and movie, was really a disguised true story of a friend of author Charles Webb's who actually did sleep with an older woman, the infamous Mrs. Robinson, and later fell-in-love and slept with her daughter who then married another.  That the grandaughter of the former and daughter of the latter discovers it might be her family that was being written about and sets out to discover the truth was a clever conceit and might have made a pretty good movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this ain't it.  While it has all the elements, including Jennifer Aniston as the young woman, a nicely laid-back Kevin Costner as Beau Burroughs the real-life model for Benjamin Braddock in the book and film, and what should have been an easy homerun for Shirley Maclaine as the prototype for Mrs. Robinson, ends up being flat-footed comically, awkward romantically and just off-kilter in direction, performance and tone.  The comedy is forced and unfunny, the sentimentality and emotion un-earned.<br /><br />I don't know what has happened to Rob Reiner whose early work was marked by such superb manipulation and timing of all these elements of comedy, emotion and sentimentality, but none of it works here.  It's not that this is a bad film, it just isn't a real good film.  It's so-so and it should have been more.  Maybe add a 1/2 star for the likeable cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I knew I'd enjoy this movie because I am a big fan of "The Graduate," but I honestly didn't expect "Rumor Has It" to be as good as it is. Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) arrives at her sister's wedding with her fianc&eacute;, Jeff (Mark Ruffalo). Already anxious about her own impending marriage, Sarah is stunned when she learns that her grandmother Katherine (Shirley MacLaine) was the inspiration for the character of Mrs. Robinson in the infamous book and movie "The Graduate." Sarah suspects that Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), the man Dustin Hoffman's character was based on, might be her biological father, so she scurries away from her family and fianc&eacute; to track Beau down. When she finds him, she is relieved to discover that he is NOT her father, but like her mother and grandmother before her, Sarah is taken in by Beau's charm and ends up in the last place she ever expected to turn up...in Beau's bed.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story and the film boasts an amazing cast. Aniston and Ruffalo deliver their best performances to date. Costner is perfect as the smooth, successful Beau, and there is also a strong supporting cast that includes Richard Jenkins, Mena Suvari, and Kathy Bates. The real star of this film is definitely MacLaine...she steals every scene as the brassy former seductress (who will NOT TOLERATE being called "Grandmother"). Her scenes with Aniston are fabulous, but her confrontation with Costner's character is probably the best scene in the film. (I wish it lasted a little longer...Katherine was totally going to kick Beau's ass!) No one will ever take Anne Bancroft's place as Mrs. Robinson, but there is no other actress who could have played Katherine better than Shirley MacLaine!<br /><br />"Rumor Has It" has more depth than most other romantic comedies in its class. It's a funny movie, but there are a lot of poignant moments. I might go back to the theatre to see this one a second time, and I'll definitely be buying the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>Why does Jennifer Aniston choose roles that make her seem like a bad actress?  She hasn't had a good movie ever.  All of them are like this.  Stupid, long and boring.  They have so much potential (as does she), but never amount to anything good.<br /><br />The only saving light in this movie was Mark Ruffalo (who is so unbelievably gorgeous and cute and funny).<br /><br />Jennifer sets out to prove whether or not her family was the inspiration for The Graduate.  Along the way, I almost fell asleep.  I didn't love this and it's not a romantic comedy, but a romantic flop.  Look out for a brief and desperate cameo by Christopher McDonald, and also look out for the odd laugh provided by Shirley MacLaine.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm sorry to say that there weren't too many good spots here and I was very disappointed.  This doesn't give me much hope for The Breakup, because I can see right away it is going to be as terrible as this.  Aniston doesn't provide much star power to me anymore.  I think she should go back to TV sitcoms.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>Rumour has it that 'Rumor Has It' is a pretty good film.  This will by no means be an Oscar contender, but as a pleasant diversion on a weekend afternoon, or possibly as a date movie (for those who still go on dates), this could be a winning movie.  Jennifer Aniston, late of 'Friends', plays a role that is in many ways reminiscent of the Rachel role - she is a transplanted New Yorker, returning home to L.A. (actually, Pasadena, which becomes a running joke) with her as-yet-unannounced fianc&eacute; to attend her younger sister's wedding.  We learn all of this in the first few minutes, possibly before the credits are done scrolling on the screen - the frenetic pace of 'Friends' is still here.<br /><br />Rumour has it that there was a family in Pasadena that the film 'The Graduate' is based upon - Sarah (Anniston) fixates upon the idea that this may be her family.  She questions her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine, but don't call her grandmother), who tells of a possible affair her mother had with a playboy before her marriage (Kevin Costner, now a dot-com mega-millionaire).  Sarah goes off without her fianc&eacute; in search of her mother's past, but finds a past of her own, of a sort.<br /><br />Lots of twists and turns in the film have the characters racing up and down the coast of California in search of the past, the future, and the truth, which ends up being both expected and unexpected in this complicated but easily-followed plot.<br /><br />There aren't major effects and major surprises here.  The situational comedy is very much in keeping with an extended version of a comfortable television show, even with the star power of MacLaine and Costner backing Anniston up.  The writing is serviceable with occasional flashes of true wit, and the pace of the film is even and pleasant.  In all, this is a good film, well worth seeing for a bit of entertainment.  Director Rob Reiner does have a talent for good films, and this is one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Don't get me wrong, the acting was good all around. The idea that a woman is so confused that she'll sleep with the guy that might be her father, grandfather, or both because she's having second thoughts about her own impending marriage seems a little less than funny, and the ending ( How pathetic could a man be? ) was a bit more than unbelievable. Rob Reiner must have been channeling his inner 'Lynch' when he chose to do this film ( although, David Lynch would have probably made a lot more sense of this mess of a script ).<br /><br />On the plus side there were some funny moments, and then there was Shirley MacLaine. She owned every scene she was in, and made a nearly mediocre movie ( despite it's great cast ) not only palatable, but entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) discovers that her mother's mom may have been the inspiration for the film "The Graduate" when the dashing Beau Burroughs comes around. Sarah is engaged to an adorable man played by Mark Ruffalo but Beau has his ways with her just as he did with mom and grandma. Sarah ventures into temptation territory while her fiance is left wondering just what is going on. A few twists and turns has Sarah wondering about her paternity but breaking the female curse of Beau proves daunting.<br /><br />This could have been a great movie especially with the comedic talents of Jennifer Aniston and the always superb Shirley MacLaine. The plot wears thin and not even Kevin Costner's charm can rescue it. The movie is saleable and Mark Ruffalo a worthy contender for Aniston's affections but it just doesn't melt in the heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I knew this was a lackluster movie before I watched it, but I was desperate for HD DVD material.  While it was not painfully bad, it was boring and superficial.  Jennifer Aniston basically plays herself (or any of her other characters on TV/movies.)  She is confused and not sure she wants to marry her fiance-snooze.  If that was not enough, Aniston-in typical golddigger [...]fashion-sleeps with Kevin Costner.  This is the man she suspected of being her father and she knew had slept with her grandmother!  But because he is rich and powerful she jumps in the sack with him.  The lone bright spot is the grandmother played by the great Shirley Maclaine, but even some of her lines seem forced and fall flat.  The HD DVD version is crammed onto a single (15 GB) layer of the disc so the picture quality is only ok (the DVD version occupies the other layer).  If you have absolutely nothing else to do then perhaps this is worth watching.  But I recommend you find another diversion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Another sit-com type, light-hearted, and feel good movie that got ravaged by the critics when it was released in the theatres. Rumor Has It isn't all bad, in fact, largely due to the performances of the A-list cast members, it's a pleasant little screwball comedy occasionally peppered with some clever dialogue. Although the movie's denouement doesn't really live up to the promise of it's opening, there's lots of fun to be had and there's something intrinsically likeable about all the characters.<br /><br />Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston) and her boyfriend Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) are on their way to her ditzy younger sister's wedding in Pasadena. Sarah and Jeff also plan to get married, but of late, a feeling of insecurity has been plaguing Sarah. Her initial diffidence is reinforced when she learns that members of her family were the inspiration for the book and 1967 film, The Graduate - and she just might be the offspring of the liaison.<br /><br />Jeff is initially weary of Sarah's investigations, but when he discovers there's a huge question revolving around the date of her birth, Sarah is compelled to seek out the truth.  Was her Granny Catherine (Shirley MacLaine) in fact Mrs. Robinson? And was that Benjamin Braddock, so famously played by Dustin Hoffman, in fact an entrepreneurial Internet shark called Beau Burroughs, played by Kevin Costner?<br /><br />It's all terribly far fetched and the material is undoubtedly light-weight, contrived and rather predictable, but director Rob Reiner imbues his characters with such a fine sense of loving earnestness that it is impossible not to get caught up in all the shenanigans of the Huttinger family. Shirley MacLaine gets the best lines as sharp-witted, cynical and world-weary Catherine who tosses alcohol fuelled acerbic barbs at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />By the time Sarah wakes up at a seaside villa in San Francisco not knowing where she is, perhaps enamored of her new potential father, we know we have been kidnapped by the fantasy. And as the main story begins to wear out steam, Reiner beefs up the screenplay, with subplot of Sarah's neurotic sister, Annie (Mena Suvari) and then introduces a zany character (Cathy Bates), who was around at the time and knows a few secrets.<br /><br />It's thanks to the charisma of Aniston, Ruffalo and Kevin Costner as the aging Romeo, the smooth-talking classic charmer that the movie mostly works. Ruffalo - who is always good - manages to bring some of his ineffable charm to the role of Jeff, and Aniston, who has the central role of the tortured, conflicted, self doubting and generally messed up 20-something trying to find herself, is her usual competent and quirky self.<br /><br />I guess you could wrap up Rumor Has It by saying it's a film with a meagerly clad premise that works as a type of cheery and optimistic farce, but don't expect anything that rises above mediocrity. Mike Leonard May 06.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Rumor has it that this is a pretty banal movie.  The rumor is true.  Ted Griffin, the screenwriter from Pasadena, and a writer with some pretty fine screenplays under his belt (Matchstick Men, Ocean's Eleven), somehow felt the need to cash in on the re-release of the classic film THE GRADUATE about his hometown idiosyncrasies and make a 30 years later 'sequel'.  Bad choice: the comparisons between the two films are just too far apart to endure tolerance from the audience.<br /><br />Rob Reiner has made some fine films in the past, but he lets this little bit of pastiche just get out of control.  The few laughs that are implied come form some gritty lines from Katherine (veteran Shirley MacLaine), playing the grandmother of Sarah (Jennifer Aniston), who was the model for 'Mrs. Robinson' in the book THE GRADUATE.  It seems that Aniston returns for her sister Annie's (Mena Suvari) wedding to hunky Scott (Steve Sandvoss from 'Latter Days' fame) with her affianced Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) only to realize that she doesn't seem to fit into Pasadena much less her family.  Never close to her father (Richard Jenkins) she hears that her mother had a fling with one Beau (Kevin Costner) and that she may be the offspring of Beau and her mother.  How she discovers the reality of the rumor is the point (or lack thereof) of the movie.<br /><br />With Aniston, MacLaine, Ruffalo, Costner and Jenkins in the cast the film has to have some good points - and it does.  It is just that the idea for the story is too lame to digest and too poorly written to buy into, making this a film to watch only if you happen to love the cast.  Grady Harp, May 06</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>A fairly amusing Jennifer Anniston vehicle, RUMOR HAS IT...stays afloat thanks to some excellent performances from the cast (particularly Shirley Maclaine and Kevin Costner) and the script's dextrous realization of some very complex characters and their multi-layered interractions with one another. Anniston is attractive and mostly likeable as the easily confused protagonist, and Mark Ruffalo is highly convincing as her dissed fiance'. Nowhere nearly as good as THE GRADUATE (from which RUMOR HAS IT...takes its cue) but it is almost possible to see these people playing out that classic's comedy-drama for themselves.  And even though it's directed by Rob Reiner, at least he has enough sense to keep his personal politics out of the plot.  Unless you're a big fan of some of the cast I wouldn't really recommend buying this one, but it might make a good date movie or a cute but harmless rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I know that the critical reception to "Rumor Has It" was very chilly, but something about the idea of the film really appealed to me. The concept, the plot conceit, is a genuinely clever notion. Being a fan of "The Graduate," I was interested to see how well they would integrate the characters of that film with the real life counterpoints in this film. I mean, come on, Shirley MacLaine representing Mrs. Robinson and Kevin Costner as Ben Braddock--seems like a great idea! But, alas, when all is said and done--an amusing and well conceived setup did not equal a satisfying movie experience, for me.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston returns to her Pasadena homestead with her new fiance, played by Mark Ruffalo. Plagued with doubts about her engagement, and seemingly disengaged from any real affection for her own family, she hears a rumor that leads her to suspect that the book and film of "The Graduate" were based on her deceased mother's experiences. Confirming that her grandmother (MacLaine) was indeed the Mrs. Robinson character, she deduces that her mother had a fling prior to marrying her father. Thus, with the notion that she might be the daughter of this man--she sets off to find the truth. Encountering Costner, as the potential daddy and Ben Braddock character, she discovers truths about herself and her family.<br /><br />All of this plays out very routinely, but the supporting actors are engaging and comfortable. It's always great to see MacLaine, but she offers nothing new or inventive in this performance--it's the standard brassy MacLaine persona we've come to expect. Costner continues to embrace his middle-aged status and has, thus, developed into a far more interesting actor than he used to be. (But for a more nuanced and astute role, check him out in "The Upside of Anger" with the luminous Joan Allen.) And Mark Ruffalo, a great serious actor, continues to play lightly as a romantic leading man. Recently cast with Witherspoon, Garner, and now Aniston in lightweight fluff--I do miss the more challenging roles he used to take on.<br /><br />But it is Aniston's character, to me, that is a despicable movie creation--one that I've seen all too frequently, but this one is supposed to be endearing. Born into a life of privilege, she has accomplished nothing in her 30+ years and has become a self-involved and unpleasant Woman-child. She floats through her sister's wedding as if it's all some great inconvenience. She doesn't think twice about mistreating a man who loves her. She never acts on anything that doesn't blatantly promote her own self-interest. I'm just so tired of it--it's not charming. Don't get me wrong--there are plenty of Man-child movies too (more so, even) about men who still act as if they were adolescent. But, think about those movies--the Man-child is an object of scorn and ridicule, we laugh at him. But "Rumor Has It" doesn't ask you to laugh at Aniston's social ineptitude and selfishness--far from it--we're supposed to embrace it and identify with her as a real person. Well, frankly, I wished everyone in Aniston's life would abandon her because of her behavior so that she'd learn to grow up. But, of course, this is wish fulfillment--and she learns about life while retaining everything of value--there is never any consequence to being a nasty person.<br /><br />This gender double standard really bothers me, and the fact that I genuinely disliked the central character--obviously, I didn't care for this film. Otherwise it would have been a fairly generic picture, but these two things caused me to feel strongly and negatively. I am giving it an extra star for a good idea, but unfortunately, it didn't pan out for me. KGHarris, 01/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>"Rumor Has It" is a family movie about a woman in search of clues from her past- clues that will help her sort out why she is so different from her real father and give her the wisdom she needs to decide about marriage in general and whether or not it's the right move for her. Rumor Has It, while not a sequel, has similarities to the classic film "The Graduate" and the latter is mentioned several times in this movie.<br /><br />As everyone knows, The Graduate centered around a young man who falls for the seduction of an older woman named Mrs. Robinson and then later falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine. In Rumor Has It, a similar situation occurs, except this time around it's Kevin Costner playing the role of ladies man and this time the main character nabs three different generations of a family rather than only two. Jennifer Aniston- one of the few bright spots in this film- falls for the charms of Costner's character and she continues the trend, in spite of the fact that just moments earlier she thought he was her biological father.<br /><br />The basic plot of this movie is a little bit interesting but I don't like the way Rob Reiner pulls it all together. The film starts out with good intentions as Aniston's character goes off on a manhunt, hoping to discover that a total stranger is her real father so that she will finally understand once and for all why she is so different from the rest of her family. But rather than make this into an intriguing movie full of personal drama and suspense, Reiner decides to make it a light hearted comedy that starts out running and then slams into a concrete wall about midway through. Once the question about whether or not Kevin Costner is Jennifer Aniston's father has been answered, the movie really loses steam. Reiner doesn't do much else with the movie at this point, allowing it to fizzle out for the next thirty to forty minutes.<br /><br />This movie has been classified as a romantic comedy but it really isn't that funny. I think I counted one funny line through the entire movie (a toast made by Shirley MacLaine to her soon to be married granddaughter Annie). But at the same time, this isn't really a drama either because it lacks the involvement and seriousness one would expect in a good family drama. Again, Reiner let this aspect of the movie get away from him. I'm quite surprised by this, because usually Rob Reiner can be counted on to make some good, solid movies whether they are comedies or serious in nature.<br /><br />Among the performances, only Jennifer Aniston and Shirley MacLaine are up to snuff. The other performances are not very memorable and Mark Ruffalo's character doesn't have much chemistry with Aniston's at all. They don't seem like a good couple and I didn't find myself cheering them on or hoping they would work things out in the end and become the happily married couple that Aniston's parents were not. I really didn't care at this point.<br /><br />Overall, Rumor Has It is a sub- par film that ranks among Rob Reiner's weaker efforts. I wouldn't say it's a total dud because I have seen worse films during the past year. But with an all- star cast like this and with someone with Reiner's experience behind the camera, I expected it to be much better than it turned out.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>RUMOR HAS IT... was a silly movie, but it was an enjoyable one.

For the reasons I don't know Griffin (who is attached to the film as director) left the set, and Rob Reiner took up the project. Then something happened to the film, which should be more original and intriguing. `Rumor Has It' is still cozy and charming in its own way, but is a great missed opportunity.<br /><br />The plot starts like a standard romantic comedy, but there is one clever twist in it; that is, Jennifer Aniston's heroine Sarah, already vaguely angst-ridden about her future, suddenly finds the `Truths' about her mother's life. Sarah comes to believe that her deceased mom was actually the model of Katherine Ross character in `The Graduate.' Charles Webb, she insists, wrote the story of Benjamin Braddock in `The Graduate' based on the real life of one Beau Burroughs, who is still living somewhere in America.<br /><br />Leaving behind her nice and understanding fianc&eacute;e (played by underrated Mark Ruffalo), Sarah travels to meet Beau (Kevin Costner). The consequences of their meeting should not be told here, but anyway you can tell from the miles away.<br /><br />Very clever and intelligent initial setting gradually turns into a middling rom-com path where so many others have already passed. It is Rob Reiner who once directed charming `When Harry Met Sally...' and we naturally expect something better or different. But sorry, no such luck here.<br /><br />Naturally (and deservedly) Shirley MacLaine steals every scene as the grandmother with an acid tongue. Richard Jenkins is excellent as Sarah's slightly odd father, cute Mena Suvari is cute as ever, and you even see handsome Mike Vogel. Uncredited Kathy Bates also appears (with a very strange hair), and Jennifer Aniston and Mark Raffalo are both good, the incarnation of nice, good-looking American couple, if nothing more. But Kevin Costner is a huge disappointment, who should have been the inspiration of Dustin Hoffman character in `The Graduate' but shows little of the charms of Ben of the Mike Nichols film.<br /><br />Oh, and the closing chapters are simply banal, throwing away any cleverness of the original idea about `The Graduate' or the life in Pasadena, and take the safest course throughout. If Shirley Maclaine had punched Costner in the face, the film would be much funnier. I expected to see something like that, but got no chance of seeing it. Just a comfortable, unoriginal, and insipid ending of `Ever After.'</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>The critics did not like this film but the trailer looked goods so I rented it and it was bad the trailer shoed all the good stuff.

The conundrum comes from my extreme enjoyment of THE GRADUATE (1967), something that RUMOR HAS IT makes no small claim to being a sort of sequel to.<br /><br />THE GRADUATE was sexy, funny, ahead of its time, and even explicitly inappropriate. RUMOR HAS IT tries to ratchet up these areas but doesn't succeed due to poor acting, poor casting (with one exception) and a senseless script.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston plays Sarah Huttinger, the granddaughter of Katherine Richelieu (Shirley MacLaine playing the aged Mrs. Robinson/Anne Bancroft), and she soon discovers that the women in her family have a "thing" for Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner playing an middle-aged Benjamin Braddock/Dustin Hoffman). Sarah (Aniston) is engaged to be married but something inside her makes her hesitate before heading to the alter. She doesn't act or look anything like anyone in her family and she feels that maybe she was adopted. Her mother died years ago and can't give her any answers, so she goes to see Grandma Katherine (MacLaine) to see if she has any. A pandora's box of information suddenly gushes forth as Sarah learns her family was the basis for the book and film, The Graduate. She also learns that Beau (Costner) may be her father, since her mother also slept with him right before Sarah's mother and father were married.<br /><br />Coming to terms with the fact that Beau isn't her father is both tough and touching (one of the few truly memorable moments of the movie.)<br /><br />But RUMOR HAS IT just isn't that engaging. It's not nearly as sexy as THE GRADUATE was and it's not nearly as funny, either. The film makers try to "shock" the audience by having Sarah and Beau sleep together while the true nature of Sarah's paternity remains unclear ("This isn't The Graduate, this is Deliverance!") But the shock just doesn't take us where we need to go. It's not funny, dramatic, or even that interesting.<br /><br />The one exceptional portion of this movie lay with Shirley MacLaine. Stealing nearly every scene she's in, MacLaine was the epitome of a damaged woman trying to keep her granddaughter from becoming just as screwed up as she. But even her excellent performance couldn't save the film ...unfortunately. Costner and Aniston looked out of place and miscast, completely lacking any kind of true chemistry, thus making the entire film unmemorable.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston) suspects that her granny, Katharine Richelieu (Shirley MacLaine) is Mrs. Robinson; Coo coo ca-choo.

They used ancient phone technology to give the film a period piece feel.<br /><br />In the end the presentation was trite and forced with little chemistry or surprise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>I suppose if you're a woman under 40 who also happens to love The Graduate despite being a woman under 40, this might be your favorite film ever.<br /><br />As it is, while Jennifer Aniston is charming in an exactly like her role on Friends way, and you feel badly for Mark Ruffalo, who plays her fiance whose biggest crime seems to be not being Kevin Costner, this falls sort of flat.<br /><br />It's clever in a borderline obsessive-compulsive about the Graduate and (sort of strangely) the city of Pasadena way, but that's not really sufficient for a recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I am surprise Rumor Has It didn't make it big for a lot of people on here. I actually enjoyed it. I thought it was funny and weird. I think they should give this movie a second chance.</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>Jennifer Aniston plays a neurotic and insecure woman engaged to be married. She is heading home to Pasadena with her boyfriend to attend her sister's wedding. She feels like she has never fit in with her family but she doesn't really go over the deep end until she hears a rumor. She hears that her family served as the inspiration for THE GRADUATE, starring Dustin Hoffman.<br /><br />She does the math and realizes that her father may not really be her father. Her mother is unable to answer any questions, having died many years before and her grandmother, played brilliantly by Shirley McLean will not talk about the matter. She decides to try and track down the mystery man.<br /><br />Her search leads her to a wealthy and successful entrepreneur played by Kevin Costner. He confirms the rumors about the book and the movie but maintains that he cannot be her father. He also sees Aniston and decides to try for the Triple Crown. This attempt leads to even more familial confusion and damages more relationships.<br /><br />This film has a few light moments but it is not great as either entertainment or as a work of art. It is one of those things I am glad to have seen but have no need ever to see again. The most likeable character in the whole piece is the dad, the real one who raised the girl. He is matter of fact, truthful and manages to get keep everything in perspective.<br /><br />If you do watch this film, it definitely helps to have seen the original GRADUATE. I suppose one could follow the story line without having seen it but it will make much more sense with that frame of reference.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Ludicrous and famously troubled vanity production for Friends star Jennifer Aniston collapses all around her just like her marriage to Brad Pitt.  You can see the cracks in the plot open up like chasms after an earthquake, and whole storylines just get lost forever.  One director after another tried fixing up the results, it must have been enormously expensive, and finally they brought in Rob Reiner to polish it all up.  Wonder why poor Kathy Bates, in a honey blonde wig, had only one scene to play?  I forget what her name is in the movie, but whatever it is she's playing "Exposition."  It's up to her to shoulder the whole burden of the back story, including keeping the treasured high school yearbooks from the 1950s.<br /><br />The scenarists had also to backdate the storyline by ten or twelve years, so that in the present day, it's 1990 or 1992--the early days of the coming internet revolution.  (And yet all the actors have the hairstyles and outfits of today.)  Why?  because otherwise the plot would have Jennifer Aniston playing a woman of 40 or so, and that just wouldn't have been very cute for poor Jennifer.  Because she was supposed to be the daughter born to the real life originals of the "Elaine" and "Benjamin" characters in THE GRADUATE, forever fixed as a mid-sixties book and movie.  It's like a giant jack inserted underneath a flat tire of a movie, this shift back to an earlier time, and yet still there's remnants of a plot in which Jennifer Aniston accidentally pockets Mark Ruffalo's cell phone.<br /><br />Didn't you think she was going to find, like Brittany Murphy in LITTLE BLACK BOOK, that her innocent good boy boyfriend had a secret life, a whole cell phone filled with other women's numbers?<br /><br />Well, she did in an earlier avatar of the script.  Then LITTLE BLACK BOOK came out and the producers realized they would have to change everything, so forget about the portable phone subplot.<br /><br />Then they must have thought that Nellie McKay was going to be the next big thing, not realizing that everyone, even Nellie McKay's mom and dad, eventually has a saturation point beyond which they beg, "Please, not another Nellie McKay song on the soundtrack!"<br /><br />The creepy dead ghost father from SIX FEET UNDER plays Jennifer Aniston's father in this one.  Originally, the script had the Aniston character confronting her mother, but Aniston has real life mother problems, so they had the mother die fourteen years before the story begins, a giant hole in the movie that all the Steel Magnolia shenanigans of Shirley MacLaine and Kathy Bates don't begin to fill.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>What exactly has happened to Rob Reiner? Remember when he used to make funny films or has it been too long?<br /><br />Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) and Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) travel back to her childhood home for the wedding of her sister (Mena Suvari). Sarah doesn't want to tell the family that she and Jeff have just become engaged; she doesn't want to steal the thunder from her sister. Jeff doesn't get it, but he agrees. During the evening, Grandma Katherine (Shirley MacLaine), reveals a secret about Sarah's mom, leading the young woman to believe her family was the basis for the film "The Graduate". "Aunt" Mitzi (Kathy Bates) reveals that Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner) dated her mother right before she was married. Sarah begins to suspect that Burroughs may actually be her father and decides she needs to find him. She flies to San Francisco, where he is giving a lecture.<br /><br />"Rumor Has It" has all of the hallmarks of a great, zany comedy yet the only element that consistently works is Shirley MacLaine. The few times she is on screen, the film becomes alive with promise. Katherine is a rich woman beyond caring what anyone thinks of her. As a result, she says whatever she wants, providing the film's four or five funny lines. Unfortunately, MacLaine isn't in the film enough to save it.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston is having a problematic transition to "Movie Star". Her last good film was "The Good Girl", an independent film she made while "Friends" was still earning her $20 million a year. Perhaps she felt the security of the show allowed her to take some risks, some chances, and it paid off. "The Good Girl" was critically acclaimed and earned Aniston a lot of good reviews. Since then, she has only appeared in big budget "romantic comedies" and the unfortunate "Derailed". In "Rumor", Aniston presents yet another variation on Rachel, her character from "Friends". Imagine her TV persona, only whinier, ditsier, and more annoying and you begin to get a picture of her performance in the film.<br /><br />Kevin Costner's performance is interesting only because he seems to have found a second career playing men his actual age, more interesting characters than he has in some time. He was great in "The Upside of Anger" as a boozy former jock turned sport radio show jock. In "Rumor", his character is just too creepy to be likable. Why exactly would he want to sleep with Sarah, a woman so much his junior? Okay, that was a dumb question. Yes, it continues the tradition of the original film, but Sarah is in a relationship. And he still sleeps with her even after learning he has already slept with her mother and her grandmother. Sarah also knows this. And both people still let it happen. Why? It is enough to generate nightmares. And it isn't funny or romantic.<br /><br />Also, early in the film, there is some question if Burroughs (Costner) is in fact Sarah's (Aniston) father. After he convinces her he isn't her biological father, they hop into the sack together. Later, at a fancy ball, Sarah runs into Burroughs' son, who unwittingly asks her to sleep with him. Somehow, I feel the filmmakers think this is a funny situation which is why they bring it up again. And again. Later, Sarah tells her sister she isn't so screwed up. "Did you sleep wit a man who slept with mom and Grandma Katherine?" Her sister responds "Oooooh, you slept with Dad? Dad slept with Grandma Katherine?" Har-de-har har. I guess I can see how the potential act of incest is funny. Can you sense the sarcasm? More than one person in the audience made an audible gasp when the film started to go down this path. I sense that Reiner lost more than a handful of potential admirers with this storyline.<br /><br />One thing they didn't seem to feel necessary was to come up with an original ending. You know, something like "The Graduate"? Instead, we just get another tired variation of the guy showing up at the last possible minute. You know, like in every other "romantic" comedy we ever see?<br /><br />"Rumor Has It...", with the exception of Shirley MacLaine, is a film more suited for the Lifetime Channel. Actually, that might be too harsh a critique of the Lifetime Channel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>I saw a small bit of this on TV where Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Costner shined, and ordered it on a whim to see the rest.<br /><br />I cannot understand all the low ratings.  There are certainly parts of the movie that are trite and annoying, but that is real life and the movie should get extra credit for reminding you of your crazy annoying relatives, not be penalized.<br /><br />A clear sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F798">The Graduate (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>, one which could have been called "The Graduate: Next Generation," the story line, the script, the world-class actors in low-key supporting roles, the settings, all of this makes this a very fine "background movie" (what I screen when doing tedious but necessary things like printing address labels) and I loved it.<br /><br />I would definitely be interested in Graduate Part IV, where she gets divorced, comes back to Costner, and they live a life of sheer joy--<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099297701">Hannibal</a> (book version vice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXSP">Hannibal (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> DVD version).</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Is he or isn't he? Is Kevin Costner the father of Jennifer Aniston? That is the springboard premise of the mildly amusing and innocent film. Shirley MacLaine is great and almost runs away with this film. Jennifer Aniston's car antics are amusing. Richard Jenkins gives a very good performance as Aniston's dad. Or is he?</p></br><a href="../users/A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ.html">A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ</a><br/><p>Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston) takes a flight to Pasadena from New York with her fianc&eacute; Jeff Daly (Mark Ruffalo) for her sister Annie's (Mena Suvari) wedding.  When there, Sarah finds out from her grandmother Katharine Richelieu (Shirley MacLaine) that a guy named Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner) slept with Sarah's mother and grandmother.  After the wedding, instead of going back to New York, Sarah stays in Pasadena and meets up with Beau.  Beau confirms with her that he did sleep with her mother and grandmother.  Sarah finds out that her mother, who died when she was young, had had an affair with Beau Burroughs before getting married to her dad (as a last fling!).  Beau intern did it with the grandmother, and now granddaughter (Sarah).<br /><br />I had to watch this movie twice because it didn't make sense to me.  But overall it was a good movie!</p></br></body></html>

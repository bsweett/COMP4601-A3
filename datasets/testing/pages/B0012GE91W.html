Fearing that Hogwarts' venerable Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, is lying about Voldemort's return in order to undermine his power and take his job, the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, appoints a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher to keep watch over Dumbledore and the Hogwarts students. But Professor Dolores Umbridge's Ministry-approved course of defensive magic leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them and the entire wizarding community, so at the prompting of his friends Hermione and Ron, Harry takes matters into his own hands. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves "Dumbledore's Army," Harry teaches them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.<br />Dark and well crafted movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>The fifth film in the Harry Potter franchise does what the third film (Prisoner of Azkaban) did for the popular series---raises the bar.  David Yates took the fifth book (which a lot of people found too dark---I personally loved it) and made it work on screen.  One thing I am so pleased to have seen continue during the evolution of this popular film series is the ability to match directors to the books, who can capture the spirit and character of the story and translate it properly to screen.  Thankfully, for Potter fans everywhere, each film in the Harry Potter universe continues to improve and grow creatively.<br /><br />The fifth year starts with Harry in trouble after using a spell outside Hogwarts to save himself and his worthless cousin, Dudley, from a pair of Dementors.  After the resolution of this issue at the Ministry of Magic (in great part thanks to Professor Dumbledore, who defended Harry), the young wizard returns to Hogwarts to face one of his greatest challenges yet-----the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge.  Umbridge (played to the hilt by talented actress Imelda Staunton) is an evil and sadistic woman, who hides her cruelity behind shades of pink, a huge smile and the occassional slip of a high pitched giggle.  Dolores decides that it is time that Hogwarts return to an old school way of thinking and begins a campaign to change everything to her idea of higher education.  However, it soon becomes clear to Harry and his friends that Umbridge has no intentions of teaching real defensive techniques in class and the students form "Dumbledore's Army", a group meeting secretly in order to be prepared for the upcoming darkness of Voldemorte's return.<br /><br />Little by little, Umbridge takes control of Hogwarts and limits the freedom of students and teachers, eventually removing Dumbledore as Head Master.  Harry is angry at this point in his life and who wouldn't be?  Filled with raging hormones (and receiving his first kiss), dealing with a malicious teacher and constant nightmares, he lashes out at Dumbledore and even his friends.  His one constant is knowing that his godfather, Sirius Black is out "there" and will always help him in times of crisis.  Sirius, this time around, has help from the original surviving members of the Order of the Phoenix, which in the past included both Harry's and Neville's parents.  The living members include Nymphodora "Tonks", Mad-Eye Moody and Remus Lupin, among others--- all great charcters and well played (if seen too little) by the actors who portrayed them.  And, we got a glimpse of the insane and murderous Bellatrix LeStrange (Helena Bonham Carter, who is unfortunately in the film all to briefly!), Sirius Black's cousin, who escapes Azkaban and returns to do the Dark Lord's bidding.<br /><br />Of course, the story builds to the finale; a showdown with Voldemorte and his Death Eaters, pitted against members of the DA, the original Order and, of course, Dumbledore.  The fight scenes were great and I recommend seeing them in the IMAX theaters at least once for the 3-D effects.<br /><br />This movie is my favorite yet in the Potter series.  From new additions Helena Bonham Carter and Imelda Staunton to our old favorites, Dame Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson, for example, all the casting was perfect.  And I can't forget to mention the scene stealing Evanna Lynch who made Luna Lovegood one of my favorite characters in this film!!!  My only complaint would be seeing so little of Professor McGonagall (I loved the confrontation with Umbridge!), Bellatrix, Tonks, Mad-Eye and Dumbledore.  That said, I realize there is only so much time for a Hollywood production and some things must be edited out of an 800 page book for the sake of time!<br /><br />So, for all the Potter fans out there.....you must go see this latest addition in our beloved franchise!  For those of you who are not, do yourself a favor and catch this movie.  You won't regret it!  Highly recommended in a summer movie season where sequels have not managed to maintain the energy and creativity of their predecessors.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>From the opening sequence, I knew that this would be the best movie of the series. And it is. By far.<br /><br />From the outstandingly ballsy cinematography to the acting (it's like night and day between this movie and "Goblet of Fire", which was great in it's own right but can't touch this), from the witty and quirky script to the special effects, it's clear that director David Yates single handedly whipped the Harry Potter movie franchise into shape. While movies 1-4 were great, they were like unpolished stones; at points they tried so hard to go along with the books and at others tried so hard to separate themselves from the books (think "Prisoner of Azkaban"'s shrunken heads), but this movie--"Order of the Phoenix"--knows what it is. It is a film, and it makes sense as a film. Everything you need to know to understand the film is here, and--unlike "Goblet of Fire"--you won't need a previous understanding of the books or even the other movies. Certainly fans will complain about deviance from the book, but these are the same unreasonable people that wish the movies would be twenty-four hours long so they could squeeze in every line of dialogue. "Order of the Phoenix" is how a book should be adapted.<br /><br />Every actor, from Daniel Radcliffe to Emma Watson to the kid who plays Dudley, is at the tippy top of their game. They're playing young adults and they act it; they laugh, and they cry. This is the first time that I actually totally suspended my disbelief while watching a Potter film, and that was almost all due to the superb acting.<br /><br />I did expect a bit more from the climax (the important character death was kind of wiggy) but things get roaring back into shape for a perfect duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Following that, everything touched on in the movie wraps up beautifully. No threads are left untied, and no plot left with an open end. Very, very satisfying. Oh, and if that isn't enough, this should be: Evanna Lynch is spine-tinglingly good as Luna Lovegood.<br /><br />It may not be what you expected, it may not be what you thought you wanted... But for me, it was more on both counts.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>A lot of my annoyances in previous Harry Potter movies have been the changes, diversion, and other "artistic privileges" taken while adapting the book into a movie.<br /><br />Of the five Harry Potter movies thus far, I think this one stayed more true to the book than any of the others.  And let me tell you, that means a lot to me.<br /><br />Otherwise, there were very few other flaws.<br /><br />The acting was fantastic.  These kid actors have really graduated into true actors.  Of all of them, I think there was only one who was a little bit too over-the-top still.  But Daniel Radcliff as Harry Potter was spot-on.  Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley could not have done a better job as Harry's most noble friend and protector.<br /><br />Two performances really stood out for me.  The first was Gary Oldman who has always been a standout performer.  I think he really outdid himself as Harry's Godfather, Sirius Black.  It is too bad that this will be his last appearance in these films unless there is something I don't know about in the seven book (9 more days!!!  I can't wait!).  The other performance was by the newcomer of the series, Evanna Lynch, who could not have played the "dreamy" Luna Lovegood any better.  She did a fantastic job and I look forward to seeing her throughout the rest of the series.<br /><br />The special effects were awesome, especially with the showdown between Dumbledore and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the end of the movie.  I think the entire theater were on the edge of their seats!  Also, the training of Dumbledore's Army was beautifully done.<br /><br />Like the books and the other movies, there was a lot of good humor throughout the movie.  The scene I was most looking forward to was the scene involving the twins when they can't take the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher anymore.  The entire theater was laughing their heads off.  It was great and couldn't have been done better.  That scene was one of the highlights this gem of a movie.<br /><br />I now remember one of my frustrations when I reviews this book when it first came out, and that was how emotionally charged Harry Potter was.  I thought he spent the first half of the book just being a jerk.  The movie actually did a better job than the book of showing WHY he was upset and angry and overly emotional.  Again, I think the fine talents of Gary Oldman helped with this.  But the director did a fantastic job of actually SHOWING us what Harry Potter was going through and why he was so emotionally charged.<br /><br />I think in the end, this will be one of the stronger movies.  Those who have read the book will finally have a movie to see they won't be groaning to throughout.  I was glad to hear the same director (David Yates) will helm the next movie and I hope he continues the excellent work he put into this movie.<br /><br />This easily deserves five stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>Better pacing than the novel "Order" trims the story while keeping the spirit of the text. Like the text the franchise is progressively darker, set in an almost post-911 world, following the disturbing events of the Goblet of Fire. Everything's changed... But not the superb casting with more Oscar Winners than you can shake a wand at, Oldman delivers again as Harry's Godfather Sirius Black aka Padfoot (the nickname is actually referenced in this one). Of course, this one has a climatic full scale battle of wands (the largest yet ) and Michael Gambon successfully dispenses Dumbledore's final duel with the Dark Lord a.k.a Tom. If you have the chance to see this in IMAX, by all means do so, oh yes!<br /> The story...<br /><br />Before Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) can even start their fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is attacked by Dementors, then placed on trail for underage magic  in front of a muggle. He isn't the only one under fire from a Minstry of Magic in denial, so is Hogwarts itself, when loathsome Dolores Umbridge, new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, played by Oscar winning actress Imelda Staunton, appears to oppress the place.  Failing to be taught actual defensive magic Harry and crew form a secret class of their own, but the newly revived Voldemort, again played by Ralph Fiennes, along with a face-full of Death Eaters including Bellatrix Lestrange played by Helena Bonham Carter (who I had in mind when I first read the book) and Lucius Malfoy (still Jason Isaacs), are plotting something nasty.<br /><br />Harry's rage and isolation is effectively portrayed, as is his edited relationship with Cho. Some of the novel's best lines remain intact here, like Ron and Hermione's assessment of Harry's kissing. Fred and George's exit from Hogwarts isn't altered enough to lose it's punch, neither is the film's exploration of teen rebellion and the consequences of becoming adults. Some of the films real heart comes from not only the brief moments between Harry and his godfather (Sirius gives volumes of exposition when refers to Harry as James during the climax), but moments between Harry and quirky Luna Lovegood, as they reflect on life, death and nargles.<br /><br />The effects are brilliant even though the CGI centaurs return, but thankfully do not speak or leave the shadows (see Sorcerer's Stone, yikes!), the other magical creatures look good, house-elves and horses alike. But ....the the wand battle will likely set a new standard for magic in film!</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>I didn't read any of the Potter books, and I thought this was a great movie!  This was much better than the other four put together!  I don't know what was left out from the story, but I don't flipping care.  The same happened to Lord of the Rings (which I read), and people still loved it.  When will people learn that books and film are TWO different forms of story-telling media?  You can't put a concentrated, action-packed 3D story onto a two dimensional screen for ten hours straight.  People can barely sit through a ten-hour flight without getting ansy let alone a movie.<br /><br />The acting all around, including the kids of Dumbledore's Army, was superb.  The Luna Lovegood girl was excellent.  The interpretation of Delores Umbridge was delightfully scary to me, especially the way she disciplined her students.  How freakishly calm and distressingly evil she was in her bureacratic pink and prim, Stepford Nazi kind of way.  Give that lady an Oscar.  She was creepy.<br /><br />I hope to see Helena Bonham Carter again as Beatrix LeStrange.  She was scary crazy...and cool!<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe: He upped the ante.  Those trigger dream sequences and mental struggles were spot on, realistic and much better than what we saw in Goblet of Fire.  Good job!  Going on stage must have really helped.<br /><br />And who can discount the Wizard and Witches Battling--What incredible special effects!  I'll have to admit that does give Lord of the Rings a run for its money, and Lord of the Rings is a classic.  This movie is pretty intense emotionally and suspense wise.  It could classify as an action horror flick on its own.  It's sinster, sinister, sinister.  So Parents, it would be easy for me to say I'd be wary about bringing your little ones to this flick, but it's a Harry Potter film--which is a story about kids.  Go with them to watch it; there are some pretty intense and frightening scenes.<br /><br />Finally, hats off to director David Yates.  Excellent job and great editting.  At first I was not keen on the whole switching director thing, but it's really worked for the Potter series.  Potter endures a tremendous life change, and each director is able to bring out a particular significant vulnerability in Potter's life with each particular story.  Order needed an intense director for an intense storyline.  I wonder how Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows is going to turn out.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>As stated before, from the longest novel comes the shortest film. And I've no complaints. Again, the director cuts out most, if not all of the sub-plots, and just gives us a straight forward story with the main characters. Somethings have been altered as well, such as Cho Chang betraying Harry and the others from Cho's friend. Which in my opinion is the better dramatic angle as Cho's friend would've only been in this one movie and it wouldn't have had as much emotional impact on the characters. The main cast continues to improve and the older actors are still wonderful. Two of my new favorite characters, who practically stole the show for me when I saw this two years ago, are Helena Bonham Carter (who gets very good billing in this for being in it for a whole five minutes) as Bellatrix Lestrange and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. Carter is wonderfully deranged as Bellatrix as the actress seems to be having a lot of fun being deliciously evil. Lynch is charmingly quirky and, despite this being her first film (I think), is excellent and I only hope that she continues to act several more films after the Potter series has wrapped. Imelda Staunton is very good as Umbridge but there's only so much I can take of the color pink and tedious crooked politician/sadistic teacher angle. I know that's how she is in the book but I find the character rather plain and not as interesting as some of the other plot-twist characters they've had before. Action wise, this is the one with the most of it, climaxing with a wizard's battle which is executed brilliantly (and one can only hope that the climatic battle in the final film will be just as exhilirating). Nicholas Hopper provides an excellent score, using Williams' themes to a minimum, utilizing some brilliant pieces of his own (the wizard battle being one of them).</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>The book was very long.  The DVD was very short.  The characters were cut to ribbons, with the exception of obnoxious Umbridge who had a big part in nearly every scene.  But many other scenes missing or cut badly. Plenty of action, if that's all you like.  Story line?  Gone.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>From the opening sequence, I knew that this would be the best movie of the series.  And it is.

When it comes to adapting a book into a movie, it's difficult to know what to cut and keep in. For "Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix" directed David Yates has streamlined Rowling's book in favor of the main plot. While it is missing some of the character of Rowling's book, it makes up for it with non-stop action and terrific acting particularly from Daniel Ratcliffe who has really blossomed as an actor in this film. Yates and the screenwriter Michael Goldenberg ("Contact", "Peter Pan")manage to condense a thick novel into a shorter, action packed sequel. That means they sometimes have to introduce characters on the fly without much background on them but the performances by the actors help fill us in a bit as well as their actions on screen.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />As if by magic we get a sharp, crisp and colorful transfer. Featuring moody cinematography (unlike the candy floss cinematography of the first two Potter films) "Phoenix" captures the mood of the novel quite well.<br /><br />You can hear all those spells with all their detail intact as the 5.1 mix makes nice use of the format putting effects around the various speakers as necessary. This is the second film liberated from John Williams' too cutesy themes (I love Williams but his score did not work well for the "Potter" films) and has one of the best scores as well. Nicholas Hooper's score sounds marvelous in its presentation here.<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br />"Phoenix" is a bit light in the special features department. Well, that's not totally true, it's just that the special features aren't all that...special. We get 10 minutes of scenes that were cut from the film. Sometimes these are bits and pieces that just didn't fit into the film (and they didn't) other times they are extensions of scenes already in the film but cut for good reason (they overstayed their welcome).<br /><br />"Trailing Tonks" features actress Natalia Tena (who plays Nymphadora Tonks in the film hence the title) giving us a tour of the studios and the sets.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Magic of Editing" is short and to the point. Director Yates and editor Mark Day discuss how only minor edits can alter the pacing and feel of a film and gives us some brief examples.<br /><br />I've saved the biggest but not necessarily the best for last. "The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter" is an Electronic Press Kit in everything but name only. It's not bad it just could have gone more into depth about the challenges of condensing one of the bigger Potter books, reception from fans to the changes, etc.<br /><br />Fans may not be happy with the abridged version in the shortest Potter film yet but I found this to be entertaining and in the spirit of Rowling's book. I try never to compare books to films simply because one can handle multiple narratives while the other handles imaginative action better. Highly recommended even though the extras are a bit on the weak side and hey, it's the movie that matters after all. Just be aware that there will probably be a double dip somewhere down the line.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>I love HP, don't get me wrong, hence 4 stars.<br />But MY GOD, they get worse and worse compared to the book and compared to the previous films.<br />For a moment after the movie ended i thought it could be cuz we have seen so may effects that we expect more and more every time, but no, i don't think that is the reason for the slight disappointment i felt after having seen the film.<br />Order of Phoenix is a HUGE book, and I am sure we the fans would not mind sittin in the theatre for another half hour, no Sir! So why haven't they made it a little longer and made it more coherent??<br />Even if you have NOT read the book you will notice connections missing, in appearance of characters who are there and you don't know why really and how they happened to be - Luna Lovegood, for instance.<br />Actions follow one another seemingly disconnected while we KNOW how connected everything is in HP..<br />Now that i'm done whining, i'll say that the film is worth seeing whether you are afficionado or not, for its brilliant casting.<br />Snape, Black, Umbridge, McGonagall, Lestrange, Lovegood - brilliant!!!<br />Radclife looks funniest of all the kids, gone all adolescent and staying shortest of them all.<br />Effects are of high standard as always.. but here i have to go back to the whining - IN SHORT: while the HP1 was almost as good as the book played in my head, with HP5 it's not the case. The movie my head played out ofthe book is so much better than the one i saw on screen last week..</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Welcome to this long-winded mess of words. And, if you haven't read the book, there's plenty of plot SPOILERS.<br /><br />Having read all of the books at least three times each, I'm a bonafide fan of Harry Potter. And, as the end draws near for this book series, I'm starting to wonder what life would be like without a new Potter entry to look forward to. For years now, with each additional chapter in the life of the Boy Who Lived, J.K. Rowling has brought anticipation and glee into my life. But it's almost done now. It's a reality which looms ever closer, even as Warner Brothers, already looking ahead and thirsting for that next blockbuster franchise, stakes its claim on children's author Angie Sage's Septimus Heap series. Life will go on, of course, because, in the scheme of things, it's really not that big of a deal. And, sure as rain, something'll come to fill in that void, although I doubt it'll be Septimus Heap. Meanwhile, there's this movie that just came out.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER & THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, at a running time of 2 hours and 18 minutes, dares to be briefer than the other Potter films. It's also even darker as it deals quite heftily with Harry's volatile teenaged angst, as well as the steadily worsening climate in the Potter universe. In the prior film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK3S">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Two-Disc Special Edition) (Harry Potter 4)</a>, Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) returned to the flesh and celebrated the act with murder. He even had a magical tussle with Harry. But, as ORDER OF THE PHOENIX commences, it's evident as hell that no one but a loyal few believes Harry's story. As Harry later pens to his godfather Sirius Black, even though Harry is back at Hogwarts, he has never felt more alone.<br /><br />The movie begins, of course, with Harry pining and resenting away in sweltering London (his buds have been incommunicado). When he's forced to utilize his Patronus charm on two Dementors to save himself and his bullying cousin Dudley, this becomes a frowned-upon feat deemed worthy of expulsion from Hogwarts. He does get out of that scrape, thanks to a strangely distant Dumbledore, who pleads Harry's case to the Ministry of Magic and then stalks away, leaving Harry futilely calling out his name. Reinstated at Hogwarts, Harry continues to have nightmares about a mysterious door, which then leads him to believe that he has a frightening mental link to Lord Voldemort. Too, Harry's hormones are raging and he persists in a foul mood until an unexpected new friend straightens him out.<br /><br />Meanwhile, all is not right at Hogwarts. The head of the Ministry of Magic, paranoid in these nerve-wracking times and fearing Dumbledore's vast influence, gets a foot in Hogwarts' door by assigning a toadie as the school's new  teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts. This person is Dolores Umbridge, officious and pink-clad. Professor Umbridge, breathily vile and prim-and-properly vindictive, does away altogether with practical, hands-on magic learning and, in one quietly chilling scene, punishes Harry for being outspoken. As her status at Hogwarts grows, it becomes clear that, with apologies to Lord Voldemort, Dolores Umbridge is the true centerpiece villain of the film.<br /><br />Somewhat lurking in the background, the Order of the Phoenix - the secret society formed to combat and foil Lord Voldemort - continues to affect Harry's life, as more than a few of its members consist of folks near and dear to Harry. The Order makes noise in the beginning and in the climax, but disappears somewhat in the film's middle as the focus shifts to the doings in school. Hermione, alarmed that the students are rendered vulnerable with the lack of training, convinces a reluctant Harry to become, on the sly, their new teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts. These students call themselves Dumbledore's Army, the core members of which will be later severely tested in a life-or-death wizardly struggle. But, before that, they still have to pass their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) exams.<br /><br />I went into this screening pretty stoked but not as excited as I perhaps could've been. I was much aware that this film is the lesser of the two upcoming, back-to-back Harry Potter events. Make no mistake, the seventh book is the BIGGER deal and the knowledge of its imminent release took some gloss away from my excitement in this film.<br /><br />Yet, I liked this film, and very much. I like it almost as much as the 3rd and 4th installments, which I thought were the best ones. So, with a few caveats, HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX is a very worthwhile entry in the series. The innocence is gone in this series, of course, having been irrevocably crushed with Cedric Diggory's murder in the GOBLET OF FIRE. Absolutely, the films faithfully echo the progressively grimmer tone and mood of the books. And this one is the darkest yet. However, the film still carries moments of zest, such as the Weasley twins' liberating final act of defiance (but where were the swamps?). On occasion, it still cavorts in enchanted whimsy (Umbridge's commemorative plates of cats, the students' Patronus guises). The special effects remain spectacular and, particularly in this movie, serve to briskly move the plot along.<br /><br />The kids are growing up. What we have here is a Harry who's portrayed as realistically as you can get, given the fantastic world he inhabits. Daniel Radcliffe flexes his acting chops and simmers and glowers as young Harry, now fifteen but feeling more isolated than ever and going thru what every fifteen-year-olds go thru, except more so. The rest of the kids are maturing nicely, with Emma Watson still leading the pack in terms of presence and quality of performance. Rupert Grint, he ain't bad, either. Newcomer Evanna Lynch as the wonderfully wonky Luna Lovegood is a welcome addition (but, what is a "nargle," exactly?). The last of the kids to make an impression is Matthew Lewis as the hapless Neville Longbottom, for whom I believe J .K. Rowling has plans.<br /><br />All Shakespearean stage and film adaptations in England must've been put on the backburner as just about every middle-aged Brit actor seems to have poked his or her head thru this particular door (What's Patrick Stewart waiting for?). Not enough of the old reliables get decent screen time, mind you, but Imelda Staunton as  Dolores Umbridge does much to make up for that. I haven't seen anyone convey such sadistic, yet oh-so-polite bureaucractic malice since the last time I was at the DMV. Meanwhile, Helena Bonham Carter, also a freshman here, simply revels in gothic villainy as the unhinged Bellatrix Lestrange. More of her would've been a very good thing.<br /><br />No, it's not a perfect film. It's definitely not for newcomers to the Harry Potter mythos or for those who haven't read the books. The scene transitions are sometimes choppy and disconcerting. People show up without an intro and move in and out of the screen, leaving the audience to follow along, which is no biggie for the constant reader/viewer but might leave rookies to the series scratching their heads. I walked away with this feeling that the film was too short and a bit abrupt. With the book nearly at 900 pages, there's simply no way to include and then amply cover all the fun stuff and the key moments. Frankly, I expected more of the Weasly twins' final rebellious prank at Hogwarts, but, alas, there wasn't enough all-out anarchy in their festivities. Also, an important element - Sirius's growing recklessness and feelings of moroseness and futility - is barely touched on. Not to mention, the film deals differently with the ferreting out of Dumbledore's Army. And not enough Room of Requirement. But the most galling thing about this film (and the book, too, come to think of it): no friggin' Quidditch! But, you do get to see Harry and Cho snogging under a mistletoe.<br /><br />Enough of my yak. This is a four star motion picture, leaner and meaner, starring your favorite, lightning scarred boy wizard. The film series has now gotten to that stage where sleeves are tugged up and knuckles are cracked, all in preparation for some serious work ahead. Time to get down and dirty. So, climb onboard. The end may be around the corner, but, for now, the series is picking up some serious momentum.<br /><br />Meanwhile, make sure the nargles are kept away, whatever they are.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>David Yates took on a thankless job as director of "Phoenix," based on what was (to me) a dull and dreary book.  He's stuffed in all the book's action, such as it is, but it feels very much like a checklist:<br /><br />Dementors in Little Whinging (check)<br />The Order of the Phoenix in London (check)<br />Dolores Umbridge in pink (check)<br />Dumbledore's Army (check)<br />The battle at the Ministry (check)<br /><br />Yes, it's all there, but done without the slightest bit of emotion, suspense, or magic.  Handsome Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) gets no chance to play the matinee idol; he's reduced to rushing breathlessly from scene to scene looking surprised and saying little.  Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) have so little to do and say that they're virtually lost in the shuffle.  Ralph Finnes (Voldemort) is more annoying than scary, and Helena Bodham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) utters just two lines.  Even the long-awaited Kiss with Harry and Cho is totally lacking in feeling - just do it and move on. (check)<br /><br />The cast and crew aren't to blame for this tepid, choppy, confusing mess; the interminable book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/043935806X">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)</a> had about 800 pages of filler.  It bothered me that we don't really learn anything about the titular "Order" in either book or movie.  The mysterious (ooooh!) "prophesy" deserved a single paragraph in the book and a short scene in the movie, yet it's the centerpiece of both(?).  Yates did the best he could with this tedious story, but it's the first Harry Potter film that didn't leave me dreaming wistfully of the wizarding world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>It's the fourth year for everyone's favorite boy wizard Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe). During his summer stay with the rotten Aunt Petuna and Uncle Vernon (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffths), he is out somewhere with his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) until a death-eater attacks him as Harry uses magic to get rid of his as it is nearly gets him in trouble with the ministry for underaged wizardy in the real world. He does return back to the world of magic to Hogwarts, Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) is back as he gives Harry some warnings that could lead him to certain dangers ahead. A new teacher named Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Stauton) seems to be in charge of some of the students making them be almost like if it was the army, Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) with Harry, Hermonine (Emma Watson), Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and Ron (Rupert Grin) with other students secretly vow to go against what the ministry and even go into war preparation.<br /><br />Co-starring Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, Helen Bonna Carter, Maggie Smith, Tom Felton, Robert Hardy, Warwick Davis with the original cast of Hogwarts from the other movies and with cameo by Robert Pattison. This is more about learning about friendship, sacrifice and about the power of freedom as those are the major themes of this installment even being a bit about getting pressure due to the system as you can crush it. Here you get to meet more interesting creatures like the goofy if lovable giant known as Grawpy and more with more improved special effects that doesn't overdo the brilliant storytelling. Sure there are some cuts and changes from the book but no adaptation of a movie is perfect, it's just a great installment i recommend and is the smartest movie of the series.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives you flawless perfect HD picture and surround sound like if you saw it in the theater. The extras are quite good too like additional scenes, set tour, featurettes, production diaries and the magic of editing featurette.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>A darker movie than even year 4 due to intrinsic story being dark in the first place. Also the director is differnt in this one and  here is not as operatic and gothic as in goblet of fire. The movie and book pretty much enter the xmen mode where you can sense this movie is the preparation for the big battle between the dumbledore army and the voldemort army in the next 2 books and movies. So its like a movie which sets the stage for a larger showdown. So although there is a showdown in the end, you know that this movie is a passage to the next and final one. The movie deviates from the end of the book and rightly so. The book did not have  dumbledore  returning for the final fight with Voldemort but in the movie he does return back. In the book he Vanishes when Cornelius Fudge attempts to arrest him to move him to Azkaban. The guys are all more grown up and look cooler. The costumes are nicer and chic. The movie is greyer and devoid of color than the previous films.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>No one who has stated that this film feels like a "Cliff's Notes" version of the wonderful J.K. Rowling novel, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is wrong.  They are 100% correct.  With that said, however, I must admit that I still enjoyed this film.  For fans of the books (like myself), this film could be very brutal at times, eliminating the bulk of the tale in order to swiftly move to the primary story.  In essence, this film paid lipservice to most of the parts of the book that didn't deal directly with Harry.<br /><br />As a film, this movie is enjoyable.  It moves at a very swift pace and never gets too boring.  The action scenes are well done and the acting is, as a whole, very good.  The music was also very good, although it isn't too hard to emote "dark and gloomy" when it's all over a film.  The special effects were, as expected, brilliant.  It was nice to see the Dursleys back on the screen, no matter how brief their moment was.<br /><br />It's nowhere near five-star quality, but it does progress the film series along fairly well.  I have a few gripes that I believe need to be addressed.  Firstly, the film seems to be lacking heart, which was central to all of the previous films.  As highly developed as these characters were through the other movies, this one seemed to detach the viewer from the players on the screen.  Another problem is that key moments that were included were often treated lightly or in a careless fashion.  There are also a few editing choices that give the film a disjointed feel.  My biggest gripe was the treatment of some of the new characters like Tonks, Luna Lovegood, and Bellatrix Lestrange.  These are three of the most imaginative characters that Rowling put on paper and of them only Luna gets decent screentime.  Tonks, played by the lovely Natalia Tena, pops up, says a few lines, winks at Harry, and then makes a few funny faces before being brushed by the wayside.  Helena Bonham Carter was perfectly cast as the wicked Bellatrix, but she snarls at the camera, does the "deed" she's expected to do in the film, and the sings her way off into the sunset.  I completely understand that the director and screenwriter were trying to compound a very big book into a reasonable running time, but I felt as if they just tossed a coin to decide what stayed and what had to go.<br /><br />Could the movie have been better, yes, but it's still not as bad as a lot of films out there.  Like I stated before, a lot of the story was cut from the book to give this film a reasonable time limit.  I just feel as if the parts that were excluded were done so rather carelessly.  Compared to the other Potter films, it's a three star movie.  Compared to other fantasy flicks that have come out lately, it's three-and-a-half stars.<br /><br />If you're a Potter fan, buy it and enjoy it for what it does have in it.  Otherwise I'd just keep it as a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Harry Potter leads a rebellion inside Hogwarts as the dark Lord Voldemort begins recruiting an army. All is not well at Hogwarts as Dumbledoor is undermined by a Ministry of Magic psychopath and evtnually replaced as Headmaster. No one believes Harry that the dark lord is back so he must lead a rebellion in secret called "The Order of the Pheonix".  More and more does it become clear that Harry and Lord Voldemort are connected. With the help of his godfather, Professor Snape, and other Order of the Pheonix members, Harry must fight back and vindicate both himself and Dumbledoor. New characters, like Luna Lovegood, bring an air of comic relief in a darker story than before.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>The fifth Harry Potter film sets the stage for war.  Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is on the loose, although certain parties in the Ministry of Magic would have the public believe otherwise by publicly accusing Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) of lying about his return.  When the detestable Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) takes over Hogwarts, stripping the curriculum of practical spells, and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seems to turn his back on Harry, the angry young man takes it on himself to train his friends for the coming conflict.<br /><br />Radcliffe turns in his best performance to date in the least of the Potter films.  I haven't read the book yet, but perhaps it was a mistake to make the longest book to this point into the shortest film.  The screenplay often seems to race from development to development and the huge cast has become positively unwieldy, with many incredible actors reduced to brief, unsatisfying walk-ons.  However, it was still very entertaining and its awkward nature is perhaps inevitable; like "The Empire Strikes Back," the whole film essentially serves as a prelude to much bigger events to come.  The earlier films were far more successful at maintaining their own independent identities.  At any rate, it makes me eager to see what comes next.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>Being a Harry Potter fan, I liked this movie regardless what coulda/woulda/shoulda been.<br /><br />In this installment, Harry Potter faces doubts and suspicion from his peers as well as from the Ministry to his proclamation that Lord Voldemort is back.  To Harry's frustration, Dumbledore doesn't help alleviate those doubts and suspicion because he keeps evading Harry.  To keep a tight rein on Hogswarts, the Ministry has sent Delores Umbridge, the Senior Undersecretary, as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  However, she soon appoints herself as the High Inquisitor when she perceives things at Hogswarts as out of control and unnecessary.  Meanwhile, Voldemort and his army are getting stronger.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I was surprised to learn that the largest book of the Harry Potter series has been reduced to the shortest movie of the series.  Both the Harry Potter books and movies are formulaic.  However, in this movie, some were deleted (like the quidditch game) and some were "fast-forwarded" (like the Christmas break from school & Kreacher).  Naturally, I was a bit disappointed.  However, I still enjoyed the movie very much even though I thought there was more dialogue than action.<br /><br />However, I just have 3 issues.  First, I enjoyed Umbridge in the book.  Her "hem, hem" has caused my friends and I to say that to each other, especially on AIM.  So, I was expecting that line to be the thing of this movie.  Instead, it was just replaced with some regular unoriginal coughs.  Other than that, Umbridge was just freakingly good.  Second, Gwarp looks more like the Jolly Green Giant than anything else.  Third, as the title says 'the order of the phoenix', there was hardly much on the order.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I liked it even though others felt it was so-so.  I do have to agree that there less action than the previous installment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  I'm already surprised that there is a movie poster for the 6th installment.  So, I'm looking forward to that.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" - the fifth Harry Potter film - is the most sombre and subdued so far.<br /><br />It has the usual stunning special effects but there is more a focus on the characters especially Harry Potter himself who is beginning to understand the burden he bears.<br /><br />JK Rowling and the film-makers continue to successfully create a parallel magical universe for us to explore.<br /><br />Dolores Umbridge (played by Imelda Staunton) is right up there with other Potter villains playing a smug Margaret Thatcher-like matron sent to tidy up Hogwarts.<br /><br />Harry Potter's first screen kiss plays a very small part in the film and his relationship with Cho Chang is never explored.<br /><br />This is not really a film for little kids but fans of the series will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I think that when you take the longest Harry Potter book and turn it into the shortest Harry Potter film, that a large number of complaints by fans as to what has been cut will be inevitable after they watch "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."  Not that this means that the legions of fans will be bitterly disappointed by the film version, but rather that there will be regrets over not getting to see favorite scenes on the screen.  For example, Quidditch is completely out of the film, denying Ron of his best moments in the sun (start singing "Weasley is our king").  So do not be surprised when your mind keeps shifting to what has been cut and distracting you from time to time while watching this summer's latest blockbuster.<br /><br />When last we left our hero, Harry fell victim to a trap to bring back Lord Voldermort, which cost Cedric Diggory his life.  The Ministry of Magic wants things hushed up, but Dumbledore tells the students at Hogwarts that Diggory was murdered and Lord Voldermort murdered him.  As this fifth film opens Harry and his wicked cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors.  Harry uses his wand to defend them and is summarily expelled from Hogwarts for using magic in front of a muggle.  The good news is that Harry gets reinstated, but the bad news is that the Ministry of Magic uses the opportunity to appoint Dolores Umbridge,  Senior Undersecretary at the Ministry, as the school's new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.  However, Umbridge teaches only the theory and not the practice because she insists Harry is a liar and there is nothing the students need to learn to defend themselves from.  Then things get progressively worse.<br /><br />"The Order of the Phoenix" was the most maddening book to read, not because it was the longest, but because I detest Dolores Umbridge.  As far as I am concerned she makes Voldermort look good, because he knows he is evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty inside, while Umbridge thinks the ends justify the means.  She is puritanical, sadistic and hypocritical.  If there were not going to be children reading this review I would tell you what I really think of her.  Suffice it to say, she makes me sick and I do not even take pleasure in loving to hate her, which is why my only requirement going into the film is that the Weasley Twins get their moment of glory when they become the disloyal opposition to the new order at Hogwarts.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe continues to have the tote the heavy load in these films as Harry, with Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley being reduced more and more often to reaction shots while Emma Watson's Hermione Granger remains the Mistress of Exposition in these films.  Alan Rickman as Snape remains pitch perfect casting and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is also a joy to watch, but I discovered in this film that I really like Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore, mainly because he always plays up the character's intelligence and I find I prefer his interpretation to that of the late Richard Harris, forgive my heresy.  Imelda Staunton does not look as much like a toad as Umbridge does in the book, but she captures the character's detestability from start to finish.  We are always painfully aware how dangerous she is, whether she smiles or not.  Also, Evanna Lynch steals more scenes as Luna Lovegood than Katie Leung does as Cho Chang, and it is certainly interesting to see Neville (Matthew Lewis) towering over everybody, with Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) in the silent but strong role for the pivotal sextet.<br /><br />After seeing this film I raced home and got out my copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/043935806X">book</a> and starting cataloguing things that had been cut.  Such comparisons are, as I suggested up top, inevitable for anyone who has read the book.  At this point what I missed the most were some of the conversations between Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Umbridge where Minerva verbally flaws the Inquisitor.  The omission that I am focusing on the most is the whole bit about why Neville's family was a target of Voldermort (I agree with Harry: always say his name and thereby reduce its power), since that suggests implications for what will happen in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225">final book</a>, which gets released in just ten more days.  I also would have liked to have seen an over reaction to Harry discovering his father bullied Snape at Hogwarts.  My favorite part ends up being the impressive wizard's duel between Voldermort and Dumbledore.  Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg does a good job of whittling down Rowling's book and director David Yates does a competent job, but fans will simply want more.  Also, we know what happens in the next book and all of the bad things that happen in this film cannot help but seem inconsequential in comparison.  Plus, fans will be distracted by mining this film for clues as to what will happen in the last book.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>The filmmakers behind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix have done something unbelievable. Not only they have parted completely from the light and happy world created by the first two films, but they've also ignored any type of film summary. There's no synopsis of everything that's gone before. And good for that, I say. Go rent the other four if you need to catch up.<br /><br />Year five at Hogwarts begins with our hero Harry angrier than ever. Harry has spent the summer being ignored by everyone after he was discredited by the Daily Prophet for daring to suggest that Lord Voldemort has returned.<br /><br />Once again, Harry and company will have to fight he-who-shall-not-be-named while combating an government that insists and refuses to acknowledge the return of Voldemort. In doing so, the government steps up and introduces a new headmistress at Hogwarts: Dolores Umbridge.<br /><br />You will find that these are indeed "darker" times for all the HP characters. Working with writer Michael Goldenberg, director David Yates have crafted a dark tale to entertain anyone watching. The effects shows us fantastic creatures. But it's the performances where a film is really sold and here they are wonderful.<br /><br />The three leads, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, have all settled easily into their roles. But it's in the supporting cast where these films really shine. Filling out secondary roles with the cream of British theatre and cinema, like Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis and Ralph Fiennes, everyone else must rise to their level, and they do.<br /><br />The movie shows us the "weird" phase we all go between adult and child, between doing what's right and following the rules and between knowledge and comprehension. When all is said and done, Harry has grown as a character. He is on his way to adulthood with an understanding of the things he's learned in the previous four films.<br /><br />However, there are worrying signs that there are no real developments from film to film: there are no substantial increase in maturity in the films themselves. Every time I sit down to a new Harry Potter movie, I'm surprised by how very similar it is to the previous one.<br /><br />There is a definite feel with The Order of the Phoenix that the story is killing time - setting the scene for the battles yet to come in the last two chapters. This isn't a criticism as such, it's just that having to do that does leave a few unanswered questions. But then, what good would a series be without a few cliffhangers?</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>It is Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Withcraft and Wizardry, and things are about to go from bad to worse.  First, Harry and Dudley encounter a pair of dementors in Little Whinging, one of which almost manages to steal Dudley's soul.  Harry happens to have his wand on him, however, and repels both dementors using the Patronus charm.  That action causes him to get expelled from Hogwarts, but soon after, his expulsion is rescinded pending a trial hearing.  Mad-Eye and the rest of the Order come to break Harry out, and they head to the headquarters of the Order, formerly Sirius' childhood home.  From there, they speed onward to Hogwarts, where things are anything but how they've been.<br /><br />For starters, Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, is absolutely resolute in denying that Voldemort is back.  Also, he uses the incident with Harry's Patronus to place more and more Ministry restrictions on Hogwarts, starting with the appointment of one of Fudge's own subordinates, Senior Undersecretary Dolores Umbridge, as the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher.  Soon, under Umbridge's tutelage, DaDA becomes, not a place where magic is used, but a place where magic is taught, because, in the words of Umbridge, "Who do you think would want to use magic against you out there?"  Not only that, but Umbridge (through Fudge) gets a whole load of Ministry Decrees passed, further tightening the Ministry's control over Hogwarts.<br /><br />A main part of the Order of the Phoenix movie is Harry's formation of Dumbledore's Army (DA).  Since Umbridge won't teach them defensive magic, Harry vows to do just that for anyone who is willing.  The DA originally consists of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but soon a whole slew of other characters join, including Neville, who, up until this point, had been lacking in the magical abilities department.  Also, Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape are included here, as is Voldemort's attempts to get into Harry's mind using Legilimency.  Finally, the Battle at the Ministry, where Voldemort finally reveals himself to the Ministry and the remainder of the Order.<br /><br />As my title says, Order of the Phoenix is the best movie out of the five that have been released, but I have a few big problems with how they handled the transition from book to movie, the main one being time.  How can they justify taking the longest Harry Potter book yet and making into the shortest Harry Potter movie yet?  Many crucial scenes were cut out, including (not really crucial, but certainly enjoyable) Ron's Quidditch tryouts (and Quidditch in general is cut completely out), Harry and the gang's meeting with Neville and his Crucio-ed mother in St. Mungo's during Christmas break, Dumbledore's conversation with Harry at the end was cut by about 3/4, Harry's excursion into Snape's memory changed (in the book, he found out about his father's torturing Snape through the Pensieve, but in the movie, it's when Harry Protegos Snape's Legilimens spell)... I realize time constraints are a factor, but cutting an 870-page book down to a mere 2 and 1/2 hour movie is beyond me.<br /><br />In spite of the completely unsatisfactory length, I was very much satisfied with the actor choices for the new parts.  Coming in for her first ever movie role is the beautiful Evanna Lynch, who plays the eccentric Luna Lovegood.  Personally, Evanna is the best actor in the whole movie, not to mention my favorite actress; she really captures the personality of Luna very well.  Gary Oldman returns for his second stab at the character of Sirius Black, and pulls off a very convincing performance.  Michael Gambon is at his best this film, as he plays Dumbledore's character to a tee.  Another actress making her first Harry Potter movie debut is Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the demented Bellatrix Lestrange; Imelda Staunton performs admirably as Professor Dolores Umbridge, the most hated character in the movie; and finally... returning for his fifth time is Alan Rickman, who once again shows the world that there can only be one true Severus Snape, and that is he.<br /><br />Also, character development is a key part that OotP and director David Yates pull off spectacularly.  We see Neville, who before couldn't do as much as a Disarming Spell, grow into quite the formidable wizard, even attempting to battle Bellatrix when they meet in the Ministry.  We see Hermione... okay, so no real change occurs in Hermione; she's still the brave know-it-all, except this time around, she's more accepting of breaking the rules (leading to Ron's classic line "Who are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?"). And then there's Ron, who, unfortunately, is pretty much shunted to the back in favor of Hermione's more affable personality; his biggest scene (not including the battle scene) is his defending of Harry when Seamus rips him for believing that Voldemort is back.  Finally, Luna really gets her time in the spotlight, being one of the first to master Harry's teaching the Patronus spell; also, her relationship with Harry deepens alot (does anyone else besides me think that Luna's got a HUGE crush on Harry?) and she starts making friends with Ron and Hermione a bit more, too.<br /><br />To close... the innumerable omissions may irk many a die-hard Harry Potter fan, but don't let that discourage you from going to see Order of the Phoenix.  It's still the best Harry Potter movie to date- it just could have been a little bit longer and, by extension, a little bit better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>The Order of the Phoenix is the fifth book/movie in the Harry Potter series.  If you're reading this without starting at the beginning, you need to stop here and go back.  There's really no point in starting in the middle of things.  As for this movie, I think they really did great in the beginning with the series, but starting with the fourth movie, things seem to be slipping a bit.<br /><br />Harry Potter doesn't start off his fifth year very well.  After defending himself against Dementors, he is almost expelled for using magic while underaged.  Even worse, Voldemort is back and noone seems to believe him outside of those closest to him.  In fact, the Ministry is making him look like a fool and actually posting one of their own within Hogwarts school.  And she's a terrible nightmare, who just seems to have it in for Harry.  With Voldemort growing stronger and the kids at Hogwarts not as protected as they should be, it's a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe: Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Helena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix Lestrange<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus hagric<br />Ralph Fiennes: Lord Voldemort<br />Brendan Gleeson: Mad Eye Moody<br />Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore<br />Gary Oldman: Sirius Black<br />Evanna Lynch: Luna Lovegood<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br /><br />I had noticed in the fifth book that Harry seemed much much angrier than ever before.  I think Radcliffe pulled that off in this movie, but due to the limited scenes we never really know why he's as angry as he is.  Sure there's some stuff that happens that would make anyone angry, but it wasn't nearly as well explained as it was in the book.  Watson and Grint still backed him up well, and it just wouldn't be the right movie without the three of them in it.  Gambon as Dumbledore I still have mixed feelings about.  That warmth is still missing from him, although he does have that commanding presence.  I do have to say I absolutely loved Lynch as Luna Lovegood and though she did a fantastic job; spacey yet caring.<br /><br />The plot somewhat follows the book, but once again certain elements are missing that just really make the story.  Sometimes you need a little backstory on things and it was sadly lacking here.  Those scenes that were included were rushed and jumbled and didn't really give a good feel on what the whole story is all about.  A lot of it would have just been easy to make conversation scenes too, but would have held so much information that they would sitll have been important.  Still, the action scenes were well done and they returned a little of the detail in this book, especially within the Ministry of Magic itself.  So I did appreciate that they tried to make the scenes look as authentic as possible.  I just wish they would have spent as much time as that on the story too.<br /><br />The scenes, as said before, were well done.  Lots of detail and the use of magic was visually stunning.  I especially liked the battles scenes and the way they zipped about the screen.  Very neat way of showing that.  The moving pictures are always fantastic, although in the case of Umbridge, the evil teacher, her kitty pictures were almost as loathsome as they sounded in the book, and I even like cats!  They did a good job of recreating that.  The music was still good, but not at the forefront like it is with most of the other movies.  There's still the classic opening song, which I love though, so that's the most important thing.<br /><br />If they start going back to the plot these movies will definitely improve.  I know they can do it, they did it in the first few, so here's hoping they improve!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>As with all the Harry Potter movies, it takes awhile for someone who has read the books over and over to adjust to the things that are left out. But also as with all the others, the cutting was neatly done. I won't bother to mention what is left out, but concentrate on what is in.<br /><br />We start with an attack on Harry and his cousin Dudley (yes, a muggle) by a pair of dementors. What the heck are dementors doing in Little Winging? Really good question, since they're all supposed to be at Azkaban, guarding the prisoners. That there is a massive breakout of convicted death eaters later in the movie suggests that something is very wrong indeed with Azkaban. Has the Ministry of Magic lost control? If so, who has gained it? Voldemort?<br /><br />Anyway, the Order of the Phoenix rescues Harry from Little Winging and takes him to their headquarters in London, a house Sirius Black inherited from his family. There's a family tree tapestry that has several burn marks on it, including where Sirius' entry was. We don't get much chance to see the rest of the tree, though. And Creature has only a very minor role.<br /><br />Harry discovers that the Daily Prophet has been cooperating with Cornelius Fudge in a campaign to blacken Harry's and Dumbledore's names, apparently because Fudge is worried that Dumbledore is raising an army to fight the Ministry because Dumbledore wants his job. That's nonsense, of course, although there eventually is a "Dumbledore's Army" in mocking response to Fudge's paranoia.<br /><br />There are a lot of sub-plots that are somewhat distracting, but they are all there for a reason. Harry's infatuation with Cho Chang, for example, becomes important when she [not her friend, as in the book] betrays the DA under veritaserum interrogation. And Hagrid is missing the first semester, but that becomes significant because he brings back his half-brother Grawp, who ends up being more significant to the elimination of Dolores Umbridge than he had in the book.<br /><br />Dolores Umbridge is the most obnoxious Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher the school has ever had, which is saying something. She is what we used to call a pink and black witch. In fact, I don't recall that she ever wore robes like the other teachers. She wore pink fluffy things, mostly very silly-looking stuff. She talks in a high-pitched kindergarten teacher voice, and is enormously silly. But she is vicious, really vicious. I will leave it to the movie to express just how vicious she can be.<br /><br />Since Umbridge will not teach DADA correctly (she has them copying a beginner's book three times, so that they remember it, but does not teach any real spells), Hermione persuades Harry to teach those who want to learn for real, and creates the DA: Dumbledore's Army, named to mock Cornelius Fudge's paranoia. They discover the Room of Requirement, and learn a great deal until Umbridge discovers them and puts them out.<br /><br />Then there are Harry's dreams, and something which is more than a dream for him. He dreams about Mr. Weasley being attacked by a large snake, but he's aware of a point of view that suggests he IS the snake in the dream. When he wakes up, he wastes no time reporting this to Dumbledore, who moves fast to investigate through the portraits of former headmasters in his office, who can visit other portraits of themselves elsewhere and report back to Dumbledore within minutes. One goes to the Order's headquarters one to the Ministry, and then to the hospital where Mr. Weasley is taken after he is discovered in the Ministry, badly injured.<br /><br />But then Harry starts dreaming of other things, chiefly a closed door in the Ministry of Magic, and a long black corridor, and eventually a room full of glass globes. Finally, he dreams that Sirius Black is in that room and being tortured. He decides to go to London to rescue Sirius, and several members of the DA insist on coming along: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna Lovegood. And without going into detail, they recover the prophecy (that's what those glass globes were) that relates to Harry and Voldemort, and they fight the death eaters who show up with Voldemort to try to get the prophecy back from them. Then members of the Order of the Phoenix show up, and fight the death eaters, too. Sirius is killed in the process, by Bella Lastrange. [Who, by the way, looks nothing like what I imagined her, but is very effective.] Finally, Dumbledore shows up and fights Voldemort to the point where he is vanquished - not killed, but vanquished.<br /><br />It's a terrific movie, possibly the best of the series so far. Even though a great deal was left out or truncated from what was in the book, the cuts are well made and the story is completely engrossing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Widescreen Edition) being the fifth film in the Harry Potter from 2007 feels quite short many times. In the novel form it is the longest book of them all; however, for some strange reason this film is also the shortest. At times it feels as if the director rushes through things and much of the sub-plot is lost. Radclife does a very good job as usual but I feel that having read the book, that the director David Yates somehow did not read the entire book, but merely nibbled at it. The music by Nicholas Hooper is not nearly as good as that of John Williams. The special effects are quite but nothing out of the ordinary. I give this movie a strong 3 out of 5. 3/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A18HHKM6WGEF9D.html">A18HHKM6WGEF9D</a><br/><p>As other reviewers have noted, by necessity a lot of book 5 is left out of this movie, in order to keep the length manageable, but I think that is OK. Just watch it as a movie in a movie series, not as a play-by-play of the book, and you will be able to appreciate it. The focus is on the most essential aspects of the story - the growing threat of Voldemort, the denial of the ministry and media to accept this, including their smearing of Potter and Dumbledore, the evolution of the Order of the Phoenix, the growing authoritarian repression at Hogwarts under Professor Umbridge, and Harry's struggles with Voldemort's increasing presence in his mind. That's  A LOT to cover, and the movie does it well.<br /><br />This is a dark movie - the death of Cedric at the end of book and movie 4 marks the turning point in this series. From this point forward it is an out-and-out battle between good and evil, and the darker mood - and look - of this film reflects that. There is a lot of tension, and a lot of repressed (and expressed) anger, in the form of Umbridge, and, of course, Harry. Everyone is struggling to come to terms with what is happening, and many are denying it. Harry's status as an outsider is cemented, and yet, he rediscovers the importance of love and friendship in the form of Dumbledore's Army. This is a lot of psychoological complexity, coupled with adolescent angst, and everyone manages to pull it off.<br /><br />The final climactic scene, in which Dumbledore helps Harry 'expel' Voldemort from his mind, is critical to understanding the themes of this entire series, and I think it is done justice here. That in and of itself is enough to make me love this movie. So my advice is to forgive what is not covered, and assess it according to what is really most important to the series - if everything had been put in, some of the subtler scenes that drive the psychological drama would have been more rushed. Choices were made, and it's all to the good in my view.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was one heck of a book, and the movie lives up to it. Special effects are used well in this movie, and the writing was done well. And good god, the actress who played Umbridge was spot-on, right down to the sugary-sweet voice, attire, and office decor! So many movies prove to be disappointing adaptations, but so far, the movies for the Harry Potter series continue to deliver.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this it the fifth instalment of harry potter and not disapointing. i loved the special effects and the actors are getting better and better with each movie. this is a really good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie is definitely better than the last. It has a better and more interesting storyline. It introduces new characters such as Luna Lovegood and Bellatrix LeStrange (two very interesting female characters) The Ministry of Magic is in denial that Voldemort is back, and turns against Harry and Dumbledore. They appoint Dolores Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher; a senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic. She eventually takes control of the school, which causes Harry, Ron, and Hermione to start a rebellion against her and teach their friends how to defend themselves against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry and Voldemort will come face-to-face again when he is looking for a prophecy to kill Harry. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ACKDSX71VI5HY.html">ACKDSX71VI5HY</a><br/><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" works very well in spite of a rushed script, and a gripping climax pushes it into very nice maintenance of the series' extraordinarily high standards of quality.  First-time series director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg present largely top-notch work.<br /><br />The movie's titular 'Order of the Phoenix' is an honor guard of highly decorated Hogwarts teachers and associates who have sworn to protect Harry from the growing threat of a strengthening Lord Voldemort.  In a choppy movie from a narrative point of view, the Order of the Phoenix itself is somewhat a victim of fast cuts and general shortcomings.  It does provide a window into Grimmauld Place, the expressively dark family manse of Harry's godfather Sirius Black.  Gary Oldman again delivers a nuanced performance in what is a very important film for his character.<br /><br /> Simultaneously one of this movie's strengths and weaknesses, The Ministry of Magic ensures Harry will have enemies inside Hogwarts as well as outside of it.  Due to creative shortcuts, the Ministry is often glossed over in the film.  Ironically, in the book Ms. Rowling spends too much time expounding on it.  A balance could have and should have been achieved.  In the person of Dolores Umbridge, though, falsely sweet insincerity has a monstrous voice.  The name itself can mean 'painful offense.' Esteemed actress Imelda Staunton plays the character very well.<br /><br />Returning actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint again deliver natural camaraderie and acting skills, and are joined by returning colleagues Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.  Messrs Radcliffe and Rickman have an impressive scene together as Professor Snape ruthlessly attempts to train Harry to resist Voldemort's violent encroachments into his mind.<br /><br />Series newcomer Evanna Lynch makes a positive impression as Luna Lovegood, the offbeat sweetheart whose odd pronouncements always carry an ironic kernel of wisdom.  It's a difficult part to play believably, and Ms. Lynch does so extremely well.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is very, very good.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is where the films start to blur together for me, where I can barely remember how one left off and another began.  I suppose this might be the case with those who like myself are not reading the books, but it is a wonderfully entertaining experience and I never feel any lessening of enjoyment when we put these on.  We are watching the entire series prior to the finale and I am again in awe of the subtle interconnections of plot, the threads of deepening themes, and mysteries to be later explained.  As always, it is a pleasure to see the actors grow.  This is the best series of sophisticated kids' films that I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7F5SS">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a> is another great installment in the Harry Potter series (and, in my opinion, much better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PMV9FG">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition)</a>). It features the internal dissension in the wizard world between those fear Lord Voldemort versus the bureaucrats who fear losing power. Imelda Staunton as the Ministry of Magic bureaucrat Prof. Umbridge plays her part well. Often funny, always perky, she steals the movie. She has a great soundtrack theme as well. Nicholas Hooper's theme for Prof. Umbridge is a perfect mix of control-freak and 1950s female streotype.<br /><br />I took off one star because, as a movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7F5SS">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a> can't stand alone. It tells the story of the book well enough. However, at the end of the day, it seems too transitional, too much a gap-filler between the return of Voldemort and the final battle. It never really develops into a compelling enough story in its own right. If you're not a Harry Potter fan, this movie won't hook you onto the series. If you like the other Harry Potter movies, I think you'll like this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" - the movie version - IS missing lots of content from its book counterpart. Also, the screenplay has wrought a lot of big changes on the book's content and chronology. If you're a book-to-film conversion purist, or a HP Book fanatic, this fact, before anything else, might well keep you from enjoying the movie to the full. That said, if you can go into this one with an open mind (and I had to force myself to do just that, HP Book fanatic that I am), you might find yourself enjoying this movie version of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" for what it is - a fast-paced, well-made, beautiful-looking ride through Harry & co's fifth year at Hogwarts.<br /><br />The good: Acting-wise Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint keep improving, and this movie is no exception, they're very, very good in their roles. Michael Gambon is still an excellent Dumbledore and Alan RIckman's Snape is absolutely brilliant during the Occlumency scenes. It's nice to see the Dursleys back again at the start of the movie, and Harry Melling is excellent - loathsome and bullying - in his short turn as Dudley. Katie Leung is a great Cho - certainly we'll see more of her as an actress once the HP series is finished - and the rest of the cast, the heavyweights like Dame Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, David Thewlis and so forth - don't really get enough screen time to show off, but are perfectly plausible all the same.<br /><br />The newcomers are fantastic, too - Evanna Lynch makes for a great, believable Luna Lovegood and Helena Bonham-Carter's rendition of Bellatrix Lestrange is absolutely brilliant (let's hope she gets more screen-time in the "Half Blood Prince" adaptation!).<br /><br />But it's Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge who absolutely steals the show - she's brilliant. Turning on a dime from saccharine-sweet condescension to malevolent power-hungry bully, I can't imagine J.K. Rowling's original character being brought more wholly and satisfyingly to life. Okay, she may not look as much like a Toad as the book's character, but in the face of Staunton's excellent performance and faithful characterisation, that becomes immaterial. She's the best element of what must be the strongest set of performances in a HP movie to date.<br /><br />Direction by David Yates is superlative - this is a suitably adult-looking movie to reflect the changes in the HP characters' personalities and situations - and from the tense and frightening opening scenes, to the breathtaking and exciting close, Yates' talent and apparent love of this story is very palpable. Harry's "dream" sequences when Voldemort is invading his mind are brilliant - lovely to watch and very interesting from an artistic point of view - and the special effects, particularly during the closing scenes, are indescribably good.<br /><br />Production design by Stuart Craig is the absolute best in a HP movie since the original, and every element of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", Umbridge's non-toadishness notwithstanding, is nigh-on perfect. The initial scenes at the Ministry for Magic made me sit up and go "wow!", the death eaters and dementors are more menacing than before, there's one panoramic shot of Azkaban that makes that place absolutely terrifying in its believability. No. 12 Grimmauld Place doesn't get enough air time but what's there is gold, and the character of Grawp is a lot more human and fitting than I had imagined him from the book.<br /><br />The bad elements of "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" all stem from the fact that this film's running time really is too short to capture every great aspect of the original novel, and the missing scenes will, for fans of the book, cause some distress. Also, the Malfoy-Crabbe-Goyle trinity isn't particularly worthwhile or believable, and there are a couple of montage scenes, particularly involving the Educational Decrees and Argus Filch, that feel too comic, too flimsy, to belong properly to the movie. Also, there are some overconvenient events (such as Cho and the Veritaserum, and Arthur Weasley's recovery) that could have used some rewriting to get them up to par with the rest of the screenplay.<br /><br />But that said, as a movie in its own right, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is across-the-board the most satisfying HP movie to date. Best performances, outstanding direction, excellent effects and some spectacular set and costume design have restored my faith in this series, and I for one left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Definitely a must-see for fans: newcomers; watch the others before this one - it's vital to understand what's going on. As a short adaptation of a VERY long book it works on many levels, as an entry to the movie series it's outstanding, and as a film in its own right, it's a thrilling, well-made fantasy tale that will certainly satisfy you if you don't mind the cuts.<br /><br />Highly ecommended!!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>At the very end of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Emma Watson says, "Everything's going to change now, isn't it?" I remembered that quote going into "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," the fifth installment of the series; the films have greatly changed, especially in terms of heavy-handed subject matter. Not only is this film even darker than the last, it's also more mature. This is somewhat disappointing, but it is to be expected; the main characters, after all, are now fifteen years old. I have to admit that I was ready to give this film a lower ranking, simply because it lacks the bright, whimsical charm of Chris Columbus' brilliant "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." But then I realized that I was unfairly trying to compare two very different films. On its own, "Order of the Phoenix" is an incredibly well made fantasy film--well written, well acted, and great to look at, all while retaining the essence of J.K. Rowling's novel.<br /><br />The plot, while a bit complicated, is quite engrossing. In his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) will find that the odds against him are increasing. It begins when he's put on trail for breaking the rules and using magic outside of school (he had to save his cousin from a Dementor). Cornelius Fudge, the Head of the Ministry of Magic (Robert Hardy), is convinced that Harry never witnessed Lord Voldemort's resurrection. He also believes that he and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) are conspiring to take control of the Ministry. In response to this, Fudge gives the Ministry the power to enforce new rules at Hogwarts, rules so strict and unreasonable that they practically become dictatorial.<br /><br />As part of the regime change, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is introduced (as they have been in each of the films). Here enters Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), a woman that truly redefines what it means to be the teacher from hell. She oversees a complete overhaul of Hogwarts' policies, from dress codes to class schedules to curriculums. Even social interaction is highly restricted, as seen when a kissing couple is forcefully separated. Her uncompromising attitude is only made worse when joined with bright smiles, girlish giggles, and frilly pink dresses. This woman is incredibly phony, a ruthless, seething control freak who unfairly demands respect and loyalty. Harry understands this all too well; while in detention, he's forced to write sentences with a special quill. Let's just say that it makes a definite impression.<br /><br />Fearing that their defensive skills aren't being challenged enough--and fearing that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is nearing--Harry and his friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) secretly form a rebellion of sorts. Harry teaches the students a number of spells, hoping to prepare them for battle with Voldemort's army. The youthful passion and naivety is just as fascinating as it is baffling; a group of teenagers are willing to fight against evil, even if they don't have what it takes. Of course, no one understands this more than Harry, who begins to have terrible dreams and disturbing visions directly related to Voldemort. Unfortunately, Professor Dumbledore is of little help; for as yet unknown reasons, he's been avoiding Harry the entire school year.<br /><br />The film progresses quite smoothly for something so convoluted. Consider the fact that the students still maintain social relationships while all this is going on. For Harry, a teenage romance between him and Cho Chang (Katie Leung) is alluded to, as is a strong bond with Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), an eccentric yet understanding young girl. His enemy, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), remains a force to be reckoned with. But his connection to Ron and Hermione has and always will be the strongest. It was a pleasure to see them continue to develop, both as friends and as individuals. There's a moment when Hermione says, "It's quite exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?" "Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger?" is Ron's reply, which I found amusing. Up until then, he only knew her as a perfect student, always keeping her nose stuck in a textbook, flaunting her intelligence to both students and professors.<br /><br />As with all the other "Harry Potter" films, "Order of the Phoenix" features a number of well-established British actors. These include: Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, Warwick Davis, and Jason Isaacs also reprise their roles. Helena Bonham Carter joins the cast as Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius' evil Death Eater cousin. All add dimension to the story without becoming overbearing, which is good because room was needed for special effects, all of which are incredible.<br /><br />Yes, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is a top-notch movie, despite its dark tone. Having read the sixth book, I can only say that the next film adaptation will be even darker, which may be problematic for some viewers. Many--myself included--have to accept that the wondrous atmosphere of Chris Columbus' original film has long since developed into something denser, less innocent. But in no way does it lack any of the imagination or style that brought the original story to life. This is a thoroughly entertaining film, full of magic and surging with energy.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>I know some of the detractors of this latest Rowling adaptation have valid points but in my opinion Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not just a great Harry Potter movie, it is a great movie, period. The makers of the film successfully synthesized the longest Potter novel of the seven and constructed a 138-minute motion picture that moves along through its action without leaving out plot details that made the 2003 novel the wonderfully shadowy read it was. Daniel Radcliffe has grown immeasurably as an actor, as have the other younger cast members, and John Williams' score has never sounded so fitting or so possessing. A strong balance was struck in this outing between atmospheric visuals and dialogue, something sometimes unreached in the last four Harry Potter movies, despite the fact that they, too, were classics. The final sequence wherein Dumbledore and Voldemort wage a wizards' battle was a special effects tsunami that swept aside all disbelief and left everyone I know convinced that should they ever truly witness two wizards in combat, it would look exactly like that! I've seen the Order of the Phoenix three times at the theaters, and still can't wait for the DVD. It is the closest thing to a trip into a magical world we can ever hope to have. Now bring on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I'm ready!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I liked this film much better than GOF, in terms of lateral comparison. It was a radical departure from the book, though. The former films have omitted details; this one changed the plot pretty significantly. I can accept a film in a different universe than its book, but this is unsettlingly different. Cho was wronged by the screenwriters, much as I can't stand the character. There is no real explanation for the twins sudden dramatic departure. The relevance of Harry's insight into Snape is without anchor. Lucius' role is... well out of proportion (though easy on the eyes). Neville's parents are glossed over, as is the sharing of his birthday with Harry. Sirius' madness is overlooked, thus the later misnomer has little impact. Sirius is aveda'ed. It ended on a way too hopeful note. I am very disappointed with the way Sirius' death was handled. It was anticlimactic. It was too subtle. Part of that was Helena Bonham Carter seeming quite blas&eacute; in her role. She didn't seem like she really wanted to be there so I wasn't really vested in her wrongly cast spell against Sirius. I do feel the silence following Sirius' parting worked against the scene, not for it, creating levity rather than tragic density of emotion. All of the core actors have grown in their roles except Emma. She is mostly heaving chest and eyebrows in this film. She is a beauty, though, and certainly dedicated. Everyone else, though, was wonderful. Dan has come a long way in his acting ability. In this film he comes into his own as an actor. Rup rules, as usual. Draco was under used. This is the first time I thought any of the young ones looked older than their character's ages, specifically Dan and the twins. Evanna Lynch is wonderful. Visually the film is stunning. It is non stop movement, physically and emotionally. The chemistry between Daniel and Gary is spot on. They are very physically comfortable with each other and the little aside touches were in that way more telling than the many embraces that we were to assimilate as "family." There wasn't as much tight writing in this one. Clearly the emphasis had refocused to deepening the emotional range of the characters and actors. I love Rickman and Isaacs.<br /><br />My favorite moment of the film (apart from the "LOOK AT ME" bit) was when Sirius tells harry that when this is all over they will be a proper family, then closes the door on his own family tree. So symbolic, that.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD were not as unwieldy to navigate as with the other DVD releases, but they still would be entertaining to little ones.  This film, though, is probably a bit too intense for little ones to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>The 5th movie in the Harry Potter series is again a great installment in this movie franchise.  As usual, the mood is darker than the previous movie, though we do have some true romance in this one.  The cast is big, as we have numerous characters from all the previous movies, with several new ones, both students and professors.  Alas this is the first movie without any Quidditch scenes, though this is more than compensated by some awesome broomstick flying thru downtown London.  And we finally have some extensive duels to the death between adult wizards and witches, with two of them forming the movie's climax.  Overall, a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful as Bella Lestrange, but this movie adaptation of one of the richest (and best) books in the series feels condensed to the point of lunacy; the book's spectacular (and very cinematic) concluding chase through the ministry is almost entirely cut, whole months of the book seem to have been excluded, and I have no idea how someone unfamilar with the novel would keep up--why make the longest book into the shortest film?</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>When I first put down the fifth Harry Potter book I had told my friends that when the movie was made it was going to be amazing. 'Order of The Phoenix' was a real step up in the Harry Potter saga. A story that originated around magic spells and fairytales became a real world of war and politics. Harry Potter knew that this year at Hogwarts was going to be no different than the previous. Witnessing a fellow student die at the hands of his enemies the previous year things have gone from bad to worse. The Wizadering World has been torn between believers of the dark lords' return and those who just want to live in denial. Unfortunatly the second side is the side with all the power as the Ministry is trying to keep everyone in line including the children at Hogwarts. With a new teaching on the grounds insituting new rules to keep Harry's mouth shut, Harry and his friends are not going to take it lightly.<br /><br />This film was going to be a challenge for whomever took the directors chair. Small time director David Yates created a great film rich in the detail of the story. Eventhough a great amount of the books material was cut it was just like 'Goblet of Fire' There is a lot of pointless side story which really has no reference to the meat of the story and that is why you do not see those in the film. The characters have really come a long way acting wise. The children have really evolved since the begining and new commer Imelda Staunton nailed Umbridge. What David Yates did that was very different from the previous directors was that he made these characters real. With all the wizardry and magic there was a real sense of realisim through the diologue and the emotions expressed by the characters. Now with Yates signed on for the final 2 installments (3 technically due to the divison of Deathly Hallows) I am even more excited to see how the rest of this story emerges on to the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Many arm-chair quarterbacks have slammed David Yates' turn at the helm of the "Harry Potter" franchise, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."  These killjoys need to take to heart Anton Ego's soliloquy on criticism at the end of Pixar's "Ratatouille" and remember how hard it is to create something, but how easy it is to criticize.<br /><br />This is by far the most difficult adaptation of Ms. Rowling's beloved series of novels.  "Phoenix" is the darkest and longest of the first five novels, easily containing enough material for two films if one took the same stance as Chris Columbus and threw everything from the books into the movies.  Yates didn't have that luxury, and so drastic cuts were needed.  For devoted fans, this movie likely feels like "highlights from Harry" instead of a true movie, but such is the fate of most film adaptations.<br /><br />The question is, how good an adaptation is it?  For the most part, the movie triumphs brilliantly.  Harry is traumatized by Voldemort's murder of Cedric Diggory at the close of "Goblet of Fire," but it seems that only (some) Griffindors and Albus Dumbledore are willing to admit that Voldemort is back.  The Ministry of Magic sticks its head in the sand and questions both Harry's and Dumbledore's credibility, leading to a dark analysis in the story of media manipulation and government paranoia.<br /><br />Not for nothing is there not a single mention of Quidditch in the entire movie.<br /><br />The acting is all top-notch, particularly from the three kids we've seen grow up before our eyes in this series.  The cast of experienced British actors is at their typical excellent best.  But the movie is practically stolen from our favorite heroes by a villain, and not Lord Voldemort.  Insead, Imelda Staunton swipes the movie with her evil schoolmarm, Dolores Umbridge.  This lady says more about evil with a polite 'hem-hem' and a glassy stare than any number of foam-mouthed rants by lesser actors - she is a riveting, horrible pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Special kudos also go out to newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, Harry's spacy classmate.  This moon-unit's a charmer.<br /><br />The DVD is also chock-full of the usual DVD extras we've grown to appreciate from the Harry Potter series.  While nothing rises to the level of Peter Jackson's four-DVD sets for the Lord of the Rings movies, these are excellent additions for the kiddies (lots of games and whatnot).<br /><br />A must-see for any fan of Harry Potter, although die-hard fans will likely grab their dog-eared copy of "Phoenix" to see what exactly Yates left out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>I'm NOT a Harry Potter fan! The previous films I found to be a combination of either annoying, dull, confusing, or in last Harry Potter film -  very disturbing. But they finally  got one right - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is thoroughly entertaining!  It stands on its own.  It has depth. And, you don't need to know a thing about the Harry Potter storyline in order to enjoy it!<br /><br />After leaving the theater, it dawned on me that this story is truly from a European perspective. Anyone in Europe who has lived through War World 2 knows first hand what a powerful monster (dictator) can do to a society. It's not an abstraction, like it is for the vast majority of Americans. While Lord Voldemort  is physically portrayed as a devil, what he really is is a very powerful war lord. One that would be only to happy to destroy any person, group of persons or institutions that stand in his way of absolute power. He exists for no other reason. He's not after wealth or glory, just raw power!<br /><br />There's even a Neville Chamberlin character in this rather clever film. He and his allies are so blind to the obvious threat of war that they undermine everything they profess to hold dear. They are so arrogant and foolhardy they become caricatures of sheer stupidity.<br /><br />There is so much good that can be extracted from this story - what it means to a leader, that wisdom can come from the most unlikely of places, the importance of planning ahead, there is strength in numbers,  don't always believe what you read, improvise in a crisis,  help can come when you least expect it!<br /><br />I have high hopes for the final Harry Potter film. If Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is any indication of what is to come - I wait with great anticipation!</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the darkest Potter film to date.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his fellow Hogwarts students continue to fight evil as well as hone their skills as wizards.  In his unrelenting attempt to avenge the death of his parents by the demonic Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) who appears in and out of the film, Harry never gives up his untiring efforts.  For the premise of this film, Hogwarts's leadership is under scrutiny that involves accusations against Harry and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and one of the new characters, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), the annoying and sinister teacher who is after the coveted title as headmaster.<br /><br />The film is extremely long.  But as with the other four Potter films, the cinematography and special effects are exceptional.  The pyrotechnics are loud and shattering, especially the concluding scenes where Dumbledore battles it out with Voldemort, which resonates duel-like scenes from very well known sci-fi film, such as Return of the Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.<br /><br />Thus far, the storyline is complex and intense as the characters battle good and evil.  And another interesting observation is how Harry and his friends continue to grow before our eyes. Yet again, Harry experiences one of his first pubescent encounters with his ongoing romance with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and the two share an unavoidable intimate kiss under the mistletoe, which he describes somewhat immaturely to Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) as very wet; we also see the ever so delicate and sensitive Neville (Matthew Lewis) slowly mature with confidence.<br /><br />Harry and the Order of the Phoenix has fantasy and adventure that many Potter fans have grown accustomed to.  As the characters and film content matures, this particular film may appeal to older children and adults.  Otherwise, the Potter films never ceases to amaze.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The film continues to shed light on (the very well known by now) Harry Potter, as he attends his fifth year at Hogwarts.  As his powers are growing and the mystery surrounding his true purpose in life still evades us, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher proves to be much more than most can handle, disrupting Harry's already fragile state of mind in the process...<br />Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.<br />Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman (!), Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.<br />The concept, the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is guaranteed to provide a great deal of entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  In short, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection when it becomes available!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Before year five at Hogwarts can even begin, Harry (Radclife) and his cousin Dudley are attacked by dementors in the muggle world.  Soon Harry finds himself on trial for having used magical powers to save himself and his cousin.  Voldemort's (Fiennes) presence is felt everywhere.  The Ministry of Magic denies he is alive.  Those at Hogwarts, specifically the Order of the Phoenix, know better.  To stop the truth from getting out, the Ministry sends Dolores Umbridge (Staunton) to Hogwarts.  She gradually begins to seize power, punishing those students and teacher who dare to challenge her.  Meanwhile, Harry is having visions and teaching his classmates himself to prepare them for an inevitable showdown.<br /><br />Gone are the lighter days of "Harry Potter" 1 & 2.  "Order of the Phoenix" is firmly traveling down the dark road that will end two movies in the future.  The movies have grown up, and that is very welcome.  Each is better than the one before, and "Order of the Phoenix" is no exception.  The actors could play their characters in their sleep at this point, and returning to the wizard world is like visiting old friends.  Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have all become the beloved characters at this point, and the supporting cast has accomplished the same with less screen time.  David Yates brings yet another voice to the director's chair, and pulls it off despite limited motion picture experience.  "Order of the Phoenix" is another fine film in what is probably one of the most significant movie franchises ever.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" adopts a menacing tone as the Voldemort spreads his influence over the wizarding world. After Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and cousin Dudley are attacked by dementors, the life-sucking creatures that guard Azkaban prison, Harry is whisked away to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization sworn to combat the forces of the Dark Lord. Soon he is back at Hogwarts School, having barely escaped expulsion for the underage use of magic in self-defense. But defamatory press against his allies and protectors, the insistence by well-meaning adults that Harry be kept in the dark about matters that most concern him, and a new insidious Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), put Harry in a persistently foul mood. If that were not enough, Harry is plagued by visions of Voldemort's scourge.<br /><br />The most fun in the Harry Potter movies is often found in the extravagant behavior of Hogwarts teachers, and "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" pulls another coup on that front. Megalomania has never been so entertaining as when coupled with Delores Umbridge's sweetness and pastels. The film doesn't make light of the dire situation suffered by students and staff. Umbridge's spying and prying at Hogwarts is a thinly veiled Inquisition. Her efforts to stamp out individualism through Draconian policies are condemned as products of fear and egotism. A stark message made more than palatable by Imelda Staunton's gift for caricature. Evanna Lynch gives an especially charming performance among the students, as the eccentric, spacey Luna Lovegood. A new set, the interior of the Ministry of Magic is eye-catching but too CGI for my taste. The movie isn't as brooding as the book, but a shadow is unmistakably spreading over the wizarding world.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I was apprehensive about going to see "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" because I was very disenchanted by the last film in the series, "Goblet of Fire." However, "Phoenix" surpassed all my expectations. There are a few small things about the movie that bothered me, but overall, I think it was brilliant.<br /><br />This film is based on the fifth novel in the Harry Potter series. I'm sure most people are familiar with the plot, but basically this is Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, and it gets off to a very crappy start. The Ministry of Magic attempts to expel Harry from school because he used magic to defend himself when dementors attacked him and his cousin, Dudley. Also, the majority of people think that Harry and Professor Dumbledore are lying about the return of Lord Voldemort, and everyone treats Harry like he has the plague. To top it all off, the Ministry has appointed one of its own members, Dolores Umbridge, to fill the vacant position of Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts. Umbridge wastes no time wreaking havoc in the school and using all means necessary to put the Ministry's stamp on things. Meanwhile, Harry is distraught over mysterious dreams and visions that disturb him in his sleep. The film builds up to Harry's discovery of a new connection he has to Voldemort, and everything culminates in a violent encounter deep within the confines of the Department of Mysteries.<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie. It was just as dark and gritty as I'd hoped it would be, and as it needed to be in order to stay true to the book. Obviously, a lot of material had to be cut for the film adaptation, but I think the screenwriters did an excellent job editing the unnecessary parts and making the story flow together so smoothly on screen.<br /><br />Here are some of my favorite things about the film, along with a few gripes. (Warning: The rest of this review contains major spoilers, so continue reading at your own risk!)<br /><br />+ The new additions to the cast were amazing, especially the actresses who played Bellatrix LaStrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). Bonham Carter is amazing in everything she does, and the first time I read "Phoenix," I knew she had to play Bellatrix...I just wish she had a bit more screen time! Staunton was absolutely perfect as Umbridge. I would have enjoyed seeing Umbridge's character be slightly more sinister at times, but really, I have no complaints. And as for Lynch, she was born to play the part of Luna Lovegood, hands down!<br /><br />+ The thestrals looked awesome, as did Kreacher the house elf.<br /><br />+ I thought Harry's relationship with Cho Chang was very sweet and well done. Their kiss under the mistletoe was so cute!<br /><br />+ The appearance of the Dark Mark tattoo on the Death Eaters was very well done: super creepy!<br /><br />+ The Ministry of Magic looked incredible in the film: it was just like I imagined it while reading the book. I was also quite impressed with the scene depicting the jailbreak from Azkaban: very slick!<br /><br />+ Generally, most of the plot changes were very slight and only served to better enhance the story for the screen (Harry seeing the memory of his father and Snape by using occlumency instead of spying in the pensieve; the Weasley twins only causing one major disturbance for Umbridge; etc.)<br /><br />- The character of Tonks (Natalia Tena) was introduced for the first time in this film. She looked really cool, but we didn't get to see much of her, which was a shame.<br /><br />- Speaking of missing characters, where the heck was Mundungus Fletcher?! His absence didn't really affect the plot of the movie too much, but I'm sure there were many fans of the book that were disappointed Mundungus was cut out altogether.<br /><br />- Rita Skeeter and Professor Lockhart were also missing from the film. Again, their absences didn't hurt the movie, but I was really hoping for a brief Kenneth Branagh cameo.<br /><br />- I don't understand why Kreacher's role in the whole trick involving Sirius wasn't played up more. We saw Kreacher twice, and Sirius even gave him the order to "go away," but no one ever explained how Kreacher was the one who helped Voldemort lure Harry into coming to the Ministry.<br /><br />- There was no Sirius/Snape confrontation. Major bummer!<br /><br />- We never saw Dumbledore instruct Snape to meet up with Voldemort and the rest of the Death Eaters. This is the one omission from the film that bothered me the most. The significance of that event plays a big part in book seven, so I wonder how it will be explained in the next film.<br /><br />- Although the final scenes at the Ministry were good, I was a little disappointed with the way Sirius was killed. He never really dueled it out with Bellatrix: she just sort of appeared and mumbled "avada kedavra" under her breath, and it was all over. It should have been much more dramatic with more build-up to it. Also, it was never explained how Dumbledore and the other members of the Order knew that Harry and his friends were at the Ministry that night. Finally, the whole Harry/Voldemort possession thing at the end was kind of weird. I guess all these things were done in the essence of time and to make things look more dramatic on screen, but I think it could have been a bit better.<br /><br />Despite a few minor flaws, "Phoenix" is possibly the best Harry Potter film yet. I think the movie really stayed true to the spirit of the book, and I enjoyed it very much. I'll probably go back to see it in the theatre at least once more.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>oh that harry potter and his crew. the trio does it again. they're back in the order of the phoenix, a little older, and better than before. beginning at the end of the last film. harry filled with sorrow, and changing and feeling things he can not understand. he returns to school where things don't get any better. he reunites with old friends, but still he feels alone. plagued by dreams, and taken over by anger he doesn't know what to do with. his old friend dumbledore is keeping his distance from harry causing him even more frustration. this is no more about small things, this is a more darker, and thrilling film. more dangers, more villians, and more magic. some are back to help and others to destroy. for example, dolores umbridge the new teacher of the dark arts who refuses to teach defense magic. instead planning to take over hogwarts and driving everybody mad. she gets to a point where you just want to ring her neck a few times. she's an evil woman, with the looks of a psycho. all of the characters deserve an honorable mention, because the acting and story lines of all are superb. he who shall not be named has returned and he is trying to destroy harry in all the ways. his army of villians is strong and crazy. brilliant characters, both mad and as black as they can get. some scenes are terrific. you get a bit of everything in this one. things are won, some are lost, but nothing will ever be the same. the magic is still there, and in my opinion even better. the fantasy and the way they make you believe there could really be a world such as this is great. you watch it and you get lost for a minute or two and you forget reality. i just wish it would have been a lot longer. other than that i say keep on bringing the witches, the magic, and the the bad guys.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>This 5th entry in the Harry Potter series sits comfortably in what has now become a much darker and more mature series.  Though this is not be intended as violent and unappropriate at all, it is however much more than what began as a simple children's tale.  Voldomort - the evil dark Lord, is back in force, and assembling his armies of darkness while on the other hand, the armies of good are preparing for battle as well.  Hogwarts, though present throughout the film, focuses very little on actual school this time around.  The events going on in the world around Hogwarts, specifically the battle of good vs evil raging, has infiltrated the institute and placed heavy burdens on everyone inside.  And though Phoenix doesn't have all the action and humor that supplied some fo the eariler Potter films (and not a mention of Quidditch), the impressive story still makes this a superb film.<br /><br />A very serious tone surrounds the air in this film, as is a sense that there is no time for play (the overall lack of fun and humor adds to that feeling).  Still, it is a very mature and well told story, that keeps the interest of events high and suspenseful.  And though there is an overall lack of action, the climax makes up for it with an incredible visual feast of effects in an impressive duel between Dumbledore and Voldomort himself.<br /><br />The reality of death is back again, after the loss of Cedric in the previous film.  The loss of a fellow Hogwarts student looms the air, and forces Harry to come to some sort of terms with the facts, and with his crush, who had a relationship with Cedric - Cho.  In Phoenix, another dies by the end of the film, and this time it someone much closer to Harry, and the death is not taken so lightly this time, as the incredible feelings of anger begin to take over Harry.<br /><br />I say this every time I write a review for the Potter films, but we have come so far since the first int he series.  Each film adds more and more to the story, being more reality and more emotion in a very grown-up situation for simple teenagers.  The children have indeed grown up by far, but that just makes it more fun for the adults who are watching these great films.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Picking up where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7414C">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a> let off, the fifth Harry Potter flick is the dark tale of maturing students thrust into some very adult conflicts. After he sees the murder of his friend Cedric by the evil Lord Voldemort, Harry finds himself at the brunt of a smear campaign. Seems the head of the Ministry of Magic doesn't like the fact that Harry and Professor Dumbledore are talking about Voldemort's return and is doing everything he can to discredit their reputations. Sort of like the Fox News of magic.<br /><br />As such, Fudge contrives to have the persnickety policy stooge Delores Umbridge (a perfectly cast Imelda Staunton) to makes sure that Hogwarts operates in the manner the ministry deems most fit, even if it means playing dirty. Dissent is callously stifled, relationships are prudishly regulated and students are forced to take equivalency exams that drive Hermione to gripe "We're not learning how to defend ourselves; we're learning how to pass our O.W.L.s." (No wizard left behind, maybe?) The movie then shifts into high gear, driving Harry and a select group of students into an underground mission, to train against Lord Voldemort and protect Hogwarts from not just the evil without but from the conservatives within.<br /><br />Where "The Order of The Phoenix" significantly differs from the other Harry Potter films is in its seriousness. Snape (Alan Rickman finally getting to reassert his character away from buffoonery) reveals why his animosity for Harry runs so deep. Ron and Hermione are acting as young adults, with new characters (Cho, Nymphadora and Luna) sparking Harry's adolescent hormones. Draco Malfoy is not a caricature in this film, and his father Luscious returns as a malevolent force. Helena Bonham Carter brings villainy to Bellatrix Lestrange (shrieking "You Half Blood!" at Harry at one moment). The whimsical tone of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W10FWU">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W74EQC">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</a> is replaced (and is kind of a loss) by the darkening of the mood and themes. But after all, it is hard to stay young and cute after 6 years and with an Evil Lord jamming your mind and seeking to destroy you.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix" is a transitional movie in a series gradually forging into maturity. In fact, this is a difficult movie to recommend for younger children because of the darker themes and political intrigue (torturing students is pretty darn dark, even as fantasy goes). But as Daniel Radcliff shows that his acting skills are advancing beautifully and the series refuses to bland out, this is a highly recommendable DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>I have never read any of the books. I do read, just haven't read Harry yet. But when you disregard any notion that this movie belongs solely to please those that are fans of the book you have a phenomenal display of magic and deep characterization that leads to a dark, tense film with enemies and a plot worth exploring. This film benefits from the most updated technology that swarms your vision with more colors than possessed in the most colorful rainbow. They broadcast(at least for me) a field of ambiance that has rarely been shown before. It makes me beg for the crystal clear brilliance of HD, or blue ray. The climatic duel near the end between wisened powerhouses was comparible to the lightsaber fight/orchestration at the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI. I was that enthralled. And the more aggitated Harry went along, a kettle boiling over, the more they hinted that Harry may not be the savior after all, the more I was attatched to the human storyline. All this being said, I suppose it's impossible to dismiss the quality of the book for those who adore them and have endured the endless pages by their favorite author, and to those hordes of people I sympathize by saying I understand completely. But at least you have more to come, be optimistic for the sixth movie. They may succomb to your desires and make it eleven hours long.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>For fans of Harry Potter, reviews are beside the point.  They will adore "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," the fifth film in the lucrative Warner Brothers franchise based on the enormously popular J.K. Rowling books.  But for average, non-Potter addicted movie goers, this installment will have a strong sense of deja vu.<br /> The current film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) concluding a summer among the Muggles.  As his cousin and his cousin's sneering posse taunt Harry and try to provoke a fight, they are set upon by a couple of Dementors.  Harry uses magic to vanquish them, a feat that lands him in hot water at Hogwarts.  He has used magic in the presence of a Muggle.  Put on trial, Harry is exonerated only by the intervention of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).<br /> The theme of the film is established in this opening sequence:  The potential for good and evil exists in everyone.  The path to either is fraught with consequences.  The person you become rests with the choices you make.<br /> Harry and pals Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) discover changes at Hogwarts that are detrimental and destructive, and must covertly develop their powers to combat them.  The fascistic Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) has been sent to Hogwarts by the Ministry to fix everything that's wrong.  She installs a new, useless curriculum that contains no means for the student wizards to defend themselves against threats from the Dementors and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).<br /> Unlike earlier Potter films, "Order of the Phoenix" devotes surprisingly little screen time to the Harry/Ron/Hermione friendship.  In fact, Ron and Hermione are more like supporting than main characters.  Director David Yates and screenwriter Andrew S. Walsh have streamlined the novel to avoid an overly long running time, but the movie suffers in the details, some visuals, subplots (especially of Ron), and character development.<br /> Radcliffe is lankier and with more of a brooding quality than in previous Potter films, and his acting has matured.  He keeps his Harry grounded, even though a world of fantasy is the film's milieu.  His ability to make Harry a young Everyman is a key element in the movie series' success.  Radcliffe gives Harry a darker coloring this time so that he becomes less the fun-loving kid, amazed and thrilled at every new experience.  As an almost-adult, he sees real danger in the world around him.  Rather than leaving these dangers to the adults to reckon with, he is at the fore in confronting them himself.  His sense of responsibility to a greater good is being tested in "Order of the Phoenix," and this growth of character draws us in.<br /> Next to Radcliffe, Ms. Staunton has the most central role in "Order of the Phoenix."  Her Dolores Umbridge is every child's nightmare of the authoritarian figure from hell.  Self-righteous, power-hungry, toadying to her superiors, nit picking and petty, she has been armed with carte blanche from on high to destroy all independent thinking and competence at the school.  Dressed in assorted suits of flamingo pink hues and chirping with ominous cheer, she is everywhere, sticking her nose in corners, taking notes on teachers' performance and evaluating the school's efficiency as one might check on a factory's assembly line output.  Ms. Staunton, nominated for her moving performance as "Vera Drake," gives a broad, over-the-top performance that sometimes renders her Umbridge a bit cartoonish, but it is nonetheless fun to watch this veteran chow down on the scenery.<br /> Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, becomes Harry's ally in battling the forces of evil and comes off as a sort of young Ben Kenobi as he mentors and fights beside Harry.  Ralph Fiennes, in horrid make-up and prosthetics, is unrecognizable as Voldemort, but succeeds in infusing him with both stature and menace.  Fiennes' screen time is brief, but his Voldemort commands every scene he's in.<br /> Special effects are present in "Order of the Phoenix," of course, but they're not as frequent or impressive as in the earlier Potter films.  When we do have an effects sequence, it is welcome, and usually fits well into the unfolding story.  There is a sense of wonder, for instance, when the young wizards secretly practice their spells and apparition-like animals dart hither and yon.  There is also a wonderful sequence of winged creatures transporting Harry and his friends over the countryside, and one of the mysterious, shadowy centaurs grouped menacingly in the dark of the woods.<br /> The Catch-22 of the Harry Potter movies is the belief that if not all of the book's sequences are included in the movie, loyal fans will rise up in protest.  On the other hand, if every sequence is included, the movie becomes a three-hour exercise in bladder control.<br /> Director Yates understands this dilemma and has gone the route of a tight running time, though at 138 minutes, it could still stand some trimming.  I have always felt that a movie should stand on its own and not depend on every viewer knowing every plot turn or slavishly including every sequence.  No movie can provide the detail that a book can, nor do movies have the time to do it.<br /> "Order of the Phoenix" comes off as a less-than-stellar adaptation of the Rowling book.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>Like all of the other movies this one came so long after the book that I can't remember a lot of details but the adaptation seems as "good" as any to me. It is, after all, a darker toned story that still managed to get details right in spite of being heavily edited down from book form. "Goblet of Fire" seemed to have more color in it if my memory is right, this one is dark and depressing colorwise.<br /><br />The "extras" disc is pretty much a waste of time with Tonks tour of the studio being kind of silly, not telling a person much, the editing section was the usual stuff too.<br /><br />I'm waiting for the next movie now.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>Entertaining, but what happened to the special effects? The flying scenes looked like something from a 1950's B-grade SciFi flick. The giant? 1970's video game quality.  This was all about making a film fast for as little money as possible. Most of the SFX were top grade, but they really skimped on the ones that counted.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>One of the things that I always liked about the Harry Potter book series was Rowling's writing, since, while at times simplistic and not as detailed as other fantasy writers, she was able to make it more accessible and reader-friendly as opposed to Tolkien who's one of the more clinical writers and very, shall we say, "scholarly" in his writing? However, I found the 5th book, the Order of the Phoenix, the most trying to read since the length didn't translate to pacing and Harry's caps lock-laden outbursts were quite annoying. So while we have the shortest movie based on one of the longest books, it's quite successful at the adapting of it...most of the time.<br /><br />Year 4 ended with Harry Potter being witness to Voldemort's resurrection and upon returning, the Ministry of Magic has been renouncing him and Dumbledore by saving they're all lies. With wizards disappearing and adults who don't want to include him despite his needed involvement, Harry finds the 5th year with an incredibly troublesome teacher, and having to teach his classmates how to protect themselves at what's coming.<br /><br />As far as plot progression goes, Order of the Phoenix is the least advancing of the stories so far since we do find out some things but, with knowledge of how the books end, they're not as substantial and it's the latter books that are the most plot heavy. But the main issue regarding Phoenix is that it's a bit too jumpy with many scenes getting at most a couple of scenes before we're off somewhere. For example, in the book when Harry arrives at 12 Grimmauld Place, the book gives us time to settle in and gives some breathing time; here it's a couple of scenes before we're off to Harry's hearing. While yes, the book does cut out some excess, it does so with almost breakneck pace as if someone was timed and had to get in as much as they could before the buzzer rang.<br /><br />However, the actors are more confident in the roles with several big name British actors such as Imelda Staunton nailing the perfect Umbridge as well as Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon still doing fine work. And while castmates Rupert Grint and Emma Watson feel even more<br />"supporting character mode" than ever, Daniel Radcliffe does a good job at doing that frustration of being too old to shrug off responsibility while being too young to ignore it without being a big crybaby like he was in the books (man I wanted to smack him when I was reading). The scene stealer is Evanna Lynch who probably does the perfect Luna Lovegood and the book's best new character was thankfully the best cast as well.<br /><br />With its exciting finale complete with some of the best effect work the series has had (but Grawp, the big giant is bad; not Scorpion King bad but still), the film may not be the best Potter but it's still an enjoyable watch anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Unlike about every person in the world, I actually liked the book, but it was hella long and i wondered what was going to have to be sacrificed in order to make the movie..I was surprised at how little was left out, really im so sick of Quiddich, I didnt mind them nixing that.  I actually really liked this movie, eventhough I didnt like some of the new special effects, like the new dementors were not very good and the whole beginning felt very different from the book, that is not how i pictured the beginning at all, though the thestrials and the Ministry of Magic are amazing...I did like Stanton as Umbridge, she was an improvement on the annoying character in the book and the lead actors just get better and better..I've really gotten to like Gambon as Dumbledor and the scene when Voldemort battles Dumbledor is the best in the series thus far, it is spectacular.  This is a much darker film, but then again the book was dark, and Radcliffe is getting better as Harry, his acting is improving and his scenes with Gary Oldham are very good.  Overall, this is my favorite movie in the series thus far, it was the toughest book to make a movie out of so I commend the screenwriter and director for being true to the book and maybe even besting the book.  This same director is going to do the half blood prince, so im looking forward to seeing his take on that book, which is my favorite in the series.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Harry Potter nirvana this summer, the film based on the fifth book has just been released and the seventh and last (?) book has just been published. I have yet to finish the book, but I have seen "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix".<br /><br />The fifth book in the series; "Order of the Phoenix" is not my favorite entry by author Rowling. Director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to downplay many of the elements that made the book slightly unpleasant and put more focus on the characters. "Phoenix" is the longest book and the shortest film, so far, so some elements have been removed completely, for good and bad. But the increased dramatic skills of the three leads, fantastic set design and special effects and a supporting cast of every British character actor ever to appear in film, combine to make this a most enjoyable installment in the film series.<br /><br />My main problem with the book was Harry was portrayed as too typical a teenager. Yes, he was at that age, so show a little of it, but Harry is supposed to be above such things. He fought with Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione, and this went on and on. Worse, he ignored the advice and instructions of his friends, making him seem a little dumb.<br /><br />Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is spending another summer with the Dursleys (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) and their nincompoop son, Dudley (Harry Melling). Sitting on a swing, trying to avoid the heat, Dudley comes up with two friends and tries to pick a fight. The weather turns and Dudley and Harry run into an underground tunnel to escape the downpour. Two aurors immediately descend and attack Harry and Dudley. Harry quickly uses his wand and fights them off. Before you know it, he is called before the Ministry of Magic to answer the charge of using magic in front of Muggles. Mad Eye Mooney (Brendan Gleeson) and other members of the Order of the Phoenix arrive to take Harry to their secret headquarters. There, he spots Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), his godfather, and the rest of his faithful friends and supporters. He is a bit petulant about Ron and Hermione's lack of communication, but softens up when he hears they were ordered by Dumbledore to remain silent. The next morning, at his hearing, Harry is surprised to see Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) appear in his defense. The matter is quickly settled, but Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge decides to appoint Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton, "Vera Drake") as the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Upon their arrival, Harry, Ron and Hermione are amazed to learn they will be learning no practical magic, just theory; no one seems to believe Lord Voldemort has returned, so they form a study group of their own, under Harry's tutelage. But will Professor Umbridge, now appointed a sort of Hogwarts High Inquisitor, be able to find out their plans. Will Professor Snipe (Alan Rickman) be able to help Harry defend himself against He Who Must Not Be Named (Ralph Fiennes)?<br /><br />Directed by David Yates (HBO's "The Girl in the Caf&eacute;", lots of British television) and written by Michael Goldenberg ("Peter Pan", "Contact"), "Order of the Phoenix" moves at a fast clip, combining nice tongue in cheek humor with good, believable moments of the kids taking matters into their own hands. Add some great set design and some amazing special effects and you have a really enjoyable movie.<br /><br />"Harry Potter 5" is the darkest film to date, which is appropriate because the books get progressively darker as the stakes become higher for Harry and his friends and associates. As the danger increases, people die and Harry has to live with that; in "Phoenix", he still deals with the death of Cedric during the Tri Wizard Finals in "Goblet of Fire". But as Harry is growing up, he also has other things to contend with, mainly puberty, and he can't seem to keep his eyes off Cho Chang (Katie Leung), who is also grieving over the death of Cedric, her boyfriend. Will Harry and Cho give in to their temptations and enjoy a little kiss?<br /><br />Hogwart's Professor of Defense of the Dark Arts has proven to be a difficult position for Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to staff. Each year, the professor runs into problems and leaves the position. This allows Rowling and the filmmakers to introduce new characters and give a variety of great British actors a good role to sink their teeth into. "Order of the Phoenix" is no exception and introduces us to Professor Dolores Umbridge. Played by Imelda Staunton ("Vera Drake", "Freedom Writers"), Umbridge is a prissy woman, always dressed in pink, who has a lot of cats. Yet, when crossed, she can be extremely nasty, while always maintaining a sickly sweet demeanor. Umbridge is appointed to the position by the Minister of Magic, to keep an eye on Dumbledore, who he suspects is trying to take his job. At Hogwarts, she immediately decorates her office in pink and hangs many plates depicting her favorite pet cats. But don't let the grandmotherly exterior fool you. If you cross her, she is not above having you write lines with a special quill that will also write the words in your flesh, providing a permanent reminder of your impertinence.<br /><br />There has been a bit of press in the last year about Daniel Radcliffe's debut in "Equus" on the London stage. Apparently, he disrobed in one scene and was so self conscious about the role that he worked out a lot to make sure he looked good. What does this mean to this film? Not a lot, except Radcliffe has matured and become a bit more buff since even the last film.<br /><br />Perhaps his stage debut has helped in another way. In "Order of the Phoenix", Radcliffe, and for that matter, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, have all significantly developed their acting ability. Radcliffe, who as the main character, appears in virtually every scene, has really become a very good actor and brings all of this talent to this story. As Harry Potter, Radcliffe has to show the most range of emotion, conflict, joy and character development. He has always been good, but in the last few films, his skill has developed exponentially and he finally appears to be a natural actor, giving the character traits and ideals we didn't necessarily get in the first few films.<br /><br />Rupert Grint, who plays Ron, Harry's best friend, is the actor who has developed the most during the series. He no longer relies on bugged out eyes and comical mannerisms and has relaxed, allowing his character to become more natural.<br /><br />Because the three kids have grown up playing these roles, they seem to finally be comfortable with the characters. As they have grown, so have the three friends, each bringing their own personalities to the role and making them unique and interesting.<br /><br />It seems with each of the films, the various adult actors have their moments in the sun and then fade into the background, providing a rich background for the kid actors. In "Phoenix", Emma Thompson's Sybil Trelawney and David Thewlis' Remus Lupin have the briefest of roles. Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall has a few choice moments, including a showdown with Professor Umbridge.<br /><br />But the real star of the supporting cast is, as always, Alan Rickman. Despite the relatively few scenes featuring Professor Snape, his character is too important to the overall fabric of these stories to fade into the background. In his first scene, Rickman only has to stare at Umbridge, as she questions him about his history at Hogwarts to perfectly exhibit every trait of his character. He utters a single word, "Obviously", eliciting laughter from the audience. When he speaks, his voice rolls off his tongue in a decidedly sticky manner, providing the character with all of the conflict it needs.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter also makes a first appearance as Bellatrix Lastrange, the sister of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and an ally of Voldemort. She breaks out of Azkaban prison and then makes her way back to London to aid Voldemort, using her hatred of Muggles and half-breeds as fuel. The role is very over the top, but nonetheless interesting to watch.<br /><br />In "Phoenix", the filmmakers introduce us to Sirius' house, a property he has donated to the Order of the Phoenix, for their use as a headquarters. They also show us to the Ministry of Magic for the first time. Each of these locations is fantastic. The attention to detail really helps both seem real and add to the ever-growing world of "Harry Potter". I don't want to go into too much detail, because you should experience them for yourself.<br /><br />Each of the film translations has trimmed bits of story here and there. It is a necessity; there is no way they could film everything in any single book and make a single movie. There was talk about making "Goblet of Fire" into two movies, one of which would be released in the summer with the conclusion released at Thanksgiving. But they decided against that. In "Order of the Phoenix", they chopped out entire stories, making the resulting film leaner, faster and perhaps even a little darker. Gone is the Quidditch match in which Ron leads his team to victory. Gone is Doby the house elf and Hermione's efforts to help the house elves organize against their oppressors. These would have added time to the film and the film doesn't seem to suffer extraordinarily due to their absence. It just seems odd to have a Harry Potter film with no references to Quidditch. None. Zero. Zilch.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" proves to be yet another example of the trend this entire series of films has established. Much like the actors playing the three leads, the films just keep getting better and better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Personally, the films are never going to live up to expectations, no one would simply sit on their backsides for long enough to see Order Of The Phoenix put into a film, scene for scene. You'd be there all day. So yes there are a lot of reviews that are going to say that it's the weakest movie, cos it's the shortest movie, made from the longest book. And I'm shocked at myself that I'm actually going to say I agree.<br /><br />I recently re-watched the films, and re-read the last three books. Re-watching the films, I discovered that however I much I liked the second movie first time round, Dobby annoyed me every time, and I found myself pressing the skip button. To me, the second movie is the weakest. But now Order Of The Phoenix is following closely behind. But I still like it.<br /><br />Order of the Phoenix the book had simply had too much filler in, and although I enjoy reading it, I do find myself skipping bits, particularly when Dolores Umbridge opens her mouth. She was by the worst character, but not a bad character, just dreadful the way she's portrayed. I was shocked when it was announced that Imelda Staunton would be playing her, and I couldn't imagine how this would work. Until she burst onto screen wearing an array of pink. From the nurse in Shakespeare In Love, to this, certainly a defining career highlight.<br /><br />Lots of stuff has obviously been cut, from important plot points to unnecessary bits. I did find myself watching the movie, and thinking about what had been cut, cos it was really disjointed at times. Dobby was completely cut (thank God for that!), so instead of him telling Harry about the Room of Requirement, it's Neville who finds out. We have to put up with Kreacher, but he barely features. We completely lose Quidditch in this movie, not even a glimpse of Ron letting in a goal (is it still a goal?) The ending seems to be slightly changed, and it's Cho who this time who tells Dolores about the Room of Requirement, and not her best friend, as it was in the book. St Mungo's is all but virtually cut out as well, as are Hermione & Ron's new roles as prefects.<br /><br />I'm disappointed to say that Ron is virtually non-existent in this film, which is a pity, he seems to be shunted aside to introduce Luna Lovegood, and give her more of a role. It's not a good thing that Ron is basically hardly in the film at all. Other reviewers seem to be raving about his comedic timing, he's hardly there!!!<br /><br />The finale seems very tame compared to the book, and I wasn't impressed. I thought the scene where Remus Lupin was holding Harry back, was well done, as it was completely silent apart from a truly brilliant score behind it. And I've always loved the main Harry Potter 'theme' ever since the first film, but there was a whole new dimension added to it to this time, bringing a darker, more haunting theme.<br /><br />I have to say I was not keen on Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore in this film. Stepping into the late Richard Harris' shoes was very brave, but what Dumbledore does during this film is explained at the end, but I still didn't like Michael Gambon.<br /><br />There were some excellent casting decisions in this film - Helena Bonham Carter put in a surprising appearance as Bellatrix Lestrange, a witch-like but incredibly sexy woman, who's a cousin or something to Sirius, but has gone over to the bad side. She was just simply not on screen enough. Neither was the actress who played Nymphadora Tonks, or just Tonks if you will, part of the Order, who can change her hair, clothes, facial features with her flick of her wand. She was a brilliant character in the book, but is sadly underused in this. Apart from a glimpse at the start, and at the end. She was gorgeous too, and I loved how her hair changed when Mad Eye Moody called her Nymphadora! I'm not sure about Luna, played by Evanna Lynch. She was a great little character, but she was just too kooky, and she seemed to have a bit more interaction in the book.<br /><br />I can imagine there's a few people out there who will be very disappointed with Order Of The Phoenix, but personally, I'm counting down the days the next film! Hurry up already!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I thought it was better than The Chamber of Secrets and The Goblet of Fire, but not as good as The Sorcerer's Stone or The Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't like how a lot of the characters were given nothing to do this time around. Even Ron and Hermoine didn't have as much dialogue. With each film throwing in new characters and the old ones staying around, these movies are getting quite congested. For the first time, the story itself seemed to be just a set up for the last two movies, with no clear resolution.<br /><br />This film is the darkest one yet in the series and they really cut down on the humorous scenes. I did like most of the acting, as well as, the SFX.<br /><br />Not the best in the series by far, but worthy of the Harry Potter name.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix wasn't my favorite book from the series but as a movie it's extremely entertaining. I loved the movie but I only have minor complaints. It sorta rushes it's way through the book skipping a few different things. I think Ron on Harry's Quidditch team and being pretty bad was one of the best things about the book. Quidditch however isn't even mentioned once in the movie.<br /><br />  I've seen reviews saying this is the darkest and it is but there's still some charm and I still found it to be very entertaining. Evanna Lynch surprisingly gets most of those laughs every time she's shown as Luna Lovegood. She captures all the strangeness of the character perfectly. Plus she even has such good chemestry with Radcliffe that I would've preferred him getting with her instead of Cho. Also new is Imelda Staunton who does a fine job getting you to hate her and I hated her as Umbridge. That's a compliment since Umbridge isn't supposed to be liked and she succeeds at making you hate her. Helena Bonham Carter is also well casted as Bellatrix Lestrange and does a fine job in the role even if it's a small part. She's perfectly evil as her anyway.<br /><br />  I really think this one has possibly the most charm despite critics thinking it's too dark. I don't even see how Roger Ebert could give the others high ratings but this one only 2 1/2. Order of the Phoenix the book was supposed to be serious with Harry having to deal with getting older and learning not to count on grown-ups. Director David Yates does a fine job with all that but he never makes the film overly dark. When I saw two 2 1/2 star reviews I thought, why is Yates coming back for Half Blood Prince, he's gonna kill the series.<br /><br />  After actually seeing the movie though I think he did one of the better direction jobs. His film probably has the most energy next to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban but his film is probably also one of the more heart-warming Harry Potter films. I just hope that he doesn't rush through too much of Half Blood Prince though, this film was based on the longest book yet it's the shortest movie. I think it well done despite that but once movies take you to the wizard world I'm in no hurry to leave, so I don't mind if they are long, as long as they don't leave out too much. Still though I think Yates made a good movie despite some fans complaining. He made he a book that some fans liked the least into one of the most entertaining films of the series, well I think so anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Yep Mr. Riddle has returned and the minister of magic (Robert Hardy) refuses to believe this. Of course everyone sides with the minister against Harry and his closest friends. Dudley (Harry Melling) practically gets sucked to death and the Dursley's (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths) get a new flat screen T.V.<br /><br />The story plods along and leaves out key information revealed in the book. Every character stares at their feet and counts from one to ten before making their calculated statements. The film carries the story forward but does little to contribute other than a prophecy which takes all of five minutes.<br /><br />I do have to say that there was one good exception Helena Bonham Carter made a believable Bellatrix Lestrange the crazed dispatcher of Neville's parents.<br /><br />In place of story and acting we have lots of CGI filler. The graphics are par with today's technology with the exception of the department of mysteries; that location looked so phony that you would think you were watching Saturday morning cartoons.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/043935806X">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582348251">Harrius Potter et Philosophi Lapis (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Latin Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>As Hermione Granger spoke at the end of the Goblet of Fire, things weren't going to be the same at Hogwarts with the reemergence of Voldemort, the Dark Wizard who murdered Harry Potter's parents and was twice defeated (q.v. the first two movies).  Order of the Phoenix confirms Ms. Granger's words.  In it, the wizarding world has been torn apart between those who believe that Voldemort has returned, and the majority under Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge who has gone from being a pleasant but ineffective fuddy-duddy to a paranoid trying to hold onto power, thinking Dumbledore is using Voldemort as an excuse to rallying an army of supporters to overthrow him.<br /><br />Harry finds support in his usual circle of the red-headed Weasleys and Hermione Granger, but he also gains an ally in the loopy Luna Lovegood, a blonde girl who seems to be in her own world, dreamily speaking of charms against nurgles--presumably the wizarding equivalent of gremlins, and who like Harry, can see certain creatures.  She also skips down the corridors like a little girl--quite a character, that one.  But he starts to have a bit of an attitude, extremely trimmed down from the book, where he was very vitriolic at times.  Whether it's being a bit irritated at Ron or speaking out his mind against the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbrage, it's clear he's got the usual teenage issues.<br /><br />It's because of Umbrage, a stooge for the Ministry who doesn't seem too keen on properly educating Hogwarts's students in the Dark Arts, that Ron and Hermione persuade Harry to properly teach those who want to learn dueling and casting defensive spells.  He's qualified after all, given what he's gone through.  It also nets him a brief love interest with Cho Chang, the cute Chinese girl whose boyfriend Cedric was killed at the end of Goblet of Fire.  Umbrage has a typical sickeningly insincere sugary smile and voice, and dressed in pink and with a hat, she seems a demented version of Margaret Thatcher, especially in a form of torture she employs against the students who disobey her.<br /><br />Harry's reunion with his godfather, Sirius Black, provides a welcome relief of sorts, as he is the only kind of real family he has left.  While the two don't have many scenes together, it's clear that despite the limited amount of time the two spent in the third movie, there's a real family connection there.  Black and two ex-professors, sometimes werewolf Remus Lupin and Mad Eye Moody are members of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret countergroup against the reactionaries who don't believe Voldemort's resurrection.<br /><br />But Harry has been having more visions.  In his sleep, he sees Ron's father Arthur being attacked by a snake, which helps the attack from being fatal.  And he keeps seeing Voldemort, pretty menacing with that bald, noseless face of his.<br /><br />Certain interesting portions of the book have been excised, no Quidditch, and we don't see the screaming portrait of Sirius's racist mother, not to mention Harry's Aunt Petunia's knowledge of a few things in the wizard world.<br /><br />The regulars are...well, the regulars as usual.  Of the newcomers, Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) steal the show from the regulars.  Though only having roughly ten minutes of screentime, Bonham-Carter really makes the long-haired, demented cousin of Sirius Black another memorably villainous creation.<br /><br />David Yates does a credible enough job on the Order of the Phoenix, but with the dark and serious tones of the movie, one might come away thinking the magic has gone in favour of character development, which is well done.  Only the Weasley twins, Fred and George, provide a brief reminder of this, when they mischievously bid farewell to Hogwarts with a superb pyrotechnic display while the students are taking their exams.  And a fiery Dumbledore escape leads a wizard to tell Cornelius Fudge, "Dumbledore sure has style."  I enjoy this installment, though I rate it in between good and great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>The filmmakers had to make some tough choices in deciding what  to include when adapting the lengthy ORDER OF THE PHOENIX for the movies and for the most part they have done a great job.  The sequence where Mr. Weasley is attacked seems a bit rushed and if I hadn't read the book I might not have understood what was happening there.  I also would have liked to have seen Neville visiting his parents at St. Mungo's though that might have been too poignant of a scene for this all ready quite dark movie and the Longbottoms's situation is discussed.  One of the greatest pleasures of this series is seeing the child actors  growing up from kids to teenagers and all the major players both teens and adults  do a great job.  Imelda Staunton is comically loathsome as Dolores Umbridge and I think we've all known her slightly less exaggerated counterparts in the muggle world. I've always been a fan of both Helena Bonham-Carter and Emma Thompson each now in  middle age and wonderful in character parts in this film as the evil deranged witch Bellatrix and the hapless divination teacher Sybil Trelawney respectively.  As in all the previous Potter movies special acting honors should go to Alan Rickman for playing so well the complex and enigmatic Snape.  And the set and special effects look absolutely spectacular on the screen.  One caution the dementors in the opening scene, Harry's visions and the battle scenes are all very intense so think carefully about taking kids under ten.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>A lot has changed in the wizarding world during the summer between Harry's fourth and fifth years at Hogwarts. Voldemort is back, but not in the open, and the ministry is ignoring it. The Minister of Magic feels threatened by Dumbledore and Potter and has been exerting control over the wizarding press to make it seem like they are both insane liars. This somber turn of events allows Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to discuss deeper topics than in previous Harry Potter installments; topics like government corruption and control, freedom of the press, corporal punishment, etc. The film also examines public responsibility in the midst of totalitarian government through the lens of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron's underground Defense of the Dark Arts class known as Dumbledore's Army. Hefty material for a series most people look at as children's fantasy fiction, huh?<br /><br />Teens approaching Harry Potter's age already deal with issues of rebellion and angst, but in times as hard as those facing Harry in Phoenix, those feelings are heightened. When I first read the book I thought that Harry was being a bit of a brat throughout this installment, but now I realize is the magnitude of what he was dealing with. He saw the most dangerous wizard of all time rise from a place between death and life and watched him murder a fellow classmate, yet no one believes him when he recounts this information.  Dumbledore, Harry's mentor and father figure, seems to completely ignore him, and the government interferes with the dealings of Hogwarts, the one place Harry holds sacred. Radcliffe does a great job at giving life to Harry's turmoil during this installment, and it seems that the entire youthful cast is continuously growing as actors. I'm sure working with several directors and brilliant veteran actors helped them through the process.<br /><br />Once again, a new director takes over the reigns of the series in Phoenix. The choice of David Yates as the fourth and final director of the series was kind of a surprise. Prior to Order of the Phoenix Yates had only directed television movies, so many people were unsure about this somewhat untested talent. There was no need to worry in my opinion. Not only did Yates make one of the best movies of the series, he also turned the longest Harry Potter book into the shortest movie without making it feel rushed or leaving any plot holes.<br /><br />Mostly featuring returning cast members that were basically absent for an installment (Gary Oldman has a much bigger part, and David Thewlis is back after being absent from Goblet of Fire), Order of the Phoenix doesn't contain very many new characters, but the few that are there represent quite a coup d'etat in casting. Finding newcomer Evanna Lynch for the role of Luna Lovegood was a brilliant feat in and of itself, and the role of Professor Umbridge is brilliantly played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake, Freedom Writers), who brings Umbridge's toad-like qualities to life. Also joining the cast is the always marvelous Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club, Hamlet) as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange.<br /><br />I find this film to be better than Goblet of Fire, but it's still not without its failings. Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore still doesn't match up to J.K. Rowling's description of the character. While better than he was in the previous film, Gambon's Dumbledore still  doesn't create an impression of being the greatest wizard alive. I was also disappointed that certain details concerning the prophecy didn't make it into the film. In the book, you learn that the prophecy didn't explicitly mean that Harry would be Voldemort's enemy, but that it could have applied to another student at Hogwarts. It's not central to the plot, but I felt this was an interesting fact that viewers of the movie who haven't read the books missed out on.<br /><br />Critically, Order of the Phoenix is at the low end of the Potter films, tied for last place with Philosopher's Stone. At the box office, it continued the rise in box office receipts started with Goblet of Fire, surpassing it to become the second- highest grossing film of the series and of the year, with $938.2 million grossed worldwide. As this occurred with a summer release, those who thought that Prisoner of Azkaban grossed lower due to the release date were proven wrong. Of course, with its shorter run time and what is arguably the most brilliant scene of the series, Order of the Phoenix turned into quite the overall success.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZAE1I">Stardust (Widescreen Edition)</a>, I thought this movie captured the book almost better than the book itself did. I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the missing parts, but heck, that's what I've got the book for--if I want to read all the little details, I'll read the book. I view the movies as more of a companion to the books than a substitute for them, so I'm expecting things to be left out.<br /><br />The tone was suitably darker, more serious, and the actors are all well suited for their roles and convincing in them.<br /><br />I thought the movie shined where the book was weak: in particular, the scene where a certain character dies. In the book, it was glossed over, almost an afterthought--to the point where I didn't believe it. In the movie, it was clear what had happened.<br /><br />One wee pet peeve: what part of PG-13 do parents of toddlers not understand? I don't care if you let your toddler watch a PG-13 rated movie--well, as long as they're not screaming in the theater when I'm trying to watch--but for heaven's sake, quit complaining that it's too scary for them!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>If Harry Potter at the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix feels sorry for Voldemort because the dark lord can never know love or friendship, I feel almost equally sorry for those who don't read J. K. Rowling's novels and just rely on the films. As good as the movies are, including this one, they are scarcely more than sketches compared to the books. Why should this be important? Because Rowling has created a classic epic with the books, and stuffed them full of mature ideas, boundless ingenuity and clever humor, life lessons that aren't preachy or icky and with characters we come to really like or detest. No, this isn't Dickens, but as a literary tour de force, the story of Harry Potter and his growth into adulthood is unusually vivid and satisfying.<br /><br />The Order of the Phoenix isn't simply the exciting adventure, tinged with a bit of mystery and dread, that the other books and films were. With this one, the angst, worry and danger move front and center. The movie still works as entertainment, however, because it's not a stand-alone film. Those who may try to judge the relative worth of any one of the books or films needs to take into account that Harry Potter is one story, and each story in each book or movie builds on all the others before it. For me, trying to figure which is the "best" book or film would be like trying to determine which bite of pumpkin pie was most satisfying, the third bite, the fourth bite or the first bite.<br /><br />The movies, especially this one, do provide one satisfaction that the books can't. Before our eyes, literally, Harry Potter and his friends are growing up, changing from children to young men and women. We see it happen because all the original young actors, who must have signed long-term contracts or are getting a great deal of money to sign up picture by picture, also are growing up before our eyes. Harry Potter is now a young man because Daniel Radcliffe is becoming a young man. Hermione Granger's growing maturity is because Emma Watson is growing in maturity. It's odd in a pleasurable way to see small Neville Longbottom now towering over Harry, just as Mathew Lewis now towers over Radcliffe.<br /><br />Rowling's books are so good, and the movies are so accomplished as good cinema, that the "Oh, no, I'd never read those Potter stories" reaction set in sometime ago and is still prevalent among some. There is a category of individuals who automatically react condescendingly to anything which achieves great popular success. This isn't intellectual prejudice. Those who enjoy things of the mind - intellectuals - are driven as much by curiosity as by an appreciation of what rigorous things a mind can deliver. Those, however, who shiver in delight at Sondheim and only smile indulgently at Berlin, who swoon over Updike but find Dickens just adequate, who condescend to Rowling but preen over Goddard, miss the point: A good mind, a fine intellect, a curious person can find pleasure and value in all of the above. Why? Because they're all good at what they do. Intellectual appreciation of good work isn't a zero sum game.<br /><br />See the Potter movies, including this one, and be touched and entertained. Read the Potter books, including this one, and be touched and taught.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>From the opening sequence, I knew that this would be the best movie of the series. And it is. By far.<br /><br />From the outstandingly ballsy cinematography to the acting (it's like night and day between this movie and "Goblet of Fire", which was great in it's own right but can't touch this), from the witty and quirky script to the special effects, it's clear that director David Yates single handedly whipped the Harry Potter movie franchise into shape. While movies 1-4 were great, they were like unpolished stones; at points they tried so hard to go along with the books and at others tried so hard to separate themselves from the books (think "Prisoner of Azkaban"'s shrunken heads), but this movie--"Order of the Phoenix"--knows what it is. It is a film, and it makes sense as a film. Everything you need to know to understand the film is here, and--unlike "Goblet of Fire"--you won't need a previous understanding of the books or even the other movies. Certainly fans will complain about deviance from the book, but these are the same unreasonable people that wish the movies would be twenty-four hours long so they could squeeze in every line of dialogue. "Order of the Phoenix" is how a book should be adapted.<br /><br />Every actor, from Daniel Radcliffe to Emma Watson to the kid who plays Dudley, is at the tippy top of their game. They're playing young adults and they act it; they laugh, and they cry. This is the first time that I actually totally suspended my disbelief while watching a Potter film, and that was almost all due to the superb acting.<br /><br />I did expect a bit more from the climax (the important character death was kind of wiggy) but things get roaring back into shape for a perfect duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Following that, everything touched on in the movie wraps up beautifully. No threads are left untied, and no plot left with an open end. Very, very satisfying. Oh, and if that isn't enough, this should be: Evanna Lynch is spine-tinglingly good as Luna Lovegood.<br /><br />It may not be what you expected, it may not be what you thought you wanted... But for me, it was more on both counts.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>This movie marks the first time I've seen a Harry Potter film after reading the book.  As a result, I was curious how I'd like it.  I found the book long and repetitive, but I still couldn't see how they'd cut 850 pages down to a decent film.  While there were some cuts I didn't like, for the most part they pulled it off.<br /><br />Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back.  Or at least that's what Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) claim.  But the Ministry of Magic is denying these claims and the "Daily Prophet" is backing them up.<br /><br />As if that weren't bad enough, the Ministry has appointed the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is going to teach the subject by textbook only.  There will be no practical part of the course.<br /><br />Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are kept out of much of what is happening in the fight against Voldemort.  They know that Dumbledore has resurrected the Order of the Phoenix to fight the dark lord again, but they aren't allowed to join.  Yet Voldemort seems to be trying to communicate something to Harry.  What does he want?  Is Harry in danger?<br /><br />One thing that helped this movie was the art of the montage.  They used that several times to cut out the repetition from the book.  They also cut out a couple sub-plots, one I really loved, and some of the funny scenes from the book.  It was disappointing, but I could see the need to make room for important things.<br /><br />Still with all those cuts, they also cut out most of the Order of the Phoenix scenes.  What is there is great, and fans of the character Tonks especially won't be disappointed with what they see during her too short screen time.  And the ending was rushed, taking away the emotional impact while still covering all the important details.<br /><br />The only change that really bothered me was one near the middle that changed a character.  I know they had to cut out some characters, but the resulting damage to this remaining charater one really bothered me.<br /><br />If all this talk concerns you because you haven't read the books, don't let it.  I saw it with a friend who hasn't read any of the books, and he followed everything perfectly.<br /><br />But enough of my picking apart the plot.  What about the rest of the film?  As we've come to expect, the visuals are stunning.  And the cast does a great job as always.  Special praise goes to Evanna Lynch as new student Luna Lovegood and Imelda Staunton as Umbridge.  They both captured their characters from the book perfectly.<br /><br />As with the last film, this one is rather dark and scary, especially at the end.  Be sure to consider that when deciding whether to let your kids watch.<br /><br />No, it's not the book.  But until we get a long miniseries version, this is certainly a fine way to enjoy the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>This is certainly equal to or better than the previous movies, probably based on how you feel about movies on growing up. Although I love the charm and innocence of the first couple movies, I respect the maturing and depth shown in the last two. In this movie we get to see good fight evil in a match up that is leading to the final great confrontation. It is quite clear sides are being formed based on loyalties to good or evil magic. The armies may not be large, but they are formidable. The introduction of a new creature was a nice touch, but the main theme is friendship. These undead looking horses with bat like wings that can only be seen by those that have witnessed death are friendly and play a key part in helping Harry. It is Harry's friendships that have now bonded those ties to fight Lord Valdemort and his allies. Initially we see that Ron and Hermione are still very much in Harry's corner.<br /><br />Harry isn't just preparing to fight Valdemort, he is fighting his own demons that make him wonder why the commonality of his life and that of Valdemort. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel when several school members join him to train in magic to fight Valdemort. Unfortunately they must hide in order to practice since the professor of the Defense Against the Dark Arts has taken over Hogwarts and forbidden the use of defensive magic. That's right I said the defense against the dark arts. There's irony for you. She is truly the worst person to have on your side if you are trying to prepare an Army to fight the dark lord. Fortunately Neville finds them a place to practice to get out of eyeshot of the puritanical pompous peacock in pink called Dalores Umbridge. I think she was the worst kind of muggle in sheeps clothing. She obviously doesn't believe the dark lord has returned, nor that they need to use magic. Does that sound like a professor you could learn from at Hogwarts? NOT!<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie on a number of levels. I think they have done a great job with how Harry has grown not only in age, but in attitude. The central theme of friendship is remarkably comparable how students feel when preparing to graduate high school. The same type of struggles they face when dealing with how to choose whether to lead a life of good or evil. I recommend it whether you have read the book or not. I think if you have read the book you will need to be tolerant of the parts that have not been included. I must admit I wish the movie had been a little longer and included a few parts pointed out by some of those that read the book. All-in-all still a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>I don't know why, but "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," the fifth installment of Harry Potter films is by far the shortest of the series. Considering the numbers of the characters and the events that happen to them, the film's 138 minutes is too short. It needs three hours and the content deserves that length.<br /><br />Plot thickens here. No more delightful Quidditch can be seen. In spite of the occasional comical moments and Harry's romance, the film's tone gets darker than ever and even Ron's mother looks more worried. If you remember what happened at the end of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," she should be more worried about her children. That means some scenes might be too scary for kids.<br /><br />New characters (and talent) enter the story - newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is most impressive - and some regular characters like Draco Malfoy are almost forgotten. I don't know how many of you miss Draco, but with additional 20 or 30 minutes this kind of thing could be avoided. Helena Bonham Carter's villainous Bellatrix Lestrange is introduced a bit too abruptly in the story, which lessens the impact of the final battle scene and its consequences.<br /><br />The visuals themselves are fantastic as always, but director David Yates is no Alfonso Cuaron. The special effects such as Harry and friends flying over Themes River are, technically, just wizardly, but not imaginative. The scenes are beautiful, but no wicked humor of Shrunken Head. But it all depends on your taste. I just prefer different approach and that's all.<br /><br />The film should be longer by at least 20 minutes, but I believe there is a director's cut somewhere in Warner's studio. Until we see it, sorry, but three stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>I am a grandfather who initially read Harry Potter to see what had captured the imagination of my grandchildren.  Rowling is an outstanding author and has created what in my opinion is a masterpiece.  I have now read all of the books and have seen all of the movies -- and I have enjoyed every one.  This latest film was a huge challenge to the screenwriter and director due to the sheer size of the book.  In this film we see Harry, Hermione, and Ron as near adults -- ready to graduate and certainly with much greater maturity and mastery of magic.  Certainly each movie gets darker and darker as do the books as Harry and friends encounter the growing evil of Valdemort.<br /><br />This was not the best of the series of films but it keeps the story moving.  The director has clearly elected to capture the essence of the story rather than to follow all of the details, which would have made an impossibly long movie.  However, for those who have never read the book, the movie moves along well.  For those who have read the book, they can fill in the details without having to see them on the screen.  The result is many of the major characters have relatively small parts in this movie.  In fact outside of Harry, Ron, and Hermione virtually all of the characters have small parts -- still the story moves along very well and you don't see the time pass.  I really liked the movie, I highly recommend it, it is probably not a movie for very young children because it shows the characters in some dangerous and threatening situations.  I only gave 4 stars because it is an abreviated version of the story -- but still well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />In  "The Order of the Phoenix, " the time-marking fifth installment of the lucrative "Harry Potter" series, the teen wizard and his fellow Hogwarts sidekicks are girding for battle against the recently returned villain, Lord Valdemort.  They also have to wage a battle on a second front, against a sadistic dictatorial teacher named Dolores Umbridge, who has decided to remedy the "lax" standards at the academy and, in so doing, usurp Professor Dumbledor's position as headmaster of the school.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" has most of what any installment in the series needs to be a success:  strong performances, dazzling special effects, and generous helpings of spells and magic.  Yet, there seems to be something missing in this episode that prevents it from soaring into that world of enchantment familiar to us from those earlier films.  For one thing, too many of the likable secondary characters - Ronald, Hermione, Hagrid etc. - take a back seat to Umbridge, who gets way more time on screen than the interest generated by the character warrants (even though Imelda Staunton is just fine in the role).  Or perhaps it's that the movie lacks the tremendously exciting action set pieces that distinguished some of the earlier editions.  And why, come to think of it, does the cinematography in a fantasy film have to be so drab, colorless and dreary?<br /><br />It's admirable that both the filmmakers and the original author are willing to go darker and deeper in exploring the psyche of Harry now that he`s become quite a bit older, but depth of theme really doesn't matter all that much if the magic of the series itself gets lost in the process (Michael Goldenberg has replaced Steve Kloves in the writing department and David Yates has taken over as director).<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe still makes for a tremendously appealing hero, but one senses that the perhaps inevitable fatigue factor may finally be settling into this series.  I guess we'll know for sure once the final two installments are released.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>This is the fifth movie in the Harry Potter film series.<br />Movie will start automatically at 1 mins, 48 secs, if you have not chosen an option in menu.

Dudley (Harry Melling) is meaner than ever towards his cousin. He asks Harry in a hurtful way, "Where is your mum?". Dudley knows very well that his mother and father are dead. He gets Harry upset, on purpose, and Harry lashes out at him with a magic wand at Dudley's throat and chin. The other mean kids with Dudley laugh at Harry. Suddenly, a great storm develops in the sky. Harry is not causing it to happen. They both run. In a walk-through tunnel, the Dementors attack Harry and Dudley. Harry uses his magic wand to fight off the Dementors. They got Dudley good. Mrs. Figg (Kathryn Hunter) comes along to check on Harry.<br />  Back at home, an owl delivers a talking mailer to Harry.

I note that many of the fans were disappointed in how much was cut from the original book, making the story arc somewhat disjointed and hard to follow. But then this was the longest, if I remember right, of all the Harry Potter novels and you just can't cram everything in even a modest sized book, let alone one this long, into a movie. But many characters who featured prominently in the book get very little screen time in this adaptation.<br /><br />But the movie does have its good points. The best thing is how you get to see the young wizards growing in their magic skills as they learn to do magical tricks like discharge energy, repulse an attacker by knocking him back through the air, perform stunts similar to psychokinesis by manipulating objects from afar, and so on. This aspect of the movie is the most fun.<br /><br />The problem is that there's a new, evil senior professor by the name of Ms. Umbridge who is almost bad enough to bring the whole movie screeching to a halt every time she appears. She will only teach the young magicians the theory, not the actual practical techniques of magic. This puts the students in a bind, because they still need to protect themselves from evil magicians like Voldemor and also pass their exams. There's also no explanation in the movie for this inexplicable policy of Umbridge's except she's a very bad person. But the young people show some grit and determination in their desire to learn no matter who or what gets in their way by forming an outside study group, which meets in secret to learn what they can on their own.<br /><br />But Umbridge is such a low, despicable character that the whole move suffers as a result. Not the least of these problems is that she runs around with a rigid, unchanging rictus of an expression on her face that's sort of like smug, arrogant complacency combined with a somewhat pinched, pained grimace as if she has terminal hemorrhoids. It's too extreme an affectation and caricature and makes every scene with this character hard to watch. I don't think I've ever had a more negative reaction to a character in a movie, and I usually don't even have much of a reaction to characters in movies. But her whole persona is an embarrassingly bad idea and low point for what was already a problematic Harry Potter movie. The only good thing you can say about the Umbridge character  is at least the name was a clever idea because of the allusion to the word, "umbrage." Well, I guess I take umbrage with Ms. Umbridge.<br /><br />Although there are some fun and enjoyable parts to the movie, and I still enjoyed it for the most part, again, the movie suffers from some bad characterization, a patchy and difficult to follow plot, and the loss of some important story elements from the book. It seems now that the Harry Potter kids are almost grown-up teenagers the Hogwarts Academy has lost its warts and gotten a bad case of acne. I still enjoyed the movie for the most part but in comparison with the other great movies in this series I can only give this one three stars at most.</p></br><a href="../users/A1845IJB63D5H7.html">A1845IJB63D5H7</a><br/><p>Dizzying two hours were spent on this nonsense fiction. The main reason for my staying to the end of the movie was the neat and sophisticated work of art.<br /><br />A university for magic? As if the author could not occupy herself with more constructive fiction that betters our troubled world!!  Phony professors packaging memories in bottles? Though the bottles, the lab setups, the school landscape, and the old chemistry books all looked impressive and real, their use was put to no good cause.<br /><br />Assuming that the work of fiction should not be held to the test of logical reasoning, it should at least serve some constructive goal. Here, the story of the whole movie is loose and fragmented stream of imagery that could only be seen in bad dreams.<br /><br />Even bad dreams have some sort of logical connection between their events, which this movie completely lacked. Neither the dizzying fiction stretches our imagination, not did it conclude in relieving a stressing desire.<br /><br />The only purpose of the movie in my opinion was getting graphic artists busy is a jobless world.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Now let me be honest from the start and say that I've only read the first 4 Harry Potter books and have never really been interested in the rest. I must also be honest and say I've only ever really been a casual fan of the films, not getting overly excited about the upcoming release, nor being somewhat ashamed of even saying "oh that looks good." I simply ended up watching Order of the Phoenix on a whim and I must say I found it very enjoyable. The combination of the hidden magic world and believable characters, really allow the film to blend into one hell of a two hour ride.<br /><br />Harry's fifth year as a wizard doesn't start too well, he and Dudley are attacked by dementors which leads to Harry being expelled from Hogwarts. Through a series of random, craziness Harry discovers that Dumbledore is putting together an army to help fight Voldemorts army. The Order of the Phoenix involve the likes of Azkaban runaway Sirius Black, Godfather of Harry Potter and Sirius Black. The Ministry of Magic are the biggest problem facing the order at the moment as Dumbledore and Harry are constantly attacked in the daily prophet for spreading lies. The Ministry are in denial that the Dark Lord Voldemort is back and in order to stop the rumours, they must take Dumbledores power and remove him as Hogwarts headmaster. In his place is the old fashioned and quite evil Professor Delores Umbridge. She, like the ministry seems in complete denial about the dark lords return and seeks to bring order to Hogwarts. Harry on the other hand decides he must take teaching into his own hands and puts together his own army of students and prepares them for the impending war.<br /><br />I have to be honest and say Radcliffe has once again really pulled it off as a genuine actor. Although the Harry Potter label will stick with him forever, he continues to display genuine acting talent within the role. The supporting best friends of Emma Watson (Hermione) & Rupert Grint (Ron) provide the general emotional guidance that helps keep Harry going. Personally I found the Delores Umbridge character to be the more intimidating of characters from this year, she has the ability of being a bit too sweet giving the image that you know there's something more going on. She demands order, she wants peace without possibility of injury so she bans all magic in the classroom and insists all theory work is the correct way to teach wizardry. Well played part by Imelda Staunton.<br /><br />The special effects are as usual astonishing, they allow the truly magical Potter world to come alive. The Centaurs, Giants and general magical fights can only be done through the magic of computer animation and are simply flawless. There wasn't a single moment where I spotted a faulty special effect with which I could say "that's done by computers." If it did have that effect on someone then there's no denying it would have ruined the entire effect of the film.<br /><br />I do want to point something out and it's something that has been talked about time and time again. It's the darkness of the film, for a book aimed at kids the stories tend to get more and more adult as time progresses. This is a good thing for the older fan of the books, but isn't something I would really say should be seen by kids as they would possibly find it a bit terrifying. It's an amazing, honest and enjoyable picture that although there will be the complaints of cutting down too much from the book, I have no doubt that it's still a film the loyal book fans will thoroughly enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Yep Mr. Riddle has returned and the minister of magic (Robert Hardy) refuses to believe this. Of course everyone sides with the minister against Harry and his closest friends. Dudley (Harry Melling) practically gets sucked to death and the Dursley's (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths) get a new flat screen T.V.<br /><br />The story plods along and leaves out key information revealed in the book. Every character stares at their feet and counts from one to ten before making their calculated statements. The film carries the story forward but does little to contribute other than a prophecy which takes all of five minutes.<br /><br />I do have to say that there was one good exception Helena Bonham Carter made a believable Bellatrix Lestrange the crazed dispatcher of Neville's parents.<br /><br />In place of story and acting we have lots of CGI filler. The graphics are par with today's technology with the exception of the department of mysteries; that location looked so phony that you would think you were watching Saturday morning cartoons.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026YWQ4Q">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>The movie was great, not perfect, but great.  You can read all about it elsewhere.<br /><br />This, meanwhile, is my honest, appalled, and feeling somewhat ripped-off review of the Two Disc "Special" Edition DVD.<br /><br />Where's the specialness?!  Where's the features?!  Why am I paying up to 75% more for an extra disc over the normal version!?<br /><br />For the sake of continuity with my other HP movies that come with two discs, and not wanting to be left out on the bonus features, I got the Special Edition.<br /><br />The bonus features are laughably minimal, and barely exceeding an hour in full.<br /><br />Magic of Editing: A very short documentary about the importance of editing in a scene, then a stupid game that lets you add music and sound effects to a scene from the movie.<br /><br />Deleted and Alternate Scenes: The totality of these scenes, minus the first one which seemed just a joke for the die-hard fans, added up to maybe five minutes or less.  Would it really have hurt the movie to include them in the final cut?  Most of the scenes were second-long add-ons to other scenes, such as Neville claiming The Daily Prophet really is full of crap after Seamus confronts Harry in the common room, or Harry passing by Dumbledore's office towards the end, and Dumbledore motioning for him to come in.  That's really it.  The first deleted scene was basically just focusing on the Divinations Professor (sorry, forgot her name) during Umbridge's speech to the students in the Great Hall, basically spilling her food, dropping cream in her water, and all in all making an idiot of herself during the entire 3-4 minute speech.  Clearly they had no intention of including this in the movie, simply because of the sheer ridiculousness and complete irrelevance of it.<br /><br />The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter:  Basically just describing Harry's journey through the first five movies, and "speculating" on what's to come, as if the books didn't exist.  The introduction tells us that there are clues all over the movies as to Harry's eventual fate with Voldemort, but the documentary didn't bother dealing too much with this.<br /><br />Trailing Tonks:  Possibly the only really fun part of this bonus.  Natalie Tena (who seems perpetually hopped up on caffeine in this documentary) dressed as Nymphadora Tonks (and occasionally appearing on screen as herself, sans makeup, talking about her experience during this scene or that) guides us around some of the set to show us how various things were done, from sound editing, catering, shooting, prop building, set building, and choreography for wand duels.  She also sings a song on a guitar, with a fabulous voice.  Whole thing lasted like 10 minutes.<br /><br />So basically, this "special" edition gives you a few random clips and bits of the movie that add nothing more to the story already missing large pieces according to the book readers, a documentary having little to do with the movie itself, Nat Tena giving us 10 minutes of a fun tour, and a stupid little game not even worth playing.  And they need a whole nother DVD to fit this 1 hour or less of content and package it as if it were the definitive version to own.  Clearly not worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>This is the first in the series I wasn't able to see first at the theater, which I try to do with any film that promises large quantities of SFX. But I just never found the time. As it turned out, I caught all the glitz just fine on my large-ish TV. It was the dialogue that gave me trouble. From the very first scene, the actors seemed to mumble more than half their lines and I'm sure I missed a lot of the by-play. And since I haven't read the novels (Yet. Maybe.), I didn't even know what I was missing. But my wife, who has read them all at least twice, assures me that was much, much more that ought to have been said about Neville's parents, and about the revolt of George & Fred, and that there's a great deal more to say about Luna Lovegood and Sybil Trelawney, etc. I know it's the fattest of the seven Harry Potter books, and I'm perfectly aware that any good screenplay based on a novel is obliged to discard many of the subplots, but even so, two hours and a quarter apparently just wasn't enough, so they had to zip past a lot of important information. I shall have to get hold of the screenplay and read along when I rewatch the film -- and I will.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>This is going to be short and sweet.<br /><br />I am not a Harry Potter fan...not of the books nor the movies (though I have read them and KEEP watching them!I guess I am just caught in the mania!)).  This film works best for me. Why?<br /><br />(1).Imelda Staunton. Ever since first seeing her in PETER'S FRIENDS years ago and since in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY , VERA DRAKE and countless Brit-flicks, I have admired what this incredible actress does on screen.She IS Dolores Umbridge, the ice-cold emmisary from the Ministry of Magic, and Staunton embodies everything that is so wonderfully,gleefully and deliciously awful about her character.This is Oscar material here!<br /><br />(2).Finally, these films are maturing along with Harry and friends and I am loving it.This installment was darker than the rest and I found it the most to my liking.

Harry has spent the summer being ignored by everyone after he was discredited by the Daily Prophet for daring to suggest that Lord Voldemort has returned.<br /><br />Once again, Harry and company will have to fight he-who-shall-not-be-named while combating an government that insists and refuses to acknowledge the return of Voldemort. In doing so, the government steps up and introduces a new headmistress at Hogwarts: Dolores Umbridge.<br /><br />You will find that these are indeed "darker" times for all the HP characters. Working with writer Michael Goldenberg, director David Yates have crafted a dark tale to entertain anyone watching. The effects shows us fantastic creatures. But it's the performances where a film is really sold and here they are wonderful.<br /><br />The three leads, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, have all settled easily into their roles. But it's in the supporting cast where these films really shine. Filling out secondary roles with the cream of British theatre and cinema, like Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis and Ralph Fiennes, everyone else must rise to their level, and they do.<br /><br />The movie shows us the "weird" phase we all go between adult and child, between doing what's right and following the rules and between knowledge and comprehension. When all is said and done, Harry has grown as a character. He is on his way to adulthood with an understanding of the things he's learned in the previous four films.<br /><br />However, there are worrying signs that there are no real developments from film to film: there are no substantial increase in maturity in the films themselves. Every time I sit down to a new Harry Potter movie, I'm surprised by how very similar it is to the previous one.<br /><br />There is a definite feel with The Order of the Phoenix that the story is killing time - setting the scene for the battles yet to come in the last two chapters. This isn't a criticism as such, it's just that having to do that does leave a few unanswered questions. But then, what good would a series be without a few cliffhangers?</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>Normally I don't wait several years to comment on a recent film,  simply because it is unlikely that many will read my comment.  But the comments and reviews for "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" (2007) are generally so off-the-mark that a few supplemental comments could be of value.  And hopefully my comments gain useful perspective from the distance of a few years since the release.<br /><br />As has already been said this chapter of the story is a relatively small-scale one.  The Ministry of Magic is worried that Hogwarts presents a security risk, and so it plants a mole (Dolores Umbridge - slickly played by Imelda Staunton) to discredit Dumbledore and to prevent him from training students to defend themselves against the dark arts.  The Ministry is in denial about the return of "he who must not be named"  (i.e. Lord Voldemort is back and preparing for an attack).<br /><br />Personally "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" is my favorite of all the films up to now.  I have a lot of reasons.  For one, while the three principle actors by 2007 had begun to look a bit too old for their characters (Rupert Grint especially so),  the disparity is not so great that a lot of energy must be expended suspending disbelief;  as is the case with the later films.  And Daniel Radcliffe uses his maturity as a actor to bring a sophisticated internal life to Harry; something he could not quite manage in the earlier films.  Another reason is that it represents the midway point of the overall story and therefore strikes the best balance between serious elements and elements of whimsy.  And things stay fresh with the introduction of new characters like Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helen Bonham Carter) who fit the film's dark/light balance by being evil characters who are amusingly overplayed.<br /><br />But I suspect that the biggest reason I favor this particular film is that it does not flinch from the book's theme of existential despair.  And they economically pull this off through the inspired casting of Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, my all-time favorite Potter character.  Harry suffers a lot inside, which is one of the things that makes him different from the other students at Hogwarts, most of whom tend to avoid him.  And he in turn tends to isolate himself, even from his close friends Ron and Hermione.  The film version of Luna is the only friend who really gets Harry and he is energized by their interactions.  And she has the most profound line of the whole franchise:  "The things we lose have a way of coming back to us, even if it is not always in a way that we expect".<br /><br />Rowling and others have pointed out that Luna is Hermione's alter ego; an illogical and impulsive counterpart to Hermione's analytical realist. Both process more information than their fellow students, but Hermione has filters to define and dispense with the information.  Luna is less judgmental, for her processing is experiencing.<br /><br />While these comparisons help define Herminone, Luna herself is important because of her similarity to Harry. The subtle similarities regularly amaze him and they allow her to repeatedly demonstrate to him that he is not alone.  She is his bridge to everyone else in a story where he must subordinate his desire to go it alone if he hopes to successfully engage the forces of the Dark Lord. The film was especially focused on illustrating this special quality of their relationship.<br /><br />Overall, what has most amazed me about the whole Harry Potter series is the evidence that Rowling had the entire story pretty much outlined in detail at the beginning and engaged in considerable foreshadowing; something you do not appreciate with the first reading of each book.  The "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" adaptation provides an interesting example of how this foreshadowing can be done visually.  Ginny Weasley is destined to become Harry's love interest but up until this point it has been mostly a little sister / big brother type relationship (Bonnie Wright was only 10 when featured in "Chamber of Secrets").  In "Order of the Phoenix"  Harry is still preoccupied with Cho Chang (Katie Leung who looks considerably older than Wright).  What to watch for are the scenes in which the Harry - Cho relationship progresses; each time the editor goes out on a static shot of a grim Ginny observing their interaction.<br /><br />I am quite happy with the two-disc special edition DVD, since it did not promise to include an extended version of the film and the current $2 price for a used copy is quite affordable.  The second disc includes a number of special features.  "Trailing Tonks", a tour of the film sets hosted by offbeat Natalia Tena is especially good.  There are also a number of humorous deleted scenes of Emma Thompson portraying Professor Trelawney<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Like a good wine, the Harry Potter film series are something that grow better with age and the fifth adaptation of the book series does not fail to impress. As many have said before, Order of the Pheonix is by far the darkest (and shortest, go figure) film to date. It's hard to imagine the days of the light and frothy Sorceror's Stone, with its wonderous surprises, colorful displays, and an eleven year olds joy. Now, the series, likes the books, have aged into more mature subject matter, dealing with the likes of goverment conspiracies, war, death, and sinister villians. Now, i will say that this is not my favorite HP film (that honor still goes with Prisoner of Azkaban), but it is still a rather solid adaptation of the book as a whole.<br /><br />We join Harry after the events of Goblet of Fire, the beginning setting the tone for the entire film. Harry is angry, confused, and plain frustrated for everything that's happened the previous year. And to make matters worse, this year is no better. The Ministry has already begun a full out smear campaign on our young hero and the wise wizard Dumbledore, absolutly refusing to believe Voldemort is back, who is already assembling his army once more to strike the defensless wizadring community. And just when he thinks he can find solace with his friends Ron and Hermione and the school he loves so much, in walks Dolores Umbridge, a manic, power-hungry woman out to do the Ministry's bidding and restore supposed 'order' to Hogwarts school. On top of that, Harry must also deal with the frightning dreams he has begun to experince, that may very well be a clue to what Voldemort is planning next.<br /><br />All the performers bring there A game here. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, much like their characters, have matured with age and put to rest any doubts about there acting skills. Returning actors like Rickman, Gambon, Smith, Oldman, and Coltrane are all supurb, making the most of there sometimes small roles. But its truley the newcomer's who deserve the kudos. Evanna Lynch is absolutly brillinat as the spacey Luna Lovegood, while Helena Bonham Carter turns such a tiny role into a firecracker of a performance as the crazed Bellatrix Lestrange. And finally, Imelda Staunton brings the best performance in the film as the diabolical Professor Umbridge. An absoulty horrid woman, disguised by a too sweet fascade that makes your skin crawl. Oh and she also does the laugh justice.<br /><br />As usual, HP fans will have a lot to complaign about with the substantial cuts from the book, especially the whole 'Weasley is our King', so for those who are extremly touchy over this, Order of the Pheonix will most likely dissapoint you. And to those who feel the film may be to dark, it does have some rather clever comidic parts. But for the others, people should be rather pleased with the evenly paced flow of the movie cause i have to say, though i loved Goblet of Fire, i felt it was very choppy at parts, seemingly jumping from one scene to the next in a frentic hurry, almost to try and fit in as much as possible into the time. So for me, i say the cuts were necesarry, cause this film hardly felt cluttered or rushed.<br /><br />So, in closing, to all those picky HP fans, this movie will not satisfy. But for the rest of us, it will still make for a magical time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>The 5th Harry Potter book is my favorite and I was extremely excited about the movie and prayed that the director wouldnt screw it up. So now, months after seeing a midnight showing, I am still in utter shock. I dont WANT to hate this movie because it is Harry Potter after all. But I cant but cringe whenever I think about it. Basically, they turned the longest book into the shortest movie. Appalling, horrendous, wrong. It was like a ridiculously abridged version of Order of the Phoenix. People around me in the theater were also aware of this as scenes jarred from one to another without flow or reason. If you have never read the book, you probably wound't notice just how much they cut out. Or changed. The changes were awful and unfortunetely, certain aspects that they either changed or left out are crucial to the final book. So I dont understand the reasoning. I could go on and on but I dont want to relive it..<br />The one plus I do have is that the acting dramatically improved by the younger actors. I did notice it right away and am glad of that anyway. Oh and Umbridge was spot on. Well! Thats about it, really. I now have doubts about the 6th movie, being made by the same director and all...We shall see.<br /><br />Oh, also, the deleted scenes on the dvd are absolutely pointless. I mean, not 1 has any merit or importance to it. I at least hoped those would help out the movie in some way, but no, they sure didnt. I gave it 3 stars because although I dont hate the movie per se, I am quite dissapointed about it, and well, if you're a Harry Potter fan, you cant really hate it.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>Ignore the negative reviews from fans who expect every word of the story to be adapted into a twenty-hour long movie.  This film condenses the essentials of the storyarc into one of the most powerful cinematic experiences I've had.<br /><br />From the opening sequence, I knew that this would be the best movie of the series. And it is. By far. From the outstandingly ballsy cinematography to the acting (it's like night and day between this movie and "Goblet of Fire", which was great in it's own right but can't touch this), from the witty and quirky script to the special effects, it's clear that director David Yates single handedly whipped the Harry Potter movie franchise into shape. While movies 1-4 were great, they were like unpolished stones; at points they tried so hard to go along with the books and at others tried so hard to separate themselves from the books (think "Prisoner of Azkaban"'s shrunken heads), but this movie--"Order of the Phoenix"--knows what it is. It is a film, and it makes sense as a film. Everything you need to know to understand the film is here, and--unlike "Goblet of Fire"--you won't need a previous understanding of the books or even the other movies. Certainly fans will complain about deviance from the book, but these are the same unreasonable people that wish the movies would be twenty-four hours long so they could squeeze in every line of dialogue. "Order of the Phoenix" is how a book should be adapted.<br /><br />Every actor, from Daniel Radcliffe to Emma Watson to the kid who plays Dudley, is at the tippy top of their game. They're playing young adults and they act it; they laugh, and they cry. This is the first time that I actually totally suspended my disbelief while watching a Potter film, and that was almost all due to the superb acting.<br /><br />I did expect a bit more from the climax (the important character death was kind of wiggy) but things get roaring back into shape for a perfect duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Following that, everything touched on in the movie wraps up beautifully. No threads are left untied, and no plot left with an open end. Very, very satisfying. Oh, and if that isn't enough, this should be: Evanna Lynch is spine-tinglingly good as Luna Lovegood.<br /><br />It may not be what you expected, it may not be what you thought you wanted... But for me, it was more on both counts.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>This movie was bored and I thought this movie was best but it's not. This movie isn't good as other Harry Potter series.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I know that statement is going to get a rash of non-helpful votes.  But the fifth book in the Hp series, while good, did have a lot of annoying things happening.  The main one being Harry being such a snot to his friends.  I know the reasoning, but the angry teenager just rubbed me the wrong way.  I like that his isolation and his frustration was there but didn't drag across the entire film.  Ron and Hermoine are getting less and less screen time, but that's fine, too.  Especially since Daniel seems to be the only one willing to improve his acting chops.  Really, it was almost too painful to watch Emma Watson wooden performance.  Draco Malfoy was another character who's part was noticable absent.  But as a film, unless I want to spend the entire day planted in a theater seat, things have to be cut.  Adaptations are all dwindled down and one shouldn't be running to see movie five without having read the series anyway, so you know the details.  For the money and the entertainment value, I think this was the best movie to date.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The final chapter of the Harry Potter movies was delightful, imaginative, adventurous and magical.  More importantly it left us feeling satisfied with a great and proper ending.  While Harry Potter was growing and getting older, his films continued to give us the proper enjoyment we were craving since the first movie.  Over the years, we learned more about the story and the movie creators never failed to give each and every movie the right amount of detail, and they gave us the ability to give us more juicy storyline bits with each new film.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I wasn't exactly feeling this movie.  I only liked "The Chamber of Secrets" out of all the Harry Potter films.  At this point, it's like sensory overload, and overdone.  It's just the same ol stuff, and the actors look like they're done, and they should be.  I love the way it was filmed, but if your not a big fan of Harry potter in general, the movies are pretty dull and boring.  It borders on pretentiousness, and the guy playing Harry potter needs to get over himself, you ain't all that honey!</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>We saw this in the 3-D Imax version so don't expect me to remember much about the ending, for the lasr 20 minutes produced nothing but gasps of terror and frowns of puzzlement from our row, since the editing is so rapidfire we couldn't really tell what was happening.  I know they went to the Ministry, and that's about it!  I wish I had seen it the regular way without the 3-D glasses, then I might have been able to understand it better.  We take along Mark, an expert at Harry Potter, every time we go to one of these shows, and we are the irritating ones in the row ahead of yours who are always turning to the expert and asking, "Now who is that tall girl with the red hair?  Was she in the movie before?"<br /><br />The plot is so complicated now that ordinary notions of character development must have been the first thing the screenwriters chucked out.  We know Harry is angry, angry, angry all the time, for not only is he in a funk through most of the movie but he even has a scene where he says, "I'm angry, angry all the time!"  Everyone's trying to help, but Harry just can't see that.  He's still traumatized, I think, by witnessing the death of Cedric Diggory in the previous movie.  Pity in a way Cedric didn't stick around for book 5, isn't it, because he might have raised the beauty quotient a little.  The producers must be fairly sick the way that they bet on a whole crew of child actors and now they have to watch them turn into awkward, plain galoofs of teens, barring Emma Watson, Dan Radcliffe and one or two others (like that tall girl with the red hair).  If Emma Watson loses one more ounce however, she is going to be able to squeeze through the eye of a needle no matter how much money she has.  Rupert Grint?  Well, there may be some who find him attractive, though director David Yates seems to be averting the camera every time it pans in Grint's direction--cut!<br /><br />OK, so now can somebody tell me what was so great about that prophecy?  I could have told you what it said and I've never read a Potter book in my life.  Couldn't it have been something a little bit more gripping?  THAT'S the McGuffin of the whole movie?  No, no, no, I must have missed something while in my 3-D meltdown.  Tell me that little ball thing said something interesting!</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>I do not like this film. It omitted too much story from the novel. In my opinion, books 4-7 would have made better tv miniseries films, then a lot more of the story could be captured. Best part of the film is the acting. Ignore this film and stick with the first two films and the seven books.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>I have just watched "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", and I can tell that, from my point of view, this movie is the kind of film that you will love if you have already read the books, but will not appreciate or understand too much if that is not the case. The reason for that opinion is that J. K. Rowling's books include lots of details that you don't get to enjoy in the movies, probably due to lack of time. That problem is more noticeable with the new movies, that try to stay faithful to the spirit of the books, and generally do so, but leaving many charming subplots behind, something I cannot help but regret.<br /><br />Thankfully, I've read all the books in the Harry Potter series so far, and plan on reading the last one next week. I can sincerely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but that I wish it could have been longer.<br /><br />I would like to highlight the fact that the actors that play the main characters (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) keep getting better at their craft in each movie, and that the new director, David Yates, does an excellent job of trying to convey the gloomy mood of book 5, without losing the funny moments that make these books so special. The new additions to the cast were also excellent, specially Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and Helena Bonham Carter as a very scary Bellatrix Lestrange.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend this movie, but I advise you to read the books first, because only then will you be able to enjoy the whole "Harry Potter experience"  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>After three and four, this fifth installment is disappointing. Order of the Phoenix is too short and leaves out a little bit too much. Make that way, WAY too much by serious fans of the books, but when isn't that the case? At times the viewer is not provided with background and significant details which would make the story more interesting and sensible. All of these movies seem to made with an assumption that everyone has read the book. This movie should have included more and that it was shorter running than previous adaptations is inexcusable and the wrong decision by the filmmakers. This fifth story leaves you eager for six and seven while making many people concerned about the choice of David Yates (director of Phoenix) to be director of all three. However, what is very promising is Yates's desire to do the seventh and last book as two seperate films in order to do justice to the story.<br /><br />I had a problem with the bluish tint seen in much of the movie and that sort of digitale film look, I guess you could call it. Hagrid's giant half-brother was just sad. I mean, how could they accept that result? It's acceptable by mid-90s standards. Maybe they figured people wouldn't care.<br /><br />There are a few things that stand out in this movie, however.<br /><br />I liked the Department of Mysteries. You wondered what it would look like on the screen and it did not disappoint. Dolores Umbridge is evil incarnate. She is one of the most horrible, disgusting, unlikable, disturbing villains I've ever seen. Most of the time villains, particularly in the movies, are famous for having the best lines and great style. They have a stricking apperance and often more personality and charisma than the heros. Not the case with Dolores Umbridge. She has none of this going for her. No great lines but some slightly memorable ones like she confesses, "You know, I really hate children." That squeaky voice, the knit pink oufit, and torturing kids... It's Big Brother in pink with a bad hair-do as your worst nightmare teacher from grade school and "a cross between Margaret Thatcher and Hyacinth Bucket"(The Daily Mall). Well, truth is she is not as horrible as Margaret Thatcher. All the performances are good. Gary Oldman is great as Sirius Black as is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She is the embodiment of the twisted, evil, cackling witch.<br /><br />The obvious highlight and climax of Order of the Phoenix is the battle at the Ministry culminating in the epic duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Out of all the wizard fights I've seen portrayed in the movies, this one was the most impressive. It was fierce and conveyed the two masters awesome abilities without seeming cartoonish or leaving you feeling like your favorite character was short changed. (I umm, have a couple movies in mind here. You guess what they are.)</p></br></body></html>

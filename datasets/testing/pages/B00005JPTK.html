Will Smith puts in a good performance in the lead as Dr. Robert Neville, who is perhaps the last "normal" human on earth after a highly contagious virus sweeps the US and possibly the world. Being the last man on earth and perhaps the only person who could find a cure for the many infected humans (aka fast zombies) is a huge burden for the good doctor, who has settled into a bit of routine of trying to gather supplies, capture test subjects, and practicing his golf long game.<br /><br />A lot of the story is told through flashback and there are truly some moving scenes that add to the drama and provide insight to the deteriorating mindset of Dr. Neville. The action is fairly evenly paced, with some heart pounding moments scattered throughout. The special effects range from cheesy to very good, but hold up when needed.<br /><br />This movie does a great job of setting the mood of the isolation and fear that Dr. Neville experiences and is a quite watchable horror flick... I just think it could have been named something else and would have been just as good.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>OK, this movie was pretty good but, not great. Oh...it was CREEEEPY!  :)<br /><br />Will Smith does a great job of acting (5 stars for him)<br /><br />The plot is good - kept us engaged but, somebody dropped the ball. There were a few things that would have made the movie much better like showing how smart the "mutants" were, more flashbacks etc. 20 more minutes would have solved this. (4 stars)<br /><br />Special effects were...."so so". (3 stars). The mutants were obviously CGI and not believable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>I absolutely loved this film.  I must admit i did not expect much going into it.  I have never been a huge Will Smith fan or a fan of science fiction which this film seemed to be.  Wow, was I shocked and amazed with the excellent, quality film of the highest caliber that totally took me by surprise.<br /><br />This film is so well made.  I thought the story was very well laid out.  The government thought that they had finally found a cure for cancer by using a vaccine for another illness.  After much use the treatment backfired with major side effects with the people turning into flesh eating zombies who could never be in the sun.  I didn't look at the creatures as mere vampire like beings but thought the deterioration due to the vaccine was well documented.  Back to the plot, New York City becomes quaurantined and Will Smith plays Neville, a military scientist who stays in New York to work on finding a cure.<br /><br />The barren and stranded New York City is amazing to view.  I was caught up in the film from the first second and amazed as I watched the small world Neville had created for himself and his dog which allowed him to work on the cure but also have protection from the creatures.  He ventured out every day and returned at night.  Will Smith has been praised for other films but his work here was truly Oscar worthy.  The first half of the film is the best when it is just him and the dog.  His characterization is more than believable as the lone survivor who deals with loneliness by talking to mannequins etc.  He has not gone crazy but has adapted.  I found the story to also be believable and the creatures when shown were also believable and very well created.  The movie has a serious basis but also has chills and thrills like one of the best horror films there are.<br /><br />In the latter half of the film the plot changes a little (I won't give it away) and the 5 star plus caliber of the first half gets a little off track.  It is still excellent but the first half was so superior it is hard to compete with.  The film has a purpose and shows Will Smith as never seen before.  Whatever your expectations for this film, upon viewing they will be far surpassed.  Excellent acting, amazing production and directing.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I am not a big Will Smith fan but I must say I thought this movie was pretty good. I enjoyed the action and the concept (and yes I saw it already in Omega Man with Charlton Heston). The movie was well done and the CGI was pretty good. I liked the build up to the zombies and also the flashbacks weren't too annoying. Also loved the man dog friendship and how it was portrayed.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>If you are the sort that cries at movies, better have a fresh box of tissues before you start this one. It's a heart-wrencher, a gut-wrencher (yes, there's blood and violence), and ultimately one to make you think.  Think hard. Robert Neville (Will Smith) really does save the human race, but probably not the way you thought when you saw the previews. Don't let anyone tell you too much about this one: it's worth all the startle responses, shocks and emotional kicks in the gut.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>A lot of the negative reviews have pointed out that it's a terrible adaptation of the book by Richard Matheson, but I simply have to say that it's a standalone movie that takes the plot outline from the book and puts its own spin on things. On its own this film is a very emotional, intense, and at times quite a frightening movie that will have you thinking that this is possibly Will Smiths best performance to date.<br /><br />A cure for cancer is created from a genetically modified disease, but this cure turns into an infection of its own and soon spreads across the world killing most of the worlds population and turning the rest into mutated vampires which have fed on those last few survivors. Robert Neville is a former Army Lieutenant Colonel/Scientist who is forced to have his family taken away from him whilst he stays in the quarantined New York City looking for a cure to the mutated virus. His daughter hands him her dog, Sam before they take off in a helicopter. 3 years down the line and the human population of New York and possibly the world have died out and Robert is possibly the only human survivor. As he still battles to find a cure we are given an insight into how Robert copes with possibly being the only surviving human on Earth. He sets up mannequins in stores, pretends like their real people and interacts with them as if they were actually living. The Dog Sam is his only companion in the movie and we come to appreciate and love the relationship that develops between Robert and his Dog. One scene in particular that shows the intense emotion that this film reaches from time to time, is when Robert is cradling Sam in his arms after Sam is attacked by mutated dogs. Due to open wounds Sam is infected with the virus and Robert is forced to kill Sam. This, to me is a very upsetting scene and personally had me on the verge of tears, this shows the pure acting skill of Will Smith and proved to the critics that he was perfect for the role. The mutants in the film for the times that we see them are very intimidating and the chase scenes are quite intense and place you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Will Smith has always been one of those actors that a lot of people would doubt until they saw him in a movie or playing any particular role. I have to admit I had my doubts about him playing the last man on Earth and had my reservations about a film like this altogether as you would have to be prepared to sit through a movie with just the one human character on screen for the larger portion of the film and I had my reservations as to how this would play out altogether. Once putting the movie on, my doubts were simply put to rest as from the first scene Will Smith enraptures you in intrigue as you're shown how the man is hunting down his food in the form of a deer. The action sequences are intense and all scenes featuring the mutants are unbelievably frightening, even more than I thought they would be.<br /><br />This is a genuinely great movie and on Blu-Ray it's made much better with the alternate version parallel to the original cinematic version. This is a gem of a movie that I think all Will Smith fans will adore and even if you're not a fan of his previous work, this will make you want to see more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>I never read the novel so I can't compare the movie to the book. I enjoyed Omega Man with Heston immensely. I thought this movie stood up well to previous movie. The movie started well. New York City never looked so desolate and it felt real. Will Smith was in a tough role and he carried it off well. Smith had the almost the first half of the entire movie focused on him. No one to talk to except a dog. He does an amazing job of engaging the audience. The relationship with the dog was great. The dog deserved the academy award. The death of the dog scene was truly horrifying.<br /><br />The main problem with the movie was that the ending was rushed. Once the dog died, the movie quickly jumped to the final act. As if the director knew where he wanted to go, but did not know how to get there. Another problem is that the zombies were poorly done.<br /><br />In conclusion, thanks to Will Smith I enjoyed the movie. The beginning was great. The middle seemed rushed. The ending was good, but strange.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>"I Am Legend" is one of the few movies I saw at the theater in 2007 (I have 2 kids, one of which is an infant, so it's hard for me to get to the theater these days). I usually only go see a film at the theater if I am VERY interested in it. Other than that, I wait for the DVD release.<br /><br />For me, paying to see this at the theater was WELL worth the money. I have not read the original book (but I plan to now that I've seen the film), so I really can't say how accurately the original story is portrayed. Regardless, I was RIVETED. I found the story to be very intriguing, suspenseful, sad, heart-warming, and downright nerve-wracking.<br /><br />What really held my attention, though, was Will Smith's performance. He has definitely come a long way since his "Fresh Prince" days. This man can carry a role like a champion (I also recommend his peformance in "The Pursuit of Happyness" - it was Oscar-worthy). His performance took me in and made me sympathize with the character as if he were my best friend. >>>SPOILER ALERT&lt;&lt;&lt; When he ended up having to kill his beloved pet, I was almost in tears. You could feel Neville's anguish and pain beneath his determination to find a cure.<br /><br />Most of the detractors to this film seem to site the poor CGI effects that depicted the infected as being a major downfall of the movie. Yes, I've seen better, but this did not distract me or diminish my enjoyment of the film. From what I understand, the director originally had actors in make up and costumes to portray the infected, but it just didn't work and was not very convincing, so they decided to switch to CGI. Perhaps they were forced to do a "rush job" which resulted in subpar creature effects. Just my two cents' worth.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are both very good, but the extras that are offered really aren't all that much to rave about. There are a few "animated comics" that take place in other parts of the world that have to do with the virus infection, but are unrelated to Neville's story. These comics are well-done and stylish, but they aren't very long. There really could have been more special features offered. A "making of" short would have been nice, but instead, you can download a digital copy of the film. Big woop.<br /><br />This particular release also comes with an alternate ending not shown in theaters. In my personal opinion, the original theatrical ending was better. Again, just my two cents'.<br /><br />All in all, "I Am Legend" was an excellent film worthy of adding to your home video library.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The nicest thing about being the last man on earth would be not having to pay for parking in Times Square. There's nothing wrong with a good movie. "I Am Legend" may miss the mark as a great movie but what it does do it does extremely well. While Francis Lawrence's "I Am Legend" (this is the third version of the story told on film based on Richard Matheson's novel of the same name but it inspired countless other films including "Night of the Living Dead")may be bigger and bolder than "The Last Man on Earth" and "The Omega Man" (the two other film versions of the same tale), it is the small moments as well as the action sequences that make this film worthwhile.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville a military researcher brought in to solve a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong. The virus designed to deliver the payload kills patients with those remaining alive turned into creatures that seem to have no ability to reason and become monsters. Neville fails at stopping the outbreak from spreading but he remains in New York City still searching for a cure accompanied by his only companion a dog his son gave him. While hunting for the "Night Seekers" for his experiments, he also must avoid being hunted by them for food.<br /><br />Will Smith gives a terrific, nuanced performance as Neville and is the biggest asset. The visual effects of an abandoned and overgrown Times Square are stunning and captures the sense of isolation that Neville feels. He's not only cut off from the world but he's also cut himself off from many of his own emotions overcome by a sense of failure but still believing "I can fix this". There are some other fine performances in the film as well but saying any more about them would provide too many spoilers.<br /><br />The main flaws of the film are the Night Seekers and plot holes in the last act of the film. The Night Seekers are effectively used but we see too much of them (they would have been more frightening in shadow)and they don't look real enough (at least to me). The plot holes in the third act I won't reveal (again, they also reveal spoilers)but suffice to say the film is very good inspite of its flaws.<br /><br />The DVD has two versions of the film. The first on disc 1 is the theatrical cut (which I felt was inferior). The second disc has a short documentary on the real threat we face by viruses both natural and man made with experts from Harvard and other leading research facilities chiming in on the beauty of a virus (which is neithr living or dead according to one researched but somewhere inbetween). The second disc has the alternate cut of the film and there's also a weblink to bonus material. The Blu-ray INCLUDES the bonus featurettes which amount of about 50 minutes of material.<br /><br />We also get animated comics that show the effects of the disease across the world.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the theatrical cut and alternate versions are seamlessly branched on the single disc Blu-ray and HD-DVD.<br /><br />While a flawed film, "I Am Legend" is a very good thrill ride with a strong central performance by Will Smith which sells even the weaker aspects of the story. The 2 disc DVD edition really should have been a single disc edition (with the bonus material) like the Blu-ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Everyone seemed disappointed in this movie (probably because it takes a pretty high attention span to really get into).  Another reviewer commented that it "doesn't stick closely to its' source material", and in a way this is true, but it in a way it isn't--the film is pretty grim and though the ending strays from the novel, it is not a disappointment.<br /><br />Richard Matheson was so displeased with the first version of his classic horror novel of the same name ("The Last Man On Earth" starring Vincent Price) that he changed his name on the film's credits to "Logan Swanson".  One can only imagine what he thought of Charlton Heston's "The Omega Man", which featured zombies with afros and sunglasses.  Both of these films, however, conveyed the sense of crushing loneliness which comes through in the novel (particularly the former).  I'm not sure it's possible to successfully adopt this book to screen without departing in some way from the author's uncompromising vision.<br /><br />Will Smith does a fantastically understated job as the unfortunate scientist Robert Neville, who seems to be the sole surviving member of the human race after a pernicious virus simultaneously wipes out the species and transforms them into degraded, parasitic creatures not dissimilar to mythological vampires.  Along with his dog Sam, he cruises around during the day and hides in his fortress-like apartment while they roam the streets looking for him.  The tension in this film is palpable enough to cut with a knife; the scene in which Sam unwisely runs into a very dark area, thereby sparking a confrontation between Neville and his once human foes, is nail biting and effective.  Smith brings across the psychical damage wrought by years of solitude and fear when he tearfully begs a mannequin to say hello to him, almost with the glimmer of a belief that it might indeed happen.  In nearly every way it is faithful to some of the most heart-wrenching events of the novel: Sam's transformation, for instance, into a rabid dog and what Neville has to do afterward.<br /><br />The irony of Neville being a feared, monstrous being from the perspective of these creatures and his natural inclinaton to see them the same way is not brought across with as much force as it was in "The Last Man" but nonetheless it is delivered powerfully.  Smith's Neville "donates his blood" (no pun intended) while igniting a grenade in a gesture of self-sacrifice that is not candy coated.  In some ways this is one of the best versions of the novel I have ever seen, and kudos to Will Smith for a great performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>WB must think most of us are victims of ADD. This one is a breeze through the park to get through. It's you typical post apocolypse movie with a big enough star on it to sell. For full out gratification seek out the cult classic 28 days later by Danny Boyle, not '...Weeks later' though! Weeks is the sequel. This movie could have been so much better. The mutants, the main character, the story all could have been vamped up and kicked everyone's A@@'s out of their seats. And I hear NewLine's out of business, but hell, if they had gotten their hands on this it would have been epic. Bob Shaye would have poured millions into it and properly hired Weta to do the effects and voila, magnifique!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>As in the movie "Omega Man", don't expect a happy outcome for Neville played by Will Smith. If you enjoyed the version with Charlton Heston you will probably like this version with Will Smith. One thing I have to agree with several reviews here is they should have used real humans for those infected as they did in the first movie. The CGI versions are a bit over the top and don't feel real. CGI is fine as long as it is mainly used for mattes and large creatures, but when you try to make humans with it, it seems almost like watching a cartoon. Only some "Resident Evil" computer gamers may think they are acceptable. It isn't that I don't like CGI, I thought "Beowulf" was quite well done. It just didn't work here. Sometimes makeup is far more effective. Personally I would have loved to seen the infected people and animals more realistic, in other words people and dogs with makeup, not CGI. The story premise is somewhat like the book, a virus wipes out mankind. Neville and a few other humans have survived.<br /><br />Neville believes everyone has now changed to the cannibalistic creatures that come out at night. His family is dead but he has a dog as a companion. An interesting twist to how those changed, don't want changed and they are clever enough to even trap Neville. He keeps telling them he can fix this when in fact they don't desire it like he does. His dog is his best friend and probably the last thing that keeps him from going crazy with loneliness. His dog will sacrifice itself to save him inevitably. Neville will sacrifice himself for what is left of mankind as well when the time comes. Most of us would die for someone we love, so keeping that in mind it is a little easier to take the trajedy when it comes. Until then he and his dog hold up at night in his fortress like apartment and come out to scout the city for food, DVDs, and the location of infected colonies during the day. Chasing deer in a Shelby Mustang is one of the few thrills left to him. He must be home by dusk and make sure the Zombies don't follow him if he hopes to survive.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and Bob Marley music and I think it has good replayability. Good quality DVD with animated shorts on the basic single disc, and commentarty, interviews, and much more on the two disc version. - C. Luster</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Interesting mostly for the haunting view of an abandoned New York City, "I Am Legend" follows Will Smith as he tries to redeem himself for his part in unleashing a devastating plague on the world. For the first 2/3'rds of the movie, it's very affecting. Dr Neville (Smith) and dog Sam prowl an abandoned Manhattan, sharing the space with deer, lions and other critters.<br /><br />It's those other critters that amp up the middle of the movie, as Smith does a major boo-boo and grabs a female zombie-mutant plague victim who happens to be best gal pal to the alpha zombie. Seems Dr Neville needs to run tests on muties if he will find a cure and save mankind, yet for some romantic reason, alpha zombie wants his baby back. This conflict made for the best part of "I Am Legend," but the film did not have the good sense to leave it at that. After three years alone with the dark-seekers, another pair of real live humans make it to NYC, and then the film stumbles.<br /><br />I won't go beyond this point, because all other plotlines follow from that moment. What was a strong lead character to this point suddenly gets muddled up, and all the cool CGI in the world can't make drama from stale pudding. However, for the scenes of Smith grooving on Bob Marley and the meditation on "Shrek," this is a pretty good mid-level Science Fiction movie. Frankly, he was better in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN0T">I, Robot</a>, where the CGI didn't overwhelm the real people.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I had watched the earlier version of this movie, The Omega Man, on late night T.V., when I was a kid and I was totally spooked by it, the beginning was so creepy, with Heston all alone in Downtown L.A. and as he loses track of time and we see the sun fade into the sunset we are not sure why he is in a panic; it was really cool cinema.  Most people now look at that film as 70's camp, but frankly I liked it for what it was, which is why i looked forward to this film, I liked the idea of Will Smith taking the role and the move to NYC as the location.  The first half of the movie rocked, id give it five stars, but the second half and the fact that the CGI vampires didnt work at all, forced an overall three star rating.  Smith is very good in this, frankly I think he is way better by himself than when bouncing off of other actors, I think this is his best role since Ali, if only the CGI team had been up to his level.  Overall, good film, could have been great, but still worth a viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Back in 1954, Richard Matheson wrote a 'Legendary' novel that inspired many authors and film makers. Stephen King often gives partial credit to Matheson for his categorical success (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425104338">Stephen King's Danse Macabre</a>). Three film adaptations have been made of this "Legendary" novel. None of the three have ever done the novel true justice. But the most recent adaptation of Matheson's novel called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765357151">I Am Legend</a> is perhaps the best movie of 2007.<br /><br />It's no secret that 2007's I Am Legend centers around the exploits of Will Smith playing the last man on Earth. And Smith is absolutely phenomenal as this modern day (2009 - 2012) survivor; he deserves an award for his portrayal as Dr. Robert Neville. The movie runs for 101 minutes and Smith occupies the screen pretty much solo for about 3-quarters of the movie...but rest assured...he's not alone.<br /><br />Fans of Matheson's novel should go into Director Francis Lawrence's 2007 film adaptation with an open mind. The key word is that this is an 'adaptation' inspired by the original novel. In fact, 2007's I Am Legend seems to not only be inspired by the novel, but also by the two prior film adaptations (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>; the 2007 film has elements of all three as well as some very cool original aspects.<br /><br />Lawrence does an excellent job at keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with taught suspense. Smith keeps you captivated from start to finish. The story is terrific. The action scenes are very well done. But the superhuman abilities of the 'night seekers' is a bit hard to swallow.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I look forward to the DVD release of I Am Legend, because I will certainly add it to my cart.<br /><br />DVD RELEASE UPDATE - 3-20-2008 -- The DVD release of I Am Legend includes an alternate ending option to the theatrical release. Watch it. It is dubbed the "controversal ending", but it is actually more true to the theme of the original idea created by Matheson that the title of the story is derived from. Is Nevelle (Smith) a "Legend" for his work in science or is he a Legendary monster among the world's new society?</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"I am Legend", the third film based on the book by writer Richard Matheson, stars Will Smith as Dr. Robert Neville. "Legend" is a surprisingly good film despite a spectacularly weak ending and easily the best of the three film adaptations.<br /><br />Dr. Robert Neville, an army scientist, is the leading researcher looking for a cure to a virus. The virus once promised to cure cancer, but has ended up killing a large percentage of the population, leaving Robert alone in a virtually deserted New York City. He spends his days exercising with his dog, doing research to try to find a cure and trying to stay alive. I say virtually deserted New York City because at night, he has to barricade himself in his home, ready to fight off the zombie like creatures who come out at night. Portions of the people not killed by the virus have become creatures who hunt at night, feeding on the remaining humans. This situation has also helped to wipe out part of the survivors and made the creatures smarter and more resourceful- as their food supply dwindles, they figure out how to find food, becoming more ruthless, more determined, scarier. Robert knows about these creatures and is determined to protect is anonymity. One day, his dog chases an antelope into a dark building and he runs across a coven of these creatures. Determined to continue his research, he captures one and takes her back to his lab. But nothing seems to work. He continues to send out messages on a radio band and to do his research. But things will change soon, and drastically.<br /><br />Entertainment Weekly recently listed Smith as one of "The 50 Smartest People in Hollywood". I'm not trying to validate this magazine filler, but they have a point. With remarkably rare exception, Smith has made remarkably well-received films serving to cement his place in the top echelon of actors who command top dollar for their films. Even when the films aren't great, they are fun. So we can possibly forgive him "The Pursuit of Happyness" and "Wild Wild West" because he has given us such hits as the phenomenally successful "Independence Day", "Men in Black" and "Bad Boys". "I am Legend," continues this trend, providing Smith with a star vehicle in which is he is virtually the only person on screen for a majority of the film. Because the film has made a lot of money, Smith will receive most of the credit for the film's success.<br /><br />After the virus eradicates much of the world's human population, Robert, somehow immune, continues his research, working very hard to make sure his home remains a safe haven. He checks to almanac to make sure he and Sam, his daughter's dog, return home every day before sunset. He lowers shutters and barricades the door and sleeps in the bathtub, with the dog and a rifle at his side. To maintain his sanity, he watches videotapes of old television and pretends mannequins in a shop are real people, having conversations with them.<br /><br />Because there are no people in New York City, the animals run wild and Robert and Sam are always on the hunt for new game, to supplement their diet. They chase a deer and Sam runs after the deer into a dark building. Robert is reluctant to follow her, but he can't leave his pet, his only daily contact, and his only tie to the past, to fall into the hands of the creatures that take over the night. Sure enough, they run into a group of them and Robert has to try to make it out. Somehow.<br /><br />But Robert is also a scientist, so he returns to set a trap and capture one of them, to run some more experiments. Much like Sam running into the darkened building, the leader of the creatures tries to prevent one of his less intelligent followers from falling into the trap, but is unable to stop her in time.<br /><br />"I Am Legend" is very good. And it is so good because it convincingly sets up Robert's environment. I still can't figure out how they recreated the vacant, overgrown, slightly battered New York City. Robert races his car through empty streets, overgrown with weeds and littered with rusting cars. The filmmakers spent a lot of time and money on the special effects to recreate this. A shot of the bridges leading into Manhattan, both of which were hit by missiles many years ago, is particularly stunning.<br /><br />Smith is virtually the only person on screen for 80% of the film. Can there be any further definition of a star `carrying a film'? Also, because of the leading man's inherent charisma and charm, he commands our attention on the screen and makes us believe he is a scientist capable of finding a cure to a virus that has wiped out 90% of the world's population. How refreshing and different from other actors who pop up and try to portray nuclear scientists or heart surgeons and barely look like they can apply their lipstick or shave.<br /><br />As Smith's Robert Neville moves through his world, a world we are just learning about, he is almost a tour guide for us, introducing us to the various modifications he has made in order to survive. This is a testament to Smith's skill because we never feel as though he is trying to teach us, as though he is on a pulpit explaining things to us. We learn through his actions, his observances, by watching him as he deals with the routine he has set up.<br /><br />Director Francis Lawrence ("Constantine") paces the film well, catching our attention with an action packed sequence. He fills in the details later. After a brief prologue, we are immediately plunged into Robert's world and watch as he and Sam hunt wild animals. As the film progresses, Robert remembers key events leading to the evacuation of New York, which he refers to as "Ground Zero" for the virus on more than one occasion. These scenes also give us a look at what happened to his wife and child, giving us more details about how Robert is willing and able to cope with this strange situation.<br /><br />Because we are immediately thrust into this man's current situation, we get a real sense of what he has been living through. This is the majority of his life now, everything else, as important as it was, is now secondary. The filmmakers have placed the emphasis in the right place and make the story all the more engrossing and exciting.<br /><br />There are a couple of enigmatic moments my friends and I have been talking about, because they could mean a couple of different things. Not because they are confusing or uninteresting. These discussions have led all people to have further consideration for each side of the argument. How often do you come out of an action / sci-fi film talking about things, trying to figure them out, having discussions?<br /><br />For all of the work spent on creating a post-apocalyptic New York, some of the CGI character work is less than perfect. The creatures are interesting and "Alpha Male", as he is listed in IMDB, the leader of these vampire - zombie creatures does seem to have some intelligence, some capability to lead the rest of his coven. But some of these creatures are less convincing than others. Late in the film, the Alpha Male unleashes some of his infected dogs and they are particularly fake looking. So, the CGI is not consistent throughout.<br /><br />And the film begins to fall apart in the last act, leading us to a particularly weak ending. When the DVD is released, you could have a double bill featuring "I am Legend" and "The Village" and it might seem like one seamless film.<br /><br />But these complaints aside, "I am Legend" is still an extremely strong film and worthy of your money.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>I Am Legend is a classic story of "be careful what you wish for." In the future, a cure for cancer is discovered. Everyone is happy and the creator of the vaccine is hailed as a visionary. Shortly thereafter, it is discovered that the so-called miracle cure actually mutates and causes those who have been vaccinated to turn into rabid, zombie-like creatures who lose their hair, have bloody eyes, and exhibit aggression toward other human beings. When these beings get hungry, they attack human beings until, in the year 2013, there are none left. Or so scientist Robert Neville believes. Alone on the island of Manhattan, but for his dog Sam, Robert attempts to find a cure for the disease and to keep himself from falling victim to the zombies created by the KV vaccine.<br /><br />I Am Legend is startingly like 28 Days Later, and as other reviewers have mentioned, I think that movie did a better job. I did, however, find this movie entertaining, and that's what's important. It's not great. It won't change your life. But it will entertain you, and that's about all I can ask for. If you want a better movie, with a similar theme, try Children on Men with Clive Owen and Julianne Moore. That movie did a much better job of portraying dystopia and the demise of the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>Like most fans of horror literature, I've read the book, I Am Legend by Richard Matheson.  Matheson is (next to Lovecraft) the most important figure in horror in the twentieth century.  This famous book almost created the concept of "the last real human left on Earth."  In the book, it is vampires.  In the movies, they became "mutants," or zombies, or "the infected."<br /><br />This film gives us monsters who are a cross between vampires and zombies.  They are like vampires because they cannot be exposed to sunlight.  Otherwise, they are like the zombies of the 28 Days Later mold - exceptionally fast and strong.  (I still have a problem with fast, strong zombies - where do they get their strength from, especially considering they are so under-nourished.  But perhaps I am being too literal.)<br /><br />This movie works because the filmmakers choose to use suspense over cheap shocks.  It is amazing how long it takes to even see one of the monsters.  Most of the film is about Will Smith trying (and failing) to hold onto his sanity as he wonders through the surreally empty Manhattan.<br /><br />There are flaws in the film to be sure - mostly, some badly done CGI effects.  All in all, it works.  It is about time this film was made.  For years, it has been kicking around Hollywood attached to people like Schwarzenegger and so on.  It was even listed in an Entertainment Weekly article about the "best scripts never made."  Now, it has been made.  As a benefit, the book is popular again - and  whole generation of new readers will discover the old master.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This intense Sci-Fi/horror is what I call 'smart' sci-fi because it gets us emotionally attached to the characters 'before' anything shows up to attack or eat them, that way we really care if something happens. I recently saw a movie (won't mention the name) where the characters were so annoying I was cheering for the monster. I Am Legend is a high caliber movie in its genre and I've always thought Will Smith gives one hundred percent to all the roles he plays. This tale is a cautionary warning of how we humans can really mess up. A virus developed as a hopeful cure to cancer becomes a deadly infection that turns humans into hideous beings that hover in the dark, unable to live in the sunlight. Very few people are immune to it and the city of New York is closed off. Will Smith plays a doctor who dedicates the remainder of his life to try and find a cure, lonely and left only with his dog, our hearts ache for him. I must say the creatures were truly creepy.  They didn't go overboard on the effects, it's the subtle approach that makes them extremely horrid and too realistic looking. I always crave the truly happy ending, but what can I say, this film met me half-way in that area. Maybe some of us need to get over our happy ending cravings.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay -  Author</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>I absolutely loved the movie.  I believe it is Will Smith's best role since "Ali" and shows that he has some serious acting talent, as he holds his own in the first 2/3rds of the movie as the only screen presence for the film (minus flashbacks) opposite only a dog as his only companion and friend.<br /><br />I thought it was phenomenally shot, and genuinely the scariest movie I've ever seen in my adult life.  Nothing I'd seen until then was genuinely frightening (and not just a cheap teen horror thrill with a loud sound and/or violin shriek) when Sam (Neville's dog) rushes after a deer into a pitch dark area, with only a gun-mounted flashlight, and absolutely no music playing whatsoever.<br /><br />Followed by another genuinely frightening scene, in which Fred (one of the mannequins Neville sets up outside a video store to talk to) has been moved (as part of a Darkseeker's trap), and nearly drives Neville insane, thinking Fred is perhaps a real person, and having to shoot him to be sure, only to spring the trap.<br /><br />As great as the movie was, and as frightening as it was, and as heartbreaking as it was to see the fate of his family and his dog, I spend about 18 dollars for the special edition two-disc version.<br /><br />And I spend double the price for the single disc for... maybe five minutes extra footage, tops?<br /><br />Disc one is basically the same thing you'd get in the normal edition; movie plus four animated comics.  Disc two gives you THE SAME MOVIE with maybe five minutes additional footage, such as some minor deleted scenes setting up the premise for the Darkseeker's evolution and intelligence, and the alternate ending, which while was a bit frightening and touching at once, was hardly groundbreaking and not at all controversial.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: The "alternate" version of the movie just has a butterfly reference (the Darkseeker girl's tattoo), a scene with Neville showing Anna and Ethan the trap the Darkseeker Alpha set for him, a scene with Ethan swimming in a fish pond while Anna asks about the Darkseeker's evolution, and the alternate ending, in which rather than sacrifice himself, Neville turns over the girl to the Darkseeker, who shows he can truly love, and the Darkseekers leave them be to escape, with a cure to the virus in hand.<br /><br />So for used on Amazon you get the single disc version for.. 8 dollars or so.  For used two-disc, you get for 14 (as of this date), and before that I paid 18 including shipping.<br /><br />So as with the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix special edition, I got screwed; we all got screwed.<br /><br />Worthless.  Try again next time, Warner Brothers.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Faithless adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic sci-fi novel still manages to be engaging in its own right, thanks largely to the onscreen appeal of that one-man box-office juggernaut, Will Smith - and his dog. The terrifically tense staging of some sequences compensates, surprisingly, for a largely plotless and hole-ridden narrative and some clunky digital effects. Purists be warned: this is not the book you read, but it's still more speculative fiction than popcorn movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>As a standalone last-man-on-earth movie or a remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a> , 'I Am Legend' is a film of two halves. The first half, I was pleasantly surprised to discover, is very good indeed and doesn't concede to the big guns, explosions and one-liner forumula popularised by the Bruckheimer and Simpson school of Blockbuster movie-making; In keeping with the novel, what you have is the laconic introduction of a man going about an ordered routine in a world in which order has ceased to have meaning. The first section of the film, prior to the first appearance of the living human infected (and minus some dodgy CGI deer and a CGI lion that looked like it had padded into frame from the film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNX0">Madagascar (Widescreen Edition)</a> ) is nothing short of breathtaking. The vistas of an empty New York slowly returning to nature are the best CGI that I've seen since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX1I">Children of Men (Widescreen Edition)</a> largely because, bar the opening shots, they borrow a trick from that film in not dwelling on the landscapes with the obligatory "look at our cool effects, kids!" shots. Because of the ordinariness with which they're treated one doesn't relate to them as an effect.  Smith's performance as Bob Neville is, thank the lord, note perfect. The unspoken dread in his eyes as he's washing his canine companion in the bath-tub and waiting for the sun to set is palpable and, I take my hat off to him, he deserves an Oscar for the strength and subtlety of his performance here. Films like this are carried by their actors and this is a spectacular performance. Not the best of its kind - that accolade still goes to the late, great Bruno Lawrence in the brilliant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZ908Y">The Quiet Earth</a>  - but certainly in the top five. However, the scene which is the film's greatest triumph is also its greatest tragedy. Namely, when Neville is forced to chase his dog into a darkened building and we're treated to a bravura sequence in which he unequivocally panics as he tracks around darkened corners with his rifle. We, the audience, know that the human infected - whom we still haven't seen - are going to jump out on him. And they do. And when they do, they are unfortunately completely unconvincing as anything other than a special effect - and not a particularly convincing special effect at that - at which that point all of the carefully accrued tension dissipates and the audience finds itself firmly in rubbery Matrix CGI country. Make no mistake about it, if Francis Lawrence had opted for human performers in make-up (of the like seen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBN80">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>  and Zack Snyder's superb <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABURA">Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)</a> remake) rather than CGI, it would have probably have been the most terrifying piece of big-budget horror film-making in recent history. In fact, one wonders whether the budget wasn't the deciding factor in making the human infected CGI, as the audiences awareness of them as a special effect drastically reduces the level of horror which would probably have garnered the film an R17/18 rating; something which would have prevented vast swathes of the audience demographic from seeing it and probably would have spelled box office doom given the millions involved. From then on, the film marches steadily on to a denouement which is hurried, rather limp and a complete juxtaposition to the dark themes of the novel. If you're a fan of the novel, you're not going to see it here. The only resemblance to it is the title, the name of the protagonist and, superficially, the situation. Neville is no longer a borderline-alcoholic, blue-collared schmoe barely managing to contain his own self-destructive urges. The scientific examination of the vampire myth that made the book so fascinating is not here. Neither is the final heart-breaking inversion of Neville's plight which so haunted me when I read it as a thirteen year old. Suffice to say, despite three official screen interpretations and numerous unofficial interpretations, the definitive version of this massively influential novel is still to be made. One day, maybe Hollywood will realise that this is one story that doesn't need a rewrite or eye-candy to bolster what is already a supremely haunting and still frighteningly relevant tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>I Am Legend can't get a fair shake.  This Will Smith-led production is the third attempt Hollywood has made to adapt the brilliant novel.  None of the adaptions have truly done the novel justice (which is a shame), but this version has come the closest.<br /><br />Here we have a brilliant beginning; footage of a scientist (played beautifully by Emma Thompson) saying humbly that she's discovered a way to cure cancer.  Fast forward a few years, and New York is utterly devoid of human life, save for Robert Neville (Will Smith).  As the first half of the film progresses, we learn about his meager living, spending the day harvesting and trying to discover a cure, even now, while spending the night huddled in his protected home as creatures prowl.<br /><br />His only companion, a wonderful dog named Sam, protects Neville as Neville protects him.  They have a friendship based on loneliness and the human need for someone or something to hold onto.  Sam is Neville's only connection to the past and the only way to represent what little humanity is left, either in the world or Neville himself.  This period in the movie is pitch perfect, puncuated by one or two terrifying sequences that instill genuine horror.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the last half of the film deteriorates into an action movie that completely changes the meaning of the words "I Am Legend."  Don't get me wrong, it's mostly done really well.  Constantine director Francis Lawrence has a good handle on the action and delivers some good scenes.  But, it becomes muddled and veers off completely from the novel.  My biggest complaint, though, is the use of CGI.  Instead of using real flesh and blood actors, all of the creatures are created with CG and they look incredibly fake when lined up next to real people.  In the beginning, it's not a problem but as you see more of them (and you will) it's glaringly obvious.  And annoying.<br /><br />All of this I was expecting going in, though.  Considering that the film was co-written by Akiva Goldsman who also wrote I, Robot, I knew this version would stray from the source material just as I, Robot did.  As a movie, it's genuinely thrilling and creates the perfect balance of tension and action through most of its entirety.  And, surprisingly, Will Smith shows that he's a really good actor as he has to not only tackle many conflicting emotions during the two hour run time but he also has to do so without having much of anyone to react to.  Spending a good hour or so without another single actor for Will Smith to work with was a gamble and it paid off.<br /><br />Your enjoyment of the film is entirely based on what you bring to the table.  If you're coming to this film expecting to see the book come to life you'll be sorely disappointed.  However, if you're looking for a good action movie that actually has a good story and a human aspect, you'll be hard-pressed to find one as thrilling recently.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This third incarnation of Richard Matheson's masterpiece is superior to its predecessors in every way, but in spite of that achievement the film is still lacking and comes across as a disappointment in too many ways.<br /><br />I can't bear to rehash the plot as nearly everyone knows this story by now, and if you are one of the few unfamiliar with this story, then please read Amazon's well-written synopsis or Trashcanman's excellent review in the Spotlight review section.  I just plan to hit what I enjoyed about this film and what was so disappointing.<br /><br />The Hits:<br /><br />(1) Another top-notch, winning performance by the ever reliable and likable Will Smith.<br />(2) Outstanding set designs combined with CGI effects of a desolate and abandoned New York City make this film seem more important than it is.<br />(3) Best adaptation of Matheson's highly influential novel (even if it isn't the most faithful to the story in a literal sense --it captures the spirit of his work extremely well).<br /><br />The Misses:<br /><br />(1) The most glaring problem with this film, in my view, is the CGI effects for the vampire-like survivors of the plague.  They are too cartoonish for me and appear far too much like video game villains.  A good example of this for me is the early scene where Smith's character enters a building to get his dog and finds some zombies hiding in a corner.  They are real people, not CGI, and they are frightening; however, later, when he's attacked by CGI zombies, it is unintentionally humorous as they appear like Gollum from LOTR on acid.  The CGI effects are either not believable or just too over-the-top, thus, the scenes with them lose their punch.<br /><br />(2) Uneven pacing of the story is a problem here.  The opening segments give the impression that we are going to see a masterpiece here, but the second half of the film never matches the first half and it feels very rushed.  It has that "hey, guys, we just ran out of money, so we have to wrap up this film up this week" feel to it.  In a film with a deliberate and nearly dignified opening to fall into a shoddy rushed finale severely hurts this film and leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.<br /><br />The film is still solid entertainment in spite of its obvious and significant flaws.  It is probably one I will even buy when it becomes available on DVD later, but it is rather disappointing for a film that seemed to have so much going for it.  Its box office receipts may reinforce that perception as it set opening weekend records with a take of about $77 million, but by its third weekend it only grossed about $15 million and that is a severe drop off.  For a film that reportedly cost $150 to make it has grossed a disappointing $228 after a month at the box-office.  That doesn't even qualify it has a hit with a mere $78 million dollar profit at this point.  I do think it will be a hit after it's been released world-wide.<br /><br />BTW:  Some may ask, "What is a hit by today's standards?"  That's a good question with really no one set answer, however, Hollywood traditionally likes to see a film generate double what it cost to make in order to classify a film as a hit.  This film with a cost of $150 million to make is expected to earn $300 million to be considered a hit, but certain stars, like Will Smith, are expected to bring in better than double the cost of the film (hence, why this may end up being considered a "disappointment" at the box-office even if it hits the magic $300M mark).</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>Richard Matheson's novel "I Am Legend" has been made into at least three motion pictures -- "The Last Man on Earth" (Vincent Price), "The Omega Man" (Charlton Heston), and "I Am Legend" (Will Smith) -- and has served as inspiration for dozens of others.  The story combines science fiction and horror in a bleak, pessimistic view of the future of mankind.<br /><br />In the latest version, "I Am Legend," Smith stars as Robert Neville, a scientist who was unable to halt the spread of an incurable, man-made virus.  Immune to the fatal virus, Neville is the sole human survivor in what remains of New York City and possibly the world.  His only companion is his dog, Samantha.  But mutant plague victims -- the Infected -- lurk in the darkness, watching Neville's every move and waiting for him to make a fatal mistake.  Day to day, Neville is driven by a single mission:  to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus.  To do so, he must use his own immune blood.<br /><br />"I Am Legend" is by far the most ambitious of the three screen adaptations of Matheson's novel.  The opening scenes, showing a deserted Times Square overgrown with vegetation, are spectacular, and Smith manages to keep the story flowing in the early scenes even though he's the only person we see.  Flashbacks illustrate the stages leading up to the present near-obliteration of humanity and are elaborately staged by director Francis Lawrence.  The film's third act resorts to a fairly routine formula of the hero versus the monsters but, overall, "I Am Legend" is an impressive effort.<br /><br />The "I Am Legend Ultimate Collector's Edition" is just the thing for sci-fi and Will Smith fans.  The three-disc box set contains two versions of the movie, one with a controversial ending; a digital copy of the film; four animated comics; 12 never-before-seen deleted scenes along with filmmaker's commentary; a 44-page concept sketch book; a lucite commemorative piece featuring images from the movie; and hours of featurettes covering filming on the aircraft carrier Intrepid, canine training, making New York City look deserted, assistance provided by the U.S. Military, and the integration of CGI images with live action footage.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>By far my dumbest review title, but it gets to the point.  What's the point?  Every time civilization is engulfed in some sort of cannibalistic, zombie-esque plague many questions get begged and then I fail to enjoy the movie.  I hate it when I ruin movies with logic.  I have much more fun when I can let things go.  Unfortunately for me and my wife reality reared its ugly head while watching this film.  Fortunately for the movie, reality does not make it a bad film.  What am I getting at anyway!!?  To save all of us some time, here is a list of bullet statements to explain my problematic reality check of civilizations end (again):<br /><br />(Some of this might be considered "spoiler" material so consider yourself warned)<br />-Why do plagues always turn people into cannibals?  And when they turn into cannibals, why don't they eat each other?  In this film the plague-ridden are maniacal, night dwelling blood suckers.  Don't any of them have blood in their bodies to share?<br /><br />-If animals get said plague, as is the case in this film, why would they not try to eat their plague infected masters?  If the plague turns people into animals does it turn animals into... ...more animals??  I guess we should assume that getting the plague and going nuts ends all bigotry and discrimination not only between races, but also species.  If you have the plague you're cool.  If you don't you're dinner.  Hey, another upside to getting the plague!<br /><br />-In real life a plague weakens and kills people. In movies often the plague that ends civilization turns people into super beings.  Not such a bad deal really.  If I could run like the wind, scamper up walls like a squirrel, knock over cars by running into them and endure copious amounts of pain I'd consider taking up the plague voluntarily and become a superhero.  Of course I'd need to work around that urge to eat my fellow man.<br /><br />-Do the infected reproduce (am I nuts or am I the only one in the theater thinking about this stuff?)?  I mean, if they don't do "the act" aren't they going to disappear after a couple of generations?  If they do commit "the act" do the female plaguies eat the male plaguies when they're done?  I know the zombies don't do it, but you never run out of dead people.  Although, at some point after everyone is a zombie, there is going to be a big rot-fest and everyone will just fall to pieces.  Don't want to be there for that.  In "28 days later" people eventually die of the plague, so that works out nicely.<br /><br />-Since plaguies are crazed animals (sort of) and they don't really do anything but hunt for food and since they don't eat each other, wouldn't they eventually run out of food?  What happens when they eat all the healthy people and animals (Whom they greatly outnumber btw)?  Since they don't eat members of the club, this presents a problem.<br /><br />-Are the plague-ridden impervious to extremes in temperature?  Since they seem to have lost most capacity for manufacturing and electricity is becoming a distant memory, how will they stay warm in the winter?  They run around in rags with nothing on their feet, so finding new cloths seems a low priority. Do they migrate?  Hardly seems likely with that inconvenient allergy to UV light.  They do have a high metabolic rate so maybe that helps.  But, without fur covering there skin, it is more than likely that northern Plaguies would eventually die off due to exposure and cold.<br /><br />-Why do plaguies suddenly have the ability to stretch their facial bones every time they want to yell out with an attack scream?  This is kind of a rip-off from "The Mummy" movie and really looked fake and out of place in this movie.  I liked it in "The Mummy" because that was pure fantasy.  This is sci-fi and it didn't look right.  Using CG was OK for everything else because of the superpowers plaguies possess.  I just don't understand why their jaws needed to stretch.<br /><br />-Does immunity to a zombiesque plague cause you to lose your mind or miss the obvious?  At a crucial point of the movie, we learn that Will is not the sole survivor (a woman and her son pop in).  The woman insists that there are more survivors in a nearby colony.  Will insists there is no one else (boy, does he miss the obvious).  When Will asks the woman why she believes there are more survivors she tells him (paraphrase) "God says so.".  WHAAAA?!?!  She really does not get fact-based debate.  The correct and obvious answer should have been "We're here, aren't we?"  Both people missed the most obvious things and that's just not what real people do.<br /><br />-Do any of us want a future with Will Smith in it?  The prospects are bleak; Alien invasion wiping out most of humanity.  Robot rebellion.  Plague infested world full of vampires.  I pick the robots.<br /><br />In the Chuck Hesston version "Omega Man", the plague victims become cult members.  Never is cannibalism ever mentioned.  They simply want to get Chuck because he's not one of them and he wants to "cure" who they are.  That makes things a lot more feasible in the long run.  "I Am Legend" makes a similar point.  He treats the plaguies like animals (a reputation well earned) and subsequently becomes their enemy.  In the end, there are questions who the bad guy is (at least I thought so).<br /><br /> There are plenty of tense and scary scenes in which Will Smith does a great job.  A very well made movie that beg lots of silly questions from one silly guy.  These questions kind of ruined the movie for me though.  I would actually recommend avoiding at the theater and buying on DVD.  Theaters are just too expensive these days and there is little advantage to seeing it on the big screen.  Overall a fun movie but you will need to stop asking so many goofy questions if you want to enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I was into I AM LEGEND completely. All the way up to the revilation scene, when Robert Neville (Will Smith) finds out that he isn't alone and quite frankly, I AM LEGEND fell completely off the table and crashed into a million pieces.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND had a premise that we've scene hundreds of times. OMEGA MAN. 28 DAYS LATER. You can't be out after dark. Zombies, or forms thereof. The only survivor of an incredible catastrophe. Yet, what it didn't do, is anything different. When you thought it was going in a cool direction and you were seeing something completely new and a completely original twist on an otherwise overused premise, you realized... nope... same old stuff. Nothing worth remembering.<br /><br />The scenes of Will Smith racing through the baron, littered and grass covered streets of New York City, hunting deer and avoiding Lions were top notch. The scenes of him using the video store as a social outlet, with strategically placed mannequins, were well done and poigniant. The scene where he reluctantly followed his dog into the shadowed building that housed the infected humans were frightening.<br /><br />Everything was going so well... and when Neville used a trap to capture one of the infected and then the infected turned the tables on him, instituting their own trap, I was sold. That was followed by some heart-wrenching moments and a confrontation scene that was creative and realistic. I AM LEGEND was right on. A memorable, hit movie. And then....<br /><br />I AM LEGEND became just another movie. There were characters introduced that broke the movies rhythm. Anna & Ethan? They're clean. Calm. They appear out of nowhere, but have no knowledge of what happens after dark. She manages to save Neville from an onslaught of infected, but then shows no sign of being battle or survival tough.<br /><br />There are moments where the audience isn't allowed to play along, like when the infected find Neville's hideout. It is explained by a single line of dialogue and has little to zero impact.<br /><br />Ultimately though, I AM LEGEND started off unique and just became forgettable and uneventful. When a premise has been done hundreds of times, it's time for a shakeup... something new... we didn't get it with I AM LEGEND. We got 1 hour of unique moments followed by 40 minutes of the same old same old.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>This movie is slow, dull, and boring with injections of adrenalin to keep you from falling asleep.  Will Smith does a good job but good acting cannot salvage what is a poor screen play.  The deserted New York is very well done but the entire film drags plus it has some serious logical flaws.  Where are the bodies and/or skeletons?  If the surviors have resorted to cannabalism why are they only preying on the sole survior? Shouldn't some be starving? If they are eating abandoned food why are they attacking the one survivor?  If they are irrational and preying on humans why are they not attacking each other?  Where is the electricty coming from?  The first time he enters his safe house he hides his tracks but doesn't do that at any other time yet that is how he is tracked down.  Who set the trap for him?  That was left open -- why were cars used as counter weights when it would be easier to use something more easily handled?  Why was he constantly driving at high speeds?  Shooting a deer would have been easy yet he chose to chase them in his car -- why not run one down?  This whole sequence was contrived and sort of dumb.<br /><br />The film has long draggy sequences which were punctuated with attacks by over active zombies who appear to act irrationally and with no clear motive.  I watched this film with my sons, nephews, and grandsons -- none of them liked it and all of them thought we should have selected a different movie -- and I hardily agree.  This was a poor movie but the fault lies not the stars but in the screen play.  I would say don't bother with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>There's lot of Bob Marley in this film. My favorite line was the Bob Marley quote  about why he was going to perform TWO days  after being shot in an assassination attempt: "The bad people in the world never take a rest, so neither can I." Bob Marley believed that music and love could change and heal the world. He was a true visionary, and I'm so very glad his very important message has not been forgotten by Hollywood! Playing various tunes from his Legend album makes Bob Marley's dream for peace all that more poignant!<br /><br />I'm a fan of the original Omega Man film with Charleston Heston. Over the years I have watched it about a dozen times. I never tire of it! This remake pays homage to the original. But it's a very, very different interpretation. For example in the original film it was a biological warfare agent that got loose in the world. Now it's a genetically engineered virus to cure cancer that caused the destruction of the human race. In other words - biotechnology does us all in!<br /><br />"I Am Legend" also made me squirm because other than the occasional Bob Marley tune, so much of this film had zero music or sound effects. After a while you felt the Will Smith character's  mind-boggling loneliness. This is first, and foremost, a psychological film. Even the movie theater audience barely made a sound! The filmmakers had tremendous courage not to dumb the story down to the level of  adolescent boys. I have been begging Hollywood for years  to make a Sci-Fi film suitable for the mature adult mind - so thank you! You've done it!<br /><br />My favorite scene was the very last one. It showed how civilization can survive  in the future - by being self-sufficient. Keep an eye out for the ultra-modern windmills and solar panels. The scene only lasts a few seconds, but it speaks volumes!<br /><br />This film will be watched a 100 years from now! It's that good!</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Usually I will read the book first but in this case seeing the trailer being played over and over stimulated my curiosity to the point of no return. Being a New Yorker made the whole experience really fun and interesting; recognizing sights I pass on my way to work every day with an eerie feeling of abandonment was something totally different. I would often think in my head about how crowded it gets and how I wish people would just go away but seeing it all empty and overgrowing with grass like a wild safari was worse than I could have imagined. I guess its better the way it is than suffering eternity alone the same way Robert Neville has.<br /><br />Alone except for the companionship of Samantha, the loyal German Shepherd, Neville is hunting wild deer and gathering food growing amok through the city while punctually seeking shelter as soon as the day light ends. When darkness approaches so do the mutated bodies that were once human but now reduced to vampire like creatures who savagely will hunt and devour any living creature. His only mission left is finding the cure than can turn the beasts back into the living before he goes mad form being alone. Things start going wrong when Neville stops being the hunter and starts becoming the hunted, the dark alleys that look ominous contain something that is keen ob bringing him down. His daily routing gets disturbed and he can no longer live peacefully with the hopes of one day saving everyone, he needs to find the cure fast or he too will succumb to the dire fate that all others have met.<br /><br />Visually stunning the movies makes you care for Neville, who was very well portrayed by Smith. He was alone but not overly distressed or crazed, he exercised, rented videos, cooked, watched Shrek and tried to stay as close to being sane as possible. The scary parts made me jump and yell at the TV the same way guys do when they watch sports but overall it was a fun and wild experience and it really made me want to read the book to see what the original idea for this story was. I wish there was less CG effects these days but so many movies are full of them that one can't not see them for just this one reason. Other than that this was a real blast and I will want to see it again soon.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>Dr. Robert Neville seems to have more incarnations than Sherlock Holmes at this point. From humble beginnings, birthing slowly in the unlit corner of the one bedroom apartment and rising from the cheap laminate desk of Richard Matheson -- this character seemed destined for greatness. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765318741">original story</a> reads painfully, is half cheese, half camp ... but strains the eyes continuously, and has a feel to it that is quite moving and worthy of film, graphic novel or some other type of legacy yet unknown.<br /><br />It would seem unlikely that this movie could be compared in anyway to the original short story / novella that shares the same title. In fact, the title might just be the only similarity. My Chinese wife, when she heard about them remaking this - yet again, said: "Robert Neville is very repetitively described as a blonde haired, blue eyed white man in the book. Will Smith? I gotta see that." Needless to say, the horror and action fan that she is, she was heavily disappointed in this as it seemed to be its own entity, instead of sharing even the most remote similarity with the book or even the previous films in any way conceivable.<br /><br />I guess it would be foolish to state that this is the only film to have deviated so far, but we all know that isn't the truth by a long shot. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VAHR14">The Omega Man</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001932ZA">The Running Man</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00070FX5U">Total Recall</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL78">Minority Report</a> and even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UD0ESA">Blade Runner</a> all differ from their original source material - some heavily while others subtly. Who's to say whether this practice is right or wrong? Some of these films are blockbusters while others are heavily dated and total flops. Apparently, Matheson, not only approved of this version, but stated that he thought it was the best so far. Maybe he was referencing the size of the licensing contract and repetitive royalty amounts, surely he couldn't be favouring this over the Charleton Heston version.<br /><br />But what is it about Hollywood that seems to believe that good books just don't translate onto the screen? All the films I previously mentioned are decent books that would've made good direct adaptations, and I can say this confidently because the adjusted adaptations were nothing memorable or impacting, all with the exception of Blade Runner. Giving credit where credit is due, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXA2">Forrest Gump</a> made an interesting adaptation from a sub-par book to an excellent film.  But this type of foolish recklessness is unfortunately more prevalent in the Science-Fiction genre when it comes to adaptations.<br /><br />When I saw this movie at Target, it was on sale for $15.99, but beside it was another version for $24.99 that had the `controversial ending'. So, now, we must either pay an extra ten bucks to see the version where the Vampire Zombies have any level of noticeable intellect and show a glimmer of cunning, or we end up getting both versions for $35, because we just HAVE to see the other version. They used to market these `other versions' for two or three dollars more, which I used to have no problem with, but this is just unforgivable. Double-dipping is understandable in some cases, like with `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V3Z4">Donnie Darko</a>'. Numerous years passed until the Director had a chance to make his desired corrections, and when they were made, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOBI">another DVD</a> was released. What `I Am Legend' is trying to do is just foolish. The alternate ending is not worth the ten dollars, so save your money. And, sigh ... don't worry what I just told you is nothing close to a spoiler. So if you haven't seen any of the films or ever read the book, you're none the wiser, but hopefully a little more informed.<br /><br />I also found the use of the soundtrack was superficial and annoying. A lot of opportunities were wasted on this film, the soundtrack is probably one of the biggest ones, as it could've equated into more revenue for the producers and distributors of this let down. `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later</a>', a film that really raised the bar on these type of `chaos reality' films, has a groundbreaking soundtrack with even a few tracks (18 and 20) that are deeply reminiscent of the score that was used in `The Omega Man' and were quite moving. The majority of James Newton Howard's score wasn't even used in the film. The film was overwrought with so much Foley nonsense (action, explosion, sound effects) that the actual composition for this movie had been dialed into the off position or forgotten about entirely. Shame on the mix done in post by the sound board hacks guzzling diet Pepsi. James Newton Howard may have attempted to repeat his success here from the `Batman Begins' soundtrack, but apart from a few memorable moments, the majority of the musical score here is just way too slow, boring and very forgettable.<br /><br />Since I've noted `28 Days Later', let me just say that that `film' probably had a lot of creative impact on this `movie' from its inception or first utterance of "let's remake `The Omega Man'". `28 Days Later' and `28 Weeks' later recouped more money than either of their primary budgets, thus sending signals to Hollywood, that these types of films would essentially be good vehicles for their leading stars. The problem here is that even though you put bankable stars into a bankable idea it doesn't necessarily equate to a success. Also '28 Days Later' is probably the high water mark of all horror zombie films. Danny Boyle set the bar so high that other imitators will likely fail to even come within groveling distance.<br /><br />This movie's major flaws were the deviation in the writing and not adhering to enough of the other films or the original novella. Reciting lines from `Shrek' when confronted with other survivors was also another poor use of story, viewer time and appreciation of the material or the genre. The use of the mannequins was a nice touch to the creepy, artsy feel that was readily prevalent in `The Omega Man' but it just wasn't enough to admit that it's a worthy adaptation. These writers need to be sent to the unemployment office -- asap.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>Will Smith stated in a recent 60 Minutes interview that when he and his agent were mapping out his career strategy, they noted that most of the top ten films of all time were those with lots of special effects. Films like Independence Day, Men in Black and Wild, Wild West followed. After seeing I Am Legend, I have to say that it's time for Mr. Smith to drop the popcorn movies and put his talent to much better use.<br /><br />I've seen both of the previous film versions of Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend. I saw the Vincent Price version -- Last Man on Earth -- when I was young and don't remember it that well. But I have seen The Omega Man several times and, in fact, own a copy of it on DVD. The Omega Man is dated, to be sure -- 70's hipster language and Charlton Heston do not mix. However, the opening sequences of the film, showing a deserted Los Angeles, are eerily effective. In one shot, we can see nothing moving for miles -- no people, no cars, no traffic helicopters ... nothing at all. Anyone who has been in Los Angeles can tell you what an accomplishment an effect like that really is. With good supporting performances by Rosiland Cash and, especially, Anthony Zerbe as the ringleader of the vampires/mutants, The Omega Man is flawed, but in the end, very, very effective.<br /><br />I Am Legend, similarly, has some fairly effective opening shots of a deserted New York City. However, on closer inspection, the viewer can see that a lot of the effect is due to CGI. The weeds growing out of the streets don't look quite right and the delapidated look on the buildings is very unconvincing. This flaw is hammered home when Smith chases a herd of deer in his Mustang. When a lion attacks one of the deer, the effect is so artificial looking, I was wondering if Yogi Bear was going to appear next.<br /><br />Nowhere, however, do the CGI effects fail more completely than with the vampire mutants. In contrast with The Omega Man where the mutants are played by live actors, all of the creatures in I Am Legend are CGI. The effect is ridiculously cartoonish and wholly unconvincing. And what kind of killer virus actually makes its victims more agile? These creatures were once human beings and now they're able to climb up walls of Manhattan brownstones like mountain goats? Instead of being frightened by the creatures, I found myself rolling my eyes and wondering when Hollywood was going to realize just how bad some CGI effects really look.<br /><br />However, the film's shortcoming aren't just technical. The Omega Man had an extended flashback sequence showing how the virus overtook civilization. Many people drop dead right before our eyes and the horror of the situation is hammered home very effectively. I Am Legend, in contrast, gives up dribs and drabs of flashbacks -- mostly as Smith's dream sequences. The most impressive shot in the film shows fighter jets blowing up the bridges leading into Manhattan -- one of the times where the special effects are really up to the task. However, we never get the same sense of horror watching civilization collapse that we do in The Omega Man. We see a couple of infected people fail a screening and that's about the extent of it. We don't see anyone mutate into one of the creatures. We don't see dozens drop dead from the virus. The fall of civilization doesn't deliver the dramatic punch to the stomach it should.<br /><br />Smith is alone for most of the film. Towards the end, a mother and her son rescue him and briefly move in with him. In The Omega Man, we learn about Rosiland Cash's character and her infected nephew. In I Am Legend, however, the two characters are merely a plot device. They're basically there to move the plot to its conclusion and nothing more. The parts are so badly written, I wondered why they were necessary at all. Instead of caring about these new characters, I spent the final part of the film thinking about what a weak job the screenwriter did on that portion of the script.<br /><br />The only really good thing about I Am Legend is Will Smith's performance. He is excellent at portraying a man who is slowly going mad from lonliness. His heart is in the project even with the numerous flaws and his acting is the only really convincing thing about the entire film. Throughout the film I kept thinking that Smith's performance deserved a better film to showcase it. I felt bad for him, but that sympathy has to be tempered by the knowledge that it was his career goal to seek out projects like this.<br /><br />I'll grant Smith that some of his "prestige projects" like Ali and The Legend of Bagger Vance didn't do that well at the box office. Hollywood, for all the talk about creative expression, is driven by ticket sales and money. However, The Pursuit of Happyness did do well at the box office and showed that Will Smith, given a good script and a good director to work with, can combine artistic excellence with financial success without having to resort to loads of stunts and special effects. Leonardo DiCaprio chooses to work with name directors on films with good scripts in lieu of the summer blockbuster films and he still has as much influence and industry muscle as anyone in Hollywood. There is no reason why Will Smith can't do the same thing. He is supremely talented and intelligent (I'm positive he could be a terrific writer, director and producer as well as actor), should minimize his participation in films like I Am Legend and should choose projects that take more risks and aspire to more than just box office receipts. I Am Legend and other films like it are just a waste of his talent.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Blu ray prices for new blu ray movies run on avg about 27.95, hd dvd going out of business and having huge sales marked I am Legend upon release to 18.95, so Blu Ray adds some nails to the coffin and does the same.<br />Now the film, I'm some beers deep as I write this and there are some plot holes as said beer wears off, however it is a good time.  This graphic novel for a hollywood movie doesn't go 100% sappy or happy ending on us, it shows pain.  Also cash cow Will Smith isn't such a cliche character.  Speaking on Will Smith he is a good cryer, along the lines of Mel Gibson.  I knew this ever since Fresh Prince when Carlton accidently took pills from Will's locker and needed his stomach pumped, or when his dad didn't show up when he was supposed to, Will Smith crying can get to you, he is a good actor.  Besides being a good actor as I mentioned he is a cash cow every film he is makes around $100 mil, with I am Legend topping $200 mil, Adam Sandler is another safe bet at the box office, although I'm not loving his movies.<br />I expected amazing sound out of this blu ray, however the movie isn't trying to be transformers, it's the end of the world, how loud could it be?  And it isn't, if you saw this in the theaters and had a talker in your midst I feel for you.  The Film does take it's time and let's us feel the movie as opposed to attempting to be a cure for add for the entire time it is on the screen.<br />As for hollywood movies this one is a good time, and a worthy add to a collection, especially at this price when compared to other new releases.  And Amazon has a tendency to up prices here and there so I wouldn't gather it'll stay this way for long.  So I'm going to buy it, and I'll list the dvd features later.<br />Thanks for reading, I am out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Maybe it is the last third that blows it. What went wrong? This could have been good sci-fi. What a pity. We've had a lot of vampire and zombie movies over the years and many post-apocalyptic movies. I like 'em even if they aren't done that well, as does apparently a large swath of the public. So, I say the first half or so is excellent. Seeing a realistic depiction of a large city devoid of human beings, crumbling bit by bit, nature all around reclaiming ground, is interesting. New York City is the most cinematic location to digitally degrade with cutting edge computer effects with it's famous monuments and streets and gigantic skyskrappers and celebrated bridges. I've found Will Smith to not always be the most interesting actor but his performance works. Basically Smith is a military scientist in responsible for finding a cure for a super-virus similar to the disease in 28 WEEKS LATTER which turns people into fleshing eating crazed turbo-vombies. Luckily for Smith the ghouls in this flick are like vampires destroyed by sunlight. This allows him free reign over almost all of Manhattan during the day, except of course the insides of darkened buildings where monsters shelter themselves from deadly ultraviolet light. Meeting the monsters is the highlight of the movie for me. I was nervous. As for these transformed mutants of the night, they sound scary and look deformed by disease but fake. For the longest time I've said use make-up and masks when you can and cost effective computer effects for the extras--for the background zombies or zombies in dark environments when detail is less an issue. Up close in the light you got video game level quality and that is very lame. Things started to go downhill for me with a strange trap Smith gets caught in that I simply didn't buy and never found a good explaination for. After this his character is disapointing when confronted with a painful loss. Then we discover he is a man without faith in god which is a bad thing?? Not sure where they were going with that and if we're supposed to believe he got it back I simply missed that part--not that I cared in the first place. Without spoiling anything, the final nail on the coffin is the absurd conclusion to Smith's story. The timing of it! Yeah okay. And speaking of timing, got to love the scene on the wharf. Just in the nick of time, outta nowhere...What are those odds? In the end the movie wraps up and your just left with an uninteresting conventional movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765318741">I Am Legend</a>, the novel, spawned the vampires-as-physical-phenomena genre.  Vulnerabilities to religious icons were merely psychological holdovers from victims of a disease who believed they were vampires.  But the thirst for blood was very real. It established the post-apocalyptic fear of contamination.<br /><br />Since I Am Legend is a Will Smith vehicle, I figured it'd have some wisecracks, a lot of action, and Smith saving the day.  So I was surprised to get exactly that - but not delivered in the way I expected.<br /><br />I Am Legend is very much like a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C825J">A Boy & His Dog</a> in that our two protagonists are Robert Neville (Will Smith), a virologist responsible for finding a cure in New York City, and his dog Samantha, wandering a world gone mad. What's interesting about I Am Legend is the question posed by the title.  Why is Neville a legend?<br /><br />The most obvious answer is that Neville is immune to the disease that has converted 90 percent of humanity.  As such, he believes he holds the cure within himself.  In that regard, if Neville can succeed in stopping the plague, he will be a legend to all of humankind.  But there's more to I Am Legend than that.<br /><br />It's fitting that his companion is a dog.  With only Sam as his companion, Neville is truly a legend; the only other living being idolizes Neville, just as dogs idolize their masters.  Neville also creates a fictional community of people out of mannequins in a DVD rental store, where everybody knows his name.  Neville is indeed a legend in his own mind.<br /><br />There's also the possibility, posited in the original story, that Neville isn't famous as a savior, but infamous amongst the new breed of humanity as a mass murderer.  In that regard Neville is legendary not because of whom he saves but whom he kills.  Neville sacrifices countless of the infected in a quest for a cure, and in the process loses a little bit of his own humanity.<br /><br />I Am Legend could easily have been an egotistical macho romp in a world gone mad in the vein of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005R2IS">Mad Max</a>.  Instead, it is a thoughtful meditation on how communities define ourselves, even if your only friend is a dog.  Although the director flinches at the uncompromising ending that could have been (and is on the two-disc special edition), I Am Legend is a serious entry in both science fiction movies and Will Smith's string of blockbusters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>The third adaptation of Richard Matheson's apocalyptic novel (behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>), "I Am Legend" is a a fine film that features great chills, thrilling action sequences, and fine-but-uneven storytelling. Will Smith gives a terrific performance as Robert Neville, and does a good job of carrying this movie on his own for more than half its length. While the end might seem disjointed from the rest of the film, it is still very fascinating, leaving one to ponder the possibilities.<br />The DVD comes with terrific picture and sound, and some good extras. The alternate theatrical cut of the film is basically the same except for the ending, which is weaker than the other one. Overall, this is a fine film that fans of action/horror films will enjoy.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>This seems like the last HD-DVD to be issued by Warners since they'll be pulling the plug as of June.  Too bad because this disc boasts superb visuals & sound.  Smith should have been at least nominated for a Golden Globe or Oscar but I guess the committees don't appreciate good sci-fi. This film is superior to the 1971 version with Charlton Heston (RIP). If any of you still have a HD-DVD, do get this one before Warners withdraws its HD version from the catalog. Have already seen the Blu-ray version from Netflix and there's no difference. Also the alternate ending is interesting but implausible so stick with the theatrical version!!</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Director Francis Lawrence deserves a standing ovation for portraying such haunting images of a deserted Manhattan, its streets and thoroughfares overgrown with weeds and teaming with wild life.  A desolate Times Square long silenced into decay and deterioration has real impact on the viewer.  These images, combined with an exceptional performance by Will Smith, make I AM LEGEND a haunting, yet ultimately satisfying, experience.<br /><br />Smith, with the help of a German Shepherd, aptly carries this movie by himself.  I've seen this actor in numerous films, and in my opinion he's never been better.  The viewer shares Smith's range of emotions--from his determination to eradicate a deadly virus that has decimated the human population, to his fear and terror of the mutated zombies who survived the infection, to his grief over the loss of his family. . .to his utter loneliness and despair.  Intermingled with flashbacks depicting the once-promising virus (a cure for cancer) unleashed in New York, Lawrence and Smith convey a story that systematically builds tension and delivers suspense right to its tragic end.<br /><br />My biggest complaint (and it didn't take away from my enjoyment of this film) had to do with the cartoonish appearance of the zombies.  Bald, charcoal-colored, hairless, shirtless, these monsters with super-human strength and athleticism looked like they belonged in a video game, not a motion picture.  One can only wonder how much more real and convincing this story would have been had real actors been used. . .<br /><br />Regarding the special features of this two-disc set, the first disc includes four animated short features depicting other survivors coping with loneliness and/or despair in other parts of the world--and all four include some very disturbing images.  The second disc is another version of the entire film, featuring what is dubbed a "controversial ending."  Having viewed it, I am so glad the theatrical release ended the way it did, as the alternate ending was over the top--way too much of a "feel good" ending, and not in keeping with the post-apocalyptic theme of the story.  And for a plethora of extra features and segments the viewer is advised to insert Disc #2 into his/her PC and go online--something that is above and beyond the call of duty of at least this couch potato.  Setting these drawbacks aside, I AM LEGEND is recommended viewing, a haunting story of loneliness, tension, and heart-pounding suspense.<br />--D. Mikels, Author The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>This movie is sad. Very sad. And isolating. That's what you feel almost throughout. Every time Will kept trying to convince himself he'd be alright walking through the halls of an empty store, pretending to pay for things while he was ultimately alone (minus his dog), I initially thought it was strange. Then, that strangeness turned out to be very, very testing later on.<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't excited to see this movie. I didn't really hear  much about it specifically which was great. But my brother rented it so when we finally got it, I saw the back. There were "zombies" there and I wasn't really up for it. Not scared just totally not interested.<br /><br />And then I watched. It was alright. In the beginning. But as it progressed and I digested what was going on I was amazed, captivated and totally down and out for him and his situation.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't see how anyone could turn there head and say this movie "was alright" or "it sucked". But then I think and know that people have their own opinions...<br /><br />For those who have yet to see it, see it. It's fabulous. I know I didn't really say much about the movie but it's interesting. The storyline is good and the characters decent. But it's mostly Will. That's what you see: Will. Every day.

Unfortunately, it goes seriously awry in the second half. It's hard to believe as you watch this film unravel from near masterpiece to typical Hollywood action fare.<br /><br />The film is interesting and entertaining to a point, it just has a very unsatisfying ending and it could have used some narration. The narration could have helped explain some things going on, like where are the generators for electricity you have in your house and what is that stuff he poured on his steps etc.etc. etc.?! The CGI creatures are not all that convincing, but I could have lived with that had the film followed the original story. This could have been one of the best Sci-Fi films in history, but it's destined to be forgotten. I think the 'The Omega Man' despite it's flaws is a better film and 'The Last Man On Earth' is too, at least those films had some guts!<br /><br />To make matters worse, the two disc edition is terrible! The only extra feature you get is an alternate version of the movie which is only the last few minutes. The alternate ending is not as good as the theatrical one, but strangely enough both versions have some good points and some really bad ones.

All of the original's deeper underlying meanings are still there, buried in the actions and expressions of the transfigured creatures Smith does his best to avoid, but without a big reveal to lay all the cards on the table they're too easily shrugged off or overlooked altogether. That positions this as, basically, a hybrid summer blockbuster / suspense-laden monster movie with a better than usual premise. In this role it fares well - Smith portrays the terrifying isolation of the last sane man on Earth with passion and depth, leaving memories of his less-inspired earlier work far in the past. He's come a long way from Independence Day or even Hancock, and surprisingly little of that has the more stern-faced, serious script to thank. Legend's computer effects are a different story: while exceptional at rendering an overgrown, deserted NYC skyline, they feel excessive and overwhelming when it come to the creatures themselves. Though it may not live up to the lofty expectations of its namesake, this is hardly a complete write-off. In fact, as mass market action pictures go it's unusually smart, expertly paced and generally contemplative. A pity it didn't have the balls to stick with that original ending, though, as I think it would have been much more universally appreciated.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Emma Thompson has got a lot to answer for, what with her first juking the world with her "Erm, I say, I may have the cure for cancer" revelation, except that her vaccine instead transforms most of the world's populace into savage zombie creatures. This makes it a rather monumental oopsie. Anyway, that's it for Emma Thompson, whose early cameo establishes the post-apocalyptic premise. She's never seen again in this film. But she's done enough.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND is the third film adapting Richard Matheson's classic horror story, although, far as I'm concerned, no one yet's come close to doing justice to the novel. In terms of how it stacks up against the previous two adaptations, I prefer I AM LEGEND over THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston) but not over THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with a fantastic Vincent Price). Will Smith's performance is top notch. Respecting the bleak tone of the movie, Smith stays away from his trademark touches of humor. Instead, Smith delivers one of his strongest performances, plays up his terrific knack for garnering the movie audiences' sympathy. With expressions of despair and horror perpetually etched on his features, Smith humanizes the hell out of his character.<br /><br />Films like this underscore just how fragile and ephemeral society can be. You topple the infrastructure and break society's contract, and where are we? A palpable sense of desolation, this disquieting thing, shoots thru you as you take in scenes of a deserted New York City. The story picks up there three years after Emma Thompson's cataclysmic bungle. We meet virologist Dr. Robert Neville, the city's (and maybe the world's) last surviving human - as he and his dog Sam tool around the empty, weedy streets in a sports car. In the intervening years - or, as I'm wont to call it, the Post-Emma Thompson Age - Neville has grown strange and a bit mad. Loneliness will do that, and as well that nagging sense that you may be the last left of your kind. Neville, who is immune to the monster-making virus, has never stopped his efforts to unearth a cure, conducting experiments in his basement laboratory. Every day he wakes up and goes about his daily routine. H exercises. He frequents the local video store (in which he'll socialize with mannequins he'd clothed). When the sun reaches its zenith, he waits at the sea port hoping against hope to rendezvous with other survivors. He occasionally hunts for game (wild life, CG-rendered, now dot the cityscape). He's home before dark, barricading his sunlit house with heavy steel shutters. And, after dark, the monsters come out. Maybe the film's most harrowing moment, and the most heartbreaking, is when we glimpse Neville, weapon in hand, and his dog Sam cowering in the bathtub as terrible noises from the outside bombard their ears. The fear is palpable.<br /><br />Dr. Robert Neville has been in a rut, and it takes two game-changing events to flip the scenario. The first event shatters his spirits. The second one heralds the arrival of a woman named Anna (the gorgeous Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan, both of whom have listened to Neville's recorded daily radio brodasts and decided to take a chance. At this juncture, Will Smith's acting chops come into play again as his character demonstrates the jarring awkwardness and confusion one goes thru when introduced to company after having been alone for so long. Anna and Ethan serve to regalvanize the plot, toss it down a new direction.<br /><br />The zombies - or Dark Seekers - up the jeopardy by proving to have more game than just skittering around, biting human flesh. One particular zombie exhibits a measure of cunning and, in fact, turns the tables on Neville, and does this in a deliberately ironic way. The one knock against these zombies is that the CG rendering is just a hair off. The film's third act, in fact, is just a hair off as things degenerate into a series of garden variety action sets. Still, for what Will Smith brings to the table and for several impactful scenes which really resonate, I AM LEGEND is worth your time.<br /><br />In the "Ain't Nepotism Grand?" Department, Will Smith's real life daughter, Willow, plays Neville's daughter in all those flashbacks.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This film starts out with great promise, with WS as a lone man in a world of chaos.  He is hunting, through the streets of Manhattan, for food and uninfected humans, all the while working on a vaccine for the bio-engineered virus that has more of less destroyed humanity.  WS is convincing as an anguished, intelligent man, who is struggling with his isolation, though his dog is a vital companion.  With flashbacks and preserved video cuts, past history becomes clear:  WS was an army scientist who is the only person to understand the vaccine, which is what makes him immune to the disease of the savages who come out at night.  He has lost his family, understands what has happened to the world and what needs to be done, and has a charismatic strength of character.<br /><br />So far so good.  You see WS suffer and think as well as act with the decisiveness you would expect from a hero.  There are many excellent details, such as the relationship with his dog or his golfing off the wing of a grounded jet fighter.  It is vivid and beautiful, completely believable.<br /><br />However, once the night bad guys come to the fore, the film begins to falter.  First, the night baddies are simply not well executed technically:  they don't look real, so you can't believe in them; as one reviewer noted, they look too much like video game characters.  We expect better in computer animation, I'm sorry.  Second, from an introspective survivor film, you get grotesquely violent action.  Not only is the plot unrealistic - the baddies have not discovered him until the night he is rescued by an immune woman and then they come in force - but the action is kind of ridiculous:  the baddies seem invulnerable, though they have lost their human intelligence as they transformed into hairless half-dogs and behave as if they have rabies.  They are seeking human flesh and seem to have some kind of hive mind, like an insect society, but none of the promising threads are developed into plot and theme.  There is not even enough to enable the thoughtful viewer to connect the dots, which is another indispensable component to great scifi.<br /><br />That being said, I am quite a sucker for these end-of-humanity films.  This one got me to believe, at least for the first half.  It is a mistake to have made it into an action film in the end, though WS is a good action hero.  WS' role is more dramatic than his usual roles, more complex as a character and not at all happygolucky as we expect of the fresh prince.  He is a good actor and did well here, but the script and direction  take it over the top.<br /><br />Recommended, but not with much enthusiasm.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>This film is 'I Am Legend' in name only, it bears very little relation to the book of the same name. This aside, it is a fairly good movie with post apocalyptic themes and a storyline that will keep you interested for the 96 minutes duration. Will Smith plays the role of the relationship starved army medical researcher well. You really feel for him when he talks to mannequins and at his relationship with his dog. The action is pretty good, although the computer graphics left a lot to be desired, both the various animals and the 'dark seekers' seemed very dated compared to other computer graphics films. This is an OK film, that should keep you watching until the end. As long as you don't expect a faithful rendering of the book you should be fine. Watch it with an open mind and you'll get what it sets out to be, an action film that shows another side of Will's acting and how one copes on his own in a world where everyone else is dead! The extras on the second disc are OK, but nowhere near as extensive as other films out there. A solid three star film.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie was interesting, with a kind of science-fiction twist on the vampire/zombie/undead genre mixed in with plague. I wanted to enjoy this movie and I did in some parts, but honestly, the writing could be better. Will Smith does a decent job, so thumbs-up for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>Note: This is a remake of the Charlton Heston film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>.<br /><br />In 2009 a researcher develops a genetically modified virus that can cure cancer. Unfortunately, the virus undergoes its own mutations and becomes a lethal killer that wipes out 90% of Earth's population. 1% of the population is immune to the virus, and others, though not completely immune, are not killed, but undergo biological changes into light-hating, carnivorous semi-humans.<br /><br />By 2012 cities are being taken over by wildlife, and the human race is on the brink of extinction. Will Smith is Robert Neville, a US Army Colonel engaged in biomedical research that may produce a cure for the mutated virus. He lives alone in NYC which was ground zero for the mutated viral outbreak.<br /><br />Smith is free to roam the city by day, but has to barricade himself into his home each night. HIs only companion is his dog. Smith tries trial after trial, and as failure after failure racks up he slowly loses more of his grip on reality.<br /><br />This is a fine thriller, but I have to admit that the movie comes across as part suspense, and part horror, and I don't care for horror films.<br /><br />The movie's premis is engaging, and Smith does a good job pulling off his role. I even liked the ending.<br /><br />All in all this is a pretty good show, but not for kids!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>We've seen a lot of films that take place in a post apocalyptic future, and of those films, many open by telling us that government, civilization, and humanity in general collapsed because of a viral outbreak. This plot device is used once again in "I Am Legend," a science fiction thriller that would be far less impressive if an epidemic was all that the plot had to go on. In all honesty, the plot isn't all that interesting or original; this is the fourth film adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, the first three being 1964's "The Last Man on Earth," 1971's "The Omega Man," and 2007's direct to video "I Am Omega." For this newest adaptation, the casting of Will Smith is what made it work, especially since he had to act by himself for most of the film. He plays an intelligent, driven, and desperate character, a man whose isolating circumstances have driven him to emotional extremes. Some extremes almost come off as funny, in a pathetic sort of way.<br /><br />Yes, I can praise Smith a great deal for this role. The story, on the other hand, is generally entertaining but not entirely successful, especially as it nears the end; at that point, it relies too much on the clich&eacute;s of hope, loss, and redemption in the midst of frightening special effects. This isn't to say that the film doesn't work altogether--the first three-quarters of "I Am Legend" are surprisingly strong, not only because of Smith's performance, but also because of the way it builds tension. The story functions under the premise of a cure for cancer that was introduced in 2009, only to mutate into an infection. By the year 2012, ninety percent of the planet's population is dead. Of the remaining ten percent, less than one percent is immune to the virus--everyone else has been transformed into a vampire-like flesh eater. Nothing is ever mentioned about garlic or wooden stakes, but it is known that exposure to sunlight is fatal for these things.<br /><br />This is the horrible future in which we find Robert Neville (Smith), a sole-surviving military scientist who struggles to exist in an empty, decimated New York City. When he's not gathering basic supplies, hunting loose herds of deer with his beloved dog, Sam, or protecting himself from hordes of mutant vampires, he's trying to discover a cure in a makeshift lab in his basement. Because he's immune, his blood serves as a possible way to produce a cure. The ironic implications of that are too clever to overlook: Blood may in fact be the key to ridding the infected of their thirst for blood. But irony is not what this film is about; at its heart, "I Am Legend" is about loneliness, guilt, and paranoia, all of which come into perspective during flashback sequences involving Neville and his family. Piece by piece, the fates of his wife, Zoe (Salli Richardson), and daughter, Marley (Willow Smith), are revealed, as are the facts of how Manhattan Island was quarantined.<br /><br />Neville's memories are second only to his emotional well-being, which is barely hanging on by a thread. He tries to maintain his sanity by (1) keeping a video diary of his scientific research, and (2) sending out a radio message to anyone who might be alive and in need of shelter. But his sanity may be slipping. Early on, he enters a video store that not only has a fine selection of DVDs, but also a number of strategically placed mannequins. He speaks to them as if they were real people. He also avoids some out of nervousness; he just can't bring himself to strike up a conversation with the pretty female mannequin in back of the store. Here's a scene that appears light-hearted and funny but is actually quite serious. Simply put, loneliness can make a person do some strange things. And consider the moment he returns to the video store--he finally does approach the female mannequin to say, "I promised my friend I'd say hello to you. Hello." Now with tears in his eyes, he says, "Please say hello to me. Please. Say hello to me."<br /><br />This is the kind of depth that can mean the difference between a compelling film and an unimaginative rehash. Most of "I Am Legend" is a well-structured character study, highlighted by palpable levels of suspense, drama, and fright. It isn't until the final twenty minutes that the film loses some steam, turning a fascinating story into a run of the mill creature feature. It begins with the introduction of two immune humans: a young woman named Anna (Alice Braga) and a boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan). Anna believes that a survivor's colony exists, not because she's actually seen it, but because God told her so. This, of course, brings out the worst in Neville, who has not only lost his faith, but also his willingness to leave New York--"This is Ground Zero," he says. "I can fix this." Despite his daily radio message, his years of isolation have left him unable to interact with other people, least of all with Anna.<br /><br />And that's when the vampire mutants attack, infiltrating Neville's fortress/house in a final showdown. I obviously can't say how everything ends, but I can say that it isn't all that surprising given the kind of movie this wants to be. I won't go so far as to say that the ending doesn't work, but I do think it could have worked better, especially since the rest of the film was so much more effective. For the most part, "I Am Legend" is an above average thriller, with a tense opening that quietly plays itself out. I'm recommending this movie despite some structural and narrative flaws; on the whole, it's still an engaging, taut, emotionally charged thriller, one of the better ones of recent memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Not a seasonal pick-me-upper.  Despite that it ends on a reasonably upbeat note, this film is distressing and difficult to watch.  Another in a string of apocalyptic fear-based family films, the cure for cancer has had an undesired side effect and wiped out the human population.  One man and his dog remain to combat this grave twist of events.  As if the setup of dwindling life isn't bleak enough, the solitary life of Smith's character and the daily effort to survive while seeking a cure creates some heart stopping moments and really creepy psychological provocations.  I went into this film assuming Smith would hold his usual action hero poise, and he does to some degree.  While he is a wonderful action hero in his career, Smith is at core a gifted dramatic actor and that talent comes through in this role.  The usual running scenes, blazing fires and such abound, but they are rooted in an emotional backstory that helps viewers to understand the main character's motivations.  In that light the story is very well-rounded.  Viewers receive the action-packed thriller laced with some fairly intense emotional scenes.  Then begins the second half.<br /><br />The scariest part of this film is the deserted streets of NYC.  All in all the film is well done, acting, direction...  but something about it was really off for me, which I can only assume was the writing.  Smith spends a lot of screen time alone and despite the challenge of having to hold the momentum of the story solo, he pulls it off.  I can't in any way fault him for my feeling that the film was incomplete.  It moves very slowly, adrenaline its only initiator of plot movement in some cases.  I do like that the writing showed the main character's struggle to remain sane under such circumstances.  Most often our end of days films focus more on the hero's feats than his assured flaws.  Still, there were such leaps in the plot that I was unconvinced of the direction it took.  The finale, though realistically suited to the story, felt rushed, thus lacking.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>I love Will Smith and have always enjoyed his films. So, when I heard he was doing this remake of the book, "I Am Legend", Richard Matheson's masterpiece of horror, I could not wait to see the film. Having already seen the two prior adaptations, "The Omega Man", starring Charlton Heston,  and "The Last Man on Earth", starring Vincent Price, I looked forward to seeing what this remake would bring to the table.<br /><br />This is an interesting adaptation of the book in many ways, capturing the essence of despair, loneliness, and hope that runs through the book and transferring it successfully to film.  Here, Will Smith is cast as Robert Neville, a military scientist who finds that he is immune to the virus that has run amok and globally killed off most of the population or turned them into vampire-like killers who dwell in the dark, coming out only at night where they prowl the earth seeking other living creatures to nosh on.<br /><br />Robert Neville seems to be the only human being left in New York City. Coming out by day with his beloved dog, Sam, which is his only companion, Neville hunts for food and necessities, taking care to get home before night fall. He lives in solitary splendor in his town house in Washington Square Park, where he struggles to find a cure for the virus in hopes of restoring humanity to those rabid creatures that were once human and now prowl the earth at night.<br /><br />The bleak landscape of a New York City that is  ravaged by the changes is compelling, and Smith, as Neville, does exude that pathos of a man who has nearly lost all hope. His attempts at communicating with other human beings that have not been transformed by the virus are touching, especially so when we see how he longs for interaction with others like himself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film becomes undone by too much reliance on computer generated monsters, failing to realize that less is sometimes more.  Instead, the special effects render the second half of the film to something that one would see in a video game. Consequently, I found myself hoping that the end of the film would soon arrive.<br /><br />While I did enjoy the film overall, it was, ultimately, disappointing, as my expectations were so high. It is unfortunate that the powers that be were so enamored of the special effects that they were unable to show some restraint. What was potentially a filmmaking masterpiece turned into a film that was simply a contender, despite Will Smith's excellent performance. In the end, it was a performance that was overshadowed by the filmmaker's excess.</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>(Spoilers involving the book "I Am Legend" lie ahead)<br /><br />There is something about post-apocalyptic tales and zombie horrors that fascinate us and draw us in.<br /><br />This is a taut and fairly suspenseful scifi/horror film that kept my attention. It is better than what I expected. When I learned that Hollywood was doing a film of my favorite vampire story (the third film version so far based on Richard Matheson's gripping novella), I winced and groaned. They'll ruin it, I thought. Well, the film is not bad. That being said, it's not excellent either.<br /><br />The digital zombies are just that. Digital-looking, if you get my meaning. Why do so many CGI monsters look unrealistic? I can't put my finger on it. Could be skin tones, or a certain lifelessness in the eyes, or the way they move? Hard to pinpoint. But these rabid monsters were cumbersome looking. They were loud and big, but not frightening enough for me. I felt half the time like I was watching a video game. The closeups especially were awful, reminding you that this face was created on a laptop by some guy with orange Cheese Doodle grit all over his fingers. And yet the zombie lab rats (and the zombie dogs in the city) were freaky scary. Go figure.<br /><br />There are some positive things about the movie. Silences instead of musical score accentuate the suspense; particularly in scenes such as when Robert Neville is looking for his dog Sam in some creepy, dark rooms. Incidental music would possibly have taken away from the feeling of dread in sequences like that. I liked the quiet. It was scary and tense.<br /><br />The movie doesn't become too much of a zombie flick; it remains more of a character study involving a man who has passed the edge of sanity but is fighting hard to crawl back. Will Smith is good, as usual. I don't think there's much he couldn't do as an actor.<br /><br />There's very little handheld, 'cinema verite' style camera work, I am happy to report. Lately a few horror movies are copying the visual style of The Blair Witch Project.<br /><br />There will be people who see this film and want to bury it in their back yard or hide it in the freezer along with Bambi, Charlotte's Web, and Old Yeller. I just hope they do not dismiss this film simply because it is realistic and sometimes sad. Those who have seen the movie know what I am referring to. I must confess that I had tears in my eyes at one point. Luckily the scene was handled very discreetly; but any way you do it, it's still heartbreaking.<br /><br />This is a loose interpretation of the book. People looking for a faithful adaptation will be sour after seeing this. After I read the book (many moons ago) I had it in my mind as a movie. It was so involving and scary. There was a scene in the book in which Robert Neville is driving home in the late afternoon and discovers that his wristwatch has stopped, and dusk is fast approaching. I was on the edge of my seat. Would he make it home safely before they came out of their hiding places? Good stuff. This sequence, unfortunately, was foolishly and sadly left out of this film. Heaven knows why. I was hoping it would be included. Hollywood seldom gets it right.<br /><br />Bottom line: the film isn't atrocious. I enjoyed it because I didn't compare it too much to its source material. I would call it more thriller than outright horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>I AM LEGEND is a sci-fi disaster film that is another attempt at adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel back in the early `50's. The first adaptation being "The Last Man on Earth" (1964) with Vincent Price and the cheesy but entertaining "Omega Men" (1971) with Charlton Heston. Being a remake, "I am Legend" leaves a lot to be desired with the unpredictability factor. However, with the current evolution in CGI effects, expectations would be high. "Legend" is the one version bestowed with a huge budget.<br /><br />A cure for cancer based on the Measles virus of old has achieved partial success. While it does cure the lethal disease, it was one side effect; it mutates human beings into vampire-like creatures that feed on human flesh. Military scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith) is left alone in New York with only a German Shepherd for company, for 3 years he has been looking for a cure but to no avail. Slowly, he is starting to give in to the pressure of being alone and hopelessness begins to sink in. Now, as new survivors surface, Neville is caught by surprise and finds a struggle within himself to remain optimistic in finding a cure or wonder if the human race has been snuffed out for good.<br /><br />The direction by Francis Lawrence (Constantine) is competent enough to handle this kind of project. The first half of the film shows Neville and his dog, Sam in their daily routine. They try to battle boredom and mental collapse by hunting deers, driving around the "ghost city" looking for supplies and even renting videos, hitting golf balls off the East River. It was smart for the director to establish a rendezvous point for potential survivors alongside the river at noon everyday. Neville's loneliness is also emphasized that he has set up a certain spot where he had arranged mannequins as an attempt to simulate a crowd. It was very considerate of the director to consider certain emotions that can creep in when one is isolated in large Empty City with certain creatures lurking in the night. Along with the very delicate link of sanity Neville has to his dog, one can wonder how long a man left alone can last. Certain situation studies have been explored before in films such as "Castaway". Luckily, Neville has more company with a dog than just a volleyball, the dog certainly had more charisma than "Wilson the volleyball". The past is also shown in flashbacks as to what happened to Neville and New York.<br /><br />The film's success also depends on how good the performance is of the lead actor. Will Smith has definitely matured as an actor since his days in "Fresh Prince". Smith's performance is pretty solid as the lead; while he mostly plays a reactionary role, he manages to express the needed emotions in the sequences that I felt his fears, thoughts and loneliness. Sure, there is still the usual snappy charisma that has become his trademark but he manages to sidestep that image and pulls off a very good performance.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect. There is a HUGE plot hole in the beginning of the last act, Neville's meeting with a survivor seemed so convenient that it's almost far-fetched. The "Dark Seekers" have that charcoaled-grayish-dehydrated look that seemed a little fake. (I thought I was watching a Pang Bros. Horror flick for a moment). Thankfully, the characteristics of the creatures are more interesting; they are stronger and faster than the zombies in 28 DAYS LATER, and to make things worst for Neville, they are a lot smarter. This intelligence was displayed with their observance of a "pack leader" and the ability to learn and imitate what they have seen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film didn't have the guts to follow through with its dark premise of pure despair of a lonely man in large city. It opted to settle for the usual heroics and while the film did have some emotional and intense sequences that redeemed it, it went on the direction of faith and Catholicism. While there may be nothing wrong in trying to emphasize human optimism and belief in a higher power, the conclusion was a little less satisfying and quite frankly, it collapsed in its predictability. "I Am Legend" carried a lot of potential but ultimately, it stumbles halfway through and lacked a very powerful climax. I am sad to say it fell just a little short of its truly majestic vision.<br /><br />Recommended! For Sci-fi fans  [3 ?

This time Mr. Smith stars as Robert Neville, a US military scientist who helped create a virus-based vaccine against cancer that ends up becoming contagious, spreading to the entire human population, killing of 90% of humans, and turning most of the survivors into cannibalistic, light-hating creatures; i.e. vampire - zombies called Darkseekers.  Most of the movie takes place in New York City, specifically in Neville's town home, and in the streets and buildings of Manhattan.<br /><br />The drawbacks of the movie are primarily in the plot; specifically there are some very dumb scenes.  Probably the biggest is the lack of firepower wielded by Dr. Neville.  We learn in the movie that Dr. Neville happens to be an Army officer.  We also see that Dr. Neville has been living alone in NYC for several years, often fighting of Darkseekers.  Dr. Neville also has a lot of time every single day to drive thru the city, stop of at music and DVD stores to "rent" movies and CD's, arrange various store mannequins to provide him "company", play golf, and chase animals that have escaped from the local zoos.  Yet in the entire movie, Dr. Neville has only three guns on him, an automatic rifle, and two handguns.  For someone living in a city full of zombies that want to eat him, who has military training, and who has a lot of time to acquire firearms in a city that must be full of gun shops, I would think Dr. Neville would be loaded with guns.  In the final scene when the Darkseekers storm his house, he uses a grand total of 1 gun with 1 clip, and 1 grenade.  This is preposterous.  I would have hundreds of firearms in that house, several per room, with lots of ammunition clips around.<br /><br />A second stupid scene in the movie is when Dr. Nevill falls into the Darkseekers' trap and gets strung up by his leg.  For a sober Army officer to fall into such a simple trap is ludicrous and mind-boggling.<br /><br />Probably the dumbest part of the movie is why doesn't Dr. Neville start demolishing the hiding places of the Darkseekers.  He clearly knows how to construct and use explosives, as shown in the movie's climax.  And he clearly has the time to do this, so why does he not start blowing up various dark spots throughout the city as a way of clearing out the Darkseekers?<br /><br />So all in all, this is a movie with a great premise and good acting, but some big plot holes that lead to very stupid scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>If even something is great in this movie it's a character's (Will Smith's own?) muscular body.<br /><br />A completely illogical film of a scientist having survived the virus transforming people into flash-eating zombies has climaxed into him becoming a world saviour by donating his own healing blood upon being consumed by these mutants.<br /><br />I prefer New York City in its glory rather than mutilated post-apocalypse rubbish-side of dementia-suffering nightmares.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q04XXGGED746.html">A3Q04XXGGED746</a><br/><p>Imagine going everywhere you used to go to, and never encounter another living human.

Mediocre reviews still couldn't keep me from seeing the very reliable Will Smith in a genre that I love. I got the 2-disc "Special Edition" at a good price. There aren't a whole lot of extras for a 2-disc version, but the 2nd disc is the Unrated Theatrical Edition. Mr. Smith is good, and the premise is certainly intriguing, though not terribly original. I was more entertained by "Night of the Comet". Still, magnificent special effects and sound effects, and steady direction by Francis Lawrence, made this enjoyable for me. I like sci-fi, and  enjoy a good "light-show" on occasion. Smith's character is most empathetic, and the brief appearance of Alice Braga is sweet in the midst of chaos.  I didn't look for flaws; rather, enjoyed a fun (?) film made with flair and care.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>When it comes to remakes of films I've always liked, I generally have very low expectations. This one, of course, is a remake of _The Omega Man_ (the only good film Charlton Heston ever made, in my opinion), which was based on the novel by Richard Matheson -- also one of my favorites. (The version meant to star Schwarzenegger fell through before completion.) And there was a terrible version starring Vincent Price called _The Last Man on Earth._ Also, Will Smith, who is actually a pretty good actor, had already appeared in _I, Robot,_ one of the worst films ever based on a classic science fiction story. So, would this attempt be any better?<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that, while this version of one of the best "zombie" yarns ever written has significant differences from both the book and the Heston movie, it's a very good piece of work taken on its own. Smith is Robert Neville, an army researcher involved in developing the genetically mutated virus that brings an end to cancer as it spreads. Unfortunately, it mutates farther than intended and kills off ninety percent of the world's population. Of the survivors, another few percent become inhuman "Dark Seekers" and kill off all the others. Neville is one of only a handful of naturally immune individuals. And while cooped up in his house on Washington Square, trying desperately to find a cure for the plague he helped cause, he's going slowly and quietly insane. And when night comes, the windows are shuttered and the doors bolted because the Infected will be coming out to hunt. Smith plays the role with considerable power and believability. The camera work and the sets are excellent, and the screenplay is first-rate. One of the best horror films I've seen in awhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>In "I Am Legend" the apocalypse has hit the world, a man-made virus intended for good, intended to cure cancer, but gone horribly awry.  On a planet now populated by hordes of mutated, vampire-like victims of the plague, a surviving military scientist (Will Smith, in his best performance), somehow immune to the disease, works in a fortified house to find a cure, walking the city with his canine companion in search of specimens to test various experimental treatments on, and in search for survivors.<br /><br />  He's set up a radio transmitter that sends out messages on all frequencies urging any other survivors to meet him at a certain time and place to band together, but day after day, year after year, he finds no one there to meet him.  Interspersed with the post-apocalyptic time frame we see frequent flashbacks showing the early days when the 'cure' was going wrong, and global panic was breaking out.  The plague victims are nightmarish creatures, shirking from the sun, ravenous, violent and mindless.  During the nights the doctor barricades himself and his companion inside the house, but the ghastly creatures are out there, always.  It's a bleak world being presented, but done well.  I've noted before that 'bleak' is among the hardest moods to do right in a movie, but I Am Legend does it brilliantly.  Part of it is that the grim mood is punctuated by touches of the idyllic: the abandoned city beginning to look alive again as all this beautiful greenery creeps in, deer bounding about...but there's nothing idyllic or peaceful once you get into the shadows where the creatures dwell.  One of the creatures, in particular, is especially disturbing: he seems much smarter than the others, seems angrier than the others, and the others are starting to follow his lead.<br /><br />  **WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />  Eventually, Smith's character does come across another survivor, two actually: a woman and her little boy.  Instead of just relief, tension soon follows.  Smith has by this point become utterly defeated psychologically and spiritually - he no longer believes there's any hope of his finding a way of reversing the mutation, he's lost faith in just about everything, and he reacts with disbelief and almost anger as she claims God guided her to him, and her claims that an entire colony of survivors is out there waiting for them.<br /><br />  Where the movie goes from here I'll refrain from hinting at, but it continues developing.  A lot of what happens in the latter parts are highly interpretative, and fascinating.  The movie does miss a couple of opportunities, and is a bit slow in places, but those minor hindrances are blown away by the overall power of the movie.  Emotional, at times frightening, at times spiritual, boasting great cinematography and great performances from a cast that has some very demanding material, I Am Legend is among the top movies of 2007.  9/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>When it came out there was a great advertising and promotion campaign. Yet it did not fulfill its promises. One more survival film, you will say. Maybe but I am afraid it is more serious than that. One more epidemic film. Yes for sure, but yet it is deeper than that. One more zombie and living dead film then. Absolutely, but the disappointment comes from farther than that. The film uses three very common forms and it could have intertwined them and twisted them in a new creative way. But with one character and a dog, you do not go that far. In fact it is the whole argument of Stephen King's The Stand. The super flu, the dying of everyone, the survival of a few. But Stephen King remains human and the two antagonistic camps are human survivors and then they represent the two opposite impulses of the human species: to fight and kill to survive against others, and to organize collectively to survive with others. In this film the survivors are good humans and all the others are bad mutants. Badness in man is thus not human but antihuman. That is very na?ve indeed, especially when we understand the epidemic was caused by the irresponsible experiments of one doctor on thousands of people with genetically manipulated viruses. It is this vision of good humans attacked from outside by some who are no longer human at all that makes the film poor and even weak. Evil is not outside. Evil is inside. Anyone who says the reverse is just a blind man. Then the plot is no plot because we know what it is going to be. There is no surprise and no psychological death. And the dramatic events here and there are defused by too much disbelief to suspend. How did the woman arrive in Manhattan, how did she escape the house, how did she drive out of Manhattan, how did she know where to go? And many other questions like those. Then the legend becomes a fable and a weak one at that. Too bad because the theme could have been better and the author behind, Matheson, is supposed to be better than that.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>Will Smith is one of the greatest Actors of our generation."I am Legend"should have been the film that got him the awards he deserves,but its not the one,even though you are interested in the movie mostly because of him.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>4.5 stars.  Now this is entertainment.  Will Smith carries this suspenseful film effortlessly.  I know many have complained about its CGI, but I actually found the vampire characters quite scary and believable.  I'm not sure whether it was explained how Fred the mannequin was removed from store or why the vampire population weren't turning on themselves for food.  Some of the plotlines were predictable but it doesn't mean they weren't still effective.  Losing Sam caused a lump to swell in my throat.  The thought of being completely and utterly alone was a bit much to wrap my brain around.  My problem with the film was the same as most: the ending.  The decision seemed so abrupt.  If the tunnel was strong enough to withstand the blast then it was strong enough for him to hunker in and wait until morning to leave with the woman and child.  Still this was a highly entertaining film.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>As I viewed this film, it quickly become clear to me that two very different themes are being explored by director Francis Lawrence in this film, one that works and one that does not:<br /><br />The first, more wide-reaching theme, is the fate of the human race, which Robert Neville (Will Smith) is working desperately to save throughout the movie.  I can't tell you the state of humanity at the end of the film without spoiling some things, but suffice it to say that there is a good chance you will feel a bit let down by the lack of resolution to this theme.<br /><br />The theme that works quite well, however, is how Neville copes with being the "last man on Earth".  His internal struggles and outward devices (such as talking to mannequins, for instance) that he uses to keep some semblance of his sanity are intriguing, and Smith is a well-rounded enough actor to portray the wide variety of emotions his character must express.<br /><br />Overall, then, this is a decent enough film (worth a rent), but lacks enough of a payoff in the end to be considered a real classic.  I found this film to be much in the vein of J.J. Abram's recent hit "Cloverfield", where little to nothing is explained or expanded on...viewers are just supposed to live in the moment.  Yet, with the way that Neville's family is developed in this film (unlike the anonymous characters of Cloverfield), I think that the lack of a conclusive ending was more apparent.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I Am Legend brings to the screen the story of what appears to be the sole healthy survivor of a human-evoked biological catastrophe who spends the remainder of his life searching for a cure during the day and fending off the infected survivors during the night. At first it might seem like an improbable scenario, but Hollywood has been noted (surprisingly or not so surprisingly) to foresee destructive events before (e.g. Wag the Dog-instead of Albania it was Yugoslavia, The Day after Tomorrow-instead of ice it's hurricanes, Deep Impact-instead of a tidal wave hitting the USA it hits Indonesia and Sri Lanka, Outbreak-instead of the Ebola-like virus it's SARS and/or the bird flu, etc), The Island-and the real prospect of the production of human clones for `spare parts,' etc.<br />The film does a good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware that messing around with viruses and genetic engineering will sooner or later lead to a mistake that mankind will regret. It is inevitable.<br />In addition, the movie should have been rated R and not PG-13.<br />In short, Will Smith's acting, the plot, and the setting, are all very good, and I Am Legend is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!<br /><br />PS Just wondering if someone could shed some light as to whose trap he springs and falls into?</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>I Am Legend is one of the better films to come out of Hollywood in a while. It's dramatic, compelling, bizarre, and it can be rather suspenseful.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: In 2009, a virus ravaged the world and killed most of the population. There is virtually no one left except for the few people who are immune to the virus. But most of the immune were killed off by the infected. One man; Robert Neville; is the last man in Manhattan. He was a military virologist when the outbreak occurred, now he lives in Manhattan with a German shepherd named Samantha, trying to survive and find a cure for the virus and see if there is anyone else left alive.<br />MUSIC: The music is good, especially considering the guy who did this film's music also did the music for The Happening.<br />COMPELLING FACTOR: This film isn't exactly action-oriented, but it is rather great at setting the stage for suspense and dramatic, depressing moments.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: If you're hoping for an action-packed film you're not going to get one. This film is more focused on story and characters than action. It is a compelling movie that is worthy of a purchase. If you easily get bored of movies, you probably won't like this one, but give it a try.<br />OVERALL: There were parts of the movie that got boring, that is the main flaw. But the rest of the movie is superbly executed and creates a dramatic, compelling post-apocalyptic world.<br />THE GOOD: Good storyline, cool action scenes, great characters, and good music.<br />THE BAD: Boring scenes of nothing.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>Will Smith stars yet again in another film where he battles animated creatures.  First it was runaway robots in "I Robot."  Now, it's super strong mutants, products of a cancer treatment gone horribly wrong.  The bald mutants look very similar to the robots.<br /><br />  "I Am Legend" is a remake of a remake.  The original is "The Last Man on Earth."  Made in the sixties, this film most closely resembles the novel on which it was based:  Richard Matheson's  "I Am Legend."  An airborne virus kills most of the human population which return as zombie-like vampires.  Vincent Price is Dr. Neville who's lost his family to the virus and searches for a cure while killing vampires in London.<br /><br />  In the early seventies, Charlton Heston reprises the role as Dr. Neville in "The Omega Man."  Living in Las Angeles, he also searches for a cure while killing the mutants.  Those who do not die from the germ warfare are turned into psychotic albinos who are afraid of the light.<br /><br />  Of the three movie, "The Omega Man" is superior because it has the most realistic plot and the better characterization.  The mutants are three-dimensional humans; they are not cartoon characters.  Neville has more interaction with the unaffected survivors, especially one female played by feisty Rosalind Cash.  There are also more twists and turns.  It has a delicious, downbeat ending that leaves us with a faint ray of hope for mankind.<br /><br />  In "I Am Legend," Will Smith is basically a one man show; it is him versus the cartoon characters.  The interaction between him and the dog is touching and very emotional.  However, I felt more sympathy with Vincent Price's Neville who watched his family slowly die of the plague.  He even encountered his wife's return as a vampire.<br /><br />  Overall, "I Am Legend" is entertaining and suspenseful.  However, it is a disappointment for fans of the far more superior "Omega Man."  I strongly suggest that, if you liked "I Am Legend," you obtain a copy of "The Omega Man."  You may enjoy it more.  If you are a fan of classic horror and/or Vincent Price, search out a copy of "The Last Man on Earth."</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>This movie is quite possibly the strangest one I've ever seen. I had no idea what it was about before I rented it and just got it because Will Smith was in the movie.<br />About the movie: Scientific testing supposedly cured 10,009 people of cancer. However, something in that medicine had a negative affect on these people afterwards. People started acting more like animals, killing and abusing each other for prey. Only a select few were immune to bites from this savage group and from getting the disease that swept the world. In comes Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith) who is immune to the disease but still fears for his life and that of his gorgeous German Shepherd, who is his best friend and only confidant that is alive. Both he and his dog prowl the area for surviving human beings.<br /><br />Pros: I love dogs like most humans love babies so I spent quite a bit of the time grinning and going "Aw" when the German Shepherd did cute things like not eating its vegetables or licking Smith's face. As a puppy, you could've put that dog on a postcard and framed it to your wall. The movie is definitely unique and took some great risks and a very unromantic twist about "the last man on Earth." With such a serious film, there were definitely some uncomfortable comedic scenes, like Dr. Neville being so lonely for comfort that he has now decided to holla at female mannequins. The special effects could make the average horror film phobic jump at every scene, and I enjoyed them.<br /><br />Cons: I never figured out what the purpose of the lion and deer was supposed to be, especially considering you never saw another lion in the movie again so it wasn't like the city completely turned into a jungle.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Although I'm a fan of Richard Matheson's work, I have yet to read his novel, I AM LEGEND.<br /><br />I also haven't seen the first movie version with Vincent Price called THE LAST MAN ON EARTH.  I saw the cult favorite THE OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston years and years ago but I think I'll read the book and then watch that one again.  And maybe this one again.<br /><br />This third version, thankfully keeping Matheson's great title, is well-made and entertaining but I thought the first half was stronger than the second half.  I liked Will Smith in I, ROBOT and he does a great job here as well, playing a dogged scientist hunting in an eerily empty New York City by day and searching for a cure to the plague virus by night.  (Years ago it had been announced that Arnold Schwarzenegger would play in this--imagine Dr. Arnold as a gov't scientist!)<br /><br />The zombie/vampires were creepy enough but they were obviously computer generated.  I wished there had been more personality given to them and more personal conflict between Smith and the monsters (a relationship between the lead monster and a female monster Smith abducts to experiment on is hinted at but never developed any further).<br /><br />Still, some great shots of NYC standing empty, overrun by weeds and deer.<br /><br />(Now I'll have to read the novel.  Without knowing the original story, I liked this movie version).</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Following in the apocalyptic tradition of `The Last Man on Earth' from '64 starring Vincent Price and `The Omega Man' from '71 starring Charlton Heston we now have the '07 release `I Am Legend' starring the always impressive Will Smith in the role of a man faced with the possibility of being the last human being on the face of the Earth.<br /><br />While I reward the film superior marks on the one hand for Will's performance, exceptional production values and the message imbued within the storyline delivered through the music and philosophy of Bob Marley, I also found the film very slow in unfolding. Once the action finally got into full swing and I was getting involved it abruptly ends, leaving me somewhat dissatisfied with the distinct feeling that something is missing.<br /><br />My Rating: `I Am Legend' is definitely worth a watch but I don't think it will stand up well to many repeat viewings; -3 ?

The movie is all kinds of ridiculous - in part because it holds its cards practically *inside* the vest for the opening act - and Lawrence, instead of succumbing to hubris and letting it drag on for a craptacular two-and-a-half hours (like most blockbusters these days) he ends it, mercifully, at 90 minutes. Yeah, maybe it's because the zombies look like Bat Boy from the Weekly World News, but still - brevity is a virtue.<br /><br />Stripped of all the subplots that made Richard Matheson's source novel so compelling (and the inspiration for some good films, comics, and books since its printing in the 1950s), "I Am Legend" is a vaguely intriguing "Cast Away" vehicle for Will Smith until it must deliver some action goods, which is does efficiently and without any particular rules or sense whatsoever, before closing on a old fashioned Blow Up Real Good sequence. This explosion, really, is the perfect ending for the film Lawrence actually made. Some moviegoers - who have invested far too much thought in this lame experience - prefer the "alternate ending." Not I, for reasons that simply don't matter.<br /><br />Smith is Dr. Robert Neville, the last "survivor" in New York City of a cancer vaccine gone viral. Most New Yorkers died upon contracting the illness; others mutated into rubber-faced, physically amazing zombies that hate the sunlight, even though, unlike the spiritually touched vampire, they're simply mutations, which means they'd need sunlight to...oh, never mind. If you want to believe the sun could crash into a black hole and these creatures could survive, go ahead. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman provides all of this with a somber sincerity that informs the movie's look and tone in the first half-hour; Neville and his German shepherd stalk the streets of an overgrown NYC in near silence, as Lawrence keeps the soundtrack music to a minimum. Like "Cast Away," it's compelling to hear the sounds of the world in this film. Unlike "Cast Away," it also seems like a way to blow 30 minutes without having to show those ridiculous zombies.<br /><br />So Neville's still after a cure for the mutation, and he carefully orchestrates traps so he can capture "subjects" for tests; despite the end of civilization, all of the utilities still work and the gas pumps aren't dry, so Neville uses a giant, state-of-the-art lab for his work. The zombies seem to be getting smarter, though, plotting their own revenge on the "hunter." Sandwiched in there are some flashbacks of NYC's last night as a living (and implausibly civilized) city and the fate of Neville's wife and daughter. These are effective enough, but they're also cheat, really - the movie doesn't want to give Neville the same struggle he has in the novel.<br /><br />It's right about then that Lawrence gets his hustle on; Goldsman shuttles a couple more survivors onscreen so the title can make the least bit of sense, but Neville doesn't want much to do with them. There's a raid, a showdown, and a big boom. Or, if you prefer, the alternate love-in. Blammo. Over.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>An interesting movie.

The ending is great!</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>The biggest problem with I am Legend is the same problem that Hollywood had with The Omega Man. All they have to do is to make the book from Richard Matheson into a film and don't add anything or take anything. Yet both times they have tampered with the material and both times they end up producing less than average results.<br /><br />A doctor finds himself almost alone in a city trying to find a cure for a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong turning people into starving rabid but rapid zombie-ish type creatures that run through the night killing people. The action sequences are mostly of the nightstalker hunting or cure finding sort. Lots of the time Will Smith is left talking to himself, his dog or having flashbacks before the plague.<br /><br />This latest attempt at I am Legend is not an outright disaster. The empty New York set design and Will Smith do save the dodgy CGI nightstalkers and a script that simply deviates too much from the original concept. It is still something you can watch, maybe even enjoy at times, but that is not the point. This is not I am Legend and that is bad because this simply isn't the film we wanted to see and it's the second time Hollywood has got it terribly wrong. It makes matters even worse that we have been waiting over 12 years for it since an Arnie version was announced but then dropped. Third time lucky maybe but not even three stars for this effort.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>I am going to start with a disclaimer, aimed towards fans of Matheson's book: This is not what you would call a "faithful" adaptation.  Matheson's novel was more of a social commentary (as was most of his work, including his several "Twilight Zone" episodes and movie screenplays), with an ending that left readers no doubt that he was reaching beyond the realm of science fiction and horror.  This movie...not so much.<br /><br />The film must be judged on its own merits.  Fortunately, it holds up.  I was skeptical--as soon as I heard they were putting Will Smith in a production of "I Am Legend," I balked.  Vincent Price pulled it off in "The Last Man on Earth;" I've never seen the Charlton Heston version ("The Omega Man"), so I can't judge it.  But Will Smith?  Don't get me wrong, he's a great action hero.  But this isn't--or, rather, wasn't--an action story.  So...again...Will Smith?<br /><br />Well, he pulls it off.  He probably could even have pulled off a faithful adaptation; the first half shows so much potential, I think he could've gone all the way.  As is, as soon as the cheesy computer-animated monsters come in, it becomes something more of a shoot-em-up.  In fact, I'm willing to bet you that there are two good reasons for watching this movie: the scenery (my God, it'll take your breath away), and Will Smith.  Well, also the dog.  And, if you've heard about the scene that's not good for dog lovers...well, you're right.  I didn't think it would shake me much, but it did.  Kudos to the film-makers; that's probably the one scene in here that SHOULD'VE been in the Matheson novel.<br /><br />So, for those doubters out there, I suggest watching the film.  If you're a Richard Matheson fan, go into it with a grain or two of salt, please, and judge the film on its own merits.  It still isn't a GREAT movie, no; it could've been, I think, had they stuck to the novel.  They digressed, however, and what we have here is a slightly-better-than-average popcorn flick, with vampire/zombie hybrid things.  And Bob Marley.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>It's hard to believe that the same geniuses who made the incredible "empty NYC" special effects for this movie could also make the cheesy and unbelievable reindeer, lions and zombies.<br />When Will Smith first enters the dark building and we have a first glimpse of the zombies, no CGI seems to have been applied and they are truly terrorizing. By the later sequences when they climb walls, destroy ceilings, etc. they reminded me of the equally unmemorable "I Robot" effects.<br />Still plenty to like in this movie which for me, unfortunately, will always be remmembered as a missed chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>I've read some of the other reviews here and disagree with a lot of them. I have never read the book and I saw the Vincent Price version of this movie when I was very young. So, I came to this version with basically a clean slate. And I liked it.<br />There are so many things I liked about it I don't know where to begin. The special effects were great, although a number of people dissed the CGI, I thought it worked well. The story follows a logical line for the situation, I liked that a lot too. Will Smith.... 'nuff said there.<br />The first half and the second half of the movie did, for me at least, fit together. In his travels one day, Will Smith notices one of his mannequins where he did not place it. He is distraught and investigates. While he is investigating, he's pulled into a trap similar to one he used on one of the vampires. As evening closes in, his watch beeps and wakes him up. A battle ensues between him, his dog and the 'night seekers'. During the battle he's rescued by a stranger who takes him to his home unaware that the 'night seekers' watched and now know where he and she are. They come back later that evening for the final confrontation.<br />So, there is a transition that takes place. It takes the movie from a peaceful but lonely route into a dangerous one. The vampires that Will Smith had been able to avoid can now locate him.<br />The moral and ethical implications this film stirs up are tremendous. Scientific experimentation to cure cancer seems to have been the cause of the transformation in this story. That in itself brings up endless wagers and exhaustive arguments over right and wrong. Will Smith's character states 'God didn't do this. We did.' Placing the blame for the destruction of mankind onto mankind in a way that's different from other similar movies.<br />Although this is not really a classic film, it is indeed a fine film and well worth watching. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sci-fi or movies that can be debatable afterwards.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I guess I have to agree with other reviews I've read in print and online - this movie was good for the first hour, and then the ending was kind of a deflation of the mood that was set in the start. The nature of the zombie/vampires was not well explored, particularly the clear demonstration of their vestigial intelligence and apparent social organization. The film just kind of gallumphs to a close.  I would also have to agree with criticisms of the sometimes-chunky CGI; thi sis the first film I've ever saw that I actually thought, gee, it wouldn't be so bad if at some future date they went back and retouched some of the computer graphics. Much of it was surprisingly cheesy.  Will Smith does a good job in his role -- loved the dog, as well.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue)</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>SPOILERS below!!<br /><br />This is not your typical creature feature/horror/action fest of a movie.  Will Smith deserves a lot of credit for imbuing the character of Robert Neville with determination, sadness, desperation, and basic humanity in the face of unimaginable danger and desolation.<br />He believes he is the only man left on Earth, so we can't even imagine the depths of his loneliness.  Having watched his wife and daughter die, the only things keeping him going are the quest for a possible cure for the killer virus (which has destroyed most humans and turned the remainder into murderous freaks; and the love of his loyal family dog, Sam.<br />  Two scenes in particular are extremely moving and sad:  the infection of Sam, whom Robert has to put down before she turns on him; and a scene in which he begs a mannequin to say hello to him because he has heard no other human voice besides his own in three years.<br />  It was a bit simplistic to include scenes in which a woman and her son find Robert and he at first declares that there is no survivors' camp and no God--and then later he decides they were meant to find him because they can carry the cure (in the form of a vial of blood) with them to Vermont, where survivors do, in fact, live.<br />  Don't let that keep you away, though.  This is a well-done story of a man, his dog, and the fight to keep the human race going.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Interestingly, 2 adaptations of the Richard Matheson book have already been done with "The Last Man on Earth" and "The Omega Man" showcasing the same kind of premise of supreme loneliness and isolation. It's one of those stories that seems ripe for re-interpretations and such a simple idea can bring with it a number of tries to get the story going. This version is probably one of the better ones but it's not perfect by any means and it's either the closest we'll get to a great adaptation or it's just not the right approach.<br /><br />Robert Neville is a military scientist trying to find the cure for a virus that wiped out nearly the entire world's population. Living in New York with his dog Sam, Robert spends his day renting videos in alphabetical order, chatting to mannequins he's set up and waiting at a pier in case people who hear his broadcast show up. But when the watch's alarm goes up, he heads back home before the sun goes down as strange sounds and creatures come out at night, leaving him to fend for himself while he tries to find a cure.<br /><br />The first hour or so is one of the more well executed parts in the entire film and you're on your way thinking this is going to be a great movie. But then Neville turns out to not be entirely alone and the film kind of dips into "eh" quality. The screenwriters (one being Akiva Goldsman who's responsible for the unholy mess that is Batman and Robin) manage to keep our interest entirely by showing the various ways you can keep busy in a desolated New York. It changes a couple of elements from the book that work a bit better and thanks to the visuals which show vegetation growing out of the pavement, cars all over the streets and even wildlife showing up now and then it becomes impressive how well it's keeping our attention.<br /><br />It's the last act which falls apart as it's not a bad idea storywise it's just handled improperly and starts with a couple scenes, involving Shrek and Bob Marley that fall completely on their face and they're just strange. Then of course there's the look of the creatures which, instead of taking the "guy in costume" approach, they're entirely computer-generated and they look so bad and practically PC quality that it's distracting.<br /><br />Best thing easily about the movie is Will Smith who shows what a lot of people knew all along: he's an incredibly charismatic and likable actor that makes it hard not to want to watch him. But being the only actor for a large chunk of the film was a feat some were curious about and he doesn't just ham it up either and gives an emotionally charged performance that shows he can act and films like Ali or the Pursuit of Happyness are not his only forum for breaking his "Fresh Prince" persona, usually seen in the blockbusters.<br /><br />Since it's probably the biggest DVD/Blu-Ray release this week, I'd have to recommend the film since everyone will want to see it but I'm not sure how many will enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>This remake of Omega Man (staring Charlton Heston), which itself is a remake of  Vincent Price's The Last Man on Earth, is arguably the best of the three.<br /><br />I watched both of the above movies in preparation for viewing I am Legend.  Each is campy and fun, updated for its own time.  I expected the same from this:  another fun zombie movie.  I was quite mistaken.<br /><br />Although not a die hard fan of Will Smith, I am in awe of his stellar performance in this movie.  It is basically a one man show, and Smith hands-down proves he has the talent and screen presence to successfully pull it off.  It is a riveting performance; one in which Smith lives up to his potential as a cinematic leading man.  His emotions are realistic and run the gauntlet:  anger, humor, hope, love, caring, despair, shock, loneliness, fear. He does it all and leaves you believing.<br /><br />The cinematography of a deserted New York is outstanding, both oddly beautiful and action packed.  The opening sequences grab you and glue you to your seat.  The scenes of Smith hunting on the streets of NYC really drive home just how alone he is.<br /><br />The infected, the CGI vampires, actually made my skin crawl.  All the effects were well done, and allowed the viewer to successfully suspend his disbelief.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great film.  It still affected me days after I had seen it.  And that is exactly what a good movie should do.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>In I AM LEGEND, New York City is a barren, apocalyptic landscape that has reverted to a wild and natural landscape where only one man, Robert Neville (Will Smith) hunts and lives.  Years earlier a cure for cancer was developed by changing the structure of a virus.  The cure was heralded throughout the world until the virus begins to mutate and begins a plague. New York City is quarantined, but Neville stays behind in an attempt to find a cure.  Years later, except for his faithful dog, he is still alone.  He spends his days hunting for survivors, gathering supplies, and trying to find a cure.  But that's only during the day.  Before evening, he returns to his home and barricades himself in for the night.  For at night, the people that have been infected by the plague and are still alive come out of hiding, seeking for flesh to eat and blood to drink.  These mutated zombie-vampires are hungry and not only want to find Neville to eat him, but to seek vengeance for what they have become.  As the movie unfolds, it becomes a cat and mouse race as Neville attempts to outwit the creatures and find a cure before they find his home and destroy humanity's only hope.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND is loosely based upon the classic vampire short story of the same name by Richard Matheson.  Other than the main character's name and the general exposition of the plot, I AM LEGEND is unlike the original story.  Fans of the story (myself included) might be disappointed by the adaptation.  Yet, despite straying from the source material, I AM LEGEND works really well as movie in its own right.  The ending of the film does seem rushed and is very different from the ending of the story, yet the overall spirit of the book is intact and the ending of the film makes it clear that Robert Neville is a hero to be admired, a legend.<br /><br />I enjoyed I AM LEGEND.  Will Smith is a very talented actor and I usually enjoy watching him on screen.  I really liked Richard Matheson's original story, and though I was disappointed by certain aspects of the book's latest adaptation, I thought the filmmakers did a great job in making a good and solid movie that stays true to the spirit of the original story.  I also enjoyed the soundtrack of the film that was composed of almost entirely Bob Marley music.<br /><br />Recommended for Will Smith fans, people who like vampire and zombie movies, and anyone who just likes a good dramatic-adventure/sci-fi movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>I for one love the apocalyptic movies. Meaning it's the end of the world, and either there is one survivor or a few, but the results are the same...people really discovering how to survive during the end of days. Ex-Military researcher, Nevell is apparently immune to the very real vampire-like virus that has completely devastated New York City (in the future). Alone with no one but his dog (his wife and daughter were killed), and a variety of strategically placed mannequins, Nevell appears to be handling solitude, as anyone would (with a touch of madness). In a city filled with deer, wild animals (they obviously got out of the Zoo), Nevell spends his days hunting those that are ill, and his nights hiding out in his well fortified home. Unfortunately, things change as we see other survivors and the very beings that Nevell thought were so unintelligent (and without meaningful brain activity) being more intelligent (well at least the leader) than first believed.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story, although I wasn't particularly fond of the ending. I think that in a time of great despair and hopelessness, we see a man that was able to survive, with his sanity (well not exactly) and his sense of purpose. And I really think that it takes a great actor, to be able to portray loneliness so well. Will Smith did a wonderful job!</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>I am Legend' s point of departure remits us immediately to "Planet of the apes" , "28 days later"  with a devastating Manhattan (the most cosmopolite city in the world) and a warrior of the road, the only survivor in many miles away, (whose only friend is his almost human pet Sam, whose expressiveness equals it with the sympathetic dog in "As good as it gets")<br /><br />The film reconstructs the previous moments to the global catastrophe, the origin of the messy and chaos that led this apocalyptic ambiance.<br /><br />But since the middle of the story, one feels the plot simply weakens itself more and more; common places, edition problems and sudden alterations of a well planned script simply collapsed with a predictable final and a lack of that crucial dramatic punch.<br /><br />A fabulous idea that stranded in the middle of the river. Perhaps, in hands of veterans directors of this genre (David Cronenberg or John Carpenter) , the overcome would have been by far, quite succesful</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the last remaining human in New York City, where he works on a cure for the disease that has decimated the human race, turning most of the survivors into rage-filled creatures that cannot endure sunlight.  There is much to enjoy here.  An empty NYC slowly being reclaimed by nature is perfectly evoked, and Smith is excellent as the lonely man trying to hang on to his life and his sanity long enough to achieve his goal.<br /><br />The early sections of the film are the best.  Director Francis Lawrence and writers Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman establish the mutated survivors as a truly terrifying, unstoppable presence, most notably in a frightening sequence in which Neville enters their lair to look for his dog.  However, they lose their sense of menace in direct proportion to the amount of screen time they get, no doubt due to the fact that they are realized through CGI rather than practical make-up effects.  This is a rather large flaw in a film that gets so many other things right.  I was not disappointed in the finale, as so many other reviewers were, but perhaps this is because I have not yet read the Richard Matheson source material.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>I read Matheson's book prior to seeing the movie.  Watching the movie, I felt like "what story am I watching here?!"  The ending, the girl's role, the whole thing was changed. There was a tiny bit of the essence of Matheson's book, but the stunning quality of I AM LEGEND is it's ending.  Why is he legend. Will Smith was awesome and he carried me through the movie. But what a disappointment overall.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>My standard for judging "I Am Legend" is not the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765357151">original novel</a> by Richard Matheson but "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>."  I watched the 1971 adaptation starring Charlton Heston last month in anticipation of going to see this new version, a master plan thwarted by classes not ending until December 21st this year.  I also tried to avoid hearing what other thought about this movie, but I did hear whispers about how the premise was great but that audiences were disappointed by the ending.  This might be an inevitable complaint about this story because after establishing the whole idea of being the last man on earth (a point hammered home in the omnipresent trailers for the film), the movie has to deal with the fact the hero is not the last man on Earth, albeit the last one living on the island of Manhattan.  If you think about what Will Smith's Robert Neville life has been like for the last three years, then what happens in this film represents a series of significant changes cascading through the end credits.<br /><br />I think "I Am Legend" is way better than "Omega Man," which is why its rating ends up being two stars better.  Director Francis Lawrence ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MDPYM">Constantine</a>") has the advantage of the stunning transformation of New York City into a true urban jungle, while the screenplay by Mark Protosevich ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXKM">The Cell</a>") and Akiva Goldsman ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN0T">I, Robot</a>") constructs a mixture of set pieces (e.g., Neville deer hunting), simple moments (e.g., Neville picking up a video), and flashbacks to the last time Neville say his wife and daughter.  The irony that a cure for cancer could turn into a plague that decimates the Earth is palatable (never trust a virus), and this time around Neville is a virologist, so he is still searching for a cure three years later.  The best parts of Smith's performance are done in silence; this might be a science fiction film but his work here is solid.  I also like the way things play out in the end, both in terms of the harsh reality of Neville's tenuous situation and also with regards to the psychology of the character that motivates his words and deeds during the end game.<br /><br />There is no attempt to explain every thing that Neville is doing, which makes sense given that unless he is dictating a report in his lab the only other living thing he could talk to is his German shepherd Sam, and the need to explain everything to Sam passed long ago.  The plethora of zombie films in recent years, especially those that have decided zombies no longer lumber around but constantly sprint (to wit, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8L9">Day of the Dead</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBN8K">28 Weeks Later"/"28 Days Later</a>") might be misleading viewers into thinking the monsters in this one are zombie-like, but the specific evidence supplied in the film clearly indicates they are vampire-like.  One of the neat things I know about Matheson's novel was that he came up with scientific explanations for the key tenants of vampire lore, and I do wish those parts of the movie had been more explicit, but at least the film is consistent in leaving it to the audience to figure things out.<br /><br />I have yet to see "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a>," so it would be premature to say that "I Am Legend" is the best version of Matheson's novel, but the bottom line is that I was quite satisfied with this movie.  This is not to say that the film is perfect: when other humans show up it seems impossible, given the isolation of Manhattan and who the humans are, that they are able to get there and and do what they do.  But I round up on "I Am Legend" because it rings true that Smith's Neville would have slipped over the line into madness given the personal isolation and demons that have tormented him for three years.  His descent is tragic, which makes the resolution of this film so much more preferable to what happens with Heston's character in the other version.  Besides, I like Neville's taste in works of art to appropriate from MOMA.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>The story begins with one of humanity's greatest hopes seemingly fulfilled. Dr. Alice Krippen (Emma Thompson) has discovered the cure for cancer. This cure is a virus that is a subset of measles. Paraphrasing her words: the virus is a fast car.  Measles is like putting a criminal at the wheel.  What she did was "replace that criminal with a cop."<br /><br />At the time of the announcement, clinical trials had taken place with 10,900 subjects.  All were cancer-free.  Something clearly went very wrong between the clinical trials and the introduction of Krippen Virus (KV) into the population.<br /><br />At the time KV was introduced into the population, there were 6 billion people on earth. The virus killed 90% of those. The remaining 9% became rabid and photophobic, running in hives only at night and killing whatever they came in contact with.<br /><br />Dr. Robert Neville is one of the 1% of the population immune to KV--and survived. At onset, he was a US Army Colonel and virologist living in New York City.<br /><br />Even three years later, Neville hasn't given up.  He takes his motto from his hero, Bob Marley:<br /><br />"The people, who were trying to make this world worse... are not taking a day off. How can I? Light up the darkness."<br /><br />By day, he and his faithful dog, Sam, travel the city looking for other survivors.  He daily broadcasts a message over all AM frequencies, asking anyone alive and uninfected to come to the South Street Seaport at mid-day offering to provide food, shelter and safety.<br /><br />By night, he hides in his heavily fortified home, preparing food and urging Sam to "eat your vegetables." He watches one movie per night, which he takes from a nearby video store--apparently viewing in alphabetical order.  He's now up to "G". In his basement, he's gathered a fully equipped medical laboratory and he's still working on a cure.  He still has hope, although his psyche is beginning to show cracks.<br /><br />Through flashbacks, we see Neville evacuating his wife and daughter from the city and the frantic efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.<br /><br />Probably the best aspect of this film is Will Smith. He does an impressive job of playing a physician keeping lone vigil over the city that was his charge--and holding on to his own waning hope and sanity. Sam the dog is the only character who can upstage him.<br /><br />I also loved the tributes to Bob Marley.  Like Anna (Alice Braga) in the film, so many of our current generation don't know the man's music or his story.  I'm glad to see both revisited in a popular format. And yes--I agree--Marley was one of the greatest musicians ever.<br /><br />What I found impossible to believe was the 'science.' Inconceivable that 10,900 people in the initial clinical trials showed no signs of the rabid KV virus?  Further, if the virus is also contagious to animals, wouldn't the rabidity, etc. have shown up in the animal testing which occurs prior to the human. I realize a good part of movie viewing is the 'suspension of disbelief' but I not only had to 'suspend,' I had to kick everything I know about the drug discovery process right out of my head. I honestly believe they could have come up with something far more plausible than this backstory.<br /><br />There are some warnings here:<br /><br />1.  While the movie ends with hope, you're going to be going through a lot of depressing material to get there.  Don't go if you're looking for a holiday escape 'pick me up film.'  This isn't it.<br />2.  If you are intolerant of suspense, reconsider going.  My husband had to leave the theatre because he just couldn't handle parts of the film.<br />3.  If scientific accuracy is your bag, you are going to hate this film for the reason I stated above (and more).<br />4.  If you are a devotee of the original Richard Matheson book, you may well disapprove of the redux.<br /><br />All that being said, I still enjoyed much of the film. "I am Legend" will be a one-time view for me, but still worth the distraction on a quiet Christmas Eve morning.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>wow it's impresive with this packaging. a lot of bonus this edition and have 2 edition. one theatrical and the other extended edition with CGI. i enjoy see this movie because this transfer picture have very done and this audio makes your room like in quite dan scary town ...</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>..but if the film was titled "I am Mediocre", "I am Ok" or "I am quite good", it might have lacked impact. If you have read the book, you had better leave it at the door. You will prefer this if you pretend the book didn't exist and view the film as a stand alone.<br /><br />Personally, the film could have done with the books sexy lap-dancing vampires gyrating wildly on the front lawn whilst Neville glumly contemplates a box of tissues and a 3-year old copy of "Readers Wives".<br /><br />OK, The Fresh Prince is besieged by his not so fresh subjects (hoho) in a Heston-esque manner by 28 Days Later mega zombies. I prefer the old lurchy ones, you know where you are with those. Anyway, the first half of the film (see Independence Day, War of the Worlds etc etc) is good, we get an insight into the deserted New York and some rather silly fooling about with tailors dummies in scenes probably pinched from The Quiet Earth (Kiwi Low budget sci-fi film.)<br /><br />There appears to be some sort of mega-king zombie who is intelligent and plans a trap for the incredibly stupid Smith to fall into, but we are never told the motivation for this. Why did the zombie do it? All of these shenanigans fall by the wayside quicker than a sunbathing vampire when the love interest arrives. The wheels fall off the film, which lurches to a less dignified end than an old fashioned zombie with no underpants on.  Which is a shame because this film could have been pretty good. Now if you make "War of the Independence Day Legend", you would get 3/4 of a great film, Hollywood Hollywood Hollywood, you really have to work harder at those endings. Now, I'm off to review Waterworld.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Colonel Robert Neville, also a doctor, is the last man alive in New York City.  He broadcasts daily on AM radio asking for people to meet up with him at what looks to be an old naval base by the water.  Neville and his German Shepherd Sam show up everyday looking for other survivors of the virus, named KV.  Once thought to be the cure for cancer, the engineered virus mutated and spread airborne, killing people and radically altering those who didn't die into zombie-like, mindless beings.<br /><br />Neville spends his days hunting deer, loose from the park or the zoo, and picking up supplies for his house.  His nights are spent inside his altered house, shuttered and barricaded against the beasts of the night.  Beneath the house is his lab, where he continues to work diligently on a cure for those infected monsters that prowl the streets at night, hungry for blood.  He sets traps to catch the zombies for test subjects using his serums.  At last, Neville believes he's found a serum that will work.<br /><br />During an excursion in town, Neville notices one of his store mannequins has been moved, and when he investigates he's caught in a trap and unconscious until nightfall.  Who moved the mannequin and who set the trap?  Is someone else still alive and uninfected?  Neville and Sam must make it back to the car before sundown, but the hour is late and the darkness is falling.  Something bad is about to happen.<br /><br />To those of you who've read the classic 1954 novella, 'I Am Legend', by Richard Matheson, the movie does not follow the book very well.  Other movies have been made from the novella, including the 1964 movie 'The Last Man On Earth' and 'The Omega Man' filmed in 1971 starring Charlton Heston. In this version, the infected are more like zombies than vampires, and more aggressive.  The film had been modernized (the incidents in the book take place in 1976) which is more attractive to today's audiences, and there's a lot more action involved.  The movie is more external (action) which is well suited for a film version than the book, which is more internal (introspective), but what I really didn't like was how they twisted the ideal of Neville's "legend" status.<br /><br />Will Smith does an excellent performance as Neville, and the atmosphere of a deserted New York City was captured quite nicely.  The zombies are pretty cool, though I don't know who dreamed up the hairless idea.  Sam the dog is added to the film (not in the book) but Sam stole the show for me.  (I love German Shepherds!)  If you're a Matheson fan and have enjoyed both novella and the other remakes of this story, then 'I Am Legend' is well worth the purchase.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>***** 2007. Based on Richard Matheson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765318741">I Am Legend</a> and directed by Francis Lawrence. Dr. Robert Neville is the sole survivor of a pandemic that started in NYC. For three years now, he has tried to find an antidote to the virus at night while infected people are haunting the city. I'm fed up with these reviewers who consider that this film is bad because it doesn't do justice to Richard Matheson book. When Van Gogh paints a face in green or orange, you don't say that his painting is not good because the face's color is not the model's, do you ? After the already very good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MDPYM">Constantine (Widescreen Edition)</a>, Francis Lawrence prooves with I AM LEGEND that he's a real filmmaker one will have to count with in the future. His film is simply the best science-fiction film since Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>. Masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>I will admit that I used to not care for Will Smith back in his Fresh Prince days.  Hard to believe that it was going on 20yrs ago that he was a young Hollywood upstart.  I'm all about giving credit where credit is due, so I will say this:  he has come a LONG way as an actor.  This film, in particular, required a great deal of acting ability, not the least of which because he is the only person on the screen through 90% of the film.<br /><br />The movie is kind of a cross between the TWILIGHT ZONE, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IJ">Cast Away (Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004VVNB">Logan's Run</a>.  A "cure" for cancer has caused an airborne virus which has killed most of the inhabitants of the planet.  Most of the rest who have been turned into zombie creatures.  A select few people are immune to the virus.<br /><br />The lone survivor of New York City is an Army biochemist (our man, Will Smith).  He is desperately trying to find a cure for the virus in his basement lab, and his only companionship is found in his dog.  He is able to travel about freely during the day, although NYC has been overrun by the animal kingdom (some of them quite dangerous).  At night he must stay locked up, lest the zombies find him.<br /><br />If you're into end-of-the-world movies and / or zombie flicks, then this one is certainly worth picking up.  It is quite a profound concept in a way:  a zombie flick with a big budget, an "A-List" actor and a very good soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>Yes, there are tons of plot holes, from start to finish. How can there be any deer in the middle of the city, when all the bridges leading to town are destroyed? How can anyone leave the town then?<br /><br />My problem with this film is also with the idea - it's such a simple plot: allegedly there is one last man in NYC after a virus wipes out everyone else; he's a doctor and wants to save the world by finding a cure to the virus.<br />The way the plot was handled could have been better, there were so many opportunities for it to sway, but there were no surprises, just the typical Hollywood trash.<br /><br />As for the acting, I can't say Will Smith impressed me. Not a noteworthy performance.<br /><br />I did like the fact that there weren't many actors, and that he does go nuts (clearly visible in the video store scenes) because he lacks a social environment.<br /><br />Also, I found the Dark Seekers to be terribly badly done!!!! What a crappy CGI.<br /><br />Hollywood-movie lovers, watch it, it's action-packed.<br />If you're looking for some decent script and good acting, this was pretty lame, so stay away.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>For all the hype, I had expected more. Actually, IAL is essentially a remake of "Omega Man" with Charleston Heston. I swear, it's almost the same movie but with better special effects. The premise is cool but I think they could have done a lot more with the plot. Very predictable and chiche. It's all special effects and little substance. I'd give it 2.5 stars, if I could.<br /><br />Weak and disappointing.

The CGI is too much. But Smith's humanity shows an actor at his best, and is reason enough to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I was really looking forward to seeing "I Am Legend", from the moment I found out earlier this year. In preparation to seeing the movie, I watched Vincent Price in "The Last Man on Earth" and Charlton Heston in "The Omega Man". Even though the main ideas of the two prior versions were the same (last man, virus, night creatures, etc.), the delivery varied for their particular time. So I was intrigued to see how the storyline would be adapted to our time.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me was the set. Growing up in New York City, it really hit me hard to see the devastation and isolation of the city that "Never Sleeps". The streets, the abandoned cars, the bridges, the U.N.,etc. It really hit home. Then we see a much slender, leaner Will Smith trying to cope with the fact that he was alone. His portrayal of Robert Neville is great. Very moving. I find the origin of the virus quite interesting as it comes as a side effect for a cure for cancer. The prior two movies used a plague (The Last Man on Earth) and germ warfare (The Omega Man) to explain the virus. The use of a cure that transforms into a virus gives it an ironic twist.<br /><br />The film opens well, and continues that way until the introduction of the other two human characters, but that's about an hour or more of Smith, alone in Manhattan after a genetically-altered version of the measles has either killed or mutated the rest of humanity into super-violent creatures who prey on those unaffected, but only at night. They're killed almost instantly when exposed to sunlight. Smith, playing Robert Neville, was an Army Lieutenant before the virus was unleashed three years prior, and he spends his lonely days walking and stalking on the grown-in streets of Manhattan with his dog, Sam. At night, he locks himself in his apartment and attempts to find a cure. It's interesting seeing Smith carry the movie with only himself, Sam, some various wild animal species, and some mannequins. He does an excellent job, and I'm sure that's not an easy task for an actor. This is easily the most likable character he's ever played, and he brings a lot of great stuff to it, including humor and a scene that had me on the verge of tears.<br /><br />Will Smith and the strength of the story outweigh the two mot glaringly bad things about this film. However, the creature effects are WAY too over-reliant on CGI, but then again, so are most horror films these days, so you might be used to it. Animatronics and foam rubber latex effects pioneered well over thirty years ago look a lot more believable than this cartoonish junk. And the other thing is the ending.  It's not terrible, and it won't make you dislike the rest of the film, but the original story's ending is very sad and ironic, and this, like the other two adaptations, just can't seem to cope with the magnitude of the situation, so they always leave you with something WAY to hopeful for what we've seen throughout the rest of the film, and also, it seems that they're afraid to teach you the incredible lesson the original Matheson story had to offer. This is a good adaptation of Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend.' So far, none of the three have nailed it, due to the inability to just use the story's ending, but this one comes close and is certainly one of the best of the three (the other two are good flicks so I recommend them all).</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>I have owned the two disc Special Edition which is in Standard Def for some time.

No acting critiques, plot summaries or evaluations of the practicality of this event occurring or CGI effects. (The male lion doesn't quite make it IMHO)  Not sure which I like better, the theatrical or alternate release, both put a different spin on things and both are fine.<br /><br />The Standard Def version was really quite good, the Blu Ray's audio tops it for clarity if not directionality and making full use of your complete sound system.  The original audio editing was top notch.  There is a definite improvement with the Blu Ray which contains both the theatrical and alternate releases of the film but since the regular DVD was as good as it was in the audio editing, the improvement does not make for a night and day comparison.  It is lossless audio and that is about the best you're going to get it.  The opening scenes really envelope you in the sight and sounds of the stricken city.<br /><br />The video transfer is equally excellent with sharp contrast and wonderful color saturation when appropriate.  The dark scenes looked a touch crushed in the blacks to me but detail was still there, no question about it.  I saw no grain even in the darkest of scenes.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

I enjoyed the special effects and computer animations as well as the staging of this very good sci-fi remake of the OMEGA MAN.  In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit more than the original film and recommend it for all fans of Will Smith.<br /><br />I was not at all surprised that Will Smith could pull off some very serious and dramatic acting under genuine "sci-fi" conditions that strain credulity. As I always suspected, he is much more than a likeable stunt man and should enjoy a great acting career over the years ahead.<br /><br />The ending of the film was a bit of a bummer, but we all knew the basic plot anyhow. I thought he went out like an action figure but was given a good chance to demonstrate his very fine acting skills.  As he usually does, he portrayed a very likeable and basically very good individual, and did this without appearing corny. His character was trying to set straight a failure of the entire human race and took his responsibilities as a research doctor very personally.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>I Am Legend was without a doubt one of the most over hyped and disapointing movies of 2007. Francis Lawerence shows the same mis direction he showed in 2005's Constaine and the script is strictely by the numbers. The only saving grace in the movie is Will Smith's performance as the last man on earth. As for the hyped alternate ending it's also a let down.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>Obviously things are a matter of taste. Some people love it, some people hate it, other just don't care.<br /><br />There is something deliciously horrible to watch our cities being destroyed in the movies. It is like a guilty pleasure. Some uncontrollable curiosity that leaves us in awe before the unusual. It may be looking at a car accident as we drive by or watching New York City being destroyed by the sea in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7OI8">Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, by a monster in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPXY">Cloverfield [Theatrical Release</a>] or by the ultimate storm in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALRU">The Day After Tomorrow (Two-Disc All-Access Collector's Edition)</a>. It is a pleasure to see the impossible happen with the visual accuracy of certainty while deep inside we know it only lasts for two hours.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND gives you that guilty pleasure... with a twist: the city is not really destroyed. It is Humans who are absent after a deadly disease has wiped us out. And after that, Nature starts to reclaim the Earth. In fact, one of the most powerful images of this film is in the beginning, when Dr. Neville (Smith) drives a Mustang across the city and gets surprised by deers running scared through the streets on Manhattan. Even more disturbing is to see Dr. Neville moving across the woods in Times Square (no less) as he hunts one of them.<br /><br />This is just one of I AM LEGEND's greatest achievements: it really gives us a world (through state-of-the-art visual effects) unseen, unimaginable, fascinating... and lets you explore it. We know there are vampires (or some creatures like that running havoc through the night). But during daytime, we go places and see things we'll never see. And that's pure film magic.<br /><br />So here is the story: Dr. Robert Neville lives alone in Manhattan as the sole survivor to a deadly virus (to which he is immune) who transformed everybody in light-sensitive vampire-like monsters (forced to live in the dark). The crisis (shown in flashbacks as he recollects) happened a few years ago and - right now - Dr. Neville is on the verge of loosing his mind. He talks to mannequins, watches recorded television broadcast and try to have a normal life (with his dog Samantha) hoping to make contact with other survivors like himself. Oh... and he is a military scientist trying to find a cure.<br /><br />Now... it is a ridiculous effort to compare the film to the book, as this film is much more a loose adaptation of Richard Matheson's great novella. This film uses the same premise but makes significant changes in key elements that (I believe) would never really work on a Hollywood blockbuster. So, those who love the novella and hate the film should realize that, many many times, the film's preoccupations and objectives are not the same ones we have on the books they are based on. It is important to appreciate the film in its own merit and outside the burden of the book - a burden any film wants to break free from. Gone are the days where a Hollywood film "wanted to be the book" because they needed such blessing from such an authority.<br /><br />And breaking down the film's great assets, we'll find only positive elements: Will Smith's very precise performance, a screenplay who tell you the story minute by minute maintaining you always wanting more, great special effects, great scary moments that will please its target audience... and the city we love being engulfed by a destiny without us.<br /><br />Simply beautiful.<br /><br />This DVD version comes with lots of extras, the best of which, in my opinion, is the making of the city's visuals we see throughout the entire movie. Also, it comes with an alternate version of the film with a different ending that would never hit the audience in the same way. Fascinating.<br /><br />The film is not perfect. There are one or two less interesting elements that I will not delve into because I believe they are a matter of taste. And regardless of that, I think this film is a production triumph in contemporary cinema.<br /><br />That's it.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I was really looking forward to this one.  I have read the book and have seen the first two screen adaptations dozens of times.  The movie is good, but not great.  It is not as faithful to the book as Last Man on Earth, nor does Smith show the utter madness of Heston in Omega Man.  Smith was good in the role.  Better in fact than I expected him to be.  The special effects showing an abandoned New York were terrific, I don't know why the special effects for the dark walkers was so terrible.  They looked so CGI that it took away from my enjoyment of the movie.  With a big budget I don't understand how they could have done such a bad job with that aspect.  I think overall the movie could have been longer.  The idea of the last man alive is very interesting and I would have loved to see more of Smith surviving on his own.  I would have also preferred a dark ending.  The ending of this one is a little too typical Hollywood uplifting feel good end.  I did however enjoy the movie overall.  I hope that there is an extended version for the dvd release.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>In 2009, a vaccine for cancer caused a virus that turned nearly all of the people on earth into rabid, blood-thirsty, zombies.  It is now 2012, and as far as Robert Neville (Will Smith) knows, he and his trusty dog are the only uninfected creatures in New York City.  He spends his days watching DVDs, driving the deserted streets hunting for deer, and working in his laboratory, trying to find a cure for this horrible virus.  No matter what, he has to be home by sundown, because that's when the zombies come out.<br /><br />I like Will Smith a lot and here he gives a somber yet powerful performance that tugs at your heartstrings and has you rooting for him.  He and his dog make a very likeable team and they make the movie.  I don't like films that over-do the CGI stuff - I think it makes then too cartoony - and, unfortunately, this movie is loaded with it.  The blown-up  bridges and deserted, weedy streets of New York are too obviously fake, and the zombies, while repulsive and frightening, are poorly done and never looked real.<br /><br />The unoriginal script and suspense factor were worth about three stars, while Smith's performance earned five stars, so I give it four stars; intriguing and sometimes intense, but not really thrilling, due to bad computer images and because the last-man-on-earth plot has been done before (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VAHR1E">The Omega Man</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a>).</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Though it stoops for unearned sentimentality at the end, "I Am Legend," until then, is a spine-tingling vision of a future devoid of humanity.  And hope.  Will Smith turns in a landmark performance as Dr. Robert Neville, the sole survivor in a New York City decimated by a man-made plague.  During the day, Neville and his faithful dog travel the city for sustenance and spiritual survival.  The images of a downtown Manhattan crumbling and decaying are downright chilling.  But in the dark corners await bloodthirsty monsters that were transformed by the plague from ordinary humans to something more primitive, feral and terrifying.  Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) and gifted cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings) construct nerve-frying, blood-freezing sequences in an abandoned building and a New York seaport at night when Neville finds himself face to face with the cannibalistic creatures.  But Neville's true fight is not with them or with the disease he so fervently tries to cure; it's with his own dissipating sanity.  Where the film works best is when it let's Smith work his Hanksian magic, chronicling Neville's daily routine (talking to Manicheans as if they were real, waiting in seeming vain at the aforementioned seaport for any sign of life) to fight off absolute desolation.  Smith finds the ravaged, fragile soul of a man fighting for one more day, one more fleeting chance that hope will reveal itself.  When Lawrence and his screenwriters stick with this bleak, desperate story for survival, "I Am Legend" connects with unexpected emotional body blows.  The predictable deus ex machina ending blunts the emotional impact shows, but until then, "I Am Legend" is a harrowing vision of a future where hope hangs by a vulnerable thread.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>Director Francis Lawrence is the third to adapt Richard Matheson's classic novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765357151">I Am Legend</a> to the big screen.  The story takes place three years after a cure for cancer mutated into a virus that transformed humanity into cannibalistic ghouls who can't bear sunlight.  In the midst of this is Robert Neville (Will Smith) who appears to be the last surviving human.  Neville was an army scientist, and has been searching for a cure ever since the outbreak began.  He has turned his home into a fortress to keep him safe at night and spends his days foraging for food and other essentials in addition to conducting research.  Neville is fighting the good fight, but with only his loyal German shepherd to keep him company, he's struggling to maintain his sanity.<br /><br />For those who have read the book, there are numerous changes in the story.  These changes are significant enough that one is better served simply watching the movie for its own sake and setting aside the book completely.  Think of it as "inspired by" rather than "based on" the novel.  While there is some humor, the overall tone of the movie is pretty bleak.  Neville lives under the constant threat of sudden death if he wanders into the wrong place or allows the creatures to find his home.  The infected are ferociously aggressive, fast, agile, relentless, and cunning.<br /><br />Will Smith turns in a strong performance, which will surprise no one who has seen him before.  His dog is very likeable as well, and the audience roots for him just as much as Neville (maybe more if you're an animal lover).  The pace of the movie is uneven and it sags a bit in the middle.  The action scenes are all quite scary, though, as the infected are so hyperactively vicious in the way they attack.  The ending doesn't quite fit the rest of the movie, but it should satisfy those who want to see something hopeful come out of all the tragedy that has taken place.<br /><br />I did have some problems with certain aspects of the movie.  At one point, the infected apparently set a trap for Neville that is simple in some ways, but very complex in others.  I'm not at all certain that I could rig the same trap, and these creatures are portrayed as being so primitive and rabid that it's hard to picture them hatching such a plan.  I had other issues with the plot, but since they occur in the second half, I will not specify them to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />I Am Legend is a decent movie and the legion of Will Smith fans will almost certainly want to give it a try.  It's far from perfect, but it has scary action scenes, pathos, and even a little humor.  As mentioned earlier, fans of the book will need to set aside their expectations and go along for the ride or avoid this movie like the plague.  You will not find anything remotely resembling a faithful re-creation here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>I am a big Will Smith fan, and a sci-fi fan, and I like exploring the concept of being the last man on Earth, so I just had to see this movie.<br /><br />Will Smith does a superb job with the material he is given.  It rings true every step of the way.  I will not go into exactly what happens every moment of the movie, and there will be no spoilers here.  Instead, ask yourself if you would like to bond with Robert Neville, the character Mr. Smith plays, and go along on his dedicated journey to save lives, maintain sanity, and survive while avoiding imminent danger.  Also ask yourself if you would like a good cry.  This movie has a few tearjerking moments, and if you have any heart at all you will probably shed at least one tear.  This movie may not be perfect, but if you like the idea of Will Smith in this role you should see it at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>The year is 2012, and Dr. Robert Neville (Smith) may be the last man on Earth.  He is partially responsible for a cancer cure that mutated and turned humans into beings that cannot stand sunlight and crave blood.  Neville is lonely, and only has his dog Sam for a friend.  During the day, he searches for food and supplies, and works on trying to cure this awful disease.  At night, he locks himself away in his house and hides from the horrors that wander the streets.  One day, he gets sloppy, and his world becomes worse.<br /><br />Will Smith carries this movie full on his back.  Acting alone or with only a dog, he is the reason to see this movie.  Like Tom Hanks in "Castaway" or John Cusack in "1408", he gives a solid performance all on his own.  Visually, "I Am Legend" is mostly excellent.  A desolate New York City is well rendered and eerie.  The monsters, on the other hand, mostly look like the work of CGI.  That's a shame because CGI wasn't really needed for them.  The story does differ from the classic novel by Richard Matheson, and while the ending isn't a total cop-out, it is a bit disappointing.  On its own merits, "I Am Legend" works pretty well and is worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Well, this certainly was entertaining. It's no award winner, but it's involving. The hour-and-a-half goes by pretty fast, and gets you into the plight of the main character, so I give it four stars for that.<br /><br />I can't say the story is anything special, or particularly intelligent. The theme of few people left on the planet, a kind of "Planet Of The Ape" type tale, is nothing new. This one just has a few different twists to it and, film-wise, is different in that it features computerized special-effects. As one who normally enjoys those visual treats, I would rate this aspect "fair," too, like the story.<br /><br />Early on, the animals racing down New York City streets looked very fake. Later, the effects were a little better with the zombies, but nothing that would make you drop your jaw in amazement.<br /><br />Like the story and FX, Will Smith as the lead character was okay: good, but not Oscar material. Actually, I thought the German Shepherd did the best job of acting in the film!<br /><br />Having said all that, I still enjoyed the film and recommend it iff you are looking for suspense, some scary scenes and a good diversion in your life for 91 minutes.  Just know what you're getting: this is very horror-like in many spots.

These aren't mindless zombies. They possess the intelligence to set traps.

Neville's argument about the plague being manmade, rather than an "act of God", bespeaks a man that has carried a mountain of guilt on his shoulders for his part in the disaster.<br /><br />X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X<br /><br />"I Am Legend" doesn't introduce anything new beyond the two previous films, but the use of CGI (which is not entirely great) makes the action introduced in the film effective.

Everything is bright and sunny, with him riding around an isolated NYC with his dog.  After a while though, his alarm on his watch starts going off, and he heads home, while the dark starts creeping up he gets in and closes off his house, windows and all.  You then hear horrible, demonish sounds outside.  You get it that this is a nightly routine for him. You do get a couple of great scenes that are scary in this, but the movie really plays up on his sense of isolation and aloneness. I think the reason my husband didn't like it was because of the time it took to get established.  I don't think the story would have worked had he just all of a sudden started with the monsters, it had to tell what his life was to that point, and how it started to change.  Anyway, pretty good movie if you feel like seeing one!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>While this is the fourth time the story for I Am Legend has been adapted for film (first as The Last Man on Earth, second as The Omega Man and third as I Am Omega), the script is unduly similar to countless other horror and sci-fi films of late. Lone survivor Neville faces the monotony of isolation (as seen in Cast Away) and grasps at the hope that he can discover a cure for the virus that has wiped out civilization (as seen in the equally mediocre Resident Evil). The constant "jump" scares become predictable and the stodgy creature designs are curiously reminiscent of The Mummy's Imhotep. I Am Legend is unfortunately one of those films that may be entertaining at first glance, but will be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />From the first few minutes of the film it is more than apparent that the last man on earth is not alone. And that's when the suspense hits. The most impressive and annoying aspect of I Am Legend is the wavering suspense turned to constant apprehension. It is not intellectual or psychological suspense like that found in Alfred Hitchcock's legendary works, but mere "jump scares" that create shock from the unexpected. Startling the audience with fulminating noises, sudden movements and creatures lashing out at the screen, this is clearly the poor man's replacement for genuine scares. The constant fright builds plenty of anticipation, but due to the regular intervals of scream-inducing moments, it becomes rather predictable as the movie progresses.<br /><br />A lot has been left to the imagination, especially during the adaptation of the novel, of which the film deviates so greatly that taking its title was far from necessary. The post virus break out is narrated through dream sequences and flashbacks to explain why Neville is alone in New York. While much of the deterioration of humans into vampiric zombies is not covered, the reverse effect, in which the creatures begin to grow smarter and appear to follow a leader, is completely untouched by explanation. In fact, the last we hear of Neville's experiments is that they have de-evolved into the most primitive of life forms - and the very next second they are plotting intricate traps and training zombie dogs to attack.<br /><br />In an attempt to demonstrate Neville's loneliness as the last man on earth, he sets up mannequins in the neighboring video rental store to simulate interactivity with humans. It is a relatively successful demonstration of the mental instabilities he suffers due to extreme isolation, but even at its finest, when he finally confronts a female mannequin that he continually jokes with his dog about approaching, it feels like an inferior version of Cast Away. At the same time, a single shot of one of the mannequins seemingly turning its head as Neville passes by, is the highlight of the horror creepiness, which is perhaps the only real psychological scare.<br /><br />I Am Legend remains entertaining throughout (mostly due to Smith's onscreen charisma and the incessant jump scares) but ultimately offers nothing new to the genre. Straying far from the novel's more thought-provoking storyline, (involving multiple factions of human digression and vampire tendencies), this Legend never really breaches the sci-fi horror category and often feels all too familiar for those keeping up on their sci-fi/horror films. Superb action sequences help and poor creature designs certainly don't, but enough entertainment can be had that Smith's latest work is worth a look for those interested in the genre; just don't expect anything too legendary.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Excellent set up at the beginning.

Films like this are the reason that I avoid big Hollywood blockbusters. Ugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Not bad, not great, a few good moments, some tedious ones, could have been better had a few more things been explained or a couple plot holes been tidied up. Overall not a film to spend too much time thinking about as opposed to just passively watching sans deep analysis, a thing which tends to erode the suspended disbelief needed to make I Am Legend work. Will Smith earned his paycheck here more convincingly as a soldier than as a scientist, but on the other hand the mutants he battled were one of the neater CGI foes to come along in a monk's age. I Am Legend hasn't lingered in my mind the way a truly good movie will but I recall being pleased enough when I first saw its story of one man and his loyal dog surviving in a disquietingly vacant post-epidemic Manhattan. So, your call here. If you like Will Smith movies, grim futures, recumbent humanity and cannibalistic mutants-cum-monsters, you'll probably enjoy I Am Legend. If you're one of those "I Am Analytical" sorts, well, maybe a more cerebral cinematic outing is your poison. Either way, go have some fun.

I really wasn't expecting that much from the film. Obviously Will Smith was always going to be the films saviour even if it was a complete Turkey. But its not.<br /><br />I agree with most previous reviewers that the first half is the best part of the film. However IMO the 2nd half and the special effects are nowhere near as bad as some reviewers have made out. Only at one point in the film did I think "thats CGI". Will Smith is very good and the errie deserted streets and his relationship with the dog are very well done.<br /><br />The film is only 96 mins long, which is also in its favour. Unlike a lot of Hollywood blockbusters this doesn't feel like it should have much, if anything cut from it. Most crucially of all, Neville (Will Smith) was a sympathetic character. This film has that crucial element that is missing from so many bloated blockbusters - characters you care about.<br /><br />On the downside there are a few contrived moments in the plot that I didn't really believe in. To some extent I agree with previous reviewers criticisms about the ending, but in the end the filmmakers just about got the balance between a completely happy ending and a resolutely downbeat one. Without actually giving away what happens at the end I can't say anymore than that.<br /><br />This isn't quite 4 stars for me but its better than 3 and I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>Verdict:<br />Movie is really nice (simple story but cool). I prefer the alternate ending (much more realistic; I hate happy endings). CGI of the monster is too "smooth" but still believable enough. This is the movie where I realized Will Smith can actually act (the same way I realized Ashton Kutcher can act after watching Butterfly Effect; which I also own).<br />Bluray: Very nice video and audio.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>There is a theme that runs through many horror films: the monster is initially welcomed as a wonder, then feared and reviled as its true nature becomes apparent. Attempts to destroy it fail, but an uneasy detente is reached by the end. I Am Legend is a fascinating instantiation of this theme, saved from being a takeoff on 28 Days Later by its deep exploration of loneliness and humanness.<br /><br />The genetically engineered virus that cured cancer mutated into something that deprived its victims of their skin pigmentation and their ability to control their survival impulses. Those that survive its 90% kill rate turn into dark-seekers, creatures whose skin burns at the touch of light, and whose carnivorous urges compel them to feed on any living animal, including humans. But some intelligence remains; they can set traps, act in coordinated fashion while hunting, train infected dogs to assist them in the kill, catch the eye of a man standing in the sunlight and give a look that says, "you win this one, but wait until dark." We are brought to wishing that they didn't have minds any longer, so hideous their existence, but they do have minds, and the thought of being one of those millions who didn't die is worse than death.<br /><br />Just one percent of the human population is immune to this virus, and one of them is Robert Neville [Will Smith], an Army virologist who finds himself at the epicenter of the outbreak, Long Island. He has no reason to go on. His family was killed trying to evacuate the Island; he broadcasts a call to any other unaffected human and waits every day on the pier at midday for those who hear it to come to him. But no one ever does. But Robert has a will to survive, and that will must be given some purpose, so he constructs a basement lab and continues the search for a cure, accompanied only by his dog, Samantha.<br /><br />I Am Legend is far from perfect. It is, after all, yet another good-scientist-does-evil-by-unleashing-a-virus-that-creates-cannibalistic-humans flick. But it is also about sanity, the human need to have purpose and companionship, the scientist who finds that he also needs faith. Mix those all together, and you have quite an interesting movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Big Will has no problem holding the screen. Will Smith is solid, believable, and entertaining. Setting is done very well. Some intense scenes. Overall extremly great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>The basic premise of this movie is that a virus is unleashed and most of the population on Earth is killed off.<br /><br />Some people do survive because they have a natural immunity to the virus, while many others without a natural immunity to the virus become infected by so called "Dark Seekers", whom are mutant vampire like creatures that only come out at night & attack those that aren't infected.<br /><br />Will Smith carries the movie and is the primary actor in about 90% of "I Am Legend". Smith does a good acting job and plays the part of a military research scientist trying to find a cure/vaccine for the virus to help save others. Smith's character does find a cure for the virus and dies protecting the cure for the virus, hence becoming a legend for the remaining survivors.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>I am a fan of Will Smith, I enjoy watching his movies and generally speaking they never disappoint me, and to an extent I even enjoy some of his music (mostly just the songs he's done for the various movies he's starred in). When the initial posters for "I Am Legend" arrived in theaters and listed the name Will Smith I was already psyched to see it, even though based on the posters I thought the name was the way too long "The Last Man on Earth is Not Alone", but it turned out that was just the tagline, but I still maintain that was a strange marketing strategy by not making the film's title readily visible. Anyways, when the trailers began showing up on the internet and on television I became even more pumped for the movie because it just looked really interesting and cool, and I was intrigued by the fact that based on the previews I still had no clue what exactly Will's character was up against, only that he was the last surviving member of humanity (to his knowledge) and he's fighting for survival against some monstrous person or group of people. So, the movie was released to theaters, I didn't go see it, go figure since I don't see a whole lot of films at the theaters these days, partly because of time and the other is the ever-increasing cost of ticket prices, I just find it easier to wait the extra few months for the DVD release and watch it on my widescreen TV in the comfort of my own home. Finally, it was released to DVD, and after all the various criticisms I had heard, along with some praise, though it seemed like not as many people liked the movie compared to those that disliked it to some degree or just flat-out hated it; I was still interested in seeing the movie and I must say I was not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />"I Am Legend" takes place in the year 2012, as mankind has been essentially wiped out by a deadly virus meant to cure cancer. In place of mankind are these monstrous, mutated beings who are similar to vampires due to their affinity for darkness, sensitivity to light, their attraction to blood, and because they can infect others with their `vampirism' as it were; however, they are not vampires or even zombies for that matter, they are merely mutated and diseased humans who have taken over New York City and possibly the rest of the world. At night they are in charge, but during the day one lone man prowls the streets, Robert Neville (Will Smith) who along with his trusty German Shepherd, Sam, has NYC all to themselves. Robert is a former military virologist who is trying desperately to develop a cure for the disease that he is somehow immune to, while at the same time trying to keep his sanity and hold onto some small sliver of hope that there may possibly be other human survivors out there waiting to be found.<br /><br />After watching "I Am Legend" I can see why some people may have not liked the movie as much as most of Will Smith's previous efforts, because prior to its release no one really knew what to expect from the movie. So, the fact that essentially 85% percent of the movie consists of either Will Smith on screen by himself or with his dog, and no one else to really interact with, could really turn some people off to the overall experience of the movie. In my case, I knew what to expect going into watching the movie, so Will Smith having to act by himself on screen a majority of the time didn't bother me at all, and I was truly impressed by how good he did and just how captivating he made the character of Robert. I believe that even if I hadn't known what to expect in terms of whether there would be other actors featured prominently or just having Will by himself for a majority of the film, I still would have enjoyed the movie all the same.<br /><br />The story for "I Am Legend" is very well-paced and well-written by screenwriters Mark Protosevich ("Poseidon") and Akiva Goldsman ("I, Robot") based on a novel by Richard Matheson. They imbue the story with such heart, intense drama, and a tense, eerie atmosphere that you are instantly drawn into the plight of this lone man roaming the streets searching for a way to survive and to fix past mistakes, and in the end cure the disease that has ravaged the world. I appreciated the way the writers tried to show Robert's mental state as being somewhat disconnected from reality, by having him set up mannequins throughout the city for him to interact with as if they were real people. Also, the connection between Robert and his dog Sam was very genuine and natural, serving as an almost bittersweet connection to Robert's past and the family that he's lost along the way. Many people praised Will Smith for his powerful performance in this movie given the challenge of having to act by himself, and he is completely deserving of any praise he receives for his work here, but by the same token, I would think some praise should go to the writers for being able to craft such an engaging story focusing on one man and his dog, without really being able to rely on dialogue or any kind of interaction with other characters. This is a brilliant job on behalf of the writers and even the novelist, for being able to keep an audiences' attention every step of the way without the usual tools at their disposal for propelling a story onward.<br /><br />From an acting standpoint, there is really only one person to talk about and that's Will Smith, and as I've alluded to somewhat already he did an exemplary job with the role of Robert Neville. Will is a magnetic presence onscreen in every movie I've seen him in, but normally he's able to play off of other actors in the scene, but here he's pretty much on his own or with a dog, aside from a few key flashbacks that shed some light on his previous life before the virus struck, so his ability is definitely worthy of praise. An incredible performance for Will, and one that I'm sure wasn't nearly as easy as some of his other past performances might have been, but he handled the isolation onscreen very well, and conveyed the characters deep sense of loss in a way that was very natural yet didn't make the character seem suicidal or depressed, which would have most likely not played well with most audiences, just desperate which was very appropriate for the circumstances Robert has found himself in.<br /><br />"I Am Legend" is a very entertaining movie that remains engaging from start to finish even though the focus is primarily on Will Smith and his dog, and not much else. Director Francis Lawrence ("Constantine") has really knocked it out of the park with this movie; he's definitely come along way from shooting music videos for MTV. Some have likened this movie to Tom Hanks' survivalist film "Castaway" due to his character being alone on an island except for a volleyball named Wilson as a companion. I can see the similarity between the two movies in that both movies featured a lead actor who was forced to act by himself for a majority of the film, but that's pretty much where the similarities end. Unlike "Castaway" which was a good movie, but not great, I feel "I Am Legend" is a great movie and one I will watch more than once. This movie isn't for everybody, but if you kind of know what you're going into prior to seeing the movie, you may end up enjoying it more, no guarantees though.<br /><br />"I Am Legend" is rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>The film looks beautiful.  The NY landscape is absolutely amazing.  Smith is actually perfect in this film.  This perfomance is, I think, his best. But, this is no action-packed, thrill-a-minute movie.  In fact is is sometimes dull and really quite depressing.  In fact, I think the film lets smith down as it becomes a bit clunky as it goes on.  Otherwise, he would have been considered award worthy.  And that german shepherd - wow!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The long in development I Am Legend is a flawed yet entertaining adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic horror novel, and while this is undoubtedly the best version of Matheson's work to be filmed (don't get me started on The Omega Man), the potential for what I Am Legend could have been makes it slightly disappointing.  Will Smith stars as military scientist Robert Neville, who very well may be the last man on Earth.  Along with his dog Sam, Neville searches for a way to save humanity, which has been reduced to a vampiric race after a cancer vaccine went awry three years earlier.  Where I Am Legend works is first and foremost with Smith, who is so good as the isolated, lonely, and desperate Neville that he alone will keep you glued to the screen.  Smith's performance ranks as one of his best, as sometimes we forget just how good an actor the man is, he reminds us again here.  The visions of a desolate, unpopulated New York City is also one of the film's strengths, offering some very impressive visuals.  Where I Am Legend fails however is with the directing of Constantine director Frances Lawrence, whose action scenes are made worse thanks to some surprisingly lacking digital effects work.  I Am Legend could really have been something special here, regardless of how much it departs from Matheson's book, but alas, it just isn't.  Still though, I Am Legend isn't bad one bit, and the alternate theatrical cut included in this two-disc set is even better than the regular cut.  All in all, I Am Legend is definitely worth a look whether you are a fan of Will Smith's or a fan of Matheson's work, but be prepared to start thinking of what could have been after the credits start rolling.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed watching this movie.  There were a few part where I jump alittle.  If you like Will Smith, or a good Scifi type of movie, then this is a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>Recently we went to see I Am Legend.<br /><br />Based on a novel which I believe is of the same name, it tells the tale of a military doctor who is one of the few survivors of a plague, which has wiped out most of humanity, and turned most of the rest of the population into a pack of ravenous but daylight-fearing zombies. The doctor's manic mission is to find a cure for plague. He is on his own, except for his trusted dog, left behind by his family when they fled New York.<br /><br />The doctor is played by Will Smith, and he has to carry most of the movie on his own. And carry it he does. He could have been manic or over-the-top, but he kept things reserved, showing the quiet warping of personality associated with imposed isolation for years.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect. The zombies are too McGuffin-like, and the film feels a little shorter than it should have been as a result. Nevertheless, the movie was enjoyable, and provided some good scares too.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Give the Oscar to Will Smith, but send his little daughter to acting school!  I thought I had seen the bottom of the Smith barrel when Jaden lit up the screen in last year's homeless but not hopeless saga THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, but I had not reckoned that Will would put little Willow into a movie where vampires smash into limo windows trying to eat her!  Well, better her than another more impressionable child actor I guess.  Is this how Peter and Jane Fonda started out, widenings in their dad's demographic?  The little white boy who arrives in the present day is nothing to write home about however.  They never did explain to me where he'd come from, just told him to keep shuffling his food across his plate, from one end to the other, over and over, in an attempt to suggest some of the post traumatic stress of spending whole days with Alice Braga, niece of veteran Brazilian bombshell Sonia Braga, sadly missed in these days of "the next generation."<br /><br />More importantly the movie delivers plenty of action and suspense, till the last third where it all goes down the drain.  Director Francis Lawrence gets a wrenching performance out of his star, and the designers convincingly show us an apocalyptic and haunted, lonely New York, something Leonard Bernstein might have written symphonies about.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />Hate the emphasis on church in the picture, as the last reels dissolve into a debate between Will Smith and Alice Braga about does God exist or is He just an illusion or worse, out to get us.<br /><br />It was all very well in THE VILLAGE, but why repeat it here in the closing shots of I AM LEGEND.  Why do we have to see that church steeple, is it supposed to make us feel, OK, we're in good hands now?  Even in THE NEW WORLD, when John Smith returns to Jamestown and sees everyone dying of hunger, the church steeple is broken and battered.  Do the vampires of I AM LEGEND respect crucifixes the way vampires in Hammer horror do?  I wonder.  Maybe something of this atavistic belief survives into the present era of post-28 DAYS LATER laterness.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS.

Very well done.<br /><br />2) Will Smith has matured into a very good actor and did well in this film.<br /><br />3) The film borrowed heavily from the Vincent Price film version of this sci-fi classic which is a good thing.<br /><br />Now the BAD..........<br /><br />1) CGI "dark seekers".<br />Hollywood needs to put away the "gee-whiz" gimmickery and sometimes focus on real film making again.<br />These cartoon-looking "monsters" looked so goofy and like the Zombies in the old SEGA video game "House of the Dead" that any feeling of dread and gloom that were established by the great scenery was lost.<br /><br />CGI is still not to the level technologically where it can be used for humans or characters meant to strike a chord of reality or feeling.<br />That's what killed the HULK, recent remake of KING KONG and some other recent films.<br /><br />You simply can't connect or feel "what I am seeing is real" when they are visually divorced from reality.<br /><br />Smith's other film "I-ROBOT" suffered that same problem.<br /><br />2) SPOILER ALERT -<br />...<br />...<br />....<br />....<br />....<br />...<br />When Sam, the dog dies...... so does the apparent pacing of the movie.<br />Others have had the same comment on here.... It seems the 2nd half of the movie pales in comparison to the first.<br /><br />The plot device used to get rid of Sam, was too contrived.<br />ie.... Smith's character get's snared in a trap.<br />Then awakens just at sunset.<br />When he gets down... you ask yourself ............... Okay Buddy why don't you hop on your one good leg ??<br />But NO.... he drags  across the ground until the dark seekers come out and attack them.... THEN afterwards of course when the damage is done, he is able to limp on that same leg and even carry Sam.<br /><br />My wife kept complaining.... "Great the dog dies because he is too stupid to hop on his one good leg and get out of there. They should have re-shot that scene differently".<br /><br />In summary it seems they had the budget to work with, but somehow the film fell FLAT and was OK..... but it is not memorable and will probably be forgotten with time.<br /><br />Even allowing for it's old age.... We feel the 1956 Vincent Price version of this film "Last Man On Earth" actually had a stronger feeling of pathos than this remake.<br /><br />But this new film COULD have been a classic if they maintained the mood of the first 40 minutes and did not turn the movie into a CGI fun-fest<br /><br />PS...<br />The ALTERNATE ENDING is FAR SUPERIOR to the theatrical "Happy Hollywood" ending and while not identical to the message of the novel, does both capture the general message best and also matches the mood of the rest of the film.<br />The theatrical ending really weakened the film and seems like a mismatch tacked on at the end.<br />The "alternate ending" alone boosts the rating of this film 1-2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>I LIKE THIS MOVIE AND THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT.

But can't we see a few more original films on the big screen rather than mulling over the same ones year after year? Is that asking too much? Perhaps it is.<br /><br />The post-apocalyptic science fiction genre has been done to death (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MDFTHE">Night of the Comet</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQNAG">Dawn of the Dead</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731401">Outbreak</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZ908Y">The Quiet Earth</a>). And here in I AM LEGEND, we get a remake of the Charlton Heston film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VAHR1E">The Omega Man</a>. Growing up, I loved The Omega Man. I often wondered what it'd be like to be the last man on Earth; at least the last "normal" man on Earth. The genre wasn't yet tired in 1971 and I wasn't even into my teens. But since then not-just-a-small-number of similar cinematic films have come out, bombarding movie watchers with the same ol' theme over and over and over again (see my partial list above).<br /><br />Will Smith (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6U0E2">The Pursuit of Happyness</a>) takes on the lead role as Dr. Robert Neville, the seemingly sole survivor of a plague that has wiped out 99% of humanity, turning the remaining 1% into cannibalistic zombie-vampires who burn up if exposed to sunlight; they roam New York's desolate streets at night in search of fresh meat. A cure for cancer has sparked a new virus that started humanity's die-off, and these scenes are given frequent flashbacks during the movie. We also get to see Dr. Neville's responsibility for trying to find a cure via the military (whom he works for before everyone keels over).<br /><br />With Dr. Neville is a trusty sidekick named Sam, a German Shepherd with acute senses. His canine abilities extend to detecting vampire-zombies, and to helping Neville battle the complete aloneness that rattles around his psyche. This is undoubtedly one of the strongest elements of the film. Watching Dr. Neville walk into a video rental store and speak to the mannequins he has set up is an honest portrayal that would hit any human who had only a dog to speak with.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />When Sam-the-Dog dies (or rather when Dr. Neville is forced to kill him), it is a blow too deep and the good doctor goes out to meet up and kill as many of the nightstalkers as he can before they kill him. That's when he meets up with two young people (an older sister and younger brother) who save Neville from himself and tell him of a fantasy safe zone somewhere in the hills of Vermont. Neville has to decide what to believe in as the monsters close in on his home and threaten not only himself, but his two new god-fearing humans. The ending is pretty weak but set up nicely in a visual way.<br /><br />END SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />Having hoisted such terrible news as "unoriginal" on I Am Legend, one cannot deny two key elements that make this film a positive experience. First is the extremely creepy feeling one gets when looking at a vacant New York City. The weeds growing up from cracks in the pavement. Wild deer migrating through empty car-riddled streets. Everywhere there's a vision of what once was human inhabitation and is now just a rotting shell. That was a painfully great set of scenes. Secondly is Will Smith. Similar to Tom Hanks' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IJ">Cast Away</a>, Smith carries the entire film and does so with effortless precision. The losses he experiences are tremendous, and Smith pulls us in and forces us to feel the pain of one man left alone for far too long. This is most evident when dealing with Sam-the-Dog and his encounters with a pretty mannequin that he starts to humanize in his mind.<br /><br />Some might be able to wiggle past this film's unoriginality factor, and if they can, I applaud them. They probably enjoyed the movie (minus the ending) much better than I was able. But if you're like me, and desire something fresh in the cinema, you'll probably have similar feelings.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>A pretty good zombie movie, with Will Smith professing amazing acting prowess. His loneliness, desperation, and conviction are extraordinary. The bond between Smith and the German Shepherd is apparent. As far as apocalyptic movies go, this is a pretty good one.</p></br><a href="../users/A30IP5D5DLHRPA.html">A30IP5D5DLHRPA</a><br/><p>I Am Legend is one of the films I greatly anticipated for Winter 2007 and having just emerged from the theater I feel as though a great deal is needed.  Perhaps my hopes were just too high but let's look at this point by point.<br /><br />I Am Legend is roughly take 6 at the original novel of the same name.  The Omega Man is probably the most popular and, for fans of that movie and older generations, this will prove very disappointing as both films derive multiple themes from the book such as Sam the dog, a woman entering Neville's life, etc, etc.  "IAL" just was not unique enough to satisfy certain fans.  For the general audience, however, there are some redeeming qualities.<br /><br />The visual were very nice.  New York city was reproduced superbly if not used outright as several blocks were closed off for the filming; kudos.  The "monsters" were kind of freaky but I almost felt a humanistic touch to them as one seemed to express remorse for losing one of his kind (I thought she was his daughter or something) but it's not expanded on.<br /><br />The acting, which comprises almost solely on Will Smith, is superb.  I still am having trouble finding a movie Will Smith acted poorly in every movie he is in I think about seeing just on that basis.  He performs well as a man living almost entirely alone for several years but remains diligent in his tasks.<br /><br />The story had potential.  It deviated slightly from the book in terms of the ending but I think almost for the better.  I'm glad the directors took a different approach to the Twilight Zone-esque themes of vampires that the original book took.  DESPITE ALL THIS, the movie was TOO SHORT.  It was barely 90 minutes (I think) and sooo much more could've been explained, expanded upon or even made somewhat kewl.  The ending came too quick and very anti-climatic almost to the bewilderment of the audience.  They didn't even bother to explain how certain things came to be and that really bothered me.<br /><br />The story is similar to War of the Worlds only the movie didn't suck as much; too many holes, not enough time.  IAL could've easily been an epic but directors settled for a 90-minute money bagger and I'm quite disappointed.  The movie started out awesome but just fell short at the end.<br /><br />I will still buy this on DVD when it comes out but for theater goers I must give a warning that there are holes.  Also, THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM.  Several people tried to ward me off due to "horror-elements."  This is not the case.  If anything, it is a thriller.  It is appropriate for most audiences although I wouldn't bring too young of kids.<br /><br />All in all, a B-.  Diss marks for lack of story and length.  It kills the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>Since the mid 90s Hollywood has really been in a rut; everything has to be bigger and louder and basic storytelling has gone out the window. But I'm not gonna totally knock Hollywood they do sometimes get it right. It's just they don't produce the movies they once did. I hoped I Am Legend would be one of the few that worked well, but when all was said and done Hollywood dropped the ball again. I Am Legend had potential to be a really chilling movie, but it never reaches that level.<br /><br />First up I have to mention Will Smith who plays Robert Neville; it's pretty much a one man show and more than half the movie is just Will Smith and his dog. I'll give major credit to Smith who really does a great job at carrying the movie. In general the movies Will Smith does really don't appeal to me, but he is a fantastic actor and does one hell of a job here.<br /><br />I Am Legend is based off the Richard Matheson novel and the screenplay was written by Mark Protosevich & Akiva Goldsman and it's never really interesting. It's not easy to write a screenplay and even harder when you have pretty much one character through a majority of the movie. The concept of the movie is excellent, but their screenplay just doesn't really work. It's not terrible by any means, just isn't all that good. But with the right director it could have possibly worked.<br /><br />Francis Lawrence steps into the director's chair and fails at brining any tension or adventure. The pacing often lacks and he never really gets much going and the action scenes come out weak. Seeing the deserted Manhattan streets is sort creepy as a New Yorker and seeing that makes for a semi chilling moment, but is never as creepy as it could have been. But after a while those shots become tiresome. I never felt that whole end of the world vibe; one of the most chilling scenes in recent memory was the deserted London streets in 28 Days Later, but here with I Am Legend you never get that chilling vibe.<br /><br />The screenplay was flawed, but with the right director I think the movie could have worked. I just never felt any tension, the deserted Manhattan streets are never as chilling as it should have been and the action scenes fail at brining much excitement. The ending was very anti-climatic. What could have been a powerful scene feels rushed and just falls flat.<br /><br />The biggest downfall of the movie is the CGI; first off I really don't like CGI, but depending on the movie I can tolerate it. With a 150-million dollar budget one would think the F/X would come out good, but nope it's terrible and really brings the movie down. I've seen movies done on a much lower budget that ranges from 2-5-million with CGI and it looks on par with this. I've seen movies done under a million that have far better F/X. With the budget I Am Legend had there is no excuse for such shoddy F/X.<br /><br />I Am Legend is just too Hollywood stylized; in some ways it's better than a lot of what's out there. While this does have action scenes it's not done as much as I thought it would be. I expected mindless action scene over and over again and it wasn't. So that's a good thing, but action or not it's too stylized. A movie like this needs more of a gritty look. Again there was potential here, but when all is said and done I Am Legend just lacks in tension and excitement.<br /><br />If you are into big time Hollywood productions odds are I Am Legend will get the job done and you'll enjoy the movie, but for the rest of us we'll mostly be bored. I haven't seen The Omega Man, which is based off the Matheson novel and I Am Legend follows that movie, but I have seen The Last Man on Earth, which is also based off the Matheson novel. My opinion skip this one and check out The Last Man on Earth, while flawed it's far better than this. But again for those who enjoy Hollywood productions you'll probably like this, but the rest will be bored at another Hollywood mishap.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>In just a couple of years, cancer will be cured via a mutated version of the measles virus...reprogrammed to destroy cancer. Yet just three years after that, mankind will be all but extinct, as the virus has mutated yet again to where it either kills the person carrying it or turns that person into a type of light-fearing zombie set on eating living flesh of any kind. In Manhattan, the lone "normal" survivor is Dr. Robert Neville, who coincidentally was the military scientist who was madly working on a cure as all of society crumbled around him. He continues to work on a cure...even when it seems there might not be any reason one is needed. Accompanied only by his faithful canine companion Sam, he roams the streets of NYC, hunting for deer, gathering supplies, renting DVDs and sending out an AM signal encouraging others to come to him. Oh, and occasionally ensnaring a zombie so that he can take it back to his lab to try his latest serum on it.<br /><br />That's the premise in a nutshell. You might be picking up on just a little cynicism in my description, because the movie invites it. It throws out a few tidbits about exactly what has happened to mankind and the virus (and also to many other species), yet the puzzle pieces we pick up don't quite make a full puzzle and sometimes the pieces don't seem to be to the same puzzle.<br /><br />Many, many movie have been made about the last remnants of mankind. A good recent example is the powerful CHILDREN OF MEN. We have a society that has apparently lost the ability to produce offspring. That's all we are told...no other details about how this has happened. It just has...and we see the consequences on society and on the very soul of mankind. If the movie had let little details trickle out...we would have tried to piece them together and no doubt we would have been left frustrated. Instead, we just have to accept it, and go where the movie takes us.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND throws out some tidbits and we try to assemble them into a cohesive narrative. But it can't be done. When the film was over, we spent our time trying to make sense of the little bits, instead of talking about the grand scheme of things...the movie itself.<br /><br />And there IS much to admire in the movie. Honestly, I have never seen CGI used more effectively to create a city. In Peter Jackson's KING KONG, he used CGI to recreate a Great Depression-era NYC. It was beautiful and convincing...but the abandoned Manhattan that we see in I AM LEGEND is even more seamless. You almost never can tell where a real set blends with a computer generated one. The city is empty, the bridges are destroyed, weeds grow everywhere and deer run everywhere. It's actually a pretty startling accomplishment, and seeing Will Smith driving all through these streets that should be jammed with people, traffic, lights, energy but instead are like a metropolitan dust bowl is pretty scary. And the effects are really convincing. Even the CG deer (and the lions who appear, no doubt having escaped from the Central Park Zoo) look amazingly convincing.<br /><br />And Will Smith gives a committed performance. He's not a great actor, but he is a charismatic presence...which in a film like this, where he's the ONLY person on screen for huge chunks of time, is even more important. We have to see the world almost entirely through his eyes, and Smith does an outstanding job in showing us the loneliness he feels all the time and the insanity that is lurking just around the corner. Smith is aided in his work by Sam, a wonderful German Shepherd. Sam is not one of these dogs who has been trained to cock his head to the side all the time and look like he understands every word being spoken. He's not "cute." He looks like a dog you or I could own...smart, but also still just a dog. He is loyal to a fault, but also inadvertently nearly gets his master killed in an amazingly tense scene in a dark warehouse where we first encounter the zombies. So I guess I'm saying Sam gives a naturalistic performance! Kudos to his trainers, and even to Smith, who works with Sam like a man who owns a DOG and not some unnaturally sensitive creature.<br /><br />There are some exciting scenes, no doubt. And as we would expect, the film has a huge final confrontation between Smith and a marauding horde of zombies. In many ways, it's a good scene...lots of noise, close calls, explosions and so forth. But sadly, where the CG that created NYC is nearly perfect, the filmmakers chose to make the zombies CG creations as well, and not for one moment do these creatures look physical. They are obvious CG creations...and that saps so much drama from the film. And I have to wonder WHY they did it? Certainly there are amazing things that can be done with makeup...and real people could have done a most of the things the zombies do. It was a serious blunder, in my opinion.<br /><br />I won't tell you any more of the plot, but suffice it to say that at the end, just a few too many "oh, isn't that convenient" moments pop up...and our willingness to suspend disbelief crumbles a bit. I would say that the first hour or so are really excellent, gripping, convincing and well-acted. The final 25 minutes or so are contrived and a bit awkward. It's like someone letting out the air from a very nice balloon.<br /><br />It's still a movie worth seeing. It's brisk enough to show you a good time...but when I left, my first thought was that the film could have been so much more. And then my mind turned to puzzling out all the inconsistencies in the back story. Don't let yourself be sucked in by those, and maybe you'll enjoy it more!!  3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.<br /><br />And what's more.  I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice.  He does "big budget" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal.  His "Wild Wild West", "Independence Day", "Men in Black", "I Robot", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.<br /><br />"Hitch" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.  Any actor could have replaced him in all those films of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me.  I guess I just don't care for his choices in his movie career.  But, I guess he's not hurtin'.  America eats this crap up.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "I Am Legend" starring Will Smith. I got it at Wal-Mart off the five-dollar rack. First of all, I was unaware of the movie or the book on which it was based. Second, my feelings for the movie are extremely mixed. First, my reaction to the discovery of a cancer cure which morphs into a rabies-like virus and wipes out the Manhattan population is skeptical, to say the least. Well, I know this is unadulterated fiction, so I'll try to give it some slack. But secondly, the depiction of Manhattan as a devastated city is exceptionally good and I'm left wondering how in the world did they ever do it? The streets are cluttered with cars as if everything was just abandoned after the sounding of an alarm. After three years, all the streets are overgrown with mature-sized weeds growing from cracks in the pavement wherever Smith might go, and he covers a lot of territory. The city looks completely abandoned and in bad decay. Well Done! Whoever put this together ought to get an award of some type. And, alas, from this as a start, I would expect a really good movie to follow.<br /><br />Well, this well-crafted scene just doesn't hold up. Smith has an office-laboratory where he labors to save the world and it is fully electrified. Full lighted. All the machines work. It even has a working TV. And the computer works, including the internet. And his car works fine as he motors about the city, never getting low on gas, although he's been there three years. And he sends a broadcast out over the airwaves of the city ever day trying to find out if anyone else might be there. Huh? How could this be? It just doesn't wash. All of a sudden I find myself involved in a story I couldn't possibly believe. At about this point, there's the appearance of human-like monsters and monster dogs which are infected with a rabies-like virus and are insanely violent and after his hide. I'm sorry folks, the story just lost me totally and I just couldn't bear the last half.<br /><br />The movie had promise. Too bad the last half wasn't up to the first half. As it is, I'd have to congratulate some of the special effects people (the NYC scene)  and let the others know what an awful job they did (the monsters). What an incongruent mix! Who's responsible for this mess anyway?. Well, I'd have to say that Smith's acting was fairly good. My condolences to him for being stuck in such a preposterous script.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>Pretty good adaptation of the novel by Richard Matheson, modernized and great idea to set it in NYC.  And the creatures were great.  But then the ending came, and I wanted to .....Hollywood bs.  Stick to the novel for a change.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>I am Legend is an interesting sci-fi conceit - a vaccine to cure cancer goes horrifically wrong - a viral strain leads to the formation of human mutant grotesques who have attacked and eaten all the other humans on earth. Will Smith is the only survivor (this is all conveyed at face value in the first moments of the film, for viewers of truncated IQ, don't worry, you don't have to think too hard to work it out).<br /><br />Will Smith (aka Robert Neville, a scientist with military connections) is the only man left on a post human manhattan - overgrown with weeds, buildings falling into decay and blasted bridges (the Brooklyn Bridge, despite being a suspension bridge, only seems to have lost its middle span). Leaping deer and barking dogs roam around the island by day, more sinister creatures prevail at night (the post human mutants) so Neville has to sleep cradling a gun in his bath in his heavily fortified apartment with only Sam, his faithful German shepherd for company).<br /><br />Neville, despite being the only human around, still manages to pick up electricity and fresh water. (He also works out fanatically to keep his abs sharp, and doesn't let his hair grow long or grow a scruffy beard, despite that fact that there are no women left to justify all that grooming). He goes slightly nuts devoid of human company, talking to his dog, and broadcasting on the airwaves to see if anyone is around.<br /><br />The first moments of the film have some interesting scenes in the lab as Neville experiments on gollumesque GCI creatures to see if he can establish why the cancer cure went wrong, and how he can reverse the strain and keep human life going in the most unpromising of circumstances. Dangers and madness assail Neville each day. He befriends two mannequins in a DVD store, and is disturbed to discover they have moved outside the store one morning. He loses his beloved dog, Sam, after he is bitten by mutant dogs who are released after a snare trap disables Neville and has to put him down. His experiments to cure the mutant grotesques and restore human life constantly founder. He is constantly threatened by the grotesque creatures who have done for everyone else who attack him in all manner of ghoulish CGI ways. Through flashbacks it is revealed that his attempts to airlift his family out of Manhattan in the US exodus from Saigon type scenes failed, and his family have all perished, along with he presumes every other human on earth.<br /><br />Being Hollywood, light comes in (sadly around the same moment as the budget clearly runs out and the director realised the movie needs to wrap up in a swift conclusion having blown a cool $15 million on a Brooklyn Bridge scene).  Neville encounters other people who save him after an attack - a woman and her son who survived the disaster after being on an Brazilian Red Cross ship. Together, they work on an experiment to cure a mutant woman. This time it works, but Neville tragically perishes as the compound is attacked by CGIs). However he justifies his legend status by saving their lives to recreate humanity in the image of a Ronald Reagan wet dream - a beautiful clapboard village in tree dappled Vermont.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>Taut, Tight, Gripping - GOOD!<br /><br />The law of unintended consequences shows its darker side in this futuristic nightmare.  A heralded "cure" for cancer ends up becoming a deadly virus that wipes out most of human life.  Worse, the virus transforms its victims into rampaging vampires.<br /><br />(Don't you hate it when that happens?)  Bummer!<br /><br />Will Smith is the sole survivor, or so he thought ... until he encounters a young woman and her child en route to a rumored survivor's colony in Vermont.  The special effects of post-apocalyptic New York City are arresting, visually evocative of the recent TV special, "Earth Without People."<br /><br />Can Smith find a cure for the virus?  Can he survive to discover it?  Will the woman and child make it to Vermont?  Will they find any "survivor colony" there or is it just a rumor?  You'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />This movie was better than I expected.<br /><br />P.S.  The German Shepherd should get the Oscar for best supporting canine.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>In high school I first saw the "Omega Man", Charlton Hesston's version of this story. It has remained one of my favorite apocalyptic films, with some pretty wry humor thrown in. When my wife and I went to see this film over Christmas break at the show, I had high hopes, and I was entranced until the final 30 minutes of the film, and then I was what????<br /><br />The movie spent such a long time effectively building sympathy for the protagonist, and then threw it all away by rushing the end. And without giving away the end, the alternative conclusion available on the disk 2 versions, while maybe a bit hokey, was much more satisfying and enjoyable.<br /><br />So my advice is if you are going to buy Legend, get this Two disk special edition</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>From the moment that the Fresh Prince of Bel Air bounds across your line of vision, complete with a sniper rifle and about four thousand CGI deer (oh! and also a pride of fake lions...), you'd be very forgiven for thinking that "I Am Legend" is going to be Just Another Action Movie. Indeed, the glaring awfulness of the computer-rendered deer is enough to make you forget all about the beautiful post-plague New York cityscapes (in themselves worthy of huge praise, they're chilling and very impressive), the thitherto-great performance by Smith as a man hounded by loneliness and personal demons, and the very cute Alsatian by his side.<br /><br />But with further viewing, "I Am Legend" becomes much, much better - for the most part - and is, by the time the credits roll, not Just Another Action Movie, but something more enjoyable - if two-dimensional.<br /><br />The Good: Smith gives a gorgeous, nuanced performance as plague survivor Robert Neville - when he's allowed to act, that is. When he's forced to shoot, run, chase, do action - he reverts to a horrible sort of MIB stereotype - but during Robert Neville's more emotionally complex scenes he's actually excellent. Director Francis Lawerence does great things with the aforementioned bare New York of the future, and we can really sense the isolation and loneliness of Neville's plight. And yes, there are several worthwhile "jump" moments, too, with which to keep the action moving along nicely. It's just a shame that most of the action is hackneyed - which leads me to<br /><br />The Bad: Boring chase & evade sequences and frankly ridiculous computer animations (the animals are a minor offender: the crown of stupidity in this case belongs squarely planted on the heads of the totally unrealistic, poorly-animated Zombies) ruin the great work of Smith and his director in "I Am Legend". Also, the ending is very hackneyed - I'm not sure if it's reflective of the novel since I haven't read it - but as a movie, we've seen it all before.<br /><br />Still, criticisms notwithstanding, "I Am Legend" is a worthwhile way to pass an evening's viewing: I wouldn't buy the DVD because no amount of extras could make up for the fact that, while enjoyable enough with all-too-brief moments of excellence, "I Am Legend" is just not engaging enough to watch twice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>There are a few sublime moments in "I Am Legend" that make you realize just how amazing a science fiction film can be. The genre has long been my favorite, and even though this isn't a sci-fi film in the strictest sense of the term, it has shades of the genre all through it.<br /><br />Prime moments include Will Smith entering a dark building in search of his dog, and then battling with monsters he never knew existed (literally). There is one particularly effective scene, where Will Smith knows that his dog has been 'infected', watches his dog turn into a monster before his eyes, and then kills it with his bare hands. The entire sequence plays out like a subdued exercise in human tolerance and reaction - and it was carried out superbly by Will Smith.<br /><br />In fact, it is Smiths' amazing screen presence and top-notch acting ability that makes this film as good as it is. However, he is let down by a very weak script, a nonsensical ending, and is paired opposite a tepid actress in the second half who reduces the film to a parody of itself. My primary problem with the second half is that it entirely undid all the solemn promise the first half did. The climax is a huge group of monsters (very poor CGI here) trying to attack Smith, who in turn destroys himself and the facility so that the monsters perish as well. This 'Save the World' sentiment has been overdone in way too many Hollywood films, and it just didnt work here.<br /><br />The best parts of 'I Am Legend' are when it slows down to a quiet, sombre pace. The first hour, with its languid passages of just Will Smith walking and bonding with his dog are the most poignant, and the most real. This is a one-man movie, and its a pity that when it moves away from that, it doesn't work. By no means a classic, or even a 'very good film', but this is one movie well worth watching - it could have been much, much worse.<br /><br />Three Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>Boring, cheesy, riddled with plot holes and leaps of logic, atrociously bad CGI, and poorly written.  I'm not going to delve into the plot because you can read the hundreds of other reviews on Amazon for that.  I'm simply doing my duty bringing the over-all rating of this disaster down.<br /><br />The special edition discs do however make great drink coasters so all is not lost for your ~$20.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I have read several stories by Richard Matheson but not I Am Legend, so I do not have any expectations but I can unequivocally say that a book can never be transitioned to the screen as written; telling a visual story is far different from developing a story on the printed page.  For my wife and me I Am Legend is a terrific thriller that does not let up.  Will Smith gives an excellent performance as Robert Neville who decides to remain behind as Manhattan is cut off from the rest of the world to battle a man-made virus. The emotion level that he reaches in his portrayal beautifully conveys the commitment of his character to find a cure that will save those infected by the virus.  His relationship and devotion to Sam the German Shepard is a joy to watch and becomes distressing for us when Sam succumbs to the virus.<br /><br />Although other reviewers found the film slow I liked the pacing.  First we learn what it is like being the last human on Manhattan by observing Robert Neville performing his everyday chores and activities. We get to know him.  Flashbacks tell the story of Neville's family and their escape from New York into the supposedly safe are beyond.  He has been on his own, alone except for Sam, for three years, and it is the emotional toll, his desperation for someone to talk with, that Will Smith makes so convincing.  He does not meet another human being until the last quarter of the film when Anna saves him from the infected.  When he finally meets Anna, Neville finds it a bit hard to communicate right away and finds her optimism that anyone has survived to be doubtful.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Will Smith's daughter, Willow, and Salli Richardson as Neville's wife, very brief but nicely played roles.  Although I have seen several virus/zombie films like 28 Days Later and the Dead series by Romero I did find the creatures in this film rather creepy.  The scene where Sam follows a deer into a building held a lot of suspense for me.  The creatures do look a bit unreal sometimes and I took them all to be CGI generated until I learned that someone actually played the "Alpha-Male" that attempts to capture Neville.  There are some things about the film that do stretch the imagination a little.  My wife was wondering how destroying the bridges into Manhattan would stop people from getting off the island: couldn't someone build a raft or simply swim.  Was Anna on Manhattan the entire time or did she travel to the island?  There are a few questions like this that are not essential to the story but make one wonder, and require a book to answer all of the sub-plots.<br /><br />I Am Legend is a film that requires more than one viewing to take in marvelous design of a New York being taken over by nature and I think one would be better able to see all of the facets in Will Smith's performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Richard Matheson's 1954 novel "I Am Legend" is universally, and rightly, considered a touchstone in modern horror and science fiction literature.  Its story of one man's fight for survival in a world of undead caused by a horrific plague has been the offspring for countless cinematic variations (e.g., NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and 28 DAYS LATER), and two overt cinematic adaptations--1964's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with Vincent Price); and 1971's THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston).  And now, in our time, it is Will Smith's turn to take up the role of humankind's last best hope in this third adaptation of Matheson's book, using its original title this time.<br /><br />Smith stars as Robert Neville, a virologist who had, in the year 2009, played a pivotal role in the development of a viral cure for cancer that instead turned into a violent plague that decimated the world.  Now, in the year 2012, he roams the deserted streets of the Big Apple with his trusted dog Samantha, foraging for supplies, sending out radio calls into the void in the off-chance that there are real survivors out there--and getting back to his townhouse before nightfall.  For it is nightfall that the Dark Seekers, those plague survivors who have turned into horrible mutants, come out to make his life a living hell.<br /><br />Smith's rationale for staying alive amidst all this horror is the development of a vaccine that can reverse the spread of the virus--a vaccine that he tries on Dark Seekers that he captures.  It also helps him maintain his sanity, as he has terrible flashbacks to the beginnings of the plague.  Once he encounters a totally normal woman (Alice Braga) who has survived in a colony in Vermont, he sees a ray of hope for humanity.  But will he be able to make the promise he made to himself years before come true?<br /><br />It has to be said that, much like the two other films based on it, I AM LEGEND strays significantly from its source material (the monsters in the book are vampires, and the setting is Los Angeles, not New York).  Indeed, this third version takes its cue as much from the John Corrington/Joyce Corrington screenplay of THE OMEGA MAN as it does from Matheson's book, particularly in Smith's attempt to develop a cure for the plague.  Also, the Dark Seekers, as they are conceived, look a little too much like what they really are, namely CGI creations, as opposed to the pale vampires of THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, or the Manson-like mutant cult of THE OMEGA MAN.<br /><br />All the same however, I AM LEGEND works well enough because Smith, who holds the screen all by himself for three-fourths of its running time, is able to convince us of his character's situation--concern; panic; horror; and much more.  Though some of the special effects are a tad bit excessive on occasion, director Francis Lawrence and screenwriters Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevitch manage to conjure up enought suspenseful situations to make this enterprise more than tolerable, and on many occasions very frightening.<br /><br />It may be that Matheson's book is unfilmable the way Matheson wrote it, what with Hollywood's concern for thrills and chills at the expense of the novel's psychological and scientific horror.  But Smith's performance and the scenes of a completely deserted Big Apple are more than enough to paper over the flaws, and make I AM LEGEND a very good cross of horror and science fiction the likes of which have not really been seen in Hollywood for quite some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>First, I am going to say that if you want an objective review, you'd better read a different review of this film. I went to the theaters as someone who:<br /><br />1.Had read the book, loved it and knew that Will Smith was probably not going to do an exact recreation of that book. That was fine by me. I can accept artistic license, in this case.<br /><br />2.Is a huge fan of Will Smith. I could probably listen to him read the phone book, name by name.<br /><br />3. Loves apocalyptic, vampire and similar movies, even some that others would consider cheesy, campy or just plain dumb.<br /><br />So there are my disclaimers, right up front. If you read on, you do so at your own risk...or because you have a similar mindset. But don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />I do suggest that you consider the fact that this book has been considered very hard to put on the screen - and rightly so, as far as I'm concerned. The book, a post-apocalyptic tale of one man surrounded by vampire types - is one of my favorites and I've read and reread it many times. However, I wondered how it'd work as a film adaptation.<br /><br />It isn't true to the book, not in the way a movie like To Kill A Mockingbird or The Yearling attempts to be true to the source material. Even so, I'd recommend this movie. I intend to see it again. Will Smith, generally very watchable on screen, doesn't disappoint and he reveals the unraveling of a man who is in the most desperate of circumstances, unhinged, not sure who is friend or foe or even the complete situation.<br /><br />Smith has the added challenge of appearing as a solo performer for a huge part of the film, a challenge in itself. He held my attention, utterly.<br /><br />Maybe I missed it but I never got the sense that the movie explained why or how there was an illness or disease that wiped out much of the world. Maybe a mutated virus? The cause isn't as important as the situation, a truly ghastly one, one man left amongst a group of vampirish types, crazy and demented.<br /><br /> I couldn't keep my eyes off of Smith's face as he showed a range of emotions, reminding me that the man is an extremely talented actor. If you focus only on the accuracy of the translation of book to film, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment but if you can let that go....and take this film for what it is...and accept the vision of the director and the acting talents of Smith, you'll be in for one wonderful ride (read my disclaimers above first).<br /><br />Also, I do have to note that the CG special effects bothered me some. I'm not a huge fan of those. Yet I still intend to see the film again, allowing my selective focus to hone in on the areas of the film I loved.<br /><br />I happened to really like 28 Days Later so this might be the type of film that fans of that movie would like, too.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>Robert Neville (Smith) is a scientist who has trapped himself the quarantined city of New York, along with his dog.

He is superb in what may be his best dramatic performance yet.  He sells the character clinging to the tattered shreds of normalcy, swapping DVD like rentals at the corner store, watch old newscasts, etc. Purists of the original work maybe disgruntled by the changes made to the 50 year-old classic novel, but they make the movie a tighter, stark and relevant vehicle.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>I know this will come as a disappointment to the millions of night dwellers willing to risk crowded roads and over priced tickets in order to see this movie, but sadly I Am Legend does not live up to its hype. The third movie release of Richard Matheson's horror classic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765357151">I Am Legend</a>, this film stars Will Smith as a former military officer living in New York City in the year 2012, three years after a deadly virus created to cure cancer mutated and decimated the worlds population, killing 90% of all human beings and transforming almost everyone else into blood thirsty zombie/vampire like creatures called "night dwellers" who come out only at night because UV rays from the sun burn their skin.<br /><br />Will Smith is the last man on earth, his only companion being his family dog named Samantha, or Sam for short, and manikins at the movie rental store that he likes to talk to. He goes though the "Cast Away" effect, like Tom Hank's character tries to remain sane by talking to a volleyball, Will Smith talks to manikins. the most stunning aspect of this film is the city itself; a deserted Time Square, overgrown with weeds and taken over by deer and escaped lions, is pretty creepy but unfortunately for this film 28 Days Later outdid it years ago with its deserted London, shot on location without using special effects. Anybody familiar with zombie movies have seen dozens of deserted cities as good or better before, whether it is from the 28 series or Romero's Living Dead series. I Am Legend, although impressive, is hardly groundbreaking in this area.<br /><br />while the city effects are good, the main focus of this movie is how Will Smith deals with being the last man left alive. a military man at heart, he goes though a rigid routine every day, exercising with his dog in the morning, working in his lab trying to find a cure, making his radio broadcast at noon and hoping someone will answerer, and then spending the rest of the day hunting and gathering supplies. At night, when the night dwellers roam the streets, he returns home where his home transforms into a fortress, and falls asleep in the bathtub. Then, next day, he does the same thing. his tests for a cure drive him to seek out human specimens every now and then, so like in Romero's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8L9">Day of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition)</a> he captures zombies, brings them into his basement, and tries to cure them, more often killing them then helping.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie never has a real sense of focus. does it want to be a character drama that keeps the zombies in the background and highlights the characters loneliness and despair like Night of the Living Dead, or does it want to be a classic shoot em up zombie movie like Resident Evil or 28 Weeks Later? It never makes up its mind, and in the end does both poorly. there isn't enough character depth to make this a great character drama, for that it needed to be at least twenty if not thirty minutes longer, and it doesn't have anywhere near enough action to make it a shoot out film; actually there is very little in the way of action. Social commentary is none existent as well, giving this film absolutely nothing to set it apart from other zombie/horror/virus movies from this year, or any other year. its lack of originality and depth makes almost guarantees this movie to go the way of other I Am Legend movie adoptions <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>. It will make its million dollars, and end up in discount bins five years from now. It's a shame really; this movie had the potential to be something truly great.<br /><br />Re-watch value; low.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>I notice I was in a mellow mood when I watched this movie in a Singapore cinema. I focus entirely on the good sides of this entertaining movie and ignore other aspects.<br />The good sides:<br />Girls get to watch Will Smith a lot (which made my daughters happy, hence me).<br />The variation on Robinson Crusoe is fascinating, even if Friday doesn't make it as long as Crusoe.<br />Optimal use is made of Bob Marley's music.<br />Suspense is very strong in some scenes, mainly the hunt into the dark building (a variation on Silence of the Lambs, with different, though similar monsters).<br />An interesting variation on the 'apocalypse caused by science' theme.<br />A marvellous opening scene with Thompson, happily and modestly admitting that she conquered cancer. One does not need to be anti-science to appreciate this gem.<br />The monsters, well, they were also there, as was the future, in the person of the girl from Sao Paolo who never heard of Bob Marley.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"I Am Legend" is great! This is how the story goes: Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist, but even he could not contain the terrible virus that was unstoppable, incurable...and manmade. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City...and maybe the world. But he is not alone. He is surrounded by "the Infected" -- victims of the plague who have mutated into carnivorous beings who can only exist in the dark and who will devour or infect anyone or anything in their path. For three years, Neville has spent his days scavenging for food and supplies and faithfully sending out radio messages, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. All the while, the Infected lurk in the shadows, watching Neville's every move, waiting for him to make a fatal mistake. Perhaps mankind's last, best hope, Neville is driven by only one remaining mission: to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood. But his blood is also what The Infected hunt, and Neville knows he is outnumbered and quickly running out of time. The cast led by Will Smith (as Robert Neville) is excellent! The directing by Francis Lawrence (who also directed "Constantine" (2005) is great! The screenplay, (which is based on the novel by Richard Matheson, and the 1971 screenplay of "The Omega Man" by John William Corrington & Joyce Corrington) by Mark Protosevich (who also wrote the screenplay to "Poseidon" (2006) and the story and screenplay to "The Cell" (2000) & Akiva Goldsman (who also wrote the screenplay to "I, Robot" (2004) and the upcoming "Hancock" (2008), both which also starred or stars Smith), he also produced "Constantine", "Poseidon", & the upcoming "Hancock") is excellent! The music by James Newton Howard (who also did the music to "King Kong" (2005), "Michael Clayton" (2007), "The Lookout" (2007) and the upcoming "Charlie Wilson's War" (2007) & "The Great Debaters" (2007), he also is doing the music to the upcoming "The Happening" (2008) & "The Dark Knight" (2008) is excellent! The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie (who also did the cinematography to the "Lord Of The Rings" (2001, 2002, & 2003) trilogy & "King Kong", he also did the cinematography to the upcoming "The Lovely Bones" (2009) is excellent! The film editing by Wayne Wahrman (who also did the film editing to "Constantine") is great! The casting by Kathleen Chopin (who also did the casting to "Hitch" (2005), which also starred Smith) is excellent! The production design by Naomi Shohan (who also did the production design to "Constantine" and the upcoming "The Lovely Bones") & David Lazan (who also  an art director for "Constantine") is excellent! The art direction by William Ladd Skinner (who also did the art direction to "Mr. Brooks" (2007), "Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End" (2007), & "Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" (2006) & Patricia Woodbridge (who also did the art direction to "Hitch") is excellent! The set decoration by George DeTitta Jr. (who also did the set decoration to "Michael Clayton" & "Enchanted" (2007), he also did the set decoration to the upcoming "The Lovely Bones") is excellent! The costume design by Michael Kaplan (who also did the costume design to the upcoming "Star Trek" (2008) is great! This is an great sci-fi horror-thriller that keeps your heart pounding and your mind thinking. This is one of the better Will Smith action-type movies in recent history.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Awesome visuals do not a movie make.<br /><br />This great looking movie is a meaningless remake of "Omega Man" and light years away from Richard Matheson's haunting and weirdly relevant novel "I Am Legend."<br /><br />See it for the amazing views of deserted New York City.  And yes, Will Smith is very good.  For about 45 minutes this movie teases with huge potential and then it descends into below average jolts of blood-thirsty mutants jumping out of the dark with their mouths open.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />In the end, super-hero-with-abs Will Smith (certainly not the relatable, ordinary man of the novel) sacrifices himself for no reason and then there's a hastily  tacked on ending of survivors entering a walled-in compound somewhere in Vermont.  Is there unintentional irony here?  Have they traded freedom for the illusion of security?<br /><br />No legend.  No myth.  And finally, not much of a story.<br /><br />I was hoping for a movie that tickled my brain as well as my eyeballs -- like "Blade Runner."</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Will Smith stars as scientist Robert Neville in this apocalyptic thriller about viruses and the struggle to survive.<br /><br />Dr. Neville is a military scientist charged with finding a cure for a terrible virus that has supposedly sprung from a failed cure for cancer.  The virus has a 90% kill rate, and the military is moving to evacuate people from New York City.  Neville rushes his wife and daughter to a waiting helicopter, but he remains in the city; determined to find a cure for the rabid disease.  Neville himself is immune from the virus, but most are not.  To make matters worse, the military has decided to quarantine Manhattan, and soon, bridges are being blasted to prevent infected people from escaping.  Neville only has Sam, his pet German Shepard, as a companion.<br /><br />Neville spends his days foraging and his nights working on a cure for the virus, using his own immune blood as a component to the vaccine.  He is also forced to deal with the Infected; mutated vampire-like zombies who are roaming the deserted streets of New York in search of prey.  He has also sent out radio messages trying to attract other immune people to come and join him.  He offers food, shelter, and safety to any immune person who can reach him.<br /><br />One encounter with the Infected leaves Sam near death.  Neville takes his beloved dog home to try to save him, but Sam begins exhibiting traits like the Infected.  Sadly, Neville puts Sam down himself.  However, he isn't alone for long, as a young woman and child show up unexpectedly at his house.  She explains that God brought her to Robert's house, but he is skeptical.  Meanwhile, Robert has been experimenting on one of the Infected that he managed to capture and bring back to his house.  By using his own blood, it appears that the effects of the virus are being reversed, but it might be too late for Robert and his companions, as the other Infected have tracked Robert to his home.  Soon, the others break into the house and begin searching for Robert.  Will he survive, or will the Infected succeed in disposing of him?<br /><br />This is a first-rate thriller.  Will Smith gives one of his best performances since "Independence Day" as the dedicated Dr. Neville.  The special effects are excellent as well.  It was somewhat scary looking at a deserted New York City, with weeds growing in the cracks of sidewalks and streets.  Watching lions hunt deer in the city was definitely strange, too.<br /><br />I rate this movie very highly.  The story is very good, and the acting and special effects will keep the viewer interested until the end.  Watch "I Am Legend" and experience what it might be like to be the last person on Earth.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The first half of the movie is excellent. It's gripping, intense and emotional. It shows that nobody can live by himself/herself. Human beings need each other to survive.<br />It also showcases Will Smith's talented acting. It's heart-wrenching to watch Will kill his beloved dog after it was infected with the disease.<br /><br />The specical effects are spectacular in the scenes showing lions roaming New York. However, the "zombies" look fake. They don't look realistic like the creatures in Lord of the Ring.<br /><br />The last half of the movie is exactly like other movies of this genre, i.e. 28 days later. So, I was able to predict it.<br />It's definitely worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>(2) we need more Black doctors and scientists in America.  Kids should be pushed towards the natural sciences and engineering. I'm not a fan of Will Smith although I loved his little boy in Pursuit of Happyness but this is my favorite Will Smith movie.  This is the one that I want to own and show my kids when they are old enough.  It's a perfect horror in broad daylight action movie with emotional content and no superfluous violence.

Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.  There's a ton of science fiction books that could be made into good movies.<br /><br />This movie is based on the novelette <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765318741">I Am Legend</a><br />Recommended for fans of Will Smith, and science fiction (Note:  I have not read the book so I don't know how closely the story follows the book.)<br /><br />Gunner  October, 2008</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>When you look at `I Am Legend' you may initially shrug it off as nothing more than summer blockbuster popcorn fluff; just another horror film targeting today's youth and wasting our hard earned money.  You will most likely still go see it because, quite frankly, no one can resist Will Smith.  The film will start and you'll think that the depictions of New York, barren and desolate, are pretty creepy.  You'll see Smith driving a hundred miles an hour down the empty streets and you'll wish you could do that.  You'll see him hunting deer with his dog and it'll all seem pretty cool but what you won't realize is that you are slowly being drawn into the loneliness that is Robert Neville's existence.  You will watch his everyday life unfold and you'll find yourself feeling cold and distant and alone.  Before a single `vampire' appears on the screen you will be petrified.<br /><br />`I Am Legend' works so well because Will Smith is really that good in it.  Regardless of what anyone says, Will Smith is one excellent actor.  He's the type of actor that has everything you need to be successful.  He's attractive, he has charm and charisma; he's a riot in person and on film but he can also evoke very mature and stunning emotions that many wouldn't assign him.  In that respect he always proves himself a surprise to the viewer.  Here is no exception.  He elevates what could have been nothing more than a Hollywood monster movie into a serious and commanding look at loneliness and desperation.  In fact I'll be so blunt as to say that the best scenes in this film are when Will Smith is the only person on the screen, when he is alone and vulnerable; not when he is being pursued by the monsters.<br /><br />`I Am Legend' is the third revamping of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name.  It tells the story of Robert Neville, a scientist who happens to be the only survivor after an outbreak turns the world's population into walking zombies, or vampires.  He walks the streets of Manhattan during the daylight with his loyal German Shepherd Samantha and hides in his home at night while the creatures roam the streets looking for food.  During the day he attempts to live a life that is as normal as possible.  He sets up mannequins in video stores and carries on conversations with them.  He sticks to a schedule of exercise and meals and hunting.  He drives in his car and listens to Bob Marley and talks to his dog and pretty much does everything he can to stay sane.  He also broadcasts a message over the airwaves everyday looking for other survivors and he waits at the dock everyday at a specific time for them to arrive.<br /><br />The first half of `I Am Legend' plays out much better than the second because it's a slow build of human emotion.  Watching Smith's desperation grow across his face we are brought into his life and his situation and we feel his pain.  The second half, which introduces to us the creatures as well as another human survivor, steps a little bit away from the focus on Neville's loneliness and tries a little too hard to force fear on us by using the creatures.  This fear would have been much more rewarding had the creatures not looked so CGI animated.  They somewhat take away from the realness and rawness of the film when they look more like aliens then mutated humans.<br /><br />One thing that remains on point throughout though is Will Smith.  This may be one of his finest performances to date, seriously.  The emotion that he portrays his so real, so strong.  There is one scene in particular, where he breaks down crying in the video store as he begs for a female mannequin to talk to him, that got me all choked up.  His performance is so committed, so vital to the film that you can't help but give him props for delivering a very believable and very moving performance.<br /><br />In the end there are some things I would have changed here.  I would have hired actual actors for the roles of the `vampires' (although I hear that they had initially done that but felt that they looked too much like mimes) because I feel that the CGI was a little overdone.  I would have stuck a little closer to the book and eliminated the `other' survivor.  But there are too many things that I would have left alone; that work so well here that it seems silly to complain.  The first half of the film is in a word `perfect' and that alone is enough to elevate the rest of the film.  Smith is a goldmine of emotion here and delivers a solid award worthy performance that tops his Oscar nominated performance from last year.<br /><br />If the CGI creatures hadn't spoiled my fun (just a little) I would be quick to label `I Am Legend' as one of the best films of 2007.  That little issue aside though, `I Am Legend' is far better than some may expect and will definitely leave you with much to talk about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>I Am Legend (2007)<br />Drama, Science Fiction, Thriller, 101 minutes<br />Directed by Francis Lawrence<br />Starring Will Smith and Alice Braga<br /><br />Will Smith is one of the biggest box office draws, whether it's for action, comedy or drama. He has the charisma to pull off just about any role and is improving as a dramatic actor as he matures. I Am Legend contains some action, but it's a futuristic drama more than anything else. Smith is required to show considerable range.<br /><br />The movie makes this list because it shows how people adapt in extreme situations. Robert Neville (Smith) is possibly the last man alive after a cure for cancer turns people into aggressive zombie-like creatures who live in the dark. He's a scientist and appears to have a natural immunity to the virus. He's trying to develop a vaccine that will help these creatures recover their humanity.<br /><br />Imagine if you had an entire city to yourself. How would you spend your time? Neville has a routine. He wakes up at the same time each day, works out, and then systematically searches the buildings in the area for canned food and bottled water. This is vital for his survival. He also continues his research and tries out his vaccines on laboratory rats. In order to maintain the illusion that he's not alone, he watches recorded TV shows and talks to mannequins while he works his way through the inventory of a local video store. Every day at Noon, he waits at a predetermined location for any response to his radio messages offering hope and shelter to other survivors.<br /><br />New York is an abandoned city. Grass has reclaimed most of the land and Neville has to compete with lions when he goes hunting for dear. The early special effects are very convincing and we are drawn in to Neville's world. Some of the exposition is achieved through showing Neville's dreams and we discover that his wife and daughter were evacuated along with the other healthy people left in the city. His only friend now is Sam, his dog. Unlike Neville, Sam can be affected by contact with the creatures roaming the city.<br /><br />One of the saddest scenes in the movie comes after Sam is bitten by a creature carrying the virus. He injects her with serum in the hope that it will prevent her from transforming into a deadly version of his former companion. If you are an animal-lover, it's a hard scene to watch.<br /><br />I won't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. Is Neville really alone? Will he develop a cure? If he does, will it even be possible to capture the creatures and successfully administer the cure?<br /><br />The film raises a serious question; are humans the biggest threat to their own survival?<br /><br />The Blu-ray includes an alternate ending. Both endings are hopeful, but one is considerably more hopeful than the other. The Blu-ray presentation is just about perfect.</p></br></body></html>

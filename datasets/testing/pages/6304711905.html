As someone with little knowledge of this certain group of movies, or of the history and fact surrounding the characters in writer Kevin Jarre's story, I'm not about the begin to praise or denounce the film on the basis of what is truth and what is fabrication. I simply wish to comment on the wondrous sense that a long-forgotten era of movie-making seems to have been resurrected to the screen in this near-perfect spectacle of gun-slinging and rousing action. <p>Once again telling the well-known story of legendary Wyatt Earp, the films casts Kurt Russell in the main role as the now-retired sheriff reunited with his two brothers, Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton). Accompanied by their wives, the brothers journey to Tombstone, where they hope to find peace and begin their lives anew, devoid of the perils of policing town after town.<p>The film's first hour is devoted to much of the character development, and while this is usually a good thing, it tends to test one's patience with the film. We learn that Earp's new wife suffers from a drug addiction, that which keeps him from living out his married life as he wishes to. This calls for the presence of a new love interest, arriving in the form of actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney); unfortunately, the movie doesn't expand much on her interaction with Earp, and their scenes together seem muddled and misplaced. <p>Of course, throughout this wallow in seemingly endless boredom, the film has two things going for its first half: the meticulous production design, and the establishment of the cast's willingness to throw themselves into their roles with full vigor. "Tombstone" vividly recreates the Old West in a manner that pays homage to the Westerns decades before, from the single street lined by houses, hotels, and saloons, to the dry, arid feel of living in these territories. <p>The introduction of its many characters provides a new entrance by another actor in an all-star ensemble cast, with Russell and Val Kilmer leading the way. Russell gives perhaps the best performance of his still-unfinished career as Earp, making the transition from a man who wants no more violence to a brother bent on exacting justice with impressive conviction. Kilmer plays the eccentric Doc Holliday with a terrific panache and humorous wit; together with Elliott and Paxton, the four form a lethal force of unrelenting justice seekers. <p>As the movie moves into its second half, things begin to pick up speed, gaining momentum with the introduction of the ruthless band of renegades known as The Cowboys, who see fit to create a ruckus throughout Tombstone that disturbs the peace Earp so desperately needs in life. pleading with his brothers to stay out of the affairs of the law, he is reluctant to take up arms against these men, though a stormy night and a dead brother provides him enough emotional anguish to create an uprising against the Cowboys and wipe them out once and for all. <p>It's material like this that director George P. Cosmatos excels at. His character development is well-guided, though throughout much of the first half, I wasn't feeling the vibes that I felt I should be. Once the first shots were fired in a spectacular shootout that begins their bloody feud, I was completely enamored by the various sequences of gunplay, which never fail to dazzle the eyes with an authentic sense of realism and historical accuracy in terms of appearance. <p>Once Earp begins to take his stand, which ends with a grandly-executed stand-off sequence at O.K. Corral, "Tombstone" proves its worth as a modern envisioning of a legendary figure. Some will quibble about its historical accuracy, while others will embrace it wholeheartedly. To be honest, I enjoyed the movie's wonderful energy and realistic depiction of the Old West, which was almost more than enough to make me overlook the shortcomings that befall its beginning.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Dodge City 's recent clean up is the last solved conflict by Earp brothers, but as you know the marauding never rests, and sooner than you imagine on, they will have to put their guns back on.<br /><br />The admirable action sequences, the formidable edition and the presence of Val Kilmer playing his best performance 's lifetime until this date as Doc Holiday, will make of this film the last superior Western made until now. Cosmatos made undoubtedly his masterpiece, although the occupied place by My Darling Clementine still remains unmatchable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R.html">A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R</a><br/><p>Val Kilmir. Enough said. He plays doc holiday, and he makes the movie worth watching, and kurt russell is also worthy. I also enjoyed Dana Delany becvause she is beautiful and a great actress. The main reason why this movie was so good was the great lines. I GOT TWO GUNS, ONE FOR EACH OF YA! Just alot of western bad ass talk that we all love and reminds us of DO YOU FEEL LUCKY WELL DO YA PUNKS clint eastwood movies. It's all good and fun. It's basically about the ok corall, and mostly a true story but as with all movies, some of it exaggerated and obviously for enteratinment, not boring documentaries and they couldnt have chosen better actors than russell and kilmir.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner's WYATT EARP never stood a chance, did it? Its theatrical release came six months on the heels of TOMBSTONE, which is hands down better and my favorite film featuring lawman Wyatt Earp. TOMBSTONE is not as contemplative as MY DARLING CLEMENTINE or HOUR OF THE GUN or GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, but its sheer bravado and energy kept my eyeballs glued to the screen. TOMBSTONE breathes thunder and swagger into an old western legend.<br /><br />Tombstone, Arizona in 1879, and the territory is lorded over by over 100 exiled Texas outlaws calling themselves the Cowboys, identified by their red sashes and led by Curly Bill Brocius and the fast-draw killer Johnny Ringo and numbering the Clantons in its roster. And then Wyatt Earp came to Tombstone, retired from his days as a Kansas peace officer and intent only on a fresh start as an entrepreneur with his brothers. Except that Wyatt Earp was never meant to go down in the history books as a businessman.<br /><br />Who knows how accurate this adaptation is? I don't know. Word is the first half of TOMBSTONE is more or less true to the real life account, is fairly faithful to what led up to the blood feud between the Earps and the Clanton gang, but that the second half deals in sprawling malarkey. All I know is that I'm always hugely entertained when I see this movie. History buffs of the Old West may beg to differ. I just like to see bullets fly with impunity.<br /><br />I am bowled over by the bristling machismo and attitude. If nothing else, TOMBSTONE pound for pound has to boast more aggressive facial hair than any other film in recent memory. Familiar faces dot this landscape, quite a bit of these actors being of the manly persuasion: Sam Elliot, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker, Billy Bob Thornton, and even Robert Mitchum drops by to do some narrative voice-over. But Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer carry this baby. Russell is bedrock solid as the centerpiece, playing Wyatt Earp with unrelenting intensity and boring holes with his icy stare. His brooding interpretation easily dismisses Kevin Costner's own take as inferior stuff. Russell's defining moment comes early when he braces the bullying faro dealer at the Oriental bar casino. "Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens," he ominously dares the bully, and we immediately know this cat is not to be effed with. The faro dealer is properly cowed, and keep in mind that this is Billy Bob Thornton playing the faro dealer.<br /><br />It's Kilmer, though, in his best role ever, who walks away with the universal plaudits. Val Kilmer is magnificent and magnificently sly in a performance that manages to simultaneously convey terminal sickliness and a detached, reckless flair. Doc Holliday, unrepentant sinner and cough-ridden, cuts a tragic figure, and yet he delivers the most memorable lines, cool customer that he is. I really don't know how many times I've quoted "I'm your huckleberry" or "You're no daisy" to friends, but I'm now pretty much hated for it. A marvelous bit of cinema surfaces when Doc Holliday and Johnny Ringo (a mad dog Michael Biehn) bait each other in Latin and then there's that inspired contest of braggadocio immediately following. No man could've ever struck down THIS Doc Holliday. Only tuberculosis could fit him for a casket.<br /><br />Did we need to see Wyatt Earp's floundering marriage and his subsequent romance with the stage actress? Not really, not in a testosterone-driven revenge movie like this. TOMBSTONE is all about slick black coats and lawlessness being tamed, about Russell's fierceness and his handlebar 'stache, and Val Kilmer looking like death warmed over and yet still expertly dealing in lead. Law comes to Tombstone and it's keeping an eye out for red sashes, mustache combs, and maybe some cough drops.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>There are so many great things about this movie. It may not be the most historically accurate, but it never strays from being ridiculous, and it always keeps its sharp wit and great action.<p>Along with &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; &quot;Tombstone&quot; is a film with some of the greatest lines I've ever heard. Here's a sample:<p>&quot;I'm you're Huckleberry.&quot;<br />&quot;Drunk piano player...you can't hit nothing. In fact...you're probably seeing double.&quot; / &quot;I have two guns, one for each of you!&quot;<br />&quot;I don't have the words.&quot; / &quot;I know.&quot;<br />&quot;Maybe poker just isn't you game...I know! Lets have a spelling contest!&quot;<p>Don't be surprised if you find yourself using these lines in casual conversation (my friends and I often use the Huckleberry line ourselves).<p>But the character, the flow of the story, and the pure charisma of the characters is all there. Every one turns in a good performance, and the good script only enhances that. I could go on about how many great feelings I have for this movie, but I'll prevent myself. This is truly a modern day classic, western or otherwise.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Pair this one with Clint Eastwood's &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and you have the two superlative movies of the last decade.  This remake far surpasses the original &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,&quot; with its perfect  casting of Kurt Russell, Powers Boothe, Sam Eliott, Bill Paxton, and Jason  Priestly who shows that he can exist outside of the &quot;90210&quot; zip  code.<p>But it is Val Kilmer, one of Tinseltown's most gifted  &quot;chameleons&quot; who immerses himself as the legendary Doc Holliday.  Everyone in my circle of friends lauded his performance as one of the  finest that has ever graced the silver screen.<p>The guy can act!</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>There's a lot to be said for this version of the 'Gunfight at the OK Corral.' Like many westerns, it's a story of honor, loyalty, and an inescapable journey wrestling with one's character.<p>In many ways, it bears striking similarity with Alan Ladd's portrayal of Shane many, many years ago. Both Shane and Wyatt Earp have a violent past, to some extent supported by a sense of honor, yet violent nonetheless. Both men imagine they can escape that past and live a life of peace and normalcy. Both men fail. Kevin Costner faces a similar conflict in &quot;Open Range,&quot; and all men have a similar narrator, so to speak, Dana Delaney in &quot;Tombstone&quot; being the most recent.<p>Powerful roles are fulfilled by Sam Elliott as brother Virgil, but perhaps the most telling observation is made by the youngish Bill Paxton playing the role of brother Morgan, who tells Wyatt when he won't go along with him and Virgil to again strap on the six-shooters, &quot;you gotta' back your brother's play.&quot;<p>If I found pleasure in the movie it was superlative qualities of all of the actors, and the grittiness of the scenery. On occasion it almost left you with a feeling of dust in your mouth. If there was a let down it was the eventual union with Dana Delaney which, when acted out, almost seemed inconsequential in light of the ensuing carnage following the 'OK Corral' incident. I found equally unsatisfied with the ending of &quot;Open Range,&quot; where again 'true love' did not appear to be much of an antidote for the extraordinary emotional and physical trauma earlier experienced. And a lot of blood. To me, it seemed much more logical when a weary Alan Ladd rode away at the ending of the much earlier &quot;Shane.&quot;<p>Having said that, &quot;Tombstone&quot; carries the day with brilliant acting on all levels, especially Sam Elliot and Val Kilmer, who carry the supporting roles they are assigned as the ailing Doc Holliday and Virgil with a high level of skill. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>1993 found a memorable cast working together to make a great film... Kirk Russell (as Wyatt Earp), Val Kilmer (as Doc Holliday), Sam Elliott (as Virgil Earp), Bill Paxton (as Morgan Earp), Powers Booth (as Curly Bill), and Michael Biehn (as Johnny Ringo). Not to mention superb supporting roles by Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestley, and Dana Delaney. "Tombstone" takes you back to 1881 when the Earp brothers stumble into Tomstone, AZ to settle down with their spouses. It isn't long before the outlaw "Cowboys" led by Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo make trouble and the Earps decide to take action. Val Kilmer plays a witty and charasmatic Doc Holliday - the best I've ever seen - probably one of Kilmer's finest Hollywood roles. A chunky Billy Bob Thornton has a memorable role as Johnny Tyler - as Wyatt's first punk to pick on. The first half of the movie sets up the characters nicely. The second half of the movie really gets going when Wyatt Earp yells at Johnny Ringo at the train station... "You tell him I'm coming! And Hell's coming with me!" You just know that the Earp's and Doc are going to kick some major as*. The gunfights were excellent. The town with it's buildings and surroundings were believeable. Director George P. Cosmatos has not put out a finer movie to this date. This special (2002) director's cut 2-disc set gives the audience superior 5.1 dolby sound; approx 5 minutes of extra movie footage; a director's commentary; a timeline of the story, 3 different production featurette's; a corny "collectable" Tombstone map; and a game of chance (you'll play once and probably never play again). A classic western and a personal favorite (5 stars).</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>This is one of the most entertaining westerns ever made and as such, ranks right up there with "Shane," "Open Range," "Ride the Man Down" and Eastwood's "The Unforgiven." It is a story of changing times that haven't quite changed enough. Kurt Russell gives his best performance as Wyatt Earp, coming to Tombstone with his brothers to settle down and put his lawman days behind him. Tombstone is a wild town still and a group known as The Cowboys and a young gunslinger named Johnny Ringo begin to make this impossible.<br /><br />Dana Delany is radiant as the actress Wyatt falls for even though he is married. His wife has become a drug addict and his marriage is not the stuff dreams are made of, but Dana Delaney is. The film takes its time as Wyatt and his brothers are slowly drawn towards the history we have come to know, and the aftermath we may not.<br /><br />This is a multilayered story more faithful to the truth than most versions. What makes this film superior to other westerns is the depth of the story and the realistic performances of the cast. The finest of the aforementioned is Val Kilmer's extraordinary turn as Doc Holliday.<br /><br />This film more realistically portrays the relationship of Holliday and Wyatt than any other film. Kilmer's Holliday is dangerous and intelligent, and above all, loyal to perhaps his only real friend in life, Wyatt Earp. Kilmer so became the real Doc Holliday that it was said he remained in character on the set at all times, even when the camera was not rolling. His performance is something that will always be remembered by anyone who watches this film.<br /><br />Wyatt is a real man in this film with raw courage but no self delusions. He is no gunman and realizes he can not beat the quick and dangerous Johnny Ringo in a gun battle. Doc Holliday, in spite of his illness, has Wyatt's back and arrives there first. What follows is one of the most tense and accurately portrayed gunfights in film history.<br /><br />Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp remained friends until Holliday finally was overtaken by the tuberculosis which had plagued him for years. As in real life, Wyatt Earp actually does find happiness and settles down with Dana Delaney after his wife dies in this film. The real Wyatt became quite wealthy in the latter part of his life.<br /><br />The rich tapestry of events that formed the legend of the dangerous Doc Holliday and Marshal Wyatt Earp are given the best and most accurate screen treatment ever filmed. This is a must see western. You will never forget it and you will never see a better and more colorful true to life performance than Val Kilmer's turn as Doc Holliday.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Having already seen My Darling Clementine (1946)  and The Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957) several times, I was curious to observe what director George Pan Cosmatos and his screenwriters would do with essentially the same material in this film. There are significant differences between and among them but suggesting comparisons and contrasts would be unfair to three different films which appeared over a 57-year period.<br /><br />Now on to Tombstone. Director George Cosmatos worked with a large cast and all of the performances are first-rate. William Fraker's cinematography and Bruce Broughton's musical score are carefully integrated within the narrative and serve it well. My own opinion is that Val Kilmer (Doc Holliday) dominates each scene in which he appears. However, Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp), Dana Delany (Josephine Marcos), Sam Elliot (Virgil Earp), and Powers Boothe (Curly Bill Brocius) hold their own.<br /><br />As portrayed in the film, Tombstone (Arizona) is a western town in the last stages of being a community dominated by outlaws. The involvement of the Earps coincide with a growing local desire among residents to establish law and order. The eventual showdown at the OK Corral is a key event but by no means the only one. I was especially interested in how Cosmatos and Russell develop Wyatt Earp's character as he struggles to follow his conscience, establish some stability in his own life, and thereby complete a transition from gunfighter to private citizen.<br /><br />Back to Kilmer for a moment. I do not recall a prior or subsequent film of his in which he reveals the comic timing, nuances of personality, and conflicting anxieties which he does while portraying Holliday in Tombstone. His is a masterful performance, maintaining an exquisite balance between playful humor and force of will. I recalled elements of that performance while recently observing Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean. However, the Holliday character is revealed to have much greater depth and complexity than Sparrow's even as both characters demonstrate at every appropriate opportunity a unique flair for mimicry.<br /><br />I do have a few minor quibbles. First, I think the pace of the plot lags unnecessarily at times. Also, the evolving relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcos is not always in focus, even when allowing for a period of adjustment as they take each other's measure. Finally, I really don't understand the purpose of the final scene except to offer an alternative to the neat-and-tidy conclusion which so many other films offer. That said, I think that Cosmatos, his cast, and crew have created 135 minutes of generally entertaining, sometimes hilarious, and often thought-provoking material. Perhaps the more ambitious scale (e.g. timeframe and subplots) precludes the dramatic impact of its predecessors, My Darling Clementine and The Gunfight at the OK Corral. In any event, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Final point: I wish all other versions offered special features comparable with those provided by the Vista Series DVD. They include a commentary by Cosmatos, the 134 Director's Cut Edition, featurettes ("An Ensemble Cast," "Making An Authentic Western," and "The Gunfight At The O.K. Corral"), an interactive Tombstone storyline, The Tombstone Epitaph - Actual Newspaper Account, and Cosmatos' original storyboards for the O.K. Corral sequence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>1993 and it was the battle between two films based on the iconic western figure Wyatt Earp.  Screenwriter Kevin Jarre ("The Mummy", "Glory", "Rambo: First Blood Part II") and Kevin Costner were originally set to make the film together but due to a disagreement, Costner would go on to film "Wyatt Earp" while Kevin Jarre would take his script to Buena Vista for distribution and sure enough, it became a contest of sorts as who would get their movie out first and which one would dominate in the box office.<br /><br />Fortunately, despite numerous problems on the set of "Tombstone", if there is one thing that the film had was its all-star cast as Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestly, Dana Delany, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Rooker, Terry O'Quinn and many more.<br /><br />Directing the film would be George P. Cosmatos ("Rambo: First Blood Part II", "Leviathan", "Shadow Conspiracy"), cinematography by William A. Fraker ("Rules of Engagement", "Father of the Bride Part II", "Street Fighter") and music by Bruce Broughton ("Lost in Space", "Bambi II", "Tiny Toon Adventures").<br /><br />In the end, "Tombstone"earned $56 million domestically and did much better than Costner's "Wyatt Earp" in the box office.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"Tombstone" is presented in 1080 High Definition (2:35:1).  For the most part, the good news is that "Tombstone" looks very good on Blu-ray.  The cinematography by William A. Fraker is absolutely beautiful during some of the scenic shots overlooking the fields, the skyline, dusk and dawn.  While many parts of the film showcases many colors and for the most part, detail of the town, the saloon, the skin pores, etc. look great on Blu-ray, I noticed that the scenes look a bit dark at times.  I haven't had the chance to compare with the original DVD release of "Tombstone" but there are times that seem as if shots were taken during overcast or the shadows of the hats are covering the faces of people.<br /><br />But despite the dark look of some scenes, "Tombstone" definitely looks sharper and more contrast is seen on the Blu-ray release and blacks are nice and deep. Only one scene which was stock video where you a bit of aliasing but for the most part, I didn't detect any major artifacts or blemishes.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"Tombstone" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit), French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Audio dialogue is quite clear and for the most part, the majority of the film is dialogue driven until you get into short action scenes at the O.K. Corral and the final half hour in which the film starts to have more action-based scenes.  But one of the things that you will notice is the use of the surrounds in terms of capturing the ambiance of the outdoor scenes.  I was watching when Wyatt and Josie were horseriding and are taking a break and all of a sudden I started hearing birds chirping and rustling the trees.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Also, you will hear the thunderstorms come to life and of course, the gun battle sequences in which you hear rifle shots, gun shots and more.  Overall, "Tombstone" sounds very good via lossless.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, English ESL, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Tombstone" comes with the following special features in 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital audio and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Included are:<br /><br />  * The Making of Tombstone - (27:19) This featurette goes into the cast of Tombstone as they talk about their characters and filming a Western. Director George P. Cosmatos talking about making an authentic Western and the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.<br />  * Director's Original Storyboards - (4:00) A special feature showcasing the original storyboards of Director George P. Cosmatos.<br />  * Trailers and TV Spots - Featuring two theatrical trailers (:60 and :120) and the "Friends" TV spot (:30).<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"Tombstone" is an enjoyable film and for those who enjoy Westerns and for those who like the stories of lawmen vs. the outlaws, the film is quite entertaining and a storyline in which both Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer actually do a remarkable job. Russell as the Wyatt Earp, the caring brother and also not afraid of anyone!  And Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday at his most charming and also his most vulnerable and how Kilmer plays off the sickly version of Holliday is really well-done.<br /><br />But what I did enjoy about "Tombstone" when I first watched it over a decade ago, was how it tried to capture the life of Wyatt Earp and led to the "Gunfight of O.K. Corral" and "Wyatt Earp and the Immortals".  Granted, the film is not exactly historically accurate and the adaptation would be of what took place had to receive the Hollywood touch but for the most part, it did capture many of the stories that took place especially with Virgil Earp becoming a marshal, some of the battles that took place and more.<br /><br />If there was one thing that I was hoping for, it would be a more climactic battle between Wyatt and Curly Bill Brocius.  With Brocius being the leader of the Cowboys, I felt that the battle between both men was rather short.  Also, there were some scenes of certain characters that felt out of place and this goes with the troubled production as the original screenplay was longer and had a story emphasizing sub-plots of the various characters but was nixed.  The fact that "Tombstone" has quite a bit of starpower, I just felt that certain characters were never utilized and if they were, what was the purpose.  For example, why was Deputy Billy Breckinridge (played by Jason Priestly) even shown and also, with no historical fact towards his sexuality, why was she shown to have gay tendencies?  Also, the character of Sherman McMasters (played by Michael Rooker), just an added scene showing why he broke off with the Cowboys would have been nice to see as well.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, the film definitely looks and sounds better than its predecessor.  It's important to note that the Blu-ray version features the 130-minute version and not the 135-minute director's cut version of "Tombstone".  Missing is the audio commentary by director George P. Cosmatos and also "The Tombstone Epitaph - Actual Newspaper Account" featured in the Director's Cut Televista DVD version.  But the making-of featurette, director's original storyboards and trailers remain intact.  But you can't help but be pleased with this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, "Tombstone" was an enjoyable Western that I have seen a good number of times.  Does it rank high compared to the best Western's out there?  Definitely not but in my opinion, it's the best Wyatt Earp film that I have seen yet and it's a film that I just found enjoyable from beginning to end.  Definitely recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>Tombstone is the retelling of Wyatt Earp and his involvement in the city before and after the famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral.  The movie begins with Earp trying to start over and forget his past in the mining town of Tombstone.  The Cowboy gang holds a stranglehold on the town that cannot be broken.  Before long, Earp and his two brothers must strap on their guns once again to clean things up.  This may be a familiar story, but it is anything but.  An impressive cast, excellent action, and even some humor makes this western fully enjoyable.<p> While Kurt Russell is excellent as Marshal Wyatt Earp, Val Kilmer steals the show as dying gunman Doc Holliday.  His performance is truly great and should have earned him an Academy Award for his performance.  Even as tuberculosis takes its toll on him, he remains the same hard drinking, card playing gunfighter that he always was.  The relationship between the two men is fully believable and one of the better points of the movie.  Michael Biehn and Powers Boothe are also excellent as Johnny Ringo and Curley Bill, the leaders of the Cowboy gang.  The fantastic supporting cast includes Dana Delaney, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Stephen Lang, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestley, Robert Burke, Joanna Pacula, Michael Rooker, and Billy Zane.  As well, look for old western star Harry Carey JR as the marshal of Tombstone.  The Vista Series DVD is loaded full of extras which are all very good.  The best may be the deleted scenes that are included.  At times during the movie, it seems a bit choppy with editing, but the movie is still very good.

There are 'guy' movies and there are 'girl' movies, also known as 'date movies' or 'chick flicks.' Anything with Hugh Grant qualifies as a date movie, while "Fried Green Tomatoes" is a chick flick. "Beaches" is a chick flick. "Steel Magnolias" is most definetly a chick flick. "Tombstone"...well, if you like spicy hot buffallo wings dripping with bleu cheese, cold beer, and football, this movie is for you.<p>Critics of "Tombstone" -- and you know who you are -- point out its cliched plot, which is more or less based on the real-life fued between ex-lawman Wyatt Earp and his brothers Morgan and Virgil, and their friend John "Doc" Holliday, and a gang of transplanted Texas outlaws called the Cowboys, which culminated in the world's most famous shoot-out, the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. They point out that some of the dialogue is stilted and hokey, if not outright ridiculous. They shake their heads at gunfights which rage for minutes with no one troubling to reload and the villains seemingly unable to hit anything except trees, windows, dirt, and if they are very lucky, the non-lethal areas of our heroes. I look upon these souls with pity. Because they are missing the whole point of this classic, pen-ultimate "guy" film: GUILTY PLEASURE.<p>Like football, beer, and the afformentioned spicy chicken wings, "Tombstone" is not good. It is just fun. I would even argue that movies like this are the whole reason movies were invented in the first place (and keep in mind the first silent pictures were Westerns). You can save your message-laden morality plays and Oscar-grubbing prestiege pictures for when you are trying to impress your girlfriend's parents at dinner, because after desert, chances are your future father-in-law will light up a stogie and fire up this DVD over that copy of "Yentel" on the coffee table. And thank goodness for that! Would you rather watch Barbara Streisand in drag or Kurt Russel bash some foul-mouthed cowboy over the head with his own .44?<p>How can you go wrong with a cast that includes apparently every working character actor in Hollywood? In addition to Kurt Russel (Wyatt) and Val Kilmer (Doc), you've got Sam Elliot (Virgil), Bill Paxton (Morgan), Billy Bob Thorton (the very unfortunate Faro dealer), Powers Boothe (Curly Bill), Michael Biehn (Johnny Ringo), Michael Rooker, Charlton Heston (yes, Charlton Heston), Jason Priestly (Billy), Billy Zane (the actor in the kilt), and even that guy that played Lowell on "Wings" ? The answer is, you can't. This (Vista) DVD is money well spent, because in addition to a few minutes of extra footage (which, by and large, doesn't add much to the viewing experience) there is a supplementary disc loaded with extras. As if you needed them!<p>The flick opens with a demonstration of first-class villainy on the part of the Cowboys, who are led by the cheerful, opium-smoking and apparently insane Curly Bill Brosius, and his right-hand man, the homicidal gunslinger Johnny Ringo. They crash the wedding of a Mexican lawman and substitute the traditional throwing of rice with the throwing of lead. This establishes them as worthy bad guys, and the credits haven't even rolled yet!<p>Cut to the arrival in Tombstone of Wyatt Earp, played by Russel. Wyatt is a weary former town marshal with, shall we say, a phyiscal approach to problem solving. Before he has spoken a word of dialogue, he hosswhips a stablehand for maltreating his trusty steed. Minutes later, he strolls into a salloon and gives loudmouth card dealer Billy Bob Thorton perhaps the most humiliating verbal and physical thrashing in cinematic history, spitting out lines like "Are you gonna do something about it, or just stand there and bleed?" before tossing him out through the swinging doors. And this is just his first day in town! Wait until he gets comfortable!<p>Wyatt is joined not only by his brothers, but by his tuburculois-stricken gunman-gambler pal Doc Holliday, who gets even better dialogue than Wyatt, and gets to say it in a marvelous Tidewater-aristocratic drawl while strolling about town in his cape. The only thing deadlier than Doc's three-gun pistol rig is his own death-wish. Never mess with a man whose motto is: "Say when!"<p>Wyatt, Doc and Co. have made the ultimate Western mistake. They have Tried To Leave the Past Behind Them. Fools! Don't they know that only breeds mayhem?<p>Now, understand that Tombstone, Arizona in 1889 is like a college town the day before graduation where in addition to being drunk and violent, all the men are carrying guns and big ... buck knives. The Cowboys run the show and don't rightly appreciate Mr. Earp and his pals throwing their weight around. Before long, insults turn to fisticuffs, which turns to gunplay, which turns to Wyatt Earp using his boot spur to give cowardly Ike Clanton a no-frills facial massage, saying, "All right you cur! You've called down the thunder....you tell 'em I'm coming, and hell's coming with me!"<p>When Wyatt says stuff like that, you should take him at his word.<br />Stupidly, the Cowboys don't, and luckily for us, the OK Corral shootemup is just the beginning of the mayhem. Suffice to say by the time the final credits roll, Boot Hill is a growth industry.<p>This is a great, fun movie that is not meant to be taken seriously, as Kevin Costner's pompous, overdrawn "Wyatt Earp" apparently was. It's just entertainment, and the actors, most especially Val Kilmer, have a blast living out their childhood fantasies of playing Once Upon a Time in the West. You will too. Like Wyatt, "I'll take my oath on it."  <p>The fight's commenced, folks....now get to fightin' or get away!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>I have long felt that this was one of the greatest westerns ever made, an incredibly delivered story with amazing acting by all involved.  Yes, Kilmer's Doc Holiday almost steals the movie but, never the less, a wonderful film.  However, I wound up returning the Blu Ray disc simply because I wanted the whole film, not a cut version of it.  The Standard Definition film with the full 135 minutes still retains excellent video and audio quality and I would rather have the entire version than a Reader's Digest Condensed version.  Should they come out with the Directors cut on Blu Ray with the movie intact, then that is the one I will buy.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.<br />Steve Douglas</p></br><a href="../users/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E.html">A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E</a><br/><p>I hesitated to see this movie for two big reasons: Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. VAL KILMER?  However, since I do so love westerns my curiosity got the better of me. I'm glad I did. Both  actors brought the characters to life, both their good and bad sides.  Kilmer did something I never though he could do: Make me forget who was  playing the part. His protrayal of Holliday is well done and  mesmorizing.<p>Tombstone starts as Wyatt Earp is arriving in town and  immediately starts to build on the feud that develops between the Earps and  the &quot;Cowboys&quot; (the Clantons, Johnny Ringo, etc). Although the  story is engrossing, and action driven, it also is a little light on  historical fact. As with most &quot;OK Corral&quot; films, the film weighs  heavily on the Earps as the good guys and the Clantons as the bad. In  reality, the situation was nothing more than a power struggle between two  groups for control of Tombstone. Also, while there is some sexual tenson  between Wyatt and Josephine, the film portrays the relationship as benign  until the end, in reality the relationship took off, by most historical  accounts, well before Wyatt's wife leaves and eventually dies of a drug  overdose. But also certain scenes are very well grounded in history. The  gunfight at the OK Corral in this movie is well scripted to what is  considered the true version. Short and violent. Also Wyatt's reign of  terror after his brothers are shot, and he starts to take his revenge is  close to the actual events, although still to heavy on him as &quot;the  good guy&quot;.<p>As Westerns go though, Tombstone is fun and a watchable  romp. As OK Corrall films go, probably Burt Lancaster's &quot;Gunfight at  the OK Corral&quot; is better (although even less historical), &quot;Hour  of the Gun&quot; with James Garner is grittier and darker (probably the  closest to Wyatt's true temperment), and &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;  with Henry Fonda probably the best of all. Don't hesitate to watch and  enjoy this film. If you like westerns you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>TOMBSTONE (1993) remains one of the most widely hyped, widely adored films in history. I find it to be one of the best Westerns ever made, and when you get a whiff of the backstory, you'll agree. I think right off the bat we can say this film succeeded because of the gaudy-yet-riveting Kurt Russell (Wyatt Earp) and Val Kilmer (Dr. John "Doc" Holliday).<br /><br />This thing as horse operas go is really an old-fashioned cowboy's dream entertainment. While it shamelessly stole from its father, WYATT EARP (vid. my review), it managed to spring the Western back into unprecedented popularity. Also it grossed double what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5N6LG">Wyatt Earp</a> did. It told a fanciful, colorful Earp chapter (restricted to the legendary fight in Tombstone) and it did so with panache, great humor, style, flair and unmatched beauty. Both symbolically and texturally, TOMBSTONE really delivers. It is funny, daring, unconventional and can be deeply moving.<br /><br />It covers the Earp Family's time in Tombstone, centering on the famous street fight, and though it goes overboard with some silly, unnecessary characters (such as Jason Priestly as the gay Billy Breckenridge and Billy Zane as The-Gay-Caballero or whatever he's called who becomes Priestly's love interest), it is good fun. Charleton Heston made an impression here as well.<br /><br />These guys started out with Costner. There was a disagreement, and they split away from Costner's bloated project. After this, Costner made it a living hell for them to finish TOMBSTONE, though as I say, they stole from WYATT EARP, too. The result was critics praising TOMBSTONE for being the first of its kind as an "independent" film. It was "independent" because Costner forced the issue - but he had good right to do so. The producers of TOMBSTONE did not need to steal so much from Costner, then race to beat him to the box office, but I guess bad blood is bad blood.<br /><br />Anyway, do not miss the delicious fun, the over-the-top silliness of the lisping, wisecrackin' Doc Holliday - and the steadfast rock Kurt Russell is, serving to anchor this film. I don't know why but the true clan leader, Virgil (Sam Elliot) is made to look a bit weak and unhinged. Virgil was the family's rock in real life, often the only man who could control Wyatt's losses of temper.<br /><br />They got all that wrong here, but that's the fun of horse opera for horse opera's sake. You'll see why it is considered one of the best films of all time, even if it isn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Over the years I have seen this film many many times, but ironically never owned the DVD, as for a long time it wasn't available. Fortunately this has enabled me to get the blu-ray edition without having to replace a DVD.<br /><br />The film: Most of us know the story which revolves around the famous shoot-out at the OK Corral. In my view this is the best of the many film versions you can get. The reasons are many, but Val Kilmers performance as Doc Holliday is first on the list. His delivery of some classic lines and his look are quite brilliant. Rest assured there some other teriffic performances, but his is the best by quite a margin. The direction is straightforward and the script keeps you guessing nicely in places. Sometimes the obvious doesn't happen.....<br /><br />Flaws: Its perhaps a little too long at 2:10 and maybe could have been trimmed a little. But I can't think where though, so this is a minor point.<br /><br />The Blu-ray: Overall this is a very good transfer to blu-ray. The picture is very sharp and the sound excellent. Only in a couple of interior shots could I fault the picture, where I thought it was a little grainy. Obviously I don't have a DVD to compare the blu-ray with but I'd be very surprised if its anywhere near as good overall.<br /><br />Extras: Not substantial, but there is a very good documentary with some comparitively recent interviews with the cast and some interesting historical background to the events portrayed and the lengths the production team went for historical accuracy. For example they used the actual Wyatt Earp Peacemaker in the film (his gun).<br /><br />Overall: 5 stars no question!</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>This is a fun movie.  Kurt Russell is dead-on as a wiley Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer steals every scene he appears in as Doc Holliday.  Bill Paxton is good as Wyatt's brother Morgan. Is there anyone that looks better under a cowboy hat than Sam Elliot?  He plays brother Virgil Earp.  Not so much a true narrative as a series of vignettes featuring the above characters (with the centerpiece Shootout at the OK Corral) the film is nonetheless a very entertaining look at these characters.  Powers Boothe is menacingly bad as Curly Bill, the leader of the outlaw Cowboys. <p>Kilmer's Doc Holliday, in particular, is a load of fun. &quot;I'm your Huckleberry&quot; he taunts Johnny Ringo, and although I have no idea where this saying originated, Kilmer repeats it in this film to entertaining effect.  Later on he is asked why he sticks his neck out for Sheriff Earp.  &quot;Wyatt Earp is my friend&quot;, he replies simply.  The other man scoffs &quot;I've got LOTS of friends&quot;.  &quot;I don't&quot; says Doc.<p>This is the kind of movie that perpetuates the &quot;Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, but it's also the kind of movie that grown men still quote liberally with big smiles on their faces more than a decade after it's initial release.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>This 1993 western may have received mixed reviews from critics when it was released, but it has since become a cult classic film that is still great movie that even people who don't like westerns can enjoy.  The film is carried at a rather nice pace, and the sublime casting of Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday makes Tombstone work.  Kilmer turns in his best performance, while Kurt Russell turns in a near equally great performance as Wyatt Earp.  The huge ensemble cast includes Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Jason Priestly, Billy Zane, Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Rooker, John Corbett, Thomas Haden Church, Stephen Lang, Robert John Burke, Charlton Heston, and the voice of Robert Mitchum in major and supporting roles, along with some great gunfights and brilliant set design all help Tombstone be a feast of the senses.  If you already own Tombstone on video or on the older edition DVD, then seriously consider upgrading to this new edition Vista Series DVD set, the extras are great and well put together, and Tombstone is one of the best action films I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>Although I'm a greater fan of the Lawrence Kasdan / Kevin Costner version of Wyatt Earp's life, TOMBSTONE -- the Director's Cut -- is a marked improvement from the original threatrical version.  Several key scenes are extended from the original release, and many new scenes are added that give the characters a bit more emotional depth.  While much of the action still remains over the top, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer epitomize the violence so prevalent between the lawmen and the Cowboys of the time period.  Don't be duped, however, by the documentaries; they're very short, and they truly don't add much to the experience.  While some interesting tidbits are thrown out about the making of the picture, very little is of relative substance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are the driving force that makes this film work. Sure it isn't totally realistic, but it is more fun than any other western I have seen. The gunfight at the OK Corral in the film is probably the best you will ever see at showing what most likely really happened on October 26, 1881. Val Kilmer steals every scene he is in and spews forth some of the coolest lines you will ever here coming out of a western movie. Kilmer's Doc Holliday is one of the only roles I can stand him in and he is an absolute genius at this part. I'm not a huge fan of Kurt Russell either, but he is my favorite Wyatt Earp by far. This is a must have western that is more fun than Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp, but I would see that one too for a more accurate depiction of Earp's life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>Some critics like to to point out that this more isn't all<br /><br />the way accurate...

But as somebody said, you<br /><br />can't forget Russell's acting in this movie. He is pretty<br /><br />good and believeable. I'm sad that they didn't get more out<br /><br />of Sam Elliot out of this one.... He is a vet of these type<br /><br />of movies... But seems to really fade into the background<br /><br />too much.

This movie had above all outstanding actors. Kurt Russell.Sam Elliott, and Powers Boothe were very good in theor roles.

It falls short when some bad guys hit the scene. Earp along with his gang take action to stop the forces of evil.The showdown between Johnny Ringo and Doc Holliday is exceptional. Of course the big confrontation happens at the O.K. Corral. This is without question an outstanding movie. See it, you will not be dissapointed. Like it has already been said,a cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>TOMBSTONE must rank as one of the best westerns in the post-Peckinpah/Leone era.  This is due to many of the traditional elements that made the western genre a uniquely American genre, not to mention the disillusionment that the characters in Peckinpah's and Leone's films felt.<p>This film focuses on legendary Kansas lawman Wyatt Earp who hopes to stick with retirement from law enforcement by journeying with his brothers (Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton) to the Arizona mining town of Tombstone, along with Wyatt's good friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer).  The trouble is, however, Tombstone is a practically lawless place.  And when a group of outlaws known as the Cowboys begin to turn Tombstone's streets red with the blood of innocent people, the stage is set--not merely for the celebrated gunfight at the O.K. Corral, but the revenge that comes after Paxton is killed and Elliott wounded.<p>Much has been made of Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and he certainly does a lot with the role.  I myself think that the real star is the often underrated Russell, who looks virtually like a dead ringer for Wyatt Earp.  So often, Russell's talents were underutilized by filmmakers.  Here, he really shows his mettle as an actor.  Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn, as the head honchos of the Cowboys, make for incredible heavies; and the legendary Charlton Heston has a cameo as well.<p>Well directed by George Cosmatos (RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART 2), scored by Bruce Broughton, and excellently photographed by William Fraker (BULLITT) on Arizona locations, TOMBSTONE is a must-see western, proof that there is still life in this genre if only Hollywood would return to it more often.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>This same movie has been made and remade so often that there is a "traditional version" , an "historical version " and a "romantic version".<br />In this version the US marshal Wyatt Earp hunts down the red sash cowboys after they kill his brother by shooting him in the back in a pool hall.<br />This takes place well after the famous shoot out at the O. K. Corral.<br />In the traditional version his brother is shot before the O.K. Corral.<br />In most versions we never see what happens to Doc Holliday or hear about how Wyatt lives to a ripe old age in California.<br />So this version my well be closer to the actual historical events than most of these movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>If I could give this more stars I would.  Tombstone was brilliant.  Let me say right off the bat though, the love story part of the film really slowed things down for me.  This film focuses not only on the feud but also on the friendship between these men.<br /><br />Kurt Russell (as Wyatt Earp) gave a fine performance.  Val Kilmer who portrays Doc Holliday was robbed of an Oscar.  What he did with the role was nothing short of amazing. He actually stole the show in some scenes.  The costuming was very good as well.<br /><br />I don't even like westerns and I don't remember how I came to view Tombstone in the first place.  I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp is just a waste of time.  You need not  bother with that thing.<br /><br />Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Robert Burke, Sam Elliot, Stephan Lang, Bill Paxton, Billy Zane, Terry O' Quinn were all very well cast for this film.  There are also  suprise cameo appearances by Charlton Heston and Billy Bob Thorton (a bit heavier then).  Sly Stallone's  brother also has a small role.<br /><br />Just a note for those that may not understand what happens in the Doc Holliday death scene.  Near the beginning of the film, one of the Wyatts brothers mentions that he read an article that said when some people die they see a bright light leading them to heaven.  Just before his death, Doc asks Wyatt to leave his bedside because he knows the end is near and he doesn't want his friend to see him die.  After Wyatt leaves, Doc looks down at his body and says, "This is funny."  In other words, he sees the light of heaven.  It is reported by some historians that Doc did indeed say "This is funny" just seconds before he died.  Some say that the reason he said it is because he always thought that he would die in the heat of a gun battle, not sick in bed.<br /><br />Point of interest:  When Wyatt's brother dies however, he sees no such light.<br /><br />If you love the western genre, this film should have an honored place in your collection.<br /><br />Parental Advisory:  I advise a viewing age of at least 13.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Tombstone is much better than Kevin Costner's "Wyatt Earp" which was released around the same time, thanks to great performances from Russell and especially Val Kilmer. It's a bit overly dramatic at times, but far superior to Costner's plodding script. Kilmer completely steals the show, sometimes overshadowing Sam Elliott's equally excellent casting. Highly recommend as a great adventure, and certainly over "Wyatt Earp."</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>Released just before the debacle that was &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, &quot;Tombstone&quot; succeeds where that film fails in almost every way.<p>&quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; deals with Earp's childhood, and may be more historically accurate than the artistic liberties taken with THIS film, but it's less interesting as a result.  &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; was a film in need of a serious editor, but &quot;Tombstone&quot; involves you very early, and only really loses steam in the last five minutes.<p>The denoument after Johnny Ringo is killed seems almost perfunctory, not to mention rushed.  But that's a minor complaint.<p>Val Kilmer might be over-the-top in this outing, but he's a lot of fun, and you can tell he's enjoying himself.  He practically walks away with the film, although Kurt Russell is passable as Wyatt Earp.  Sam Elliott is great, as always, and the rest of the supporting cast is mostly spot on in their respective parts.<p>The exceptions being Jason Priestly (why was he even billed?), the underused Billy Zane (miscast as an Englishman), and Dana Delany as the love interest; she turns in an unbelievably bad (and grating, to boot) performance, and she's actually the most jarring element of the film.<p>The film wisely deals with the best part of the Earp saga (the shootout at the OK Corral), and while it might have most western purists up in arms, it's still tremendously watchable.</p></br><a href="../users/A17D77DFID0GZG.html">A17D77DFID0GZG</a><br/><p>Tombstone is an interesting film in that it came out at the same time as the superior (I feel) Wyatt Earp.  I saw Tombstone first, and although I thought it to be a good movie with a great, and often funny, performance  from Val Kilmer, I felt the film was uneven (I didn't like it near as much  the second time around).  Russell is solid as the stone-faced lawman, but  the representation of Ringo and the Clantons seemed typical  Hollywood.<p>Unlike Wyatt Earp (which tries to be an epic--showing the  life of the famous lawman), Tombstone centers only around the time he and  his brothers moved to that Arizona town.  As noted in the other reviews of  both films, it's surprising Hollywood chose to show the shootings of Morgan  and Virgil Earp on the same evening and not months apart as had actually  happened (probably due to movie length constrants).  Between 1 and 10, I  give Tombstone a solid 6.  It's well worth the rental or purchase, if for  no other reason than seeing Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E975KR2HRERX.html">A3E975KR2HRERX</a><br/><p>Great characters and great settings!

This is a novie that I have never heard a bad thing about, even though the discussions almost always involve guys.  Really a fun and well-made film.  One of the few movies that I can watch time and time again.  A 5 star classic.  Enjoy!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>To be honest, western "classics" such as Once Upon a Time in the West or the Good, the Bad and the Ugly always seemed too long for me. I'm all for pacing and character development but only when it seems necessary and if you can get away with it otherwise. But an epic film doesn't have to be super long, no matter how well-made it is (sole exception is Seven Samurai, 3 and 1/2 hours is nothing). Tombstone is one of those kind of westerns people mention almost because they run out of recent westerns to name. Yeah, Unforgiven was great but then it's like "now what"? Director's cut usually implies the movie the director wanted us to see in the first place so watching Tombstone my first thought was yeah it's a good movie but what's so different this time?<br /><br />Legendary westerner Wyatt Earp is retiring along with his 2 brothers, Virgil and Morgan and they settle in the town of Tombstone. Also there is Doc Holliday, Wyatt's friend and stricken with tuberculosis. Wyatt has no intention of becoming town sheriff but might have to since "the Cowboys", a band of red sash-wearing bandits are causing trouble. Wyatt decides enough is enough and basically tears the West apart bringing down the Cowboys.<br /><br />I have to say this is one impressive cast. In addition to the main 4 leads: Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer(who's exceptional as Holliday), Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton (kind of miscast though), we have Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Jason Priestley, Billy Zane, Charlton Heston even as well as Billy Bob Thornton and James Cameron regular Michael Biehn. Big cast don't necessarily mean good performances all around except Russell and Kilmer though everyone does have a share. Wasted though are Billy Zane and Jason Priestley who don't really add much or even do much. It's got a bit too much of a more "modern" feel rather than truly feeling like a western.<br /><br />Is there enough to like about this film? Definately, there's plenty of shootouts and gun battles, I already mentioned Kilmer but he's just so good from mannerisms to lines, even that weird coin thing he does in his introduction. There's a couple noteworthy scenes and the whole thing has a very accessible quality to it, rather than being too long for its own good. In fact, it almost seems like a good stepping stone into other westerns such as the Leone ones, Unforgiven or the way-back-then ones with John Wayne and whatnot. It's probably not the most deepest or best western you'll see but it's enjoyable when you get down to it.<br /><br />If all you're looking for is a good western then Tombstone isn't as bad a choice as you would think. Is it those treasured westerns? Probably not but it's worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>In Arizona 1879,one town means crime,one town means gunpoint and one town means justice is coming and it's coming to Tombstone.the citizens were controled by the gun.

He wants peace, quiet, and above all else : prosperity. That is until Wyatt is forced back into the life. The ruthless band of outlaws known as the Cowboys ( led by Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn), gun for Wyatt, his family, and his best friend Doc Holliday ( Val Kilmer). Now Wyatt and Doc, along with Wyatt's brothers Morgan ( Bill Paxton)and Virgil (Sam Elliot)prepare for the legendary gunfight at the O.K. Corral. <p>Before I saw &quot;Tombstone&quot;, I was never really a huge fan of Westerns. However, &quot;Tombstone&quot; was so great that it managed to turn me into a huge fan of the western genre. The shoot out scenes and overall non stop action is amazing in this film. Tombstone also gives an extremely acurate portrayal of events as well. Kurt Russell gave the best performance possible as Wyatt Earp. He nailed the fierce determination and sense of justice. Val Kilmer gave the best performance in the film as Doc Holliday. Perfect portrayal of Holliday's lifestyle consisting of: drinking, smoking, gambling, women, and a quick trigger finger. Bill Paxton and Sam Elliot make nice additions as the Earp brothers. Dana Delaney gave a nice supporting role as the actress Josephine Marcus. Unbelieveable chemistry between her and Kurt Russell!! Other well known actors include Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Jason Priestley, Stephen Lang, and Thomas Hayden Church. Billy Bob Thorton makes a hilarious cameo in the film as well. <p>When Tombstone first came out on DVD, I unfortunately ended up buying it. The movie was great, but the DVD was just plain awful. However, I was overjoyed when Tombstone became a member of the Vista Series. This automatically puts the film on a whole new level. Vista Series DVD's always provide for the best quality possible, and tons of outstanding extras. You get a making of featurette in three parts, commentary from director George P Cosmatos, and more. I have seen many Westerns since &quot;Tombstone&quot;, but it is still the greatest Western ever made in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>To say Tombstone is a great western is not at all to do the movie justice.  To say Tombstone is unbelievably good is to trammel it down in the muck.  What you've got to do is grab each person you know by the lapels and shake them back and forth while screaming in their face that they absolutely must see this film.  Friends don't let friends not see Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday - easily the most inspired character in all of fiction.  I will stack Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday up against any other character that has ever been created by an artist.  He will win.  Hamlet?  Come off it love.  Who do you think you're fooling with this Shakespeare routine?  Certainly not me and probably not even yourself, as you yawn and scratch your way through yet another &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  Why don't you make a clean slate of it and just admit to yourself finally that Shakespeare bores the crud out of you and his plays are irritating beyond belief?  But Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday... now THERE'S literature!  Stack him up against Hamlet and he'll blow his brains out with his ivory handled revolvers.  And as Hamlet gags and sputters and reels and staggers Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday will yell, &quot;C'mown, Johnny, C'MOWN!&quot;  And he will advance solicitously, full of adroit concern as Hamlet collapses, saying, &quot;Oh you're no daisy.  You're no daisy atall!&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>THE FILM<br /><br />"Tombstone" is certainly one of the best westerns ever made.  The action/shoot-out scenes are terrific, exciting and very well-staged.  The set design, costumes, sets, and everything else truly takes you back to the old days of the Wild West.  And the acting! WOWWEEE!  Kurt Russell gives the greatest performance of his entire career as the legendary Wyatt Earp; he adds so much depth to the figure with a past/reputation that he would give anything to leave behind, but he knows that he can't.....and to put it in his own words, "And that's the damnable misery of it."  He is both very human and a "wouldn't-hurt-a-fly" kind of guy, but also the baddest dude this side of the Rio Grande!  This is one guy you do not want to piss off!  But Val Kilmer absolutely steals the show as the gamblin' gun-totin' "Doc" Holiday; his mere screen appearence can brighten up the scene.  He has the best lines (except for the one above, which is given to Kurt Russell), and presents them in a way that is bound to make you laugh/cry/do whatever it is that you're meant to do.  Everyone else does great, too.  Love backstories in westerns aren't usually all that great, but the one in here is very well-done.  This is a must-own for any western or action fan!!! 5 STARS!!!!!<br /><br />VISTA SERIES DVD<br /><br />I was really hyped up about this new two-disc set, because I heard it was great.  Well, not that I'm saying it's a bad DVD (FAR FROM IT!), but it fails to live up to its reputation, both in the "all-new, never before seen Director's Cut" and the Extras on Disc 2.<br /><br />First of all, there's hardly any thing added in here!  Four minutes at the most.  In the end, you come off wishing for much more to be added in.  And what makes it even more disappointing, is that if you watch the Theatrical Trailer, you will see TONS of footage not shown in the movie!!  That pissed me and my dad off A LOT!!  But, oh well.  What can ya do?  What is added in is very good.  Every scene adds more character development or drama to the story, as well as make more sense to the plot/story.  And the picture and sound quality is nearly flawless; just some grain here and there, but BARELY!<br /><br />The Extras are nothin' to get excited about.  The 3-part Making-of documentary is very entertaining, but unfortuanately it isn't very long (a little less than half an hour).  It does have great interviews with the cast & crew, and it's very informative.  It makes you realize how much went into making this magnificent western, and you come off respecting the film even more.  Also, the cast members offer little insights on their characters, and those are very interesting!  The "Tombstone Epitaph" is pointless unless you get right up to the screen; otherwise, you can't read a darn thing!  Besides that, there isn't much besides some trailers and story boards (boooorrriiiing!!!), although I have not yet tried the DVD-Rom card game that is featured.  That looks fun!  But, ironically, the best special feature is the really neat case and cover art it comes in!<br /><br />In Conclusion:  This DVD, while not among the best DVD's I own, is a great buy.  The film is presented in a format that is perfect!  Well, nearly.  Poor special features or not, at least it has special features!  The original DVD didn't have diddly.  The Vista Series DVD is a somewhat disappointment.  But, then again, every DVD seems like a somewhat disappointment after owning and viewing the Special Extended DVD Edition of "TLOTR"!  But what the Vista Series is focused on is the actual film, and in that case, it succeeded beautifully.  They sould've either done  A)  Inserted all that footage shown in the trailer, or  B)  Not included the trailer at all!  Then we wouldn't have any complaints and wouldn't know about it at all!<br /><br />Overall, a great DVD to add to your collection.<br /><br />Film:  5 Stars<br /><br />DVD:  4 Stars<br />Overall:  4.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>A lavish historical western epic you know the name you know what he does for a living and you know what him and his lawmen did at the O.K. coral one the hugest showdowns of the first millenium is captured here when you hear  Tombstone you think it just going to be the showdown and that's the end of  the movie but Kurt Russel's potrayal of Wyatt Erapp is awsome as well as a  strong supporting performance from Val Kilmer as his doomed drinking friend  Kevin Renolds 3 hour 15 minute Wyatt Erapp is about the man and his  life.Tomstone is a little over 2 hours and is more importantly about the  legend of this unforgettable town and while it brings emotional depth the  showdown between the Clanton's and The Erapps comes within the first  half  of the movie vs. Wyatts you wait almost 2 hours and 15 minutes before you  get to see the  showdown and furthermore it's to peaceful in  Wyatt Erapp  but in Tombstone because this ,  battle at the coral was violent Tombstone  shows you that and shows you the aftermath of what  happens to the lawmens  familys and the tragedy  and vengence it derives point put it may not be  accurate as far as the rest of the movie but as far as what this gunfight  looked like your not going to get much better then Tombstone it showed you  everything about this battle and not trying  to otherwise gloryify it the  clantons didn't know  who they were messing with and got no mercy in  return there is a legend in Arizona and it has a name it's legend is  Tombstone and in this movie  it is about as accurate as you can get it with  this movie the legend will live on in a good emotional and powerful western  about a man and a  town no cowboys should have messed with in the first  place justice is coming to Tombstone and  with a vengance.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>With a cult following as long as this one, I'm surprised at how little critical attention this one received.  I mean, back in '93, this was considered a lukewarm gunslinger and really only gained praise for Val Kilmer's turn as Doc Holiday.  Now, you won't find many who would put this down.  In fact, I've had many a friend tell me not to bother wasting time on the '94 film `Wyatt Earp' and only watch `Tombstone', which they all claim to be superior.  Of note, `Wyatt Earp' actually received an Oscar nomination for its cinematography, a feat that `Tombstone' couldn't manage; but it also racked up five Razzie nominations (winning two), another feat that `Tombstone' didn't attain.<br /><br />I haven't seen `Wyatt Earp'.<br /><br />It has taken me quite a while to finally see `Tombstone', but nestling onto the couch this past weekend to indulge in yet another `manly' film I'm required to like had me questioning my manhood yet again.  I mean, this happened when I watched `Braveheart' and got to thinking that it was a beautifully shot soap opera wrecked with vapid excuses for stereotypes.  My friends berated me and the Ammy community took strike against my three star review.  Watching `Tombstone' felt roughly similar in that it felt completely void of any real point.  It was just another gunslinger with big names and no real dissection of character.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I like my films to SAY something about the subject they embody.  Films that exist solely to show a montage of action sequences don't do a thing for me.  When you litter those action scenes with horrifically amateurish acting, I have an even bigger problem.<br /><br />So, while watching the film I couldn't help but imagine ways in which this film could have been something better.  First, the only great performance here is Val Kilmer.  The fact that he was Oscar snubbed (really snubbed of everything except two MTV Movie award nominations, one for `Most Desirable Male' which only tells me that the voting body, most likely consisting of teenage girls, didn't actually watch this movie and merely voted for him because he's Val Kilmer, since his sickly interpretation of Doc Holiday is anything but desirable) is a true testament to the mundane quality of the film itself.  He is surrounded by average to mediocre to just plain awful acting.  Kurt Russell tries, but ultimately fails to bring anything remotely `true' to his portrayal of Wyatt Earp.  I mean, he look ridiculous and then goes all banshee at the end, which feels so forced and silly ("The law is coming!").  Sam Elliott kind of survives this with his grumble, but he's somewhat forgettable.  Forgettable is a godsend when you consider that Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn are unforgettably horrible in this movie.  UGH, and to think I used to have some sort of man crush on Bill Paxton and `wanted' to see him movies.<br /><br />Just...no.<br /><br />As far as the film itself, the scripting is somewhat skeletal.  I never felt like I really knew who these men were.  They are just kind of there and yes, they are tough.  Doc Holiday is the only character who feels lived in, and a lot of that is due to the way that Kilmer embodies the man.  He really drives this film.  The lovelorn triangle between Earp, his drug addicted wife and the pretty actress is domineering and foolishly handled and I just wish it had been ripped from the film entirely.  I know that it is somewhat representative of fact, but if you can't flesh it out to where it feels genuine then don't bother representing it at all.  The final scene alone made me want to barf it was so pathetic.  Seriously.  We run out into the street and laugh?  That leads me to the awfully clich&eacute;d score.  I hated it.<br /><br />So, see this for Kilmer.  Or just don't see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>After Cleaning Up:Dodge City, The Earp Brothers (Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott & Bill Paxton) are settledown quiting for been the law and moving with thier wives to Tombstone for Peace but when a Monauding Outlaw Gang (Led by Micheal Biehn and Powers Boothe) starting trouble in the Town.

Cosmatos (the "Rambo" films) made an epic historical drama action remake (if you wish to call it such) of the classic film "Gunfight At The O.K. Corral." Although the translations for the Latin used by Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn,<br /><br />"The Terminator," "Terminator 2" [Special Edition], "Megiddo") and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, "The Saint," "Batman Forever,"<br /><br />"The Prince Of Egypt") appear in the "Trivia" section, I still<br /><br />think that Cosmatos should have placed English subtitles for those phrases in the movie. Worth viewing, not only for the historical value of the film, but because of the star-studded cast, which includes the real Wyatt Earp's fifth cousin, also named Wyatt Earp, Kurt Russell ("Sky High"), Sam Elliott ("HULK"), Bill Paxton ("The Terminator," "Twister," "Titanic") Billy Zane ("Back To The Future," "Back To The Future Part II,"<br /><br />"The Phantom," "Titanic," the made-for-TV remake of "CLEOPATRA,"<br /><br />"Sniper," the TV mini-series "Sole Survivor," "Posse," "Tales From The Crypt Presents DEMON KNIGHT"), Billy Bob Thornton ("The Alamo," the recent remake of "The Bad News Bears," "Bad Santa,"<br /><br />"Pushing Tin," "Armageddon"), Stephen Lang ("Gods And Generals,"<br /><br />"Gettysburg"), Powers Boothe (the TV mini-series "Joan Of Arc"), Thomas Haden Church (the "George Of The Jungle" movies, the upcoming "Spider-Man 3" [set for release next summer]), Robert Mitchum ("The Longest Day," "Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison," "River Of No Return," "The Wild Bunch") as the Narrator and Academy Award winner Charlton Heston ("The Ten Commandments," "Ben-Hur" [Academy Award, 1959], "Planet Of The Apes," "Soylent Green,"<br /><br />"William Shakespeare's Hamlet") as Henry Hooker. Too violent for young children, but older kids and adults will enjoy this excellent history lesson. Rated PG-13 for violence and brief strong language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>I am giving this movie 4 stars, but what I'd really like to do is give it 3.5.<br /><br />So much about this movie bugged me, but it was a great action flick and was a movie about one of my "Old West" heroes, so there you go. I give it an extra half star because of that. (Well that, and it stars Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton and an EXCELLENT Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday!)<br /><br />The portrayals were pretty spot on... however, so many facts in this movie were mixed up and made up and forged and falsified that it might as well be called Historical Fiction.<br /><br />First, When Wyatt and the boys are going to disarm the Clanton gang, we see a building burning in the background. Though Virgil's attention is momentarily drawn, he continues on toward handling the misdemeanor crime of carrying a weapon in town, rather than doing his duty to help put out the fire. As the town would've likely not had a great system for putting out fires, (No fire station for one!) It was up to Virgil as the ranking law man to see to it that this fire was put out. This would have been his first concern. Not whether or not some drunk idiots were carrying concealed weapons.<br /><br />Second, Morgan was not killed on the same night Virgil was shot. Virgil was shot in December, just two months after the OK Corrall Incident. Morgan was murdered in March the following year.<br /><br />Furthermore, the COWBOYS did not wear red sashes. Curly Bill was not the leader, nor was Ike Clanton, nor was Johnny Ringo. The Cowboys were a loose band of outlaws. The whole point of being an outlaw is that you don't want to follow a leader. You might be banded together for a common purpose but you don't recognize authority.<br /><br />There is no proof that Doc Holliday killed Johnny Ringo. In fact, it's more than likely he did not, as he was reportedly not in the area when and where Ringo's body was found. Most reports today claim Ringo's wound was self-inflicted.<br /><br />Wyatt was not at the Sanitarium where Doc died. In fact, he did not even hear about Doc's death until a couple of years later. By most accounts, Wyatt never visited Doc and he never wrote a book about his friend, Doc Holliday. Current research suggests Doc spent time in a sanitarium but may have left and likely died in a hotel room.<br /><br />Josephine Sarah "Sadie" Marcus Earp was not called Josie. She was in fact called Sadie. Her parents were not wealthy and Wyatt was forced to work in various jobs well into his old age. The infamous photo of her was also of an entirely different woman.<br /><br />Marshall Fred White was not an old man as depicted in Tombstone. Born in 1849, killed in 1880, he would have been a mere 31 years old. Younger than Wyatt who was born circa 1848<br /><br />It has been argued that Doc Holliday was in fact a better friend with Morgan and Virgil than with Wyatt. Yet Doc is always associated with Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />The Cowboys never shot into the Earp's house, or at the Earp women.<br />(Apparently there was SOME honor among thieves)<br /><br />Sherm McMasters was not killed during Earp's Vendetta ride. No body was dragged as a message or challenge to Doc or any member of Earp's posse. In fact, no member of Earp's group died during the course of the Vendetta.<br /><br />Billy Claiborne was not shot by Wyatt Earp during the Earp Vendetta Ride. He was killed by "Buckskin" Frank Leslie after returning to Tombstone in 1882.<br /><br />Morgan Earp did not die lying on the pool table, but in a cardroom adjoining the billiard parlor<br /><br />All this having been said, I enjoyed the movie. I managed to get quite lost in the portrayals of the various old west characters.<br /><br />I see why people enjoy this movie and I DO recommend it... but with a huge grain of salt!</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>When "Tombstone" begins, you think you're watching an 80 years ago amateur's attempt at a home movie by your grandpa.  What's happening of course, is old school mentality says a western has to make the bad guy as evil as possible so the audience has no pity for the bad guy when it's his time to be killed off.  "Tombstone" takes that to the most extreme I think I've seen in over a decade, but for as hard as they try, they just don't get the job done.  The producer and director are trying to give the audience a sense of the past misdeeds of the Clanton and the McClaury gang, using technique.  No sale, try something else in your next film, okay?  Kurt Russell helped direct this film and I guess this was just too early in his career to be experienced enough to know what works and what doesn't.<br />More and more, Hollywood makes justice and due process of the law to seem as equally evil and wrong as the criminal element.  Brutality for brutality, and yet done in a manner that portrays it isn't so much revenge as it is a reckoning.  The outlaw gang has an extended family adherence apparently, and the last quarter of the movie shows the marshal posse gunning them down like this movie was trying to beat a Bruce Willis movie for body count.  The story has for the most part ended before these events, and then has to go back to where the story left off.  Peppered into the stew is the poignant passing of Doc Holliday in a hospital bed in Colorado.  That sanatorium segment could have been left out entirely.  Seriously.<br />Well, Val Kilmer does a fair portrayal of Doc Holiday, although for all the sincere effort Kurt Russell puts into the role of Wyatt Earp, Kurt just isn't convincing.  Sam Elliott was throttled too far back.  This version of the events of the city by the movie's name, would have been a much better story if Sam Elliott had been cast in the lead.  Kurt Russell belongs in action, adventure, or sci-fi; but would be better off leaving westerns to other actors.  In those other genre, Kurt Russell has impressed me over and over again.  This time not so much.<br />I was surprised to see Charlton Heston in this movie in just a cameo role.<br />Michael Biehn does a great job in the role of Johnny Ringo; one of the bad guys.  His meeting at the big oak with Doc Holliday is the best part of this whole film.<br />I can't give this movie 5 stars.  My opinion is there was just something not quite right about this film, and I'm leaving historical accuracy out of it.  Something just wasn't kosher.<br />Most of the big names that should have been prominent were almost in obscurity by contrast.  Michelle Beauchamp only has about 4 minutes of screen time.  Billy Bob Thornton is a casino table dealer in a saloon.  Stephen Lang was great in "The Men Who Stare At Goats" and in "Gettysburg," but in this version of "Tombstone," his role as Ike Clanton is another one of those casting problems that simply doesn't work convincingly.  Dana Delany is lovely in her role as Josephine Marcus, but that sure could have been expanded upon.  BTW, the "R" rating is for violence, not for nudity or sexual situations.<br />Overall, this movie was much choppier than it had to be, and doesn't have the continuity to make it superior to "Wyatt Earp" with Kevin Costner.  Casting and emphasis in "Tombstone" is simply off the mark.  Should have been a lot better, the cast had enough talent; but apparently in the wrong place.  I'm glad I bought this DVD used.  May have to recycle this one for something better in trade.  Shouldn't be too hard to accomplish.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XMSURGM0L1N.html">A35XMSURGM0L1N</a><br/><p>Tombstone is about the Immortal Wyatt Earp and his brothers in a town called Tombstone where they came to make a new living but took up the side of the law again to fight evil cowboys. There are running horses, saloonfights and a lot of gunbattles, so nothing new there. And a little romance of course. Even the titles in the end scene are western like<p>What makes this movie stand out a little about the others is the acting performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. His accent is perfect and he plays a dying man very convincingly. This is the only reason you should really see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>George P. Cosmatos' rather overrated 1993 western covering the events and characters of the famous shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone, Arizona, between the Earps and the Clantons.  Although brought to life by a brilliant performance by Val Kilmer and modest acting by everyone else, the film suffers from an uneven screenplay that tries to incorporate too much of a sstory in light of its narrow subject.<br /><br />As the title indicates, the entire film is primarily about what led to the shootout at the OK Corral instead of being about the life of Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russel.)  Unfortunately, it seems that the film can't make up its mind as to whether it wants to deal more with its characters or its setting.  As such, we have a Wyatt Earp who should be worrying about the Clantons but is more cocerned with explaining issues that have little relevance to the main plot (e.g. a rather shallow love story that just takes time away from the film dealing with the Clantons or other important characters.)  Other nuances just add to the irritation; the most absurd part being a cattle-rustling and illiterate cowboy engaging in a Latin wit contest with Doc Holiday (please, the Clantons were low-life cattle russtlers who could barely even read English.)  The story tends to stumble upon itself in this fashion leading to a rather hurried ending that is anti-climactic.<br /><br />In sum, it's a rather overrated film that became popular mainly, if not exclusively, because of Val Kilmer's excellent performance as Doc Holliday.  Apart from that, the screenplay is uneven in its treatment of the characters and in terms of plot continuity. A good film to own or rent but it certainly isn't one of the best westerns to have been made.  For a better study of Wyatt Earp as a character and his life, watch 'Wyatt Earp' with Kevin Costner instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>After I struggled through Wyatt Earp, my friends all recommended this movie to me. Apparently Kurt Russel is a better actor than Kevin Costner and Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday is just amazing. So I finally watched it and it wasn't all that great.<p>Of course Doc Holliday is the best character in this storyline and he will always be the best character, but I found Dennis Quaid a better Doc Holiday (if only because he was saving us from Kevin Costner's delivery) Val Kilmer just seems pretentious where Dennis Quaid was having fun. Kurt Russel is ok, but this movie is also ponderous and too long. <p>Besides that the video transfer isn't very good. Half the time it looks like everyone is walking around in a dust cloud. While that brings some authenticity to the old west storyline it doesn't bring much pleasure to the viewer at home. If you want to watch this movie, get the DVD. I can't say that it's any better, but it can't be any worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Tombstone is one of the most entertaining pieces of cinema to hit the silver screen in the past 15 years. Kurt Russell does a fantastic job portraying former Sheriff Wyatt Earp. Russell's Earp is at a crossroads in his life and sure, really, of only two things: he wants to make a lot of money and he wants to live near his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton). Needless to say when the Earp three move into the ragtag town of Tombstone business picks up a bit. The Earp's go into the saloon/casino business and start to clean up which begins to rub a few of the local cowboys the wrong way. All the ensuing altercations lead to the historic shootout at the OK Corral which is one of the films many highlights. Wyatt's sidekick is perhaps the best thing about Tombstone. Val Kilmer turns in an unforgettable performance as Doc Holiday. Holiday is by far the most intriguing character in the film and endears himself to the viewer almost instantly. Kilmer simply steals every scene he is in, which makes for one of the most memorable (and lovable) movie characters of all-time. Although Doc's hedonistic lifestyle eventually catches up with him in the end, it sure is great to watch this &quot;fabulous disaster.&quot; The film is long but it doesn't feel it. The pacing is fantastic and almost all of the movie is action packed. Overall, Tombstone is easily in my top five favorite films of all-time...and on some days it's number 1. Highest Recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>As a fan of movies, I find that most films labled as &quot;The Director's Cut&quot; just add scenes for the sake of adding scenes (&quot;Star Wars: A New Hope Special Edition:&quot; the scene between Biggs and Luke was not needed or acted well). But if you are lucky, you'll find a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; that features scenes that help better round out the story (&quot;Highlander 2: The Renegade Version,&quot; &quot;The Abyss Special Edition,&quot; and &quot;Superman: The Movie Expanded Edition&quot;). One of those fortunate films is George P. Cosmatos' cut for his epic western &quot;Tombstone.&quot; Released under Buena Vista's successful &quot;Vista Series&quot; packaging, &quot;Tombstone,&quot; my choice as the best western film ever made, now includes almost five minutes of footage that really give a better understanding of the story and the characters.

Doc Holliday is a name known from legend. All these elements and more are present. I have no idea how historically accurate their portrayals are and I don't care. What I do care about is that this was a fun movie.<br /><br />Wyatt Earp and his brothers move to Tombstone to try and put their pasts behind them and cash in on the silver rush. While there, they get sucked back into the law enforcement business and try to clean up the town for decent folk. The problem is that the bad guys are really bad. As a result, the bad guy body count just keeps climbing until Wyatt triumphs. That's the story but it is not the "entertainment".<br /><br />I like seeing the bad guys get their comeuppance as well as the next guy but what makes this movie work is a combination of the story and the characterizations and the acting and the cinematography. It's all good. Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday does an especially fine job but the others get kudos as well. The good guys are "good" but they do have their human problems as well. The bad guys are nothing but bad and, eventually, dead.<br /><br />No one is going to earn academic credit for the history in this movie (I hope). That is beside the point. The purpose of this one is to see the good guys beat the bad guys and feel good about it. That alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Put your mind on hold and just sit back to enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>After success cleaning up Dodge City, Wyatt Earp moves to Tombstone, Arizona, and wishes to get rich in obscurity. He meets his brothers there, as well as his old friend Doc Holliday. A band of outlaws that call themselves The Cowboys are causing problems in the region with various acts of random violence, and inevitably come into confrontation with Holliday and the Earps, which leads to a shoot-out at the OK Corral. A powerful cast is essential for a great Western, and you couldn't find a better group of actors as the Earp brothers. This is a thrill ride for anyone who loves westerns. "TOMBSTONE" is a truly a superior movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>When I think of the ultimate Western two films come immediately to mind; 'The Magnificent Seven' from '60 and 'Tombstone' from '93. When you compare the two it doesn't take long to see the similarities between these classic films and realize what sets them apart from the rest of the pack.<br /><br />1) Both films boast superior casts and many unforgetable performances.<br />2) The momentum starts to build from the very begining and never faulters on its journey to the closing credits.<br />3) The dialogue is amazing. Every word, every phrase is loaded with meaning and portent, all coupled with a plethora of quotable lines you'll never tire of hearing viewing after viewing.<br /><br />Probably the most important similarity of all is they both exude an aura of nobility about the characters involved, perfectly capturing what you might like to call the "noble savage". If you want to know what constitutes a classic western study these two films. You'll figure it out in no time.<br /><br />Wonderful performances abound; Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Powers Boothe, Billy Zane, the list goes on and on. However it's Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday that will forever remain my favorite.<br /><br />'Tombstone' receives my highest rating: 5 Stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>But he's always your brother and that's the central theme of Tombstone. I was trying to think of a way I could be a little more detached about his movie than I feel like being, but there's no point in trying to do so. The fact is that this is a wonderful film with a wonderful story line and wonderful acting. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday sucks out all the oxygen in every scene he's in (and even a few where he's off camera). He is devoted to his best friend Wyatt Earp for many reasons but chiefly because he's one of the only friends that he has. Admittedly, this is only a semi-historically accurate portrait of Holliday but the sacrifices he makes for the Earp brothers are touching and admirable. In my mind, the gambler/dentist is the perfect embodiment of loyalty and honor. These are very politically incorrect virtues so we must be thankful that some element of pop culture decided to enshrine them somewhere. Independent of its symbolic and emotional resonance, Tombstone is just a plain old good time. Whatever you want to call it--an action pic, a western or a drama--it's superb and fantastic cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>In spite of living in Arizona, I did not have much of a historical view of the Gunfight at the OK Corral, even though I visited Tombstone.  (My only information was a Star Trek episode and a series in the comic strip "Mandrake The Magician", which both make no historical claims.)  So I watched "Wyatt Earp" and now "Tombstone".  By the way, the day I watched "Tombstone," there was a Bizarro cartoon titled "Gunfight At The OK Chorale."<br /><br />For those who want to get to the gist, I will say that I think "Wyatt Earp" is probably more accurate historically, but I found "Tombstone" much more entertaining.  Where "Tombstone" succeeds over "Wyatt Earp":<br /><br />1.  The Gunfight is more exciting.<br /><br />2.  Kurt Russell's Wyatt is more likeable and identifiable with than Kevin Costner's.<br /><br />3.  The villains are more dastardly here.<br /><br />4.  The friendship between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday is better developed here.<br /><br />5.  The ending does not drag, and is more satisfying.<br /><br />The only things that are better about "Wyatt Earp":  Mare Winningham's portrayal of Mattie (Earp's deserted, alcoholic wife) is light years ahead of Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's, and Linden Ashby is a more vibrant Morgan Earp.  As far as the portrayals of Doc Holiday, Val Kilmer's here and Dennis Quaid's in "Wyatt Earp" are equal.<br /><br />Now, for those who want a more in-depth comparison, here goes:<br /><br />1.  "Wyatt Earp" is more concerned with the life of Earp, while "Tombstone" is concerned with the gunfight, the events leading up to it, and the aftermath (though "Wyatt Earp" touches on the trial of the Earps and Holiday, while "Tombstone" does not).  Thus, the longer "Wyatt Earp" spends half of its time looking at Earp before his arrival at Tombstone.  Also, "Tombstone" does not deal with the Earps struggles as businessmen before returning to being lawmen.<br /><br />2.  "Tombstone" introduces the equivalent of the mafia with "The Cowboys".  Ike Clanton here is only a henchman with Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) being the chief villains and gang ring-leaders.  While there is clear opposition to the Earps in "Wyatt Earp", the cowboys are not as developed.<br /><br />3.  "Wyatt Earp" starts off with Wyatt waiting for his brothers to tell him what the Clantons are up to, and then leading them to the gunfight.  "Tombstone" has Wyatt being very reluctant to get into the law-keeping business, with Virgil (excellently portrayed by Sam Elliott) and Morgan proceeding him.  Also, in "Tombstone" it is Virgil who leads the heroes march to the OK Corral.<br /><br />4.  The relationship between Mattie and Wyatt is not as detailed here as in "Wyatt Earp."  Likewise, Wyatt is more of the instigator of the adulterous affair with Josephine Marcus in "Wyatt Earp", while Dana Delaney's interpretation has Marcus being more of a seductress.  As a result of these two items, "Tombstone" makes Wyatt a little more forgivable than in "Wyatt Earp," because it makes him more of a victim, and Mattie less sympathetic.  Also, the ending of "Tombstone" mentions Mattie's death, which "Wyatt Earp" does not.<br /><br />5.  On the subject of women, Holiday's girlfriend Kate (here, played by Joanna Pacula) is better looking than her "Wyatt Earp" counterpart.<br /><br />If you want history and don't mind being a little bored, get "Wyatt Earp".  But if you want an enjoyable and entertaining adventure, get this one!!!  And when you plan on watching this movie, why not get ready by stopping at the grocery store, and get some pizza first.  What kind of pizza?  Tombstone, of course.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Tombstone tells the story of Wyatt Earp who has retired from his life as a lawman and who goes to the wild town of Tombstone to make his fortune.  He is accompanied by his wife and his brothers and rejoins his old friend Doc Holliday.  Val Kilmer puts in the best performance of the movie in his portrayal of the self-destructive, high-living Holliday.  Kurt Russell is also good as Wyatt Earp.  There is lots of beautiful scenery and the gorgeous shots of sunrises and sunsets is juxtaposed with the raw violence of the gun battles.  This is a great movie for Western fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>This isn't what the ol' west was all about. This is what Hollywood films are all about: big casts, large conflict, and compelling characters. It's all set to the backdrop of Tombstone, a large town in the ol' west where Wyat Earp and his two brothers decide to retire to and make a small fortune in silver. Doc Holliday also lives there, winning card games like Mark Maguire makes home runs. But the outlaw gang the Cowboys are menacing the town and stirring up trouble. Reluctantly, the Earps and Holliday come out of retirement to fight back and defend their town. This is an extremely remarkable film with great acting, a thick plot, and some suspense-filled shoot-outs. It's a must-see for any movie buff. One of the best westerns also made.</p></br></body></html>

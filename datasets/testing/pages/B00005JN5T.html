The best thing about this particular film is the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, they are a hoot as a weird and unapologetic couple. Ben Stiller is still annoying and Robert De Niro seems rather bored in this sequel, he probably was forced do it. Good comedy just not that memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I will admit that `Meet the Fockers' is funny; in fact it's really funny.  If I were judging this film of pure comedic effect alone I'd have to say that this truly nails it.  You see, it's not a question of landing jokes and gags here for each and every one lands fine, it's just that sadly this film is nothing new.  `Meet the Fockers' is more like `Meet the Parents' rehash with a few new faces.  Taking as its own film it's genuine and hilarious yet when taken alongside its superior predecessor it can prove disappointing.  If only the script had been as ingeniously constructed as `Meet the Parents'.<br /><br />This film picks up right where `Meet the Parents' left off.  This time it's more a game of meet the in-laws as the Byrnes family travels to meet Greg's parents.  Greg's parents are obviously complete opposites of Pam's.  Bernie and Rozalin are loud and obnoxious and, for lack of a better word, `loony'.  They love their son regardless of his flaws and failures, in fact they celebrate everything he's ever done, which is not something that sits well with Jack.  Add to this the fact that Pam and Greg have a big secret that threatens to dismantle her father and you have all the makings of a very tense visit.<br /><br />My issues with `Meet the Fockers' lie solely in the script.  The decision to revisit Jack's untrusting paranoia was frustrating to me.  By the end of `Meet the Parents' we feel that maybe finally Greg has broken into Jack's ridiculousness and that they are going to move forward in their relationship.  Having Jack resort back to his scheming and manipulating and deceiving all over again seemed kind of forced and repetitive.  The clash between the Byrnes and the Fockers was funny and Hoffman and De Niro play off one another well, but Jack's character is not as enjoyable the second time around.  There is no real character development.  It's like the writers said `hey, this worked last time so lets do it all over again'.<br /><br />The cast all works well, everyone returning as well as the new faces.  This film belongs to Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman.  I can't think of two actors better suited for the roles.  They are hysterical and add layers of genuine sincerity to the roles, much like what De Niro did for Jack Byrnes in `Meet the Parents'.  Teri Polo has more to do this go around, but she still a backseat to the more memorable performers, Blythe Danner being one of them.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film and I think if you watch it as just another comedy then you will too.  The jokes land one right after the other beautifully.  Like I said, it's that pesky problem of remaining stagnant that hits this one.  There is no progression of comedic entertainment here.  `Meet the Fockers' is `Meet the Parents Part II' and that said it's bound to be funny.  Sometimes that's good enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Meet the Parents is one of those Ben Stiller vehicles that's so slapstick in its hilarity that it can actually make you feel uncomfortable.  It's funny, but it's almost disturbingly funny, such that if you make the mistake of imagining yourself in Greg "Gaylord" Focker's (Ben Stiller) shoes, you want to hide under your seat.<br /><br />Meet the Fockers takes the conceit of the original movie one step further.  Greg's already met his fianc&eacute;e's (Pam Byrnes, played by Teri Polo) family, including Pam's pleasant mother Dina (Blythe Danner), her nephew Jack (Spencer and Bradley Pickren), and her domineering father Jack (Robert De Niro).  It's now time for that momentous meeting that all engaged couples dread: the family meeting. It's time, finally, to meet the parents who named their son Gaylord Focker.<br /><br />Thus begins a road trip down to Florida to meet Greg's parents, played hippie pitch-perfect by Barbara Streisand as Rozalin (a special kind of therapist for older couples who want to be more intimate) and Dustin Hoffman as Bernie, the over-supportive, super-pal of a dad.  Mix the Byrnes with the Fockers and stir.<br /><br />The additional twist is Little Jack, representing a flashpoint of parenting debate.  Jack's childrearing is strict and disciplinarian one hand (the Byrnes hand, if you couldn't guess) and the free-love, do-it-if-it-feels-good empowerment of the Fockers.<br /><br />Streisand and Hoffman are the real treat here. Their parental struggles and angst, or lack thereof, are what make the film. If you're a fan of either, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />If you are recently married or have a kid, the movie's struggle over childrearing is a very funny debate indeed. If you don't, then Meet the Fockers is probably only mildly amusing.  Since my son was born the same month I saw his movie, it had particular comedic resonance, and my parents (who are definitely Focker-types) and my wife laughed all the way through.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>Without a doubt, a great sequel to one of the best comedy films ever!<br /><br />As if the chemistry between Robert DeNiro, the father in law of Greg Focker, played by Ben Stiller, a male nurse that married the woman of his dreams, played by Teri Polo was not enough to make a classic comedy... Bernie and Roz Focker join this winning team!<br /><br />Meet the Fockers is a superb sequel to Meet the Parents. Now, it is the turn for the bride's parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes, played by De Niro and Blythe Danner, to meet the groom's parents.<br /><br />With Gaylord and Pam, they travel in their new RV to Florida. They also bring with them their infant grandson from their other daughter, and the kid delivers some of the best lines of this film... Still to today... when we want to laugh, we find ourselves saying.... Ash-whole!!!<br /><br />Gaylord's parents, Bernie and Roz Focker, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are simply magnificent. As with great comedy, they play opposites to DeNiro, and rather than strict and controlling, they are care-free, touchy-feely... fun-loving parents.<br /><br />You should not miss this movie if you want to laugh and enjoy... one of the great sequels to one of the best comedy films ever!</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Dragooned into watching this one, what a mistake!  Although, I do agree with others that the casting of Hoffman and Streisand is out of this world.  They couldn't have been better, though whoever did Streisand's makeup should be taken out to the Everglades and shot like a croc.  But the same catasrtophe happens to youngish Teri Polo in this film.  In the first one, she looked pretty, in this one, she looks harsh and garish, older than Blythe Danner.  It's like they hate her.<br /><br />It must have been madness on the set as for decades people have been saying that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were the most demanding and difficult stars in Hollywood.  Has time mellowed them, or have they finally woken up and smelled the coffee, that their careers have pretty much ended as stars, sure Barbra can still sing, but for the rest, are either of them ever going to get as simpatico a hand-made part as the script of MEET THE FOCKERS gives them?  As Bernie and Roz Focker, they shine.  Everyone's good, but the movie itself just sits there, nothing happens and nobody really cares.  Ben Stiller gets himself in one embarrassing situation after another, but the actor has played this role so many times before we don't even feel for him any longer.<br /><br />I liked that the Fockers cherished their son so much, never made him feel inadequate, smothered him with kisses, framed his jock and his 9th place bowling ribbons and trophies.  In their eyes he's the best male nurse in the world.<br /><br />De Niro's CIA thing continues to be creepy.  For the next Focker picture I'd like Hay Roach to step down and somebody like Ken Loach or George Clooney take over the directors chair and show De Niro's character invading and decimating Ghana or Ecuador or somewhere.  Find the laughs there, Focker.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HWD9PTM7RBXN.html">A2HWD9PTM7RBXN</a><br/><p>Same format same results.  Yes, its amusing but the story line is so identical to Meet The parents.  Robert Denero's character is so mistrusting of his future son in law.  Hoffman and Striesand are a couple of goofballs.  A little funny but alot silly and full of nonsense.  Ben Stiller seems like the most sensible one in this film.<br /><br />Don't buy all the hype.  This movie is OK but certainly not over the top.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Gaylord and Pam (Ben Stiller and Teri Polo) haven't tied the knot yet.  In this film, they take Pam's uptight parents (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner) to Florida to meet Gaylord's new-age, counterculture, free-thinking parents (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) with predictable consequences.  This film coasts almost entirely on the goodwill generated by its talented cast, but the screenplay doesn't really give them a lot to work with.  Still, it's a pleasure to see DeNiro and Hoffman working together, and the film does manage to generate some good laughs as well as featuring one of the most astounding performances by toddlers (Spencer & Bradley Pickren) that I have ever seen. Was that kid a CGI effect?</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I could take or leave this movie. To me it was not as good as Meet the Parents. While Barbra Stresiand and Dustin Hoffman played unique characters, the movie used them too heavily at the sacrifice of the story. Near the end I was growing weary of sexual humor and wanted the movie to end. It's not that I don't enjoy a good joke, but The Fockers tries too hard to be one big joke. The story is weak and virtually non-existant. I didn't find myself laughing much.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>For all the hype and publicity this movie got, it really sucked. Stars galore in this, but you know what this proves, without quality writing the movie will still blow. I don't understand how Hollywood can put together so much money to make a movie, but not be able to connect to the audience. I'm sick of watching crap.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>I LOVED Meet the Parents and with the addition of Hoffman and Streisand was excited to see this.  I wasn't bowled over, but I wasn't dissapointed either.<br /><br />Fockers has some great comic moments and it is a hoot watching the old pros play against type in this one.  Hoffman and Streisand are a welcome addition to the family, but DeNiro again steals the film.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch.  Or two.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>So the world watched this film and loved it(the box office records convey that) I somehow never watched this in the theater and a lot of friends and family said it's really funny.Mind you,I thought Meet the parents was a good film.<br /><br />I respect Robert Di Nero for some brilliant films like "Casino" and not to forget the mafia perfect film "Goodfellas" He's getting old and I'm sorry it feels sad to see him play a character as ineffective and out of place as what he plays in MTF. His character in Meet The Parents was better lined but in "Meet The Fockers" he seems to try hard to be taken seriously.He still remains one of my favourite actor. I just hope no more future "meet the ____" movies come up.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman is about as irritating as they come.It's quite apparent how unintelligently inclined his pretentious over the moon happy character is.There is absolutely no story and the humor seems rather bland and highly exaggerated. I have  a bit of a humor going around but this is the classic case of befooling the audience.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS DVD<br /><br />I can't recall one scene in the film I remotely enjoyed. I'm sorry,hollywood. You can definitely do better. Watch "Harold and Kumar go to white castle" for something better enacted and glorified.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>I went and seen this movie yesterday.  Despite what some of the reviews say, this movie was as good and as funny as Meet the Parents.  The cast and characters where AWESOME.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, what are you waiting on?  I can't wait for the dvd release I'm going to buy it on the first day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I never thought that "Meet the Fockers" would be as good of a movie as "Meet the Parents," but I still expected it to be better than it was.  The premise of the movie is good: Greg (a.k.a. Gaylord, played by Ben Stiller) takes a trip to Florida with his fiancee Pam (Teri Polo) and her parents (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) to "meet the Fockers." Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are hilarious as Greg's offbeat parents, but they aren't enough to save this movie.  There are a few good laughs in the film, but most of them were shown in the movie trailers.  "Meet the Fockers" also relies on more crude humor than the first film, which was disappointing and unnecessary.  I also felt that part of the problem with this movie is that the script wasn't very solid.  The plot was jumbled and kind of bounced around from scene to scene without direction.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of "Meet the Parents," you'll definitely get a small amount of enjoyment out of this film, but I don't suggest shelling out money to see it in the theatres: wait until it comes to cable in a few months.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>Let me just say, I LOVE "Meet the Parents." It's one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />Let me now say, this movie is NOTHING like meet the parents. The whole movie is based on two things:<br /><br />1. Cheesy Sex Humor<br />2. Gross out gags<br /><br />Nothing else from this film is memorable (except for the always amazing Robert De Niro reprising one of his best roles.) Gotta love Jack!<br /><br />Skip this movie, see the first one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>I know I'm probably going to get a barrage of not helpful votes like for my reviews of "Monty Python & The Holy Grail" and "Titanic", but I actually found "Meet The Fockers" funnier than the first moive, 2000's "Meet The Parents". I got a lot more of the humor and the additoion of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand to the cast made the film for me.<br /><br />The film picks up some time after the events of the first one. Gaylord "Greg" Focker (Ben Stiller) has finally earned the respect of future father in law Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro), who he is now allowing to marry his daughter Pamela (Teri Polo). However, there is one hurdle they have to clear: meeting Gaylord's parents. Jack is intent on meeting his daughter's future in-laws. So, the Byrnes (including Blythe Danner, returning as Dina Byrnes, and Jinx the Cat) journey down to Florida to meet Bernie Fokcer (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand), Greg's carefree parents. As soon as they meet each other, it's clear that the Byrnes and the Fockers are polar oppsites. The Byrnes (okay, Jack) are conservative and somewhat stuffy. They tell onlyof their achievements and think that a simple handshake is the proper way to show friendship. The Fockers on the other hand are the opposite: they hug people, tell embarassing stories, and dedicate an entire wall to Greg's underachievements. This creates some tension between ex - CIA agent Jack and Greg.<br /><br />This results in several slight but very funny gags. Among them, a football goes horribly wrong, baby Jack drinks booze and sees "Scarface", Greg "speaks the truth" aout what he thinks of everyone, andon top of it all, Gaylord may already have a little Focker of his own.<br /><br />It's basically a rehash of the first movie, but the same schtick is even funnier the second time around. This is a film that I think I could recommend to just about anyone with a bird's taste in movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>....I could use an entire film with father and mother Focker--Hoffman and Barb--because they definitely seem to enjoy their work here and it shows. La Barb is a bit zaftig here but that's okay, she still comes off as The Owl and the Pussycat kinda sexy.<br /><br />Hoffman's throwaway lines ('Can you believe I concieved him with one testicle?) are terrific. And the dog which 'humps everything that moves' who is flushed down the RV's terlit...funny, funny. Alas though. Stiller and Polo didn't seem to want to join the party as they kinda telegraphed in their acting. Oh, well...see it for the synergy of Striesand, DeNiro and Hoffman. You'll enjoy them.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>"Meet the Fockers" picks up where "Meet the Parents" left off. The shaky truce between ex-CIA mastermind Jack (DeNiro) and would-be son-in-law, male nurse, Greg (Stiller) will be tested. Further, the emotionally distant Burns are about to meet touchy-feely aging boomers Bernie and Roz (Hoffman and Streisand). In the middle of it all, peacemaker and arbiter Dina, Mrs. Burns, finally has enough and puts her foot down.<br /><br />There are many chuckles in this movie; DeNiro, Streisand, and Hoffman play their roles with gleeful relish. The bonus features confirm what the audience suspects - the stars really had fun shooting this movie. The playfulness among them just shines.<br /><br />Inside the circle of talent, the four parents play like kids in a sandbox as Stiller watches from outside. All-in-all, this movie is fun and enjoyable. There is little to take seriously and mercifully, they don't.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />"Meet the Parents" was one of the best and most commercially successful mainstream comedies of recent years, a hilarious tale of a young man trying his damnedest to impress his prospective father-in-law - an ex-CIA agent with some mighty strange ideas about interpersonal relationships - and being thwarted at every turn.<br /><br />Now comes the sequel, "Meet the Fockers," in which the young, affianced couple, Greg and Pam, take her parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes, to meet his parents, Bernie and Roz Focker, a pair of freethinking flower children left over from the `60's (she's a psychologist who specializes in sex therapy for geriatrics) who have little in common with the uptight, conservative Jack, a man with a few eccentricities of his own to account for.<br /><br />One of the reasons why "Meet the Parents" worked so well as a comedy was that, no matter how absurdly preposterous and slapstick-y the scenes became, the humor always remained rooted in a universal, believable premise.  We always felt for Greg because we could identify with his predicament.  By bringing in this second set of parents, "Meet the Fockers" begins to feel less like a human comedy and more like a strained sitcom, one in which the characters and situations become subordinated to the laughs and all sense of reality flies out the window. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since many of the jokes here are, indeed, very funny, but one still misses the heart that made the original film such a first-rate comic charmer.<br /><br />That being said, "Meet the Fockers" is still a lot of fun to watch, primarily thanks to the high-caliber cast that has been assembled for the occasion.  Joining the original players - Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner - are Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, two old pros who seem to be having the time of their professional lives plowing full-throttle through this material.  The material itself is a bit on the crude side, with lines that are not quite sophisticated or subtle enough to qualify as double entendres.  Add to that a few too many jokes about mammary gland function and scenes involving dog humping and you will quickly realize that the writers are aiming for a fairly low common denominator audience here (the title is the first dead give away, I suppose).  Nevertheless, some of these bits do actually result in some genuine laugh-out-loud moments, thanks primarily to the caliber of the performances.<br /><br />No one will be confusing this with Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw, that`s for sure, but "Meet the Fockers" offers a fun time for those who prefer their comedy aimed a wee bit lower.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>A good laugh, if you will admit it to yourself.  Vulgar, obnoxious, slapstick . . . and funny.<br /><br />Don't even try to analyze it.  It is just a couple of hours of chuckles, and suspension of disbelief that actors usually playing deep, thoughtful parts would act in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>The original was quite simply a very funny and likable movie with polar opposites Robert de Niro and Ben Stiller sparring with Ben trying desperately to please Robert and it certainly was funny. It was of course a hit too so a sequel was in the works but not immediately simply because "we wanna make sure the scripts good". They should've waited about a year.<br /><br />Pam and Greg(real name's Gaylord) are getting married soon and Greg has just barely impressed Pam's parents. But now it's time for everyone to meet Greg's. So off they go in their RV with Pam's newphew Little Jack to Florida. And of course Greg's parents couldn't be anymore different than Pam's. His father is very uninhibited and loves to talk and laugh and joke around while his mother's a sex therapist. They also have a cute little dog named Moses which, as dogs like to do, hump things. Which isn't a good thing for Jack's expertly trained cat.<br /><br />There's a noticeable sameness with the film. It almost feels like things were placed together simply because they knew it would work and don't take chances. We still have the jokes about Greg's last name(Focker) such as his cousins Randy and Orny, since one family has a cat, why not add a dog? There's even a moment where through really no fault of Greg's, he's blamed for a big catastrophe, like the original.<br /><br />The casting however is spot-on. Normally playing a kind of know-it-all, Dustin Hoffman is quite perfect as Greg's eccentric dad. And while I normally can't stand Babs, Barbara Streisand was likable, but she still sucks otherwise, just not here.<br /><br />I find it's best to watch it with people since if they laugh you end up laughing too but watching alone it's almost like jokes flatten.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>Gaylord Focker's parents are everything that Pam Burns parents are not.  I really identified more with Pam's parents, the Fockers were a bit too loopy for me, but still they were great fun as portrayed by Hoffman and Streisand.  I absolutely loved Robert DeNiro's portrayal as Pam's over the top Dad.  Great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>I was skeptical about this picture until I saw it.<br /><br />Seeing Dustin Hoffman and Barabara Strisand on screen was the funniest couple I have seen since Richard Dryfuss and Marcia Mason in The Goodbye Girl. The chemistry that they have is amazing. They were onbviously having fun and it came off natural. Barbara Striesand as a SEX therapists! Who would of thought?<br /><br />The two seemed a natural couple and obviously were having a great deal of fun together. The movie is magic when they get on screen.<br /><br />If you were fans of the original movie you love this even more. In contrast to Robert Dinero and Blyth Danner's characters this film is a funny roller coaster fromt he moment Dustin and Barbara hit the screen. The contracst of the two familties is hysterically real.<br /><br />Bed Stiller is really the audiences persepctive in this movie. The story is simple - in-laws meet in-laws. The fun begins when Dustin enters the room with Barbara right behind him!<br /><br />I would reccomend this film to those who need a light fluffy fun picture. I applaud Dustin for doing this film and I applaud Barbara for letting her hair down, out and all over!<br /><br />I didn't care for the first one too much..but Iloved this one!<br /><br />You go Dustin and Barbara!  1-05</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>If you caught and enjoyed "Meet the Parents" a few years back, you might have, in a second, brainstormed the idea that became inevitable sequel.  Take the same idea, toss in an annoying set of parents for Ben Stiller who are liberal and extroverted counterpoints to Deniro's uptight and competitive waspy-ness, toss in the same jokes and let the script work its magic.  You know the result wouldn't have knocked your socks off, but then you're not a Hollywood writer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, "Meet the Fockers" goes no further than the hash of ideas you might have had after unreeling "Meet the Parents".  The Fockers are liberal and liberating jewish counterpoints to the Byrneses, and the turbulent meeting between the two of them would entrap Ben Stiller's character in a series of embarrassing snags (the most egregious involving sodium pentathol, the teenage son of the Focker's hottie cook, Mr. Byrnes's prodigal grandson, and a simulated latex breast designed by Deniro's character).  The script tries to brainstorm the twists of the first movie (remember how none of Focker's stories panned out after a records check because his name had been changed?) but comes up short.  Most of the subplots seemed forced (like Stiller's father getting all three of them arrested) and by the end, you're more relieved than amused.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Meet The Fockers is funny in fits and spurts but it is a fairly typical, unimaginative film. While the actors are all good, and the initial set-up is awkwardly clever, after the first hour the film seems to fall apart. Ridiculous subplots are tacked on, and<br />jokes become forced and tired, especially when half of the gags are recycled from the first film. I think this movie probably suffers from the curse that afflicts much of the mainstream comedy that currently comes out of Hollywood, which is a good idea that starts out fresh, but rapidly becomes stale.<br /><br />Yes, there are some perfectly fine moments, and if you like humor that relies on embarrassment, irreverent slapstick, and crudity, then this film is for you, but the film as a whole just gets so outlandish and preposterous that it's just too hard to totally appreciate. Don't get me wrong - there's nothing wrong with crude humour, as long as it's subtle and clever. Meet The Fockers, however, is hardly subtle and toward the end of the film it isn't even clever.<br /><br />Meet the Fockers finds male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) engaged to his schoolteacher girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) as they are headed off to visit both sets of parents so they can make their much-anticipated wedding arrangements.  Things begin go wrong after Pam's father, former CIA agent Jack Byrnes (a very dry Robert De Niro) insists on traveling in his high-security RV rather than flying. They're on their way to Florida to stay with Greg's free-spirited, new age parents Roz and Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand).<br /><br />Much of the comedy comes from the clash of lifestyles when the hip, lefty Fockers come to blows with the old world, traditionalist Jack. There are mishaps galore that involve the Byrnes family cat, the Focker family dog, Jack's supposed prodigy grandson (played by twins Spencer and Bradley Pickren), and indoor plumbing. And there there's also a subplot involving Pam's pregnancy and illegitimate son that may or may not be Greg's.<br /><br />The talented cast provides all the laughs. Barbra is of course a pleasure to watch, with her cascade of middle-aged curls, she plays the sexy, earthy, and overly enthusiastic sex therapist, Roz Focker to the hilt. Hoffman as Bernie Focker is also a lot of fun - both Bernie and Roz are stereotypes, complete with their open-mindedness, they live in a hippie like hamlet in Florida, that might have once been a commune in a type of Woodstock home.<br /><br />Robert De Niro as Jack accompanied once more by his ethereal wife, Dina (a gorgeous Blythe Danner) probably steals the show - we really feel for him as his back seizes up with tension and he constantly wads his face up into a knot of disgust over the Fockers antics. And Blythe as Dina is a pleasure to watch as she gradually warms to the Fockers hospitality, and quietly tells Jack to behave, while she's secretly having fun watching him squirm with embarrassment. Aimed at an audience that is probably not terribly sophisticated, Meet The Fockers provides some good laughs, but don't expect too much from the overwrought, ridiculous plot, where most of the comedic clich&eacute;s can be seen coming.

I hated the first one, and had some serious doubts about any sequel being able to redeem.<br /><br />However, with some excellent casting choices and just a better story I'd say this one did it.  If you thought that Stiller's and DeNiro's characters were clashes then wait till you see Hoffman, ex-hippie, and DeNiro, CIA of course, clash.<br /><br />That's where most of the humor lies, although even the stuff that goes wrong this time is more interesting then the last film.  Somehow, they even managed to throw in a few twists.<br /><br />Like I said, I don't know how they came up with an idea that would save the Meet the Parent's idea, but once again all I have to say is good casting creates good chemistry.  And they found the formula.<br /><br />(Sidenote: still inappropriate for younger kids.)</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>I am not a big fan of "Meet the Parents."  I wasn't looking foward to a sequel until I heard the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand.  I knew that these two additions would be a happy addition to the mix and compliment the rest of the cast.<br /><br />The sequel itself is funnier and fresher for some reason.  Its not just a one joke movie, it's more developed.  Hoffman and Streisand are fabulous.  Babs has never been funnier, and I wouldn't be suprised if she gets an oscar nomination.  Hoffman is equally great.  The real scene stealer is a baby.  He steals EVERY scene he's in.  Also the pets steal one scene.  Lotsa laughs abound in this movie.  It is one of the best comedies of the year, and I was pleasantly suprised of how good it was.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>This movie continues the story strated in "Meet the parents".

Deniro did a great job in this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is the sequel to the very successful film, "Meet the Parents". Although  the director tries to reprise the success that he enjoyed with the prequel, he falls short of the mark. In the final analysis, this film is simply not as funny. It is too contrived and forced, and some of the humor falls flat.<br /><br />The basic premise of this film is that Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) is going to marry his fiancee, Pamela Bynes (Teri Lord). Consequently, her parents, Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner), are going to meet his parents, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand), for the first time. This is a proposition that has Gaylord in a state of total anxiety.<br /><br />Gaylord, who prefers to be called "Greg", and  Pamela join her parents in order to travel down to Florida, where the Focker family lives. Joining them is the Byrnes' cute baby grandson, Little Jack (Spencer and Bradley Pickren). They all travel to Florida in Jack's custom made, kevlar coated, state-of-the-art RV. When they get there, the clash of the titans begins, as the conservative Byrnes are polar opposites of the ultra-liberal Fockers, and never the twain shall meet.<br /><br />Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner are, once again,  excellent in their respective roles, as are Teri Lord and Ben Stiller. Unfortunately, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand fall flatter than a pancake, being neither funny or likable. This is not necessarily their fault. The fault lies in the screenplay, as their characters are too contrived. Rather than funny, they end up being simply annoying.  Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand manage to hit simultaneous career lows with their respective roles. How the mighty have fallen.<br /><br />Still, the film is not a total loss, as it does provide some laughs. One should, however, rent this film, rather than buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>MEET THE FOCKERS was worth my time and money because we got Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand together all at once, all of them obviously having a grand old time chewing up the scenery in this so-so sequel to MEET THE PARENTS.  Sure, the movie is merely a copy cat version of the original, but throwing in Babs and Hoffman as Ben Stiller's parents is the coup de gras of this enjoyable film.  Blythe Danner may be the second banana to all the shenanigans of her co-stars, but she admirably holds her own, in the role of the wife of a real paranoid lunatic.  This time DeNiro DOES come across more vindictive and irrational than in the first, and there are times when you wonder why Stiller and Teri Polo just don't tell him to stuff it and live their lives without his constant judgment and interference.  But then we wouldn't have a movie would we?  Jinx the Cat and Moses the Dog steal a few scenes, but they aren't in the movie as much as you might have thought.  The little baby is cute, but he gets in the way after a while.  Suffice to say, it's the delightful Streisand in her first movie in almost ten years and her first supporting role and Hoffman in his delightfully zany Bernie that make this movie so special.  Whether it's the whipped cream scene or Hoffman taking on DeNiro in a friendly game of football, these two stars shine like the celestial icons they richly deserve to be.  They alone with DeNiro make this a movie well worth watching and not worrying how bad it would have been without them!</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>This movie was created for the soul purpose to entertain and it does it with flying colors.

Yes, as many have already mentioned, the plot truly follows the first film.  Jack (De Niro) is still weary of Greg (Stiller) and is trying to convince his daughter Pam (Polo) to steer clear of marrying him.  But this time around Greg has moral support in the form of his parents.<br /><br />As the complete opposites to Jack, both Roz and Bernie are loving parents who smother Greg with commendation and praise while Jack is quick to tear him down.  Dustin Hoffman steals the show from Robert De Niro this time, but De Niro still delivers none-the-less.  Streisand is fantastic as Roz and Blythe is still hilarious in her naivety.  Sadly, even with a sequel, Teri Polo fails to rise above the background.  Her character may not be as developed as the others but she still could have elevated her performance.  I read the other day that Naomi Watts lost this role to Teri Polo, and all I kept thinking was that after seeing what Naomi was able to do with her character in `I Heart Huckabees' that she would have been a much better choice for this film.<br /><br />Oh well, no use in complaining now.  So, it's not as original, but with De Niro still on board and Hoffman and Streisand recruited `Meet the Fockers' is still an enjoyable and hilarious ride...plus you get to see Robert De Niro breast feed a baby and that alone is priceless!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I was worried about the sequel to "Meet the Parents" thinking it might turn out to be rather boring and far less funny than the first part, like it often happens. But I was worrying in vain. "Meet the Fockers" lived up to its predecessor. Certainly the first part was more sophisticated and laughable, but we all know it's always difficult to keep the same level whatsoever. There's a lot of blunt humor here (like a scene with Greg's foreskin), but there's also many situational jokes that make this film just hilarious. And actually it's not the wisecracks themselves that matter, but the way they are delivered by Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Ben Stiller. I was laughing like mad throughout the whole movie, even when there seemed to be nothing to laugh at. But the way De Niro talks and makes faces can't leave you indifferent.<br /><br />Screenwriters did a very good job, they wrote Greg's parents, who are played by Hoffman and Streisand, so vivid and thruthful, all I want to say is "bravo!". From the first moment we see them, it's obvious they are just so not like Pam's parents, and it's getting crystal clear there's gonna be trouble.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman is the greatest acquisition of the film. I know he had plenty of serious, world-known movies, but this part is truly one of his best.<br /><br />The edition has interesting extras, and the principal one is a blooper-reel, which sometimes is even more funny than the movie itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Believe the critics because this one is just a rehash of the first and I don't remember laughing even once during the entire film. Unfortunately, this sequel continues in the same vein as the original. Making fun of Greg's profession as a male nurse and using his last name in virtually every way possible to replace the sexual expletive, this film appears doomed from the start.<br /><br />Along with heavy innuendo based on the family moniker, much of the script's humor relies on overt sexual themes for the punch lines. Working as a seniors' sex therapist, Roz promotes erotic exercise moves and candidly discusses options for an amorously repressed couple. A paternity case, a busload of buxom cheerleaders who start to remove their tops and an incident of mooning are also played for laughs. As well, a toddler learns to swear repeatedly and gets his hands on some hard liquor when a flustered caregiver is distracted by an incoming call. The results are supposed to be funny, but the farce often comes up short in good taste.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Working in the business world, you are constantly told that by hitting your goal, you are just working to your average potential.  If you exceed that goal, then you are surpassing your potential.  Nearly everyday this is mentioned to me in some form or another, yet I wonder why it wouldn't apply to the business of Hollywood?  The bar for Meet the Fockers was set, but for some strange reason, the actors only worked to their goal, and never exceeded it.  Riding high off the hysterical Meet the Parents, I thought that this film would bring a new chapter into this "original" story, but instead director Jay Roach decided to stick with Hollywood standards and recycle the same jokes using different players.  I don't know why I am so surprised, I witnessed this before when Roach directed the sequels to Austin Powers.  The original film was inventive, original, and hysterical, while the other two films just seemed to recycle the same formula from that original film.  The same could be seen in Meet the Fockers.  From a similar plot structure, to undefined, clich&eacute;d characters, to a complete lack of humor, Meet the Fockers hit their goal, but chose not to exceed it in any way.<br /><br />For a comedy film, I felt this just didn't quite have the punch from the original film.  While there were a couple of lines that I found myself chuckling at, there weren't any of those "laugh-out-loud" moments that I experienced with Meet the Parents.  The actors who were in the original seemed bland and really just going through the motions, while the new elements (Streisand and Hoffman) seemed over the top, nearly tipping the structure all together.  There was no balance.  It was almost as if director Jay Roach was asking us to forget about DeNiro and Danner, and focus more on Streisand and Hoffman.  We needed a stronger, more comedic balance in this family.  While I do think that there was chemistry between these four players, it was never fully matched or developed.  Their jokes also make for bad comedy.  Have we not learned yet that bathroom humor is a thing of the past?  There seemed to be more of these than the intelligent humor reached in Meet the Parents.  Secondly, how many times can we hear the word "Focker" and laugh at it.  I believe that it was overused in the first film, and deeply buried in this film.  If these were the two anchoring jokes for the film, we are definitely on the wrong road of comedy.  Roach had a very funny film on his hands here, but strangely, he focused on repeating similar jokes from the original, ultimately lowering this film from hysterical, to humorous.<br /><br />I mentioned above about how the actors were not reaching to their potential, and I do believe it to be true.  DeNiro seemed bland throughout this entire film.  There was no surprise or inviting element to him.  Ben Stiller, literally, needs to take a break for a bit.  His humor seems to be slowly fading with each film that he creates.  He seems to jump head-first into the big budget films, when I really think that he could make a bigger impact on the smaller, independent pictures.  Hoffman's character seemed forced.  I could tell that he was having fun, in fact the whole cast was having fun, but no work was getting done.  Hoffman had this one-dimensional character that only seemed alive because of Streisand's wacky shenanigans.  Finally, there was the muted Teri Polo, whose character was so exciting that I nearly thought that she was dropped midway through this film.  Again, I cannot state this enough, there was so much potential wasted in this film that I nearly imagined new ways to make this film as the film was still playing.  Hoffman and DeNiro together should have created a match in comedy heaven, but instead "ha-ha" purgatory seemed more apt.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that nothing in this film surprised me.  I kept waiting to get to the point in the movie where I would finally say, "This is why this film was created...", but it never arrived.  Roach hit the potential bar, but chose not to go above it.  He knew he had enough money invested in it if he continued to use repetitive jokes and situations that creativity and originality was completely thrown out the window.  It was sad to witness such greats fall, but I just wish there was more to this film ... not in length, but in girth.  Meet the Fockers is a perfect example of Hollywood creating just to meet budgets and create revenue.  It was a formidable idea, but the finished product probably never reflected this idea.  I was massively disappointed.<br /><br />Overall, there were some chuckles from me as I watched this film, but never any laughter.  From the reviews and friends who spoke so highly of this film, I was expecting to be blown away by the possibility of a comedic sequel that worked, but perhaps I was setting the bar too high.  Stiller does seem tired, as did the rest of the cast except for the newbies that never quite balanced out this picture.  Everyone seemed so clich&eacute;d that you could literally pick out their characters from other comedy films from across the ages.  A majority of the blame I bring on Roach's shoulders, as he needed to break his normal, tired, Hollywood recycled mold of filmmaking.  I wasn't overly impressed with this film and would probably suggest skipping it.  It carries none of the power, originality, or creative genius that Meet the Parents did.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>Its almost worth getting Focked seeing Streisand,Hoffman,and De Niro in the same movie,and THERE ALL GREAT,but this movie is not a film you want to see again.There are a couple of laughs,but this DVD is not worth buying,just rent it,or borrow it from a friend,or you will get FOCKED,Like I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It shouldn't be too big a surprise that this movie is a fairly mediocre Hollywood confection, but I did have a whimper of a hope that this was going to be an edgier social commentary given the comedy potential of the situation. Alas, it would be too much to expect director Jay Roach to be in the same league as David O. Russell or Alexander Payne given that his track record is mostly made up of Austin Powers movies. I never saw the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXO1">Meet the Parents</a>, so luckily I don't have that point of comparison, but one can easily fill in the blanks with this soft-centered sequel. Written by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, the plot seems ready-made from an instant pudding mix. Having given permission to Gaylord Focker to marry their daughter Pam, the white-bread Byrnes family from Oyster Bay now prepares to meet their new in-laws in Florida (of course).<br /><br />Simple enough, but the big surprise is that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand (third and fourth-billed, no less) seem to be having such a great time playing Bernie and Roz Focker that you can almost overlook the script deficiencies. Each had auspicious film debuts over 35 years ago (he in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F798">The Graduate</a>, she in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005O3VD">Funny Girl</a>), and they have known each other since their struggling New York days in the early sixties. That history is helpful in explaining their natural chemistry here, and you're left wondering why these two never worked together before. Streisand, in particular, seems relaxed as a free-wheeling, caftan-wearing, opinionated sex therapist, which seems like a send-up of her self-important psychiatrist in her own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OLYF">The Prince of Tides</a>. For once, she's not bathed in candlelight in some Harlequin romance with a blonde gentile unable to commit. Rather, she lends credibility to a grounded character in an often hilariously passionate marriage to a physical and intellectual equal, and at certain moments in this film, I don't think I've liked Streisand more onscreen.<br /><br />If Hoffman seems less surprising, it's only because he has already proven to be a masterful comic actor with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZM1MG4">Tootsie</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780622561">Wag the Dog</a>. Even when the running gags (a passion for capoeira, overzealous displays of affection) get tired, he still imbues his caricature with a zestful spirit. The remaining elements of the film seem tired in comparison, and unfortunately I have to include the original stars. Perhaps it's because they are recycling behavior that would be hard to refresh a second time. Robert DeNiro's tiresome portrayal of Jack Byrnes, the intimidating ex-CIA spook, is particularly disappointing and not so much because the actor is slumming (which he is) but because his character works on only one motivation, to humiliate and eventually eject his future son-in-law from the "circle of trust". There are hints that the summit meeting of Hoffman, DeNiro and Streisand would turn into something more substantial, but the sitcom dimensions of the script quickly extinguish the possibilities. Ben Stiller, who is the actual protagonist of this comedy, seems to be sitting back as his character, Gaylord, recedes into the background. He has exactly one funny scene on his own, when he spouts his honest feelings after being injected with a "truth serum".<br /><br />The whole subplot with Gaylord being accused of fathering his former family housekeeper's son seems tired and superfluous. I like Blythe Danner as Jack's wife, Dina, looking to resuscitate some spark in their marriage, and Teri Polo, who actually seems sharp and worthwhile as the fianc&eacute;e at the center of the story. But neither is given much to do except a funny scene where Roz uses hand puppets to teach Dina how to get sex out of Jack. If seeing DeNiro wearing a homemade rubber "manary gland" sounds hilarious, by all means go see this movie. For me, it just made me think how it would be great to see Hoffman and Streisand re-team in a James Brooks comedy, how DeNiro should go back to Scorsese for career guidance and how Stiller may want to take a break before he plays yet another nebbish character. By the way, I'm guessing Streisand's "A Star Is Born"-era hairdo is an in-joke to her partner since her character's name was Esther Hoffman. Now that's the kind of subtlety this comedy needed.<br /><br />The 2005 DVD features two versions of the film - the theatrical cut and a completely unnecessary extended cut, which edits in several deleted scenes. Like the DVD treatment for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JND5">Ray</a>, the additions are announced to the viewer through a blinking gimmick and consequently inhibit the flow of the narrative. It's better to see these understandably excised scenes separate from the film. Roach and editor/co-producer Jon Poll provide a so-so commentary track, and there is also a fitfully funny blooper reel. Several disposable shorts are included, among them "Fockers' Family Portrait" featuring brief snippets from Hoffman, Streisand and Stiller; a behind-the-scenes look at Jinx the Cat ("Inside the Litter Box"); another behind-the-scenes look, this time at the infant ("The Adventures of a Baby Wrangler"); a five-minute featurette on "The Manary Gland"; and a Today Show interview with the entire cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>TWO-HOUR SITUATION COMEDY AT ITS FINEST!<br /><br />This is a terrific modern comedy with a classic theme. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand brought added chemistry and welcome diversity which really helped this character-driven sit-com. Whereas "Meet The Parents" had numerous funny "gags" and a lot of comedic tension, "Meet The Fockers" takes embarrassment to a new level for Greg Focker. Although this movie is 115 minutes long, there is hardly a dull moment. I have already viewed this DVD about 15 times.<br /><br />Yes, the film does resort to some cliched, overused themes, some of which are a bit vulgar and may even be offensive to some viewers. However, the enormous credibility that the all-star cast brings, and delivers, to this sprawling situation comedy, more than makes up for the predictable silliness, and occasionally irksome crudeness that sometimes gets tiresome.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />The sound and visual quality of this widescreen DVD is about what you would expect from a new big-budget release ... about perfect. It does contain quite a few features that I found interesting, but the extended version option was by the best of them. Although it does make the movie 150+ minutes, it adds some new insights into the characters and their motivations. One such extended scene depicts Greg with the father of the boy that Jack wrongfully believed was his Greg's son. Of course, Ben Stiller played the very odd, minor league baseball coach meeting Greg [himself]. Sure it's a cliche, but it was funny. There were also deleted scenes and bloopers. They were mostly okay, but some seemed contrived.<br /><br />There are three behind-the-scenes featurettes: one about the baby wrangler's role (pretty interesting), another about the mammary gland prop, and the third was titled "Inside the Litter Box" and was of course about that darn cat, "Mr. Jinx". The featurettes are a little over the top as features go, but it is, after all, a comedy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: ENTERTAINING, BUT OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF GOOD TASTE!<br /><br />Is "MEET THE FOCKERS" as entertaining as "Meet the Parents"? I believe so, but unfortunately, in many instances, it is done so at the expense of good taste. After viewing the movie and all the features only one question remains in my mind (as well as in the mind of many others, I'm sure.) ... Will they all return in yet another sequel, "MEET THE LITTLE FOCKER"?</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>This is not burst your gut comedy but it was amusing and Hoffman, Streisand and DeNiro definitely had great chemistry.

The film picks up from the cliffhanger that the first movie had left behind; meeting the in-laws.<br /><br />Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, and the rest of the cast, do a very good job considering that the plot and most importantly the dialogues are not that great.<br /><br />There are quite a few unnecessary flaws with the movie, such as the extreme "weirdness" of the Fockers, which does not make them likable or cute in the least, and the little baby, which was totally unnecessary, not to mention the plot jumping around all over the place.<br /><br />In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, though you might not want to go so far as to purchase it.  3?

In the sequel, Greg (Stiller) must bring his future wife and her family to Florida to meet his parents played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand.<br /><br />Meet the Fockers is more of the first movie, with Greg trying to keep his parents from totally embarassing him in front of his conservative, uptight future inlaws.  With so many stars in this movie, Striesand and Blythe Danner don't get as much to do.  De Niro's character does the exact same things as the first movie.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman is really the star of this movie.  He is the focus of almost every scene and is definitely the acting equal of DeNiro.  And am I the only one to notice...What happened to Teri Polo.  In some scenes, she looked kind of creepy, not anywhere close to the cute girl in the first movie.<br /><br />Meet the Fockers is a fun movie to watch, but is basically an extension of the first movie and offers nothing new except solid laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>It's rare when a sequel to comedy turns out to be better and funnier than its predecessor, but Meet the Fockers is exactly that.  With the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as the parents of Gaylord "Greg" Focker there are some truly hilarious moments in this film and they are just perfect as the parents of Ben Stiller's character.  The only funnier choice could have been Jerry Stiller and Ann Meara, Ben Stiller's real-life parents.  Regardless, Hoffman and Streisand are very funny as caricatures of former-hippy, bleeding-heart, Jewish liberals -- and they play it to the max.  Back, of course, are Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner as Jack and Dina Byrnes who just have a fantastic chemistry together.  The one weak link in the cast in Teri Polo as Pam, but she was also the weak link in the previous film.  She is just not funny.  She should stay with The West Wing where she has excellent chemistry with Jimmy Smits.  Overall, this was just a very funny film, and there were times when I actually found myself laughing out loud.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I saw this in a movie theater, due to another movie, The Incredibles, being so full, we couldn't find seats for the whole family (Gosh I hate going out to theaters, I'm so glad I don't do it too much anymore!)<br /><br />I was already in a bad mood, granted.

I actually turned it off half-way through as the jokes were not funny at all and the attitudes of the parents were extremely unbelievable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>I'd give this a low three stars or a high two stars.  It's called a comedy, I suppose, but it really isn't funny.  There are very few laughs in it.  It's more of a human interest story.  Plus, it plays out the American right wing-left wing thing.<br /><br />The left wingers are Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand, and Ben Stiller, a married couple and their son.  They are pointedly Jewish.  There is really only one right winger in the story, Robert DeNiro, playing a very uptight retired CIA agent.<br /><br />The moral of the story is that right wingers are much too uptight and should loosen up and have sex with their wives.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was just too un-funny.  The last half wasn't funny either, but it was more "human interest" and was okay.<br /><br />Take a potentially funny scene like a man trying to breast feed a little baby by actually putting on a fake breast that can squirt milk.  Charlie Chaplin would have made it hysterical, if it had been okay to do in his day, and perhaps he would have found a way to pull it off acceptably for his audience.  Richard Pryor and Chris Rock would have made it funny too.  So would Red Skelton, most likely.  Groucho Marx would have had us rolling.  I think he was about the funniest man of the last century.  But DeNiro really isn't a comedian, and when he does it I'm not laughing.<br /><br />It's tough to make someone laugh when the script has you being a robotic tight-butt.<br /><br />The movie is basically about telling conservative America to loosen up like a liberal Jewish family.  Okay, good.  Nothing wrong with loosening up a little.<br /><br />DeNiro's dramatic work is better than his comedic work.  I don't think of Ben Stiller as one of the giants of comedy, though he is nowhere near as annoying as that guy who plays Bigelow the Gigolo, or that annoying guy from Saty Nite Live who does the No No No commercials (what's in your wallet?), or that constantly complaining and overly macho Denis Leary who has yet to do anything remotely funny, and who is about as funny as smacking a girl in the teeth.  You want funny?  Try Rodney Dangerfield, or Sam Kinison.  Now that's funny.<br /><br />But the cast also has Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, two very talented comedic actors, so how can it miss?  Dustin Hoffman can do anything.  He is just a damn capable performer, and if I see that he is in something, I know it was taken seriously and is worth a look.  He even made that wooden chunk of cardboard Tom Cruise into something once.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>I agree with a reviewer below - the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand made this movie incredibly funny.<br /><br />The first movie was OK, but kept mining the "surveillance" vein until it kind of stopped being funny.  Here, having Dustin and Barbra for DeNiro to play off is a master stroke.<br /><br />I also like Ben Stiller quite a bit.  I think that he has a very expressive face and really has fun with what he's doing.<br /><br />Must admit, though, that I thought Stiller and Meara were funnier.  Does that betray my age??</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Arguably the best comedy of 2004, Meet The Fockers is a hilarious, humor-filled marathon. Screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke (who should have received Oscars for their flawless penmanship of Meet The Parents) turn in another blockbuster manuscript. But, as with its predecessor, Meet The Fockers wouldn't be the comedy masterpiece it is without the onscreen chemistry of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. Stiller, son of comedian Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld & King Of Queens), is a comic genius in his own right and has recently dominated the Hollywood box office with a string of smash spoof comedies such as There's Something About Mary (1998), Meet The Parents (2000), Zoolander (2001), Along Came Polly (2004), and Dodgeball (2004). De Niro, on the other hand, moves from the less serious roles of his early career into the comedy genre with an ease fully indicative of his enormous talent. Earlier comic roles in Wag The Dog (1997), Analyze This (1999), and Meet The Parents (2000) prepared movie-goers for the veteran actor's zinging one-liners. Throw Dustin Hoffman (who's also surprisingly funny) into the mix, and Meet The Fockers becomes one of those rare comedies that movie aficionados will want to see over and over again...<br /><br />Meet The Fockers follows the continuing hardship of Gaylord "Greg" Focker (Ben Stiller), a male nurse whose future father-in-law, Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro), is a never-ending source of torment. A retired CIA operative, Jack is paranoid and controlling, and Greg's previous attempts to win over Jack's affections have always come up short. Now, Greg's life problems are multiplied by the imminent first meeting between his in-laws-to-be and his "birth parents".<br /><br />Traveling by RV, Greg, his fianc&eacute;e Pam (Teri Polo) and the rest of Byrnes family arrive in Florida where Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Fockers' (Barbra Streisand) free-love, hippie lifestyle stands in stark contrast to Jack's serious fa?ade. Throughout the visit, Greg works overtime to avoid having Jack learn of his mother's thriving sex therapy business, his own youthful indiscretion with the family maid, and his inability to supervise Jack Jr. for even a single afternoon. When Jack gets the idea that Greg fathered a child back in high school, he administers truth serum to Greg, sparking a series of events that is sure to make even the most ardent critic of ridiculous and juvenile movies (and this is one of them) burst forth in laughter...<br /><br />Meet The Fockers is a rarity in that it's a sequel to a fairly successful film that manages to live up to the reputation of the original. Although Meet The Parents is probably the better film, Meet The Fockers is a truly hilarious comedy in its own right. Directed by Jay Roach (director of the Austin Powers franchise), Meet The Fockers is a highly entertaining comedy, deploying all the tricks of the trade - slap-stick, bathroom humor, zinging one-liners, classic "fish-out-of-water" sequences, and situation humor. By no means is it a cinema classic worthy of artistic awards and praise from sophisticated critics. But it delivers on its promise. It promises to make you laugh, and it performs that task with relative ease...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>You know, I actually didn't think the first one was<br /><br />all that funny, but this one failed badly.

Blah!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>"Meet the Fockers" is a funny film with an all- star cast of Hollywood big wigs. This movie is a sequel to the fun film "Meet the Parents" from many years ago. This time around, the soon to be married couple is driving to Florida with the bride-to-be's parents to meet with the groom-to-be's parents. The bride's father is a conservative stick in the mud type who dislikes anything he doesn't consider normal. The groom's parents are throwbacks to the 1960's- strong believers in free love, hugs, and unconventional living.<br /><br />Barbara Striesand and Dustin Hoffman play the roles of the two liberal parents, and they offer some good, entertaining on- screen chemistry. There is plenty of contrast among the different characters, and this adds to the movies appeal. There are also a few surprises in the plot and some original humor, making the movie that much more enjoyable. And the basic premise is something most people can relate to. We all feel a little bit of anxiety when we meet our significant others' parents for the first time, and this movie uses this scenario (in an exaggerated way, of course), as its main plot.<br /><br />Director Jay Roach moves this film in a few different directions to keep it from becoming a boring, standardized comedy. In the middle and near the end, he introduces a new segment to the plot involving a young teenage boy who looks very much like Ben Stiller's character. The bride's father, played by Robert DeNiro, decides that his future son in law is the actual father of this boy and he sets out to prove his point, with the ultimate goal being to eliminate Stiller and convince his daughter to marry someone else.<br /><br />This movie isn't a comedy classic, but it does have its moments. Whether it's the contrast between the characters, the contributions from the baby, the comedic timing, or something else, you will probably like "Meet the Fockers". It isn't quite as good as the original, but it's still a fun flick to watch for its good humor and fun plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>"Meet the Parents" fame introduces the Focker family. Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand) play the parents of Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller).<br /><br />Robert De Niro (Jack Byrnes) returns as the father of Pam (Teri Polo). Gaylord and Pam are engaged but want the blessing from both parents. The whole film is based on Jack looking for Gaylord's flaws to expose to Pam. And a reason to dissolved there wedding.<br /><br />The potential in-laws Bernie and Roz are very affectionate in public and private. They teach Gaylord that there is no winner and loser. Everyone is a winner. Hence, they display all of Gaylord's trophies albeit seventh place or below. A shrine is built on a wall for everyone to "envy" at. Well that is contrasting to Jack Byrnes where you either win or you're a loser.<br /><br />The parent's differ in values, parental methods and personalities, thus giving the film some comedic options that the viewer can relate to. This gives some value to the film.<br /><br />This film has some good laughs utilizing the stepson. Of course utilizing the running jokes (Everything Focker!) through out the film keeps the viewer interested, but cannot excel this film into a classic comedy.<br /><br />This DVD is a good one viewing option. Purchase this DVD for "display only" value, so there is a viewing option for unexpected company.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>What happens when two toatlly opposite families combine?- You've got yourself:Meet The Fockers. It's the sequel that we "Meet The Parents" fans have waited three or four long years for... and guess what- it tops the first! When I went to see this sequel I thought it would not live up to the high standards set out in the first one but,this comedy managed to pass my expectations and keep me reasonably entertained. It's a good feel good and roll over laughing movie.<br /><br />Unlike the first that had suddle humour this movie was over the top and maybe not the sequel you will expect to see but, it still manages to be a nice chapter in Gaylord's acceptance and approval from his father-in-law Jack.<br /><br />Of course you know their will be casosis as the two families meet for the first time The Fockers- have always been touchy, feely, coddling and admiring parents- who love Gaylord no matter what he achieves even displaying his collection of eigth and ninth place ribbons. While the Byrnes have always had family secrets and have expected nothing less than perfection Jack even trys to pass that perfect onto the next generation of Byrnes by, making his grandson Little Jack into a baby genius by teaching him sign language and using a new method in which the youngster has to comfort himself rather than be coddled by others. The two families could not be more differant and when they meet all hell breaks loose... first of all Greg's mom is a sex therapist and her and her husband are not afraid to engage in loud activities and touching eachother- something distrubs Jack straight away... followed by the fact that Greg's dad left the position as a high-powered attroney to stay at home and care for Greg... the two families collide in a mishaps of events from showing sercumsion photos, to flushing a dog down the toliet, to Greg learning he may have a son with the woman he lost his virginity too, and Greg's mom helping Mrs. Byrnes' with some bedroom issues. Before Greg knows it he finds himself outside the circle of trust and on top of that- Pam's pregnant so they need to speed up the wedding date. But, can they when Jack dosn't approve?<br /><br />Ben Stiller is great along with great performances by DeNiro, Hoffman-who is a real comedian despite what I believed at first and Streisand does a half-way decent job herself.<br /><br />I laughed out loud watching this movie and in my opinon it's just as funny if not funnier than the first and I can't wait to have it my collection. I just hope we haven't meet the last of this movie series!</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>This movie was so funny that I think it passes the first one.  And that is rare.  I felt the dry humor and jokes that were geared towards sex were pulled off well.  They were made funny because "The Fockers"  really are dense and don't realize that they are being crude.  So it makes for a funny fim.  I also loved the baby in the movie he was so cute.  But my favorite part was the end when everyone realized that they could get along and were finally one happy family.  You can tell there will be a third movie since this one has done so well.  Let's up hope that it lives up to these first two movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>This is hands-down one of the funniest movies ever. The movie starts out with meeting of Gaylord Fockers's parents. Who are funny as they are embarassing. The clear star of this movie is Barbara Streisand who plays a geriatric sex therapist. If you are looking to have a good time at the movies. This is the movie to see.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>Yes, when I saw the coming attractions in the theater, I gasped to see that the Almighty Barbra Streisand was in this movie. She's joined by Dustin Hoffman, and of course Robert De Niro. So how many Oscars do these folks have among them? And yet here they all are, in a Ben Stiller movie. The pay must have been GOOD.<br /><br />But you've got to hand it to Stiller, because it stayed His Movie. He's the star, to the end.<br /><br />Is this a bad movie? Oh no, not at all. Is this a good movie? Ah, well, there you might have me. It's a so-so movie. It's got plenty of bathroom humor (including several scenes in bathrooms, as a matter of fact), but many Americans like that sort of thing, judging by the roars of laugher in my Forest Hills movie theater. It's really nothing more or less than another entry in the Two Families That Have Nothing At All In Common Will Now Be Related By Marriage category. You saw it in "The In-Laws" with Peter Falk/Alan Arkin back in the 70s. Probably even back in the 60s with "Lovers and Other Strangers". You'll see it again, years from now with some other stars who are young now, maybe even Ben Stiller's daughter marrying Keanu Reeve's son or something.<br /><br />So, if you don't mind sex-filled, poopy pants dialogue and stars that could have done any number of other things but decided to have a good time over the summer, this just might fit the bill.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>I was excited and looking forward to see a nice comedy with a number of laughs, especially with the cast of Hoffman, DeNiro, Streisand, Stiller, etc. But after watching the trailer on TV over and over again, I must say the trailer was the best of this movie, as this flick goes downhill very fast. It's an embarrassing film with the sickest of Hollywood "humor." This flick should have received at least an "R" rating due to the continuous perverted adult content. It says a lot if in supposed-to-be "funny" scenes the whole theatre was quiet and nobody laughed. Sure, there were a few laughs here and there, but it was all messed up with the tasteless sick stuff this screenwriter put into it. Not just one scene, but one scene after the other as if the creator of this film really had a mental problem. And the script has a number of flaws as e.g. a trip from New York to Florida is played out in less than 5 minutes in the film. If you do want to see this film, don't take your kids with you -- it's absolutely not suitable. It's not the kind of comedy the trailer seems to indicate. And it is very likely that you will leave the theatre before this film is over as most folks did in the theatre that I went to. This is really sick stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just saw this film in a crowded theater and laughter flowed from the audience at a blistering pace. I found myself cracking up every couple of minutes or so. I kinda liked Meet the Parents, but to me this sequel is much funnier and the the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand make it a real hoot. It does go a little overboard on the raunchy factor (especially for PG-13), but all the gags got a laugh out of me. I may be in the minority here, but I would say this is the funniest comedy I have seen all year.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: In this sequel to Meet The Parents we get to see Ben Stiller for the sixth time this year in a movie.  I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did the first one.  Some of the scenes are just way too over the top and it doesn't fit at all.  The movie is enjoyable though, I found it to be worth my while, it's just that I wouldn't have carried it as far as they did.  There is one scene where the family is eating dinner and talking about the wedding, Barbra Streisand then brings out a memory book of Stiller's childhood.  When the other mother picks up this crusty thing and asks "oh my, you kept the umbilical cord?" in which Streisand replies "oh no, that's Gaylord's forskin from his circumcison."  Then she throws it up and it lands in the Fondue pot.  While the movie is funny, it can step overboard at times to a point where you want it to step back but it doesn't.<br /><br />ACTING: The cast from the first movie are all the same, but our new additions are Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as the Fockers.  The two are funny and pull this cuckoo but heartwarming feel.  I think the cast works well, but I'm sorry, I have just had enough of Ben Stiller for one year.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: An outrageous romp that will leave you laughing hard at times, but it's just too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>If you loved the first movie,you will love Meet the Fockers. I couldn't stop laughing through most of this movie. Ben Stiller, Rober De Niro and everyone is just as funny as they were in the first film and the new cast are equally as funny. I recommend this movie to fans and those who have never seen the fist movie, it is great!</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>So as I left the theater I was thinking, how funny you think this film is depends a lot on how old you are, and who you are, and who you identify with in the stratified society.  If you are a couple of New Aging hippies nostalgic for the summer of love and your lost libido, you gotta love it.  But if you are Oliver North or Dick Cheney, welding loose cannons or loose nukes--whatever--this has got to be some kind of insult to American manhood.<br /><br />Anyway, there was this carnival guy in the lobby with a pink top hat and a big red nose and a microphone getting comments--for publicity I guess.  "DID YA MEET THE FOCKERS? he says, eyes wide.  Most people ignore him but some guy in a NASCAR baseball cap says:<br /><br />"Yeah, I met 'em and the Byrnes too.  I wasn't too impressed.  They're kinda gay and touchie-feelie.  So fock off, would you?"<br /><br />He and his bud crack up.<br /><br />An older woman says in passing, "Bobbie De Niro used to be such a fine actor.  And so handsome.  Now look what they've done to him.  Oy ve!  But Bah-bra.  Wasn't she divine!  She is sooo good at comedy.  So funny, so natural."<br /><br />"Perfect casting," her friend says.<br /><br />One teenaged boy says, "Yeah, dude, just like Frankie's parents.  You know Frankie Rigotelli...I mean crack me up like wow it was so, so identical, I mean identical.  Dude, like when he f..in' kisses him on the neck like he wants blood or something.  I mean, dude, it was bogus."<br /><br />His buddy says, "Teri Polo is hot."<br /><br />"Yeah, I'd like to--."<br /><br />Never mind.<br /><br />A pregnant woman with her husband, beaming: "We loved it. So funny and the little boy was just adorable, wasn't he, honey?"<br /><br />"Adorable."<br /><br />An old guy in a World War II red hat with gold scrambled egg on the bill, snarls, "No retired CIA operative would stand for that.  It's just not natural.  That's not the way he would act.  He'd, he'd...take control of the situation.  Dustin Hoffman's a p--y.  He can't knock Robert De Niro down.  That's as phony as a three-dollar bill."<br /><br />"'Meet the Parents' was better," a woman says to the guy she's with.<br /><br />"Yeah, but the kid was adorable."<br /><br />"Adorable."<br /><br />So I thought, what did I think of the movie?  Well, you have two of the most outstanding actors of our time, De Niro and Dustin Hoffman in it (totally miscast, of course).  But they do a good job anyway.  You have a really fine performance by Barbra Steisand.  She is just perfect as a sex therapist for seniors.  Seems like she was born for the part.  And yes, Bradley Pickren as the boy whose first spoken word is "a--hole" is as cute as cute can be.  And what is more, they did a great job of getting all those expressions out of him on film and then splicing them in at exactly the right spot.<br /><br />But I wonder if this is director Jay Roach's best work.  My laugh-o-meter says no.  I understand the prequel Meet the Parents (2000) which also starred De Niro and Ben Stiller (but no Dustin Hoffman or Barbra Steisand) was funnier, but I haven't seen it so I can't say.  I did see one of the Austin Powers movies that Roach directed and it was very funny.<br /><br />A warning: some straight-laced types might find this movie a bit creepy.  After all, the Fockers are parents who have a trophy wall for their son showing off his ninth or tenth place ribbons for whatever along with his jock strap, framed.  On the other hand, I think young people might get some chuckles laughing at people who remind them of their parents.  And, for some aging hippies this might come off as a very warm movie.  There's a happy ending in which the uptight learn to loosen up a bit, and they did, as Barbra Streisand's character says, "Fockerize" De Niro's Jack Byrnes, who is a retired CIA agent.<br /><br />So bottom line is chill out.  This is a comedy and if you don't feel Fockerized, well, then you can just--<br /><br />Never mind.  But remember, "If it's yellow, let it mellow, and if it's brown, flush it down."</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>Dustin Hoffman plays off DeNiro even better than in Wag the Dog and Barbara proves that whatever her shortcomings in political opinion, she can act and produce laughs in this wonderful sequel to Meet the Parents.<br /><br />There is very little to not like in this movies as once again Ben Stiller underplays himself and lets everything around him shine.  There are too many funny moments in this film and it would be a crime to give spoilers to any of them, so I would just suggest watching it.<br /><br />All the cast from the first movie continues to shine to the point that there isn't much left to add.  Only the totally expected ending makes this movie lose its last star.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>A great sequel for a change!

One of a kind, written well and the actors were all top-notch.  Well, here we are with "Meet The Frockers", and that is all we really need; Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. Of course, a little Robert DeNiro thrown in to contrast with Ben Stiller and you have a win of a movie.<br /><br />Ben Stiller, Gaylord Frocker, yes, that's his name and that is the funniest line he has. Gaylord is engaged to be married to Jack and Dina Byrne's ( Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner)daughter. They are embarking on a trip to Florida to "Meet the Frockers", Roz and Bernie; Bar and Dustin. The Byrnes have a large, very large RV, and they are also bringing their infant grandson who is being brought up the Byrnes way.  There you have it, most of the movie in that little capsule.<br /><br />Dustin and Barbra have such great chemistry and funny lines, that you really only need to follow them. Barbra is a sex therapist, charading as a psychologist for the Byrne's sake, and Dustin is a stay at home dad, and used to be lawyer. They are fun and full of hi-jinks. Dustin Hoffman is a funny man. He is rowdy and raunchy. He could carry the movie alone, and well, quite frankly, he does.  I felt a sense of deja vous with this pair, even though neither has played this kind of part before.<br /><br />Ben Stiller has a comic sense of timing and carries this movie well, but not well enough. His fianc&eacute;e is ok, but looks too old for our Ben. All in all this movie has been done before. Still I laughed a lot, which is a good thing to say when watching a movie now a days. So, I am giving it a higher rank than most.

Then again, what do you want, it's a Ben Stiller movie? I didn't have high hopes to start with when I watched this. The  first one may have been a tad bit funnier, but this one had some scenes in it that outdid the first one. All of the skits with the baby made this movie. It also surprised me because it made laugh a lot more than I thought it would. I was expecting dry, boring jay leno kind of humor. So I wasn't disappointed there. I also did not want to see this movie because Barbra Streisand was in it and I thought she would ruin it, however,  I must say she did a very good job at her roll. An above average, decent, funny movie.<br />NOTE:<br />To the old conservative prudes: I feel someone must say something. I am so tired of all you cry babies offended by the name of this movie. Just because it is close to the F word? Have we come to this? Is this what the world has come to? Grow up! Or maybe, the opposite, act immature once in awhile! Maybe if you did you wouldn't be such an old prude that everyone dislikes. How about that? You conservative pukes make me sick and you shouldn't even be renting movies. You only rent movies so you can complain. Be'atch Be'atch Be'atch Be'atch that's all you do. OH GOD, look I used a word close to the B word. WAHH!!! You big baby!

The jokes grew naturally out of the moments and the personalities established by the characters.  It also had a feel of truth to it - even if Jack (Robery De Niro) was ex-CIA (which most parents aren't), he was mainly a Dad looking out for his daughter.  In Meet the Fockers, we meet the groom-to-be's set of parents.  That they must somehow contrast with the uptight New England nouveau riche Byrneses goes without saying.  Unfortunately, they are too over-the-top to allow much in the way of "truth" in the characters' personalities.<br /><br />That's not to say that such a film could not be funny, and the most delightful bits in Meet the Fockers are, in fact, those between the Focker family themselves - the hippy stay-at-home free spirit Dad (Dustin Hoffman), the hippy sex-therapist Mom (Barbara Streisand), and their eternally embarrassed son Gaylord "call me Greg" Focker (Ben Stiller).  There are also some great moments featuring the Byrnes family - the yearning of Mom for the kind of physical connection with her husband that the Fockers have for each other, and the continuing battle between Greg and the Byrnes patriarch.  Unfortunately, the screen gets filled up with too many alpha-male (and female) actors (Hoffman, Stiller, Streisand, and De Niro) that there is no time to develop the interrelationships to the point where the comedy pays off.  This is made worse because time needed to be made for Jinx (the cat) and his new nemesis, the Focker chihuahua.  But the most fatal mistake is the inclusion of Jack's grandson (by his second daughter) who makes the trip with them.  Again, he has some very funny scenes, but he exposes the script as sacrificing character for plot points - the Fockers should be delighted at the efforts Jack has made to bond with his grandson, because that was their philosophy in raising Greg.  Instead, they ridicule him for the sake of cheap laughs that diminish their characters.<br /><br />Still, when the screen isn't overcrowded by all these stars vying for time, there are some great jokes, and the third act almost returns to the kind of situational comedy of the first.  It may not be as enjoyable as the first film, but if you did enjoy Meet the Parents, you will not be wasting your time Meeting the Fockers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>I could not wait to see Barbra Streisand in her latest movie role.

I'm sorry, but this is not worth the price of the rental :(</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>I have been listening to interviews that Ben Stiller has been giving for the last couple of years.  Being a big fan of "Meet The Parents," I wanted to hear what was happening with the long awaited sequel.  He kept saying "We are delaying the making of the movie, because we want to get a script that we really like and is really good."  At first I thought that was code for "We can't seem to think of a good script and the sequel in not going to be any good."  I'm glad that I was wrong with that assumption.<br /><br />The movie has a really simple storyline:  Greg (Stiller) and Pam (Polo) are going to get married after a two year delay and its time for Pam's parents to meet Greg's parents.  Pam's dad Jack (DeNiro) is worried that Greg's family is going to ruin his families legacy.  That they will put a "chink" in the family chain.  And his worries are soon confirmed when he actually meets Greg's parents.  Greg's dad Bernard (Hoffman) is a very honest, a little too honest person, that likes to tell embarressing stories and is a stay-at-home dad.  Greg's mother, Roz (Streisand) is a senior sex consultant, who wants to know everything about Greg and the Byrnes' sex life.  So Greg has to try to make his family seem acceptable to Jack.  Obviously, that doesn't work too well and many funny sequences occur thereafter.<br /><br />All of the characters that return in this movie are basically the same characters.  The only major difference is that Pam's sister, Deborah, had a baby and Jack is watching it.  Stiller and DeNiro do another great job at their characters.  This is the kind of role that Stiller was born to play and also his funniest character that he plays.  Jay Roach also returned for this movie.  He optioned to make this movie instead of making Austin Powers 4, which looks like will never see the light of day.  Thank God!<br /><br />I would definately recommend seeing this movie.  It was really funny, the funniest movie that I have seen this year since "Dodgeball".  Hollywood should also take this movie as a hint.  Take time to make a really good movie, rather than shoveling out a crappy sequel the following year.  The audiences will be patient for quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>This movie is not as funny as the first sadly, where the first meet the parents movie was hilarious this one lacks it, it's not that this movie is not Funny. it is. but not as much as the 1st one. Then you add in the new cast of characters it just didn't do it for me sadly. It could have been better, there is a 3rd installment rumored to come as of this writing which will be about the kids, let's hope it's better and funnier. Pass this one, go for the 1st.

With a title like this, you should go in expecting an easy to watch film with a few laughs. And it does just that.  I must admit, I went in expecting the worse based on the reviews, but it surpassed my expectations.  Meet the Fockers is very easy to sit through, doesn't make you look at your watch, and it has some great laughs (even if they are rather crude). Everyone enjoys a film from time to time which doesn't require too much thought.<br /><br />Hoffman, Streisand and De Niro steal the show for sure. Stiller isn't too bad as the son embarrassed by his parent's behaviour. My advice:  Do not to take it seriously, just enjoy it.  It is a good value 3 star film ... no more, no less.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Meet The Fockers", the inevitable sequel to "Meet The Parents", has a sufficient number of laughs. Surprisingly, these laughs are generated primarily by just two of the stars and they are not the same people who caused all of the laughter in the original.<br /><br />Two years later, Greg and Pam (Ben Stiller and Teri Polo) are still engaged and anxious to set a wedding date. Before they can move forward, they have to introduce Pam's parents, Jack and Dina (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner), to Greg's parents, Bernie and Roz (Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand). The plan is that Greg and Pam will meet Jack and Dina at their home and fly to Florida together. Upon arrival at Casa Byrnes, they learn that Jack has purchased a super customized motor home and they will drive down to Florida together. They also meet Jack's grandson, by Pam's sister. Jack has taken an obsessive interest in his grandson, Little Jack, going so far as to teach him sign language and communicating with the baby. Greg knows that the meeting will probably be awkward and tries to prepare his parents, two free-thinking liberals who are a sex-therapist and a stay-at-home father.<br /><br />In "Meet The Parents", Jay Roach crafted a hilarious comedy of errors about a nervous young man going home to meet his girlfriend's parents. Every time Greg tried to become part of the family, his nervousness or Jack's watchful eye caused him to make some mistake. The events escalated until Greg was setting fire to a hand-crafted gazebo or beaning the bride-to-be with a volleyball.<br /><br />"Parents" was a wildly successful film and proved to the world that DeNiro, known for his work in dramas and action films, has a place in comedy as well. Because of its success, a sequel was pretty much inevitable. "Fockers" generates a lot of laughter, but these are almost all created by the work of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand.<br /><br />The filmmakers have shifted the focus that made "Parents" so funny. In the original, all of the laughs came from Greg's unease with Jack. In "Fockers", all of the laughs come from Jack's (and to a lesser extent, Greg's) unease with Bernie and Roz. Bernie and Roz, products of the 60s, are the type of people who were overjoyed when Greg lost his virginity, at 15, to the Latino housekeeper. So overjoyed in fact, that they invite her back to help with the welcome home dinner, and to meet Jack and Dina.<br /><br />Hoffman, in particular, and Streisand seem to have a great time playing these characters. Greg has inflated the truth about each of his parents, to make them seem more impressive in Jack's eyes. Bernie is a lawyer and Roz is a doctor, at least as Greg relays the message. In truth, Bernie quit his practice to stay at home and become Mr. Mom to Greg and Roz is a sex therapist to senior citizens. Because Hoffman and Streisand work so well together, they create the same effect as watching DeNiro in the first film. Much of the laughter comes from watching actors known for their great work in dramas letting loose in a comedy. There is something exhilarating about watching Hoffman play everything for laughs.<br /><br />Everyone else basically plays the "straight man", setting up the jokes. In a few cases, they aren't taking on this role intentionally. A scene in which Jack injects Greg with truth serum is spectacularly unfunny, but Stiller manages to wrench a few laughs out of it. DeNiro isn't so lucky.<br /><br />Let's talk about DeNiro for a moment. DeNiro has always been a busy actor. Most years, you can expect to see him in two or three films. In the past, I have always felt that he took on certain roles for the challenge of playing a different character. For instance in 1998, he made "Ronin" and "Great Expectations". "Expectations" was more or less a supporting role for him, but "Ronin" was a great action film. In 2000, he made "Men of Honor", "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" and "Meet The Parents". A mixed batch to be sure, but "Meet The Parents" stands out as a very good comedy. Lately, he just seems to be on a money grab; making sequels, bad horror films and terrible comedies, banking on his name to earn him large paychecks. Is he broke or something? Worried about retirement? I don't know, but how else would you explain the actor taking roles in "Showtime", "Godsend", "Analyze That", "Shark Tale" and "Hide and Seek"? It's the great DeNiro money grab.<br /><br />The problem with "Fockers" is that it tries to redo many of the same situations that were so funny in the first film. In the sequel, we have a beloved family Chihuahua, in addition to Jack's cat. Of course the cat came along for the ride, they're in a mobile home. Jack redirects most of his obsessive tendencies from his cat to his grandson, Little Jack. Of course, Greg will get into trouble when he watches Little Jack. Also, since we are familiar with the formula from the first film (every thing Greg tries to do right will spiral out of control and make him look bad), we know what to look for and aren't that surprised.<br /><br />"Meet The Fockers" has a few laughs in it, and is best when we get to watch Hoffman and Streisand have fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>We went to go watch this in the theater. We had low expectations and once I saw the words "Meet the Fockers" on the screen, I knew I was in for a treat. This wasn't as great as "Meet the parents" but I LOVED IT!!!<br /><br />In this movie, Greg (or Gaylord) Focker flies over to his girlfriend. He then learns that they had a baby. Then they all go to Miami to visit The other Fockers.<br /><br />With a sexualized dog, Sex-addicted parents, and other hilarious moments, you'll laugh through the whole damn movie!

Adding Dustin Hoffman & Barbra Streisand.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Barbra's but she & Dustin were great in their roles to me.  Added with DeNiro 3 Oscar winners.<br />The 3 of them with Blythe Danner are perfect in their roles.<br /><br />Teri Polo has a role that is just a watcher of course.<br />Now, I am NOT a fan of Ben Stiller.  He does his usual routine in this role as he did in the 1st & in "There's Something About Mary".  Same lying, put out then blows his top role.  Wish they could have gotten a better actor for the role.<br />And, we MOST DEFINITELY could have done WITHOUT Owen Wilson in both films.<br /><br />As for the DVD, it is a good package.  I like extras  & this one has the kind I like.

Barbra Streisand is not on my list of the favorite actors, either. But I saw "Meet the Fockers", I laughed out loud, I liked it a lot and I may see it again on DVD. Dustin Hoffman was hilarious - wild and crazy; together with Streisand they made a great team. Streisand was very funny as a Jewish Mama (I am dying to say Mother Focker - but it's been said hundreds times already. Well, I did say that :)) - Sex Therapist for octogenarians. They were the best things about the movie, and it was enough for me to spend very nice two hours (my husband and my son enjoyed it, too. Actually, it's been quite some time since I saw my husband laughing so hard at the movies).<br /><br />3.5/5 or 7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9G9G8CJGJPO.html">A3F9G9G8CJGJPO</a><br/><p>MEET THE FOCKERS (2004)<br /><br />  Universal Studios<br /><br />  Release Date: December 22, 2004<br /><br />  Runtime: 110 minutes.<br /><br />  Directed by:<br /><br />  Jay Roach<br /><br />  Produced by:<br /><br />  Jay Roach....producer<br /><br />  Robert De Niro....producer<br /><br />  Jane Rosenthal....producer<br /><br />  Cast:<br /><br />  Ben Stiller....Gaylord "Greg" Focker<br /><br />  Robert De Niro....Jack Byrnes<br /><br />  Teri Polo....Pamela Martha Byrnes<br /><br />  Blythe Danner....Dina Byrnes<br /><br />  Barbra Streisand....Rosalind "Roz" Focker<br /><br />  Dustin Hoffman....Bernard "Bernie" Focker<br /><br />  Spencer & Bradley Pickren....Little Jack<br /><br />  Alanna Ubach....Isabel Villalobos<br /><br />  Ray Santiago....Jorge Villalobos<br /><br />  PLOT SUMMARY:<br /><br />  After being given permission to marry the daughter of a retired CIA agent, Gaylord "Greg" Focker, his fiancee Pam, and her parents travel Miami, Florida to meet his quirky liberal parents, Roz and Bernie Focker.

No matter how good the writing is, or how charming the Hollywood A-list cast is, comedy sequels always receive indifferent reviews, and regardless of box office success, they never reach the heights of the "sometimes not that great too begin with" original movie. Sure, there are laughs, but Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro did all this before, and second time around, the back-and-forth shtick doesn't hit it off. The highlight is Dustin Hoffman, who manages to take a stereotypical character and give the film the most laughs. But cheap jokes about sex and circumcises are more painful than positive. And I think we got the idea that Gay Lord Focker is a queer name, it's only drilled into your brain every 5 minutes. On the plus side, the music zips the movie along at a sprightly pace, and there are some genuine chuckles to be had, but you shouldn't have to search for them. Like the recent string of comedy sequels (Whole Ten Yards, Ocean's 12 etc) Fockers thinks it's way funnier than it actually is. If easily pleased empty head American audiences actually sat back and watched the movie, they would realize what others have: there's nothing special about it, and probably a waste of your hard-earned green. Fockers fares better on DVD, where late-night viewings amuse more easily.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Poor Gaylord Focker (Stiller).You would think that after meeting his fiancee's parents, Jack (DeNiro) and Dina Byrnes (Danner), and barely surviving, he would be in the clear.  Wrong.  Now, the Byrnses are coming to meet father and mother Focker, Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand).  To call the excentric might be an understatement, and Jack is his usual uptight self.  And, of course, that means that Greg's life is about to become hellish once again.<br /><br />"Meet The Fockers" is the sequel to the popular "Meet The Parents" that was released a few years ago.  Following the same formula, "Fockers" puts Greg in one uncomfortable situation after another as the parents meet.  All the principals from the first film are back, along with Hoffman and Streisand as the Fockers.  Both do a good job as the quirky parents that must have made poor Greg's life interesting as a child.  Hoffman is the standout in this movie, I think.  He is probably the most likeable of all the parents, and is genuinely funny almost every time he is on screen.<br /><br />If you liked "Meet The Parents", you will like "Meet The Fockers".  Simple as that.  If you didn't, then stay away.  This is more of the same, and for the most part it works.  When it is funny, it can be extremely funny.  Hopefully, now that Greg has survived this second meeting, his life will less stressful.  He deserves it!</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>I COULD REALLY RELATE TO THE FAMILIES INVOLVED AS WELL; THE PERFORMANCES BY THE WHOLE CAST ARE WONDERFUL, OVER THE TOP, ZANY, ETC.

People are so obnoxious or do such odious and tasteless things that the only logical response is discomfort.  Like watching your best friend get drunk and make an ass of himself or herself at a wedding or funeral.  That kind of thing.<br /><br />It can be done well. And judging by the movie's popularity I guess there are legions who found the godawful Fockers contrasted with the uptight DeNiro hilarious.  I wasn't one of them.  I found it especially apalling considering the wealth of talent in front of the cameras.  DeNiro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand, and it sucked?  Yep.  Sorry.  I couldn't wait for this one to be over.<br /><br />The first film had some of this discomfort humor too, but that film actually had its moments, with Stiller's geometric progression of effups becoming increasingly absurd and funny.  But here his parents were so completely obnoxious and inappropriate at all times (to my mind) that it was just one labored scene after another with some people you wouldn't want to know if your life depended on it.  DeNiro was so stiff reacting to these old hippies that he was a pain in the ass too.<br /><br />Anyway, the only way to enjoy this film was to detest these people, and I didn't want to waste the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>There is a moment in "Meet the Fockers" when Pam makes a stand regarding her intention to marry Greg.  She will become Pamela Focker.  Greg opines it could be Pamela Byrnes-Focker.  "No, no, no," she insists, "I will be Pamela Martha Focker.  I know how that sounds, but, but, that's the name I'm taking."  I burst out laughing and my wife wondered why.  "Honey," I said with that sort of loving condescension that infuriates her to no end, "there is only one joke in this movie."  That is an exaggeration, but one look at the title and you know what the main joke is for this 2004 sequel to "Meet the Parents."  But Polo plays the moment so absolutely straight faced, not only because it makes the line work perfectly but also because the actress knows (a) this is probably the only laugh she is going to be able to get in the film and (b) it is impossible to compete with the rest of her cast mates when it comes to mugging and milking a scene, so why even try?<br /><br />This is a movie that stresses character over plot because the plot basically boils down to the same thing as last time: Jack is worried about Greg and makes an erroneous assumption that sends him off into full-blown CIA mode, yelling about the "Circle of Trust" and insisting his daughter cannot marry this man.  As Pam says, "Here we go again, Dad."  There is another family dinner where something both alien and familial is added to the table.  There is another pet to worry about.  However, the big difference is that for the sequel Greg's parents have been added to the mix and it is in the manic performances of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand that this film gets most of its laughs.  They are Bernie and Roz Focker, and they are as loose as Jack is uptight, plus they talk twice as fast, apparently in a frantic effort to find something genuinely funny to say.<br /><br />Last time Ben Stiller's Greg had to play second fiddle to Robert De Niro's Jack.  This time he not only has that burden again with his parents added to the mix, but there is a baby, Little Jack (Spencer & Bradley Pickren), who is being raised strictly in accordance with Jack's viewing of parenting.  Of course, Greg will take care of that in short order, the same way Jinx is going to get that little dog too.  The baby fits into the movie perfectly because when he finds his one laugh line, the kid sticks to it for the rest of the film.  Then there is poor Blythe Danner, pretty much forced into the 7th position in the film's hierarchy and taking small comfort in knowing her daughter has an Oscar given all the grown ups in this film have two a piece.  Dina finally gets a funny bit to play, as she uses sock puppets to role play a conversation between herself and her husband, and she has to play the scene in a long shot.  At least they gave her that much.<br /><br />There are plenty of chuckles in "Meet the Fockers," but with the basic story being the same and the main jokes being the same, it has to be less than the original.  Only having Hoffman and Streisand on board breathes some real energy into this sequel and when you find out that they were improvising a lot of their scenes that only underscores the inadequacies of the script.  I am sure the cast had fun making this film, but it really should have been funnier on this end given all the star power assembled in front of the cameras.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>This film is, as many may already know, the sequel to the 2000 film called "Meet The Parents" in which Greg Focker (played by Ben Stiller) struggles to get the approval of his girlfriend's father (played by Robert De Niro). Teri Polo does a good job of playing Greg's girlfriend, Pam Byrnes.<br /><br />In the sequel it is now time for Pam's parents to travel to meet her boyfriend Greg's parents. Predictably, the two sets of potential in-laws couldn't be further apart. Greg's parents are a throwback to a commune-type 1960's relationship while that is hardly what Pam's parents are about.<br /><br />The film is well cast and that's a treat: Barbra Streisand plays Greg's mother; she is very funny and keeps up her part of the jokes! Dustin Hoffman is Greg's father, Mr. Focker; it's great to see him, too. He does a fine job. Robert De Niro of course plays Pam's Dad and Blythe Danner plays Pam's Mom.<br /><br />Without spoiling it for you, there are numerous funny moments that will entertain you if you keep in mind that this is a somewhat amusing comedy. Some of the jokes could be considered crude by some people but then again the title is a hint at that!<br /><br />I would recommend that you go see this movie for some fun, light hearted entertainment. It may not be the very best comedy you'll see ever in your entire lifetime, but it's one of the better ways to overcome a dull afternoon!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>Normally, sequels try to disguise the fact that they are simply attempting to create the same profit from a cheap remake of the original.  They do this by trying to retain the chemistry of the first film, while providing a new plotline for the characters to travel down.  MEET THE FOCKERS, on the other hand, fails to provide even the smallest bit of originality.  What the producers of this film have done is take the same characters, overdeveloped them a little, and forced them to run down the same plotline.  I'm serious.  One gets the impression while watching this movie that they simply erased MEET THE PARENTS from the original script and inserted "FOCKERS."<br /><br />Of course, the film is not entirely without merit.  On the plus side, MEET THE FOCKERS takes itself a little less seriously.  While Stiller's parents, played by Hoffman and Streisand, are quite over-the-top and ridiculous, they have moments of rational clarity and insight that prevent their characters from becoming outright annoying.  Unlike the Byrnes' family, who is seemingly unaware of their ticks and flaws, the Fockers are aware of their quirkiness and I enjoyed that aspect of the film.<br /><br />While I found myself laughing at certain points, however, this sequel was more painful to watch in a variety of ways.  De Niro's character, Jack Byrnes, is difficult to watch in MEET THE FOCKERS.  In the first film, Jack came across as uptight and conservative, but generally a rational (if not overly-rational) man.  In this film, however, Jack just comes across as a heartless jerk and we are no longer convinced that Stiller needs to pander to his sensibilities, for anyone who does so would be equally soulless.  Finally, the film did not know when to end itself.  The last 30 minutes drag on at an unbearable rate and I could not wait for the film to end.  In summary, if you liked the original, you might want to check out this sequel.  But I have a hunch that it will disappoint you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>Meet The Fockers is one of the funnier films in 2004. With an all star cast, this is a sequel that is about as good as the original. Streisand and Hoffman have great comedic talents, just ones that have not always been shown in the past. The cast is key to this, as they mesh well and that's what makes this a funny movie, along with a mildly funny script.<br /><br /> You really need to see the first in the 'Meet' series to understand the whole plot and all the humor in this one. The Fockers aren't quite your oridanary family, as Mrs. Focker is a senior sex therapist and Mr. Focker is, well, sort of a hippie. As the same couple from the original prepare for their wedding, the in-laws still haven't gotten to know each other. What follows is an always entertaining comedy that flows well and never really seems contrived or anything. Owen Wilson has a great character role, although brief. Even the pets are funny. I'm looking forward to buying the DVD this week, and at the very least, I think you should at least give it a try and check it out. 4.5/5, although more of a 5 than a 4.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>`Meet the Fockers' means meeting Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. That's all you have to know, and that's the best part of the film, of which script is utterly lame, and of which set-pieces are not as funny as they should be. But the Fockers, I mean, the husband and wife played by Hoffman and Streisand are so lovable, silly, and most of all, believable that you can forget all the unnecessary part of the film, and enjoy yourself watching the vintage comic acting from the couple.<br /><br />Greg, no, Gaylord (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Teri Polo) come back as the lovers who are going to marry soon. This time, they have a bigger problem than before, and that is that they have to introduce the uptight father of the future bride, ex-CIA agent Jack to the parents of the Fockers. And the two Fockers house husband Bernie and sex therapist Roz (Hoffman and Streisand) are far from ordinary parents, who can casually talk about the `first time' of their much, much beloved son at the dinner. And to Greg's dismay, they are truly enjoying the embarrassing conversations.<br /><br />And it is only natural that Jack find them a lot more embarrassing and even rude when ex-hippie Bernie makes fun of CLIA (L stands for `lack of') right before the proud Jack. The ice never breaks between the two families when they pretend it does, and the awkward relations, which get more and more awkward as the story goes on, are seen in the center of the comedy.<br /><br />Unfortunately however, the script never gels. It has sparks sometimes, but clearly we see misfires oftener. There are several reasons for that ineffectiveness. Ben Stiller and Teri Polo do not look like a couple loving each other, and there are too many familiar kinds of gags involving toilet, dirty words, and a baby. To me, the greatest problem is that all the set-pieces are tired retread of `Meet the Parents.' Instead of volleyball in the original, you see football. If a cat is not good enough, there is a dog. And I admit Robert DeNiro is good, and I can say he is as good as in the first one, but don't you think that he is doing too many comedies these days?<br /><br />But the couple of Hoffman and Streisand is a different thing, special gift from these veterans. They almost single-handedly save the film from the uninspired mess with their hilarious comic acting. The actors themselves may not be your favorite, but you should forget your liking or disliking for now, because these parents are so charming and credible. Especially Dustin Hoffman does one of his best performances in recent years. Probably the character of Bernie is so close to his own that some seem to say that the way Hoffman keeps on bubbling funny nonsense is exactly the impression we have about him during his interviews, and you can believe their words simply by watching the extraordinary but likable character he plays. Obviously Hoffman is in his element.<br /><br />Despite the weak script and the weaker husband-wife descriptions of Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner, `Meet the Fockers' is better than I expected. Of course, that does not mean very much when I usually don't expect much from the sequels. But the family of `The Fockers' of the film's title are genuinely fun to see, and I am ready to revisit their home, even if I  didn't find the film itself particularly great.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>TWO-HOUR SITUATION COMEDY AT ITS FINEST!<br /><br />This is a terrific modern comedy with a classic theme. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand brought added chemistry and welcome diversity which really helped this character-driven sit-com. Whereas "Meet The Parents" had numerous funny "gags" and a lot of comedic tension, "Meet The Fockers" takes embarrassment to a new level for Greg Focker. Although this movie is 115 minutes long, there is hardly a dull moment. I have already viewed this DVD about 15 times.<br /><br />Yes, the film does resort to some cliched, overused themes, some of which are a bit vulgar and may even be offensive to some viewers. However, the enormous credibility that the all-star cast brings, and delivers, to this sprawling situation comedy, more than makes up for the predictable silliness, and occasionally irksome crudeness that sometimes gets tiresome.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />The sound and visual quality of this widescreen DVD is about what you would expect from a new big-budget release ... about perfect. It does contain quite a few features that I found interesting, but the extended version option was by the best of them. Although it does make the movie 150+ minutes, it adds some new insights into the characters and their motivations. One such extended scene depicts Greg with the father of the boy that Jack wrongfully believed was his Greg's son. Of course, Ben Stiller played the very odd, minor league baseball coach meeting Greg [himself]. Sure it's a cliche, but it was funny. There were also deleted scenes and bloopers. They were mostly okay, but some seemed contrived.<br /><br />There are three behind-the-scenes featurettes: one about the baby wrangler's role (pretty interesting), another about the mammary gland prop, and the third was titled "Inside the Litter Box" and was of course about that darn cat, "Mr. Jinx". The featurettes are a little over the top as features go, but it is, after all, a comedy.<br /><br />After viewing the movie and all the features only one question remains in my mind (as well as in the mind of many others, I'm sure.) ... Will they all return in yet another sequel, "MEET THE LITTLE FOCKER"?</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Now that Gaylord Focker has met his in-laws, he must introduce them to his parents, the touchy-feely, let-it-all-hang-out duo played by Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman.  She is a sex therapist and he is a stay-at-home dad, in contrast to Gaylord's in-laws, the former CIA straight arrow (Robert DeNiro) and his long-suffering wife (Blythe Danner).  There is potential for humor here, but unfortunately the movie-makers go to the lowest common denominator and choose to saturate the film with tasteless sexual innuendoes and bathroom humor.  There are a few funny moments, but unfortunately they come all too seldom in this star-studded flop of a movie.  Take my advice, and skip this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>While this is not as good as the first movie, ("Meet the Parents"), this movie does a good job of carrying on the Focker story from the first movie. It also has to be said that the first movie would have been a seriously hard act to follow.<br /><br />The story line is pretty similar to the first, with a few differences thrown in to spice things up. While it is not as gut-wrenchingly funny as the previous installment, it is actually a very good laugh.<br /><br />Robert De Niro is his usual best being the cold and paranoid Jack Byrnes, with his "circle of trust" thing. He is brilliant in the "fish out of water" role as Jack struggles to cope with a completely alien environment. Stiller is still putting on an excellent act as Gaylord Focker, and does well in a role that changes through the movie. I won't spoil the changes, but just add that it is good to see.<br /><br />I must add that Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand really rock as Gaylord's parents. They are truly hilarious and completely the opposite of the Byrnes, (some interesting developments there, too, as the movie goes on). Streisand is remarkably good at comedy, something which I had not guessed she had a talent for, (I have not seen many of her movies before). With Hoffman and Streisand, the makers cast the perfect people for the role of the Fockers. They were simply brilliant, and were superb in every crazy way.<br /><br />This movie is one that you will not regret seeing. It is funny, at times touching, but also just mighty good comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though my stomach did not hurt as much as it did with "Meet the Parents".</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's DVD movie came out of our storage rack. My wife probably bought it and we probably watched it about 6 years or so ago. It's an easy-to-forget movie and I forgot and watched it again. Unfortunately. "Meet the (Sorry, mentioning the name gets my review dropped)" would seem to have a lot going for it. The cast consists of mega-stars. The production values are high. The music is by Randy Newman. This thing should be a smashing success. Well, perhaps it was at the boxoffice, but as a home movie it's one of the lamest comedies I've watched in the last decade.<br /><br />The story involve a man and his fiancee, together with her parents, as they go together to meet his parents in a trip by motorhome. The man's last name is unfortunate hence they go to meet the parents and relatives as the name of the movie says. Get it?  Well, believe me, as a comedy it's all downhill from here. The basis problem is, of course, it just isn't funny. The name grows wearisome after the second use, and wait, there's another 50 times or so. Those with a middle-school- level humor will get a lot of laughs. Using the name in this review has gotten me in censor problems twice so far in submitting this review and I don't consider it a bit funny, the name or the censorship. Anyway, I guess other people do, at least the name. The supposed jokes among the two families and their meetings are embarrassing, not funny. None of the acting generates a feeling of fun and belonging. Even the pets aren't funny, although they come the closest. I sat in disbelief as this non-funny comedy slowly unfolded. It seemed overly long and I thought it would never end. Well, what can I say? I suppose in every great star's list of movies, there's a few turkeys and this is one of them for quite a few people. Hoffman and Streisand, in particular, must be embarrassed to be credited with this bomb.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br></body></html>

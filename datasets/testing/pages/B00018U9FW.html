It has fun with the history of rock, its cliches, and even race, privilege and mone all at the same time.  Black plays a down on his luck rocker named Dewey, who poses as his best friend to be a substitute teacher at a posh private school, filled with kids who know more about Handel than Hendrix.  Dewey changes all of that by making his class believe that there is a state-wide project that involves all schools to form a rock band and battle it out.  <p>And the kids Dewey meets along the way all turn out to be gifted musicians, as well as fodder for some of the funniest comedy to come along this year.  His band is made up of an Asian (on piano), African-Americans (back-up singers), and stiff white guys (on guitar and drums).  But the "School of Rock" has a sweetness and a genuine nature about it that transends race and heritage, not to mention the kids in the movie are immensely talented.  The child actors (those who had to) learned to play their instruments, and they do a damn good job too.  Black once said in an interview that he was kind of embarrased to be surrounded with kids who were better musicians than he was.  But Black really shines in sequences where director Richard Linklater lets Black cut loose, trashing MTV, poking fun at Einsteins Theory of Relativity and letting ad lib the a scene that coincides with the closing credits.  <p>While its still in theatres, treat yourself to ...<p>  "THE SCHOOL OF ROCK!"</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>One of the first things that struck me about School of Rock is how refreshing and totally original the movie is. Casting Jack Black was also a wise choice as he's perfectly suited to the kind of over-the-top characterization that the role demands. The film is an ode to rock music, while also emphasizing that one must never give up on one's dreams. Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a dreamer, but he's also a washed-up and self-confessed looser who has only one goal in life, and that is to become a rock-and-roll superstar.<br /><br />Things, however, aren't going very well for Dewey - he's fired as the lead singer of a second rate rock band, and his pussy-whipped roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White) - along with Ned's angry, snotty nosed girl friend - are hounding him to come up with some rent money. In desperation, Dewey finds himself posing as Ned and going to work as a fifth grade class substitute teacher at Horace Green Prep. School. Of course, Dewey has no teaching experience, but that hardly matters, because when he overhears his students' in music class, he rapidly elects them as his new band and turns each class into a secret rehearsal session leading up to a Battle of the Bands competition. Dewey gradually befriends the kids and teaches them lots of valuable lessons<br /><br />The movie flies along and comical situations abound, as Dewey must play "being teacher," while also trying to keep his new band a secret from the anxious school principal Rosalie Mullins (played with comic sparkle by Joan Cusack), from the children's snooty parents, and from the other teachers. The children are an absolute delight and each of them brings their own individuality to the film. There's also much fun to be had as they form the marvelously winning bond with Dewey. The children are the highlight of the movie and are probably the most natural and likable young ensembles in film memory: Miranda Cosgrove is totally irascible as band manager Summer, Joey Gaydos is cute as lead guitarist Zack, Kevin Clark is suitably spunky as drummer Freddy, Rebecca Brown is adorable as bass player Katie, and Brian Falduto absolutely riotous as the effeminate band stylist Billy. Although Jack Black's energy and antics do get a little tiresome after awhile, there is still much to enjoy in this enjoyable comic tribute to "old time rock and roll."

Sure, parts of this film are funny, but it's never so funny that I can't hold back the laughter.  In fact, for every critic and fan alike who scream this as being one of Black's greatest film roles (there was even talk back when this was released of his performance being `Oscar' worthy) I'm left a little confused because to me he's done much better than this.  Black does have his moments, but it's never enough to really convince me that he's award worthy.  To me it's nothing more than an amiably funny performance.<br /><br />The film follows Dewey Finn, played by Black, a down on his luck guitar player who never stopped following his dream even though it left him broke, friendless and pretty much considered a loser by his peers.  Being behind on his rent and jobless (recently being booted from his band) Dewey steals the identity of his roommate and takes on a sub-teaching job at a local elementary school.  Dewey of course has no idea what to do with these children, that is until he finds out that they are all insanely talented musicians.  Wanting to compete in `The Battle of the Bands' he decides to form a band within his classroom disguising the idea as a school project for next quarter that they are getting a leg up on.<br /><br />The plot of course follows the same formula of `dork uses people, everything goes great, dork is exposed, dork learns lesson, everything is great' that most comedies of this persuasion find themselves pigeonholed into, but it's still fun.  The musical numbers are by far the more entertaining scenes in the film, especially at the end when they perform at `The Battle of the Bands'.<br /><br />Some have mentioned that Black steals the show, but I strongly disagree.  To me it's Joan Cusack, the school principle, who steals every frame.  Cusack is probably my all time favorite supporting actress.  She makes even the unwatchable films worth the time.  Here, as the uptight principle she is just completely on mark the whole time.  She's quick witted, funny and intelligent, a brilliant actress.  Sarah Silverman also adds some character as the only real villain in the film, playing Dewey's roommates battleaxe of a girlfriend.  She's funny in that irritating yelling `want to sock her in the mouth' kind of way, which I didn't expect from her.<br /><br />All in all this is not a bad film, it is funny, but it lacks originality, and to me Black is just not that wonderful.  He serves his purpose (that of playing the dim witted idiot who learns a life lesson as well as teaches one) but any other comedian could have pulled this off, maybe even better.  Black is no Ferrell or Carrey, but he does succeed in making the general public laugh, most of the time, and here is one of his more polished roles (as in not much gross humor or unnecessary crudeness) so it should appeal to most in the family.  I may not completely agree with the praise heaped upon this film, but I can't argue with the fact that it did make me laugh and didn't leave me sour.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Black is his usual over the top self in this very funny crowd pleaser. The supporting cast of kids and adults in the film are great. Throw in some catchy rock tunes and a whole lot of zany situations and you've got one of the best comedies of the year. The original release on DVD has a very good transfer and some very cool extras including excellent commentaries which make for some interesting repeated viewings of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Lighthearted, warmly entertaining fare about a ne'er-do-well loser (Jack Black) who masquerades as a substitute teacher and ends up turning his class into a rock band, all the while finding that he is good at something as he bolsters the self-confidence of his charges and really teaches everyone (including himself) about teamwork. He thinks quickly, acts on his feet-managing to keep the rock band project afloat despite suspicions about his "unorthodox" teaching methods, diverting the principal's attention from his true intentions while preparing his students for a talent show. A good story about coming into your own, accepting who you are, even when the results are not what you expected.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>This movie is a really fun film for the entire family with lots of music and plenty of laughs.<br /><br />Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a loser; he even gets fired from his own band because he can't control his ego and wants the entire limelight. His roommate has grown past the rock and roll life to become a teacher and along with his uptight girlfriend they barrage Dewey with all sorts of negative inspiration forcing him only to withdraw. But then one day a phone call arrives that inspires Dewey into action and he finds himself employed as a substitute teacher at a reserved private school. With a class of brainy nerds awaiting direction Dewey has nothing to offer except music.....and so the story unfolds. Dewey takes this class of intellects and turns them into a great kid's band despite the watchful eyes of the school headmistress Ms. Mullins (Joan Cusack).<br /><br />Jack Black is funny just watching him exist in all that hyper energy he possesses but in this movie he gets to also show his stuff around music. Although he is sometimes irritatingly crazy most of the time he is really great in this role as a teacher that knows absolutely nothing. Joan Cusack joins Black as the comic relief in this film as the rigid school marm with a secret passion to be Stevie Nicks and flaunt herself in a rock and roll band. The kids are also great in this film in fact almost musical geniuses playing their own instruments as well as pulling off wonderful acting roles. Everyone can watch this movie and find something to enjoy and it's a great motivator for all the losers of the world who just want to play rock and roll....rock on!</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>"School of Rock" is a great comedy starring Jack Black and Oscar nominee Joan Cusack ("Working Girl" 1988, "In & Out" 1996).  This film desplicts Dewey Finn (Black) who's struggled tremendously for years to become a famous rocker.  After he is fired from his band, he poses as a substitute teacher and uses his brother's name.  There, he begins a new rock band with a twist.  The fellow members are kids in his class.  Finn and the class must keep this a secret to prevent this act from being exposed to the school board and the community.<br /><br />Though the film is cheesy in numerous scenes, its comedic form makes the film details fit well to one another.  Through the music and the laughs, this film remains unique throughout.  All the details give new comedic meaning to rock music: the quotes, the personalities, the costumes, the performances, and others.  This desplicts accurately the life of a true struggling musician while adding a one-of-a-kind entertaining theme.  All performers add their own sense of plot throughout the film, especially Jack Black in his Golden Globe nominated role for Best Actor in a Comedy Film.  This is in no doubt his career's best, which he proves he was "made for that role".<br /><br />"School of Rock" is a great comedy for viewing pleasure of a variety of audiences.  Some may not rock music the same after watching this.  Fans of this film and/ or Jack Black should also listen to his rock band Tenacious D.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Jack Black is awesome in this movie.  I didn't think he would act in a better movie than Shallow Hal, but boy was I wrong!  Not only does he beat that performance, he beats it ten-fold.<p>I loved everything about this movie:<p>The plot - Rock and Roll freak kicked out of his band an needing rent money, and a way to get back into a &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; contest, happens upon the chance to earn cash posing as his roommate and begins teaching at a private school.<p>The FUN - A cast of great kids combined with an amazing script.<p>The background - A school where kids aren't allowed to be kids.<p>The Message - Chasing your dream is NOT a waste of time.  In fact, doing so, can make time stand still...if only for a moment.  I just thought that up, pretty good huh?<p>G.B.<br />www.therunninggirl.com</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>When this was out in 2003 for some reason I wasn't psyched to see it at all. However, now that I've sat down and watched as much of the movie as I could (while taking bathroom breaks and such) I must say it was hella worth it! School Of Rock is a funny, relatable and heartwarming film about big dreams, taking chances and having fun. Jack Black is your typical "loser" who is in a band that is going nowhere financially. Everyone tells him that he should take life more seriously and get a real job. So he does--as his friend! He applies for a job at a private prep school for young kids and instead of teaching them the basic subjects most schools teach he engulfs them in a pure rock music frenzy! He unleashes the inner Freddie Mercury and Tina Turner in all of the boys and girls in the classroom.<br /><br />Throughtout the movie he gives each of them roles in the band and some of the members even learn self-confidence and to get along better with their fellow classmates. It really is a great movie and one that I would hate to see negative reviews about simply because I thought it was an awesome guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Enjoyable to the brim.<br /><br />4.4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>SCHOOL OF ROCK (2003, 110 minutes) may not necessarily be labeled Jack Black's premiere film, but I found it lots of fun. I had never seen this oft-mentioned film; I have to say I was confused even at the middle of the film. Its comic value is fantastic and the children are all stunning performers ... I just had to ask myself what message the film was trying to convey.<br /><br />Briefly, Jack plays Dewey Finn, a washed-up has-been middle-aged rocker who is fired from his own band. So far so good: that could have been a terrific, biting satire base right there. But then he hornswaggles a gradeschool with his best friend's identity as a substitute teacher, in order to make some money. He ends up subbing at a prestigious prep grade school. He teaches the kids how to 'rock out' and appreciate the music. A bite of satire aimed at MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS and a well deserved one at that.<br /><br />But I had to ask myself: since it is pure satirical comedy, does there have to be a message? When it has a cast that is 98% children, then yes, it needs a meaning. Even a silly film has to tell us what they are trying to say about children and our relationship to children. I realize the excellent satire and social commentary in the film, but it just isn't that strong. Jack Black displays his genius here that later landed him so many great film roles.<br /><br />Aside from reliving a few memories from the oldest of the rock music, what was this? A parody of DEAD POET'S SOCIETY? A shot at the first two HARRY POTTER movies that had already been released by this time? An ode to rock-n-roll (which you can't really do with children this age)? What was it?<br /><br />The only balance to the genius of Jack Black was Joan Cusack, who displays here her own bulging comic genius so much that I felt Jack kind of shrinking in her presence a little. That was fun.<br /><br />And why so many questions about the message here? Well, this is a fun family film but I found Black's antics a bit much and perhaps not for everyone; rock music is not everyone's cup of tea; the message about education seemed way off also. It left me wondering just exactly what it was I had seen.<br /><br />Besides being a hilarious comedy classic. This one I leave to your judgment, but I can tell you there are usually far worse films out there with a PG rating. And this is vintage Jack Black.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Dewey Finn (Jack Black) gets kicked out of his band for being a grandstander.  If he doesn't find a job, his roommates are going to kick him out of the apartment.<br /><br />He intercepts his roommate Ned's call to substitute at a private elementary school and shows up instead.  He's bored with the gig and doesn't do anything til he discovers that some of his class have exceptional musical talents.<br /><br />Next thing you know, he's got himself a new band and they're practicing for the band competition.  What's great about this film is that Dewey realizes he can't just have the non-musical classmates off on the bench.  He's got to find jobs for everyone--and in so doing, uncovers hidden talents and unites the divided class in purpose. The film may be a comedy, but there are some serious lessons to be learned for educators everywhere.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>I saw this on Cinemax in my hotel room in China. It stars Jack Black and Joan Cusack, with some cameos from some folks you'll recognize, and some talented kid actors. I was actually pleasantly surprised by this film. With Jack Black, one has this preconception that it's going to be over the top, but the film is rather understated. Essentially this is the story of an out-of-money rocker, who poses as his teacher friend and substitutes at an exclsuive school in order to earn some cash. He ends up turning his young class into a rock music class, teaching the kids about rock, and forming them into a band as a class project. Along the way, he becomes a better person, though it's only apparent in the little touches along the way...and he makes his students realize their potential as well. When his cover is blown, all heck breaks loose, but the band goes on to compete in the local Battle of the Bands anyways.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>Penned by Mike White, Directed by Rick Linklater and starring the Jack Black Attack, (the) School of Rock is a successful combo of hilarity, rebellion, and rock'n'ruuuwwwwlll!<br />  From Jack Black's 200-pound-ball-of-pain belly dive at the opening to that at the end, from Sunshine of Your Love to The Immigrant Song, SOR takes Spinal Tap to the next level (12).  Black plays a rock'n'roller who gets a job subbing for the country's top grammer school by pretending he's Ned Shneeebly (sic).  He takes over the class and teaches them the ABCs of Rock.  The talented kids are all great as they learn the lesson well of how to stick it to the man.<br /><br />  And behind all the humor there's a serious message.  Rock'n'Roll explodes at a time of societal rightwing oppression.  Rock has been the way for half a century, the way to tell the man to "step off".  Whether "the man" is oppressive parents, teachers, or other disciplinarians who rule our oppressive society.  But there are some cracks in that oppression and that's where rock comes in.  So turn on this 5 star movie and LET'S GET ROCKIN'!  Ahh-aaahh-aaaaaaah-AAAAHH.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>&quot;School of Rock&quot; was written by the increasingly prolific screenwriter and actor Mike White.  Here, White shows that such eye-openingly good works like &quot;The Good Girl&quot; (with Jennifer Aniston) and the critically acclaimed &quot;Chuck and Buck&quot; were no flukes.  For the first time since &quot;High Fidelity,&quot; Black is given material that suits him.  Credit White for writing and building a movie around Black's talents.  And if you think that sounds easy, go talk to makers of &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; and other Black miscastings.<p>From an acting perspective, there's Black above all others.  White modestly stays in the background.  His girlfriend Patty (Sarah Silverman) is pretty much a one-note shrew (that's the role written for her).  Joan Cusack is great when she appears - her little moment gathering herself alone in a hallway in face of an onslaught of parents is the movie's one bit of dramatic acting.  The kids are really superb.  I assume that's really them playing those instruments.  There's none of the tricky camera work when musical fakery is involved (shots of the head, shots of the hand).  You get full body shots - guitarist Zach (Joey Gaydos Jr.) expertly working the chords, keyboardist Lawrence (Robert Tsai) dexterously working up and down the scales.<p>As far as Black is concerned, I don't think this is acting at all.  This role appears to be him to a 'T'.  Credit Mike White for envisioning a really cute, smart movie around that thought.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Not as funny as normal Black movies, but it does have a big heart. predictatble but still fun.

Desperate for cash, he poses as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. But Dewey doesn't know the first thing about teaching, so he's at a loss for anything academic to do. When he learns that many of his 5th-grade students are accomplished musicians, he decides to give these straight-laced kids a lesson in rock-n-roll. He turns the class into a rock band, complete with road crew, a security detail, and groupies. The whole class pitches in to get the band in shape to compete in the city's Battle of the Bands.<p>&quot;School of Rock&quot; was directed by Richard Linklater and written by Mike White, who also plays Dewey's roommate Ned in the film. This movie is just a lot of fun. It was tailor-made for Jack Black, so it perfectly exploits his over-the-top sense of humor and physical comedy. &quot;School of Rock&quot; manages to pay tribute to rock-n-roll while making fun of its more histrionic and self-indulgent clich&eacute;s. It's all in good fun, though. Jack Black is funny and lovable as a reckless rocker who has unwittingly taken on considerable responsibility. Joan Cusack contributes one of her many memorable comedic performances as the uptight principal of the school, Miss Mullins. The child actors who play musicians were themselves chosen for their musical talent. Thankfully the film doesn't fake the kids playing the instruments. They are all accomplished musicians, and it's nice to see so much young talent on the screen. Young members of the audience will be encouraged to see that real kids can rock too. &quot;School of Rock&quot; is a lot of silly fun -but in a good way. It's a movie that both children and adults can enjoy. (By the way, in most parts of the world, this film got a G or PG rating.)<p>The DVD: This is a nicely loaded disc. Bonus features include a making-of documentary called &quot;Lessons Learned&quot;, &quot;Jack Black's Pitch to Led Zeppelin&quot; is which he begs the band for permission to use the &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; in the movie, a music video for the film's theme song, &quot;Kid's Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival&quot;, &quot;MTV's Diary of Jack Black&quot;, a DVD-ROM (Windows only) that contains Dewey's History of Rock and an archive of the film's website, 2 audio commentaries, and a theatrical trailer. &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; is a decent documentary, and it features interviews with Jack Black, Mike White, Richard Linklater, and some of the kids. Jack Black fans will like &quot;MTV's Diary of Jack Black&quot;, which spends one day in L.A. with the actor as he goes to rehearsals for the movie and works on new material for Tenacious D. One of the audio commentaries features Jack Black and Richard Linklater. It's entertaining, but there isn't much technical stuff if that 's what you're looking for. The other audio commentary features 7 of the child actors. It's chaotic, but it's interesting to hear the kids' point of view. One of the funniest things is that they've memorized all the punch lines from the movie. If you're interested in the kids, also check out the &quot;Kids Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival&quot;, which follows the principal child actors for about 12 hours on the day of the film's screening at the Film Festival. Subtitles are available, for the film, in English. And dubbing is available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>This was a script written for Jack Black... comic zaniness mixed with loads of classic head banging rock and roll. No doubt the hidden basis for this movie was so that Black could play his own music. Writer Mike White (Ned Schneebly in this film) nailed Jack Black (Dewey Finn) to a tee. The story follows Dewey shreading on a guitar solo (just a tad long and over done), and being exiled from the band the very next day. His roommate (Ned) and annoying girlfriend (Patty - played perfectly by Sarah Silverman) get on his case about responsibilities and paying the rent. Dewey receives a phone call at home one day (meant for Ned)... the high priced private elementary school needs a substitute teacher. Dewey acts as Ned - and the fun and musical fusion begin. This movie is a &quot;toast to those who rock!&quot; The main kids in the band, Zack-Freddy-Lawrence-Katie, are all accomplished musicians in their own right and were picked to play their roles for just this reason. Not to mention Joan Cusack was a great pick as Priniple Mullins. Musical tributes to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin abound. If you're a Jack Black fan, as well as a classic rock fan - I guarantee you will truly enjoy this film. Extras on this DVD include often funny commentaries with Black as well as the kids; a short pitch to Led Zeppelin for permission to use a song in the movie, trailers and a music video. Ever since Black was able to let loose in John Cusack's &quot;High Fidelity&quot;... I just look forward to everything he does.

His roommate's controlling girlfriend wants Dewey kicked out of the apartment. That all changes with a single phone call. Dewey pretends to be his roommate Mike (Mike White) and takes the job of substitute teacher at a private school. Dewey soon discovers that teaching is much harder than playing air guitar. The competitive kids appear restless and ill-at-ease doing nothing. Dewey has no luck recruiting for his new band. Until he discovers his class practicing classical music in the music room. An idea blooms full blown like a bad heavy metal song. The kids will be HIS backing band. <p>An inspired collision of indie sensibilities and Hollywood, the delightful &quot;School of Rock&quot; finally gives the talented performer Jack Black both a role he can sink his teeth into and one where he can demonstrate the chops he's honed as a member of Tenacious D. Black looks like a demonic Joe Cocker (prior to the beard of course) or Angus Young (AC/DC) after an eating binge. Black literally lights the movie up from within due to his infectious energy and humor. The screenplay by co-star Mike White (&quot;The Good Girl&quot;) was written specifically with Black in mind. Indie director Richard Linklater doesn't go the easy route; he makes Dewey into a likable slob who misleads, manipulates and twists everyone around so he can obtain his goal. Ultimately, Dewey is undone by his roommate's girlfriend otherwise he would have taken the charade all the way to the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;.<p>Like &quot;The Commitments&quot; (the film this most closely resembles), &quot;School of Rock&quot; is at its best in the sequences where Dewey works with the class. Joan Cusack dives right into the heart of the uptight principal Rosalie Mullins and the scenes between her and Dewey are delightfully funny and charming. The best sequence between them involves Dewey asking her out for a drink so he can get her drunk. He's hoping to talk her into letting him take the kids out on a field trip (really the audition for the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;) by getting her to sing along to Stevie Nick's &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;. It's a crack up to see Cusack belt out the song in the biker bar that Dewey takes her to. The kids in the movie all give great performances. They appear natural and clearly are having a ball playing their roles as well as the instruments in the movie. <p>The extras on the disc are exceptional. They include Jack pleading with Led Zep to let the film use &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;; the MTV Jack Black special as well as a very funny commentary by Black and director Linklater (plus a separate audio commentary track by the kids from the band). There's also a web site archive, the trailer, a video diary about the Toronto Film Festival and other great stuff.<p>When you watch &quot;School of Rock&quot; you'll want to rock on with Jack and the kids!</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>School of Rock will forever embody what Jack Black may have been, if not for a little band known as Tenacious D. <p>In a world...

It's fitting that the movie is filled with blatant AC/DC worship, because it's very much like one of that band's albums: it's excessive and often lowbrow, but you can't help but enjoy it because it's so full of energy and enthusiasm.  And most importantly of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Whether intentionally or not, director Richard Linklater and co. deal a major backhanded slap to all the sissified nu-metal and post-grunge "sensitive guy" bands currently dominating the airwaves, reminding us all that rock music is supposed to be fun and ultimately uplifting.<p>First of all, if "School Of Rock" doesn't make Jack Black a star, nothing will.  Black gives one of the most lovably over-the-top performances in history as Dewey Finn, an aspiring metal musician who poses as his friend Ned in order to get a substitute teaching job at a posh elementary school.  From the opening scene at a rock club, where Dewey launches into a frenzied guitar solo, whips off his shirt, and attempts a stage dive into an apathetic crowd, Black is a whirlwind of manic energy.  Much like Jim Carrey, Black doesn't just play the demented role: he means it, and the authenticity he brings to the movie makes all the diference.  Quick, think of another guy who could pull off the role this well.  This is Black's show, and he knows it.<p>When Dewey takes a position teaching the uptight children of uptight parents, the stage is set for a classic fish-out-of-water comedy.  Many of the movies' funniest moments come early on, when the overweight, disheveled Dewey and his privileged students can't quite figure out what to make of each other.  The plot?  Realizing that some of his students have musical talent, Dewey, under the guise of a school project, gets them to start up a rock outfit to compete at the local battle of the bands.  Along with the way he teaches them plenty about the history of rock and its value for, among other things, "fighting the man."  Naturally, the kids, their parents, and the school's principal (played by Joan Cusack, who would steal the movie if Black didn't), all learn valuable lessons about taking chances and enjoying life.  <p>This plot may sound rather hackneyed, but "School Of Rock" doesn't succeed by avoiding cliches; it succeeds my embracing them with all the vigor and passion of Dewey playing a guitar solo.  The movie's overbearing earnestness, which I typically find to be more of a turnoff than a woman with bigger muscles than me, turns out to be its greatest asset.  The reason?  Because "School Of Rock" conveys the too-often-forgotten lesson that people need to lighten up, and rock music has long been a valuable device for doing just that.  At its heart, the film's message is simple but enormously effective: that Rock 'n' Roll really just might be able to change the world.<p>It all comes to a head in the film's monster conclusion, with Dewey donning an Angus Young-styled schoolboy uniform for the Battle of the Bands.  Black absolutely owns the stage in this scene; there's no way the image of him performing won't be indelibly etched in the minds of all who see it.  If you know your stuff, you can also see the nods to Yes and The Clash in the kids' attire.  The song the band performs, fittingly titled "School Of Rock," is a lot like the movie itself: it's filled with rock cliches, but its youthful rebellion and energy more than make up for it.  It certainly beats much of what's on the radio today, just as the movie beats much of what's in your local multiplex.  Sometimes good intentions and inspired acting can carry a film, and "School of Rock" is one such example.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>School of Rock is a great movie with perfect Jack Black and an excellent supporting cast, most of them kids.  Dewie Finn gets kicked out of his band and must find a way to pay the rent.  When he intercepts a phone call for his substitute teacher roommate, Ned, Dewie decides to take the job.  At first, he has no idea what to do, but when he discovers the kids in the class are great musicians, he decides to turn them into a band.  Along the way, Dewie gets to know them all while also teaching them the history of rock.  This is a great movie that surprisingly can be seen by the whole family.  Jack Black has never been better, and the kids are amazing.  If nothing else, the soundtrack is great with plenty of Led Zeppelin, The Clash, Black Sabbath and so much more.<p> Jack Black is perfectly cast as Dewie Finn, the down on his luck musician who takes a job as a substitute teacher.  His eyebrows and facial expressions could not be done by anyone else.  Joan Cusack is also very good as Principal Mullins, who tries to keep her school in order.  Mike White and Sarah Silverman also star as Ned, Dewie's roommate, and his evil girlfriend.  The real stars of this movie are the kids in Dewie's class.  They are all incredible performers as well as pretty good actors.  With all these things combined, School of Rock is a can't miss movie.  For a great movie with hilarious Jack Black, check out School of Rock!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I really had heightened expectations for &quot;School of Rock,&quot; because I tend to really like movies where people find an excuse to get up and play songs.  Besides, there was such good word of mouth on this film as well and I liked Jack Black's performance at the end of &quot;Shallow Hall.&quot;  This time around Black plays Dewey Finn, who has been kicked out of the rock band he created because he tends to confuse his commitment to the power of rock 'n' roll with the gratification of his own ego.  He cons his way into a gig as a substitute teacher for a fifth-grade class at a private school and as soon as he finds out some of these kids can actually play instruments he start turning them into a rock band.  The goal is to go head-to-head with his old group and beat them into the ground at the upcoming Battle of the Bands.  He also gives his cherubs an education in rock, mainly because he is so appalled at their lack of knowledge.  <p>Granted, there is a certain predictability to the plot here, but &quot;School of Rock&quot; does not fall into a similar trap with the characters.  Dewey does not get changed in the process as much as have his eyes opened to what is happening when you really collaborate in creating music and playing in a band.  In simpler terms, he starts practicing what he has been preaching.  As for the kids, they follow their rock 'n' roll Pied Piper's lead but they also are more than willing to stand up and get in Dewey's face.  <p>I actually wanted more of a rock education for the viewing audience.  There is a nice little scene where Dewey has laid out a constellation chart of rock groups on the board, but instead of hearing him lecture we get the music on the soundtrack turned up loud.  Old viewers will of course recognize the names that Dewey drops throughout the film, but I kept thinking it would be nice if there were a few choice instances where Dewey drove home a couple of key points to the kidlets.  In other words, do with words what is done with music when Dewey teaches the kid who plays guitar the riffs for &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love,&quot; &quot;Iron Man,&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water,&quot; or the keyboard player the opening of &quot;Touch Me.&quot;  <p>You can guess what is happening at the end, but that does not take away from the overall sense of fun, especially for younger viewers who will enjoy the fact the kids are all doing their own singing and playing.  I have just been comparing such musical grand finales to the end of &quot;Uptown Girls,&quot; and I find this one to be okay (the song was not up to the kids).  There are some efforts to take advantage of Joan Cusack playing the head of the school, but she really is underutilized (I was expecting more off of the Stevie Nicks reference).  These things just underscore not only that &quot;School of Rock&quot; could have been better but that we really would have liked this 2003 film to have made it all the way to the next level.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>You may not like Jack Black -- he is always too noisy, and often too annoying.  And in "School of Rock" he never changes -- the same old JB, who hangs around in your room only with underwear, who doesn't pay his share of rent.  But "School of Rock" is a different thing.  He is still loud, OK, but this time that makes the film better than you expect.<p>Because you know this guy Dewey Finn played by Jack Black, after all, turns out a charming fellow among the likable kids.  JB's Dewey, in need of ready cash, disguises himself as a substitute teacher in a posh prep school (run by uptight principle Joan Cusack) and instead of math, he "teaches" the spirit of rock'n'roll to the children.  Of course, it won't take long before they enter the Battle of Bands, leading us to rousing finale.<p>You may not like Jack Black's character at first, but as the film goes on, he starts to show unexpected side to his personality.  The monetary motive turns into genuine passion, and that is no news in Hollywood, but it is rarely done with such an energetic and hilarious performance as that from the leading actor.<p>The kids not only can play the instruments, but also they can act, and many of them are given due moments to impress us.  Also great is Joan Cusack's comic acting, perhaps better than that of the sexually repressed fiancee in "In & Out."  Now her character here has something repressed deep inside -- which is again related to music.  Her turn (supported by a glass of beer in a bar) is simply wonderful.<p>The script by Mike White ("Chuck and Buck") who was JB's next-door neighbor knows how to extrect the better side of Jack Black's super-turbo comic turn. and though the story is not particularly unique, the result is a great success, especially when it shows the relations between the "teacher" and the students.  And director Richard Linklater ("Tape" and many others) does not show his trademark off-beat feelings -- his handling of the material is surprisingly traditional, and that also helps greatly.  <p>And most of all, this film is good-hearted, and is not afraid of showing that on its sleeve.  You can enjoy watching it with the good soundtrack, and when JB tries to teach the kids the riff of "Iron Man" and many 70s classic rock, you can feel his love of music.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>When this film was over I just hit the start button and watched it again!! This is a joyous film that makes you feel great.  Jack Black is so talented and physical--like an overgrown kid.  Putting him with a group of children is a wonderful device.  Just sit back and enjoy this funny tale of how a man who loves music finally finds his niche--as a teacher!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>I didnt think it was gonna be a good movie but I was wrong it was funny and had alot of heart.  Jack Black is hilarious in it as ususal.  Sarah Silverman is hot.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>A big, fun, good-natured romp for Jack Black who plays an unsuccessful musician turned substitute teacher who ends up teaching a bunch of uptight prep school kids how to rock out. The cast is excellent, the kids are adorable, the script is really well written. My only regret is that the hilariously edgy comedian Sarah Silverman was given such a limited role as the shrewish girlfriend. But aside from that, I highly recommend this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>What I mean by that is, it isn't completely homogenized. You're going to have to talk to the kids after the film to make sure they don't rebel against you.  Sure, it has plenty of good messages and humor mixed in there, but it doesn't hold down the subversive spirit of rock, which is envigorating.  Certainly the film is humorous and inspirational, but the plotline makes it sound like self-absorbed loafer dupes people into doing something that he couldn't have done himself and is forgiven. In other words, there's such a levity to serious subject matter like this that some people don't even realize how wrong Dewey's motives are. I have to give Jack Black and Richard Linklater credit because I don't think that anyone else could have pulled it off.  As for the DVD, it's excellent.  It captures the adult perspective of Black in the making of featurette, commentary, MTV's Diary of Jack Black. It also captures the kids who are broad draw for the film in the featurette, Toronto Film Festival Diary, commentary, and a portion of Jack Black's diary contains footage of them rehearsing songs for the soundtrack.  This DVD captures all the perspectives that you would like to see as a filmgoer who loves the film, like me.  Mike White, thank you for writing this for lovers of Black and Rock.  Extra points for acting in the movie as well, you were perfectly cast. That is all.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>It is just absolutely amazing to see how suddenly Jack Black has emerged into the public eye despite a relatively lengthy career in films. It was his hysterical performance opposite Colin Hanks, Tom Hank's son, in Orange County that brought him fully into the mainstream spectrum but amazingly his feature film hasn't been confined to the comedy genre. Since his first appearance on screen in 1992, Black has appeared in such solemn features such as Waterworld, Dead Man Walking, and Enemy of the State. Hollywood soon became aware of the inspiring comedian when starred in the Farrelly Brothers comedy, Shallow Hal, and then the irreverent comedy, Saving Silverman. Now Jack Black's future is bigger and better then ever before with superior roles in three films in 2004: Envy, Shark Tale, and Anchorman. Not only that but Black's metal parody band, Tenacious D, has the potential to be another successful vehicle for the rising star, as his leading role in The School of Rock shows he has the enthusiasm and the look of a real rocker.<p>The story follows an out of work rocker who takes a substitute teacher position at a preppy grade school to get back at his former band members who dumped him from the band. Dewey Finn knows everything there is to know about the history of rock n' roll. He knows every band, every instrument, and every chord ... Rock n' roll is in his blood. The only thing he doesn't know is when to act mature. During a major band performance, Dewey goes off on a twenty guitar solo and acts in a way that not only embarrasses the band but himself as well. Dewey's fellow band members are fed up and, without any other choice, decide to vote him out of the band. With the pressure of his buddy's girlfriend to pay his share of the rent, the fledgling rocker impersonates a substitute teacher and takes a position at an uptight private school. Upon discovering the musical talents of the fourth graders he is placed to educate, Dewey decides to enter the group into a battle of the bands contest that pits the youngsters against his former band mates. Through his senseless antics and irreverent attitude, the children soon learn to break out of their shells and be who they want to be. The story for the School of Rock is decently played out but for the most part the plot is pretty predictable which takes away some of the emotional feelings you might have for the situation and/or the characters. In a film that preaches the message of breaking away from the conventional, School of Rock contradicts itself pretty easily.<p>The cast is pretty minuscule but that doesn't matter too much as the feature relies solely on the energetic performance of Jack Black, which is all that truly matters for this film. If you are not a fan of the work of Jack Black then you are going to have a hard time tolerating this film but even if you are non-partisan in the matter, you aren't exactly going to be rolling in the aisles laughing either. It's not that Black's performance isn't funny, it is, in parts, but for the most part his crazy antics come off as being more annoying then anything else. Joan Cusack is greatly under used in this film and it was rather disappointing to see the filmmakers not exploring the relationship more between her character and Black's.<p>Overall, The School of Rock reforms the school of thought on the conventional family film but not so much so that it will spark a new trend in Hollywood. It's not that the feature isn't entertaining, it is. The problem is that it is nothing more then that. The feeling this film leaves you with is hard to describe, so here's the best way one can put it: If you are at a buddy's house for a night with your best friends and the School of Rock is the film of choice, you won't exactly try to weasel everyone out of watching it but you wouldn't exactly be jumping for joy either. Despite a decent performance from Black, delightful performances from the children, and a rockin' song selection, the entire feature film, in the end, just feels flat. The message of the film also seems a bit lost as it preaches a break away from the conventional but at the same advocates children to fight against "the man" or authority, which is definitely a wrong message to send to the young children of America. There are enough problems out there with children disrespecting their parents, school administrators, etc. without this film sermonizing the message of deviance of authority. This may not be the exact way the filmmakers may have intended but it does come off that way. Bottom-line is that School of Rock will do as an entertaining diversion but nothing you essentially need to see before more worthy features like Lost in Translation or Matchstick Men.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>I enjoyed every minute of this film.  Jack Black is on fire in this one.  Mike White's script is very very strong and well written as I would have expected.  Linklater's direction is spot on throughout particularly in the scenes involving the music.  The kids are astonishing.  All of them should have gotten some kind of ensemble award.  This is a very entertaining film that is definitely worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>What is there not to like, for an old rock `n' roll guy or gal at least, about a film with a story line about a down and out fanatic grunge rock musician who is down on his luck and then, by odd happenstance, gets a "temp" job, under false pretenses, teaching at a preppie private elementary school. And , of course, along the way it turns out the young students were really not looking to get ahead on the fast track to college but were really hiding their "inner rock" being under a bushel, that of classical music. Needless to say said rocker teacher throws out the book, gets the kids to lighten up and enjoy life a little, and maybe get a chance at rock stardom for themselves and, not coincidentally, him as well. Moreover, needless to say as well, those well-to-do parents paying large fees and authority figures responsible to those parental whims, especially one stern headmistress, do not see to see with this rock-driven  program. But all is well in the end as kids and rocker survive one more obstacle in the ordeal of childhood. The only thing that I need to add here is that actor, Jack Black, carries this thing with his energy, his facial expressions and his non-loser "loser" approach to the role. That said, just rock on.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I received this as a Christmas present. I've been meaning to write this review for quite some time, but I never got around to it, because I watch this movie on tv whenever it comes on. This movie is extremely hilarious, and has an awesome storyline. Jack Black stars as a rocker named Dewey Finn. When Dewey is kicked out of his band, he tries to find a job so his roommate won't kick him out. When his roommate, Ned Schneebly is called to be a substitute teacher, Dewey impersonates Ned in order to make some money. When he hears his fifth-grade class in the music class, he comes up with an idea to start a new rock band. During class, Dewey has them singing, and rocking out to try and win Battle of the Bands. I highly recommend SCHOOL OF ROCK!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Jack Black usually plays unlikeable characters, and he starts out here true to form. Fortunately, for us, he has a revelation and the result is no end of fun and good cheer. This low-life slacker comes to terms with his own ability to shape young minds burdened with the typical teen-angst, such as bullies, insecurity, non-understanding parents, self-esteem and the like (which he seems to naturally understand). Mr. Black is absolutely absurd in his approach, and it's the kids who inspire him to be a better person. The success of this film is largely due to wonderful direction from maverick director, Richard Linklater; "The School of Rock" takes off and flies high. The very able support of Joan Cusack is not to be forgotten. What I found most intriguing about the film is that each kid has a story to tell, and you find yourself cheering for the kids. The story doesn't say a lot about what happens to Black's character, but you know these once up-tight kids are going to be fine. Jack Black is the lead, but the kids are the real stars. This is a great feel-good movie. I'm glad I rented it. The DVD extras are fine.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>Being a fan of Tenacious D and having seen some of the twisted stuff jack Black has done in the past, having him in a movie full of small children is at first off-balance and slightly sinister.  Is this the guy that wrote FHG?  Is this the twisted dude that stared in the short-lived HBO series about being a lunatic rock demigod suffering in obscurity with his bro K.G.?<br /><br />Well...sure it is, but a kinder, gentler Jack Black, like the one we glimpse in King Kong and saw so long ago in Shallow Hal.<br /><br />Sponge extraordinaire and underground rock God in training Dewey Finn is struggling with his band and his muted rock genius as well as his roommates new girlfriend who wants him to stop sponging and start paying some rent.  He gets kicked out of his own band for his onstange antics and ultimate lameness.  Things really suck.  A phone call from a Prep School for his roomie Ned is intecepted by the Finn and bingo, the plan is hatched.  Horace Green needs a substitute teacher for a few weeks and Dewey needs some Benjamins (money).  How hard could it be?<br /><br />Dewey become Ned and takes over a classroom full of overachieving brainiac Yuppie larva.  Boredom ensues until, by chance, Dewey overhears his students wailing away in music class.  What is going on?

Time for a little class project.<br /><br />School of Rock is charming and funny in all its little ways.  Jack Black is insane and hysterical and filled to the brim with rock lore.  My kids and I both liked it.  Is it the greatest movie ever?  No.  Is it quality entertainment.  Probably.  Who really knows what passes for quality entertainment anymore.

He has just been kicked out the band that he was playing in so he accepts a job as a subsitute teacher in an exclusive school.There he soon learns that the young boys and girls have a lot of musical talent so he forms a band. Jack has got good taste in music. He likes AC/DC and Black Sabbath and Motorhead and has no time for the junk that passes for music these days.Rap music is not even given a mention. No doubt Jack is of the same belief as me that Rap was invented by some no talent guy who couldn't sing but wanted to be a star anyway. Jack informs his students that the purpose of playing Rock music is "to stick it to the man" which I agree with. Just watching this movie made me want to pick up my 1971 Gibson Les Paul Recording Guitar and try to shatter a few windows. This movie has fine acting, a great cast and a great rocking soundtrack .

Personally, I thought it was hilarious. I enjoyed it tremendously. Jack Black confirmed his "God" status yet again to me. I think this was his best movie yet. Giving Jack Black a starring role in a movie about rock music was the single best decision made by Hollywood in 2003. Needless to say, I was stunned, and even after the movie was done, I stayed and watched the end credits sequence. The reason this movie worked was because although it was aimed primarily at children, it was *NOT* a kid's movie: it was a FAMILY movie. That is, everybody, young and old, male and female, smart and stupid, could enjoy it. If you were a kid, you got some funny physical humor with nary a flatulence joke in sight (thank GOD)! If you were an adult, you got some funny subtle music references. And the peculiar thing is this, my friends: this movie worked on multiple levels. If you wanted just straight-forward, good-natured comedy, you got it. If you wanted an inspirational story that sends a good message to kids, you sure got it. If you wanted a movie that kicks MTV in the face and glorifies REAL rock music, you definitely got it. This movie is about a lot of things, and it isn't preachy or heavy-handed, nor does it have stupid plot twists (I was very happy that one of the kids didn't end up with cancer or break their arms or something). I was surpremely enthralled with this movie, and I bow down at the altar of Jack Black, for bestowing his glory upon yet another quality work of cinema. The only gripe I have is that it would have been nice to see just a *little* more tension between the kids' parents and Jack Black, especially towards the end, but hey, it was still a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>I avoided seeing this movie, bacause I<br />thought it would be corny.

The movie is a showcase for Jack Black, who proves with this comedy that he can be a very good lead actor in comedies.<br /><br /> The plot isn't specially original, but the rock soundtrack and the original music in the movie are EXCELLENT, also a lot of jokes and rock references are simply great, for instance, check out the AC/DC guitarist (Angus Young) impersonation, or Peter Townshend's trademark arm swing when a kid plays the guitar, or when Jack Black rolls in the ground while playing a guitar solo, like Jimi Hendrix did.<br /><br /> The kids actually are real musicians, and even though they are very young, they show an outstanding talent, also Jack Black is a very skilled musician and a charismatic singer as well, both Jack and the children perform their songs.<br /><br /> During the movie, we can hear songs by groups that built the foundations of rock music, the music includes rock legends like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, AC/DC, The Who, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Metallica, among many others, as well as a lot of great references to artists like Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and Yes (by the way, check out the rock history diagram drawn in a blackboard, it's a great detail).<br /><br /> Rock aficionados will enjoy &quot;School Of Rock&quot;, as well as Jack Black fans, but the movie is funny enough to appeal to most of the people.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>Things aren't going well for Dewey Finn (Jack Black).

The kids, musicians found in band camps and similar venues, do a great job, while Joan Cusack as the school's uptight principal, and White and Sarah Silverman as Dewey's roommates, never hit a wrong note.<p>Directed by Richard Linklater (Clerks), the film is paced well, thoroughly enjoyable, and filled with great music, culminating in a great Battle of the Bands and a fun jam session over the closing credits.<p>DVD extras include a terrific commentary track with Black and Linklater (too bad White is missing); a commentary track with the kids; a 25-minute behind-the-scenes featurette that shows how funny Black is and how close the cast was; an hilarious pitch by Jack Black to Led Zeppelin; a music video; trailer; a 16-minute MTV diary; an 8-minute video diary of the kids at the Toronto Film Festival; and the film's awesome History of Rock chart, unfortunately available only to Windows users.<p>The film is great fun for the whole family, Black and his supporting cast are terrific, and the dvd extras rock!

If Chris Farley were alive today,he would have been perfect for the character of Dewey Finn,portrayed by Black. Farley played characters like Dewey,semi-obnoxious but kind. The film was written by Mike White who plays Dewey's buddy and roommate Ned Schneeblee. The most famous of all is Joan Cusack who is Rosalie Mullins,the principal of Horace Green Elementary School. Dewey,a heavy metal band's frontman is fired from the band and worse,is threatened with eviction from his apartment that he shares with Ned and Ned's girlfriend. To pay back rent,Dewey,who had shaved off his beard,takes a teaching position at an elementary school where Ned teaches also. After Dewey arrives,using his buddy's name,the classroom is definitely not the same! The kids in the class aren't learning math and English much anymore. Dewey teaches each kid how to play the guitar and keyboard. Before too long,loud,hard rock is emerging from the classroom. This is brought to the prncipal's attention after receiving a complaint from another faculty member. Dewey and the kids hide all the evidence before the principal enters the classroom. After Ned receives some kind of notice in the mail regarding something that he really wasn't involved in,he takes action,with the help of his girlfriend,by sending the police to the school during a PTA meeting,which there are many infuriated parents. Here's where Dewey discloses his real identity. He did the wrong thing for the right reason. But,now all the kids are talented musicians in their own right and are performing in a talent show with Dewey as the School Of Rock. The principal and the angry parents arrive at the performance way too late. There's also one scene where Dewey and the principal go on a date. Black played an awesome character in this film,I must admit. Hey,can you imagine Robin Williams in a film called "School Of Comedy",teaching kids how to be foul-mouthed stand-up comedians?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This movie flat out rocks on every level. This is by far Jack Black's finest and funniest on screen performance. He is pitch perfect and contains more than enough facial expressions to make even Jim Carrey happy. All the kids acting abilities are really great as well and would have hurt the film if they weren't in it. I made the mistake of renting this for $4.00 on Tuesday night, loving it so much that I bought it at the store for $16.00 today. So my advice is save the rental cost and put it towards the purchase of the outstanding rock comedy!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a passionate musician that is dumped by the band that he once started and is in financial quandary as he cannot pay the rent.  Desperately Dewey assumes the name of his roommate and accepts a job as a substitute elementary school teacher for the states best private school.  However, Dewey has no interest in teaching, until he finds out that the students are exceptionally skilled with a number of musical instruments.  This leads to Dewey to initiate a secret school project that includes playing and learning about rock music.  School of Rock is an interesting comedy that displays how an exceptional teacher must love what he or she is teaching in order to engage his or her students.  Linklater grabs the audience in a very uplifting cinematic experience, which is full of wonderful jokes and shenanigans.  This film should be recommended viewing for teachers as it can salvage their desire to teach and help youth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>As long as you're okay with a bunch of 10-year-olds joining hands and praying to the God of Rock (with a pretty Church of Satan-like prayer, to boot), then this movie is light and fun family fare. (Hey, at least they're praying, right?)<p>What works about this movie is Jack Black.  There is something demented about him that fits his lead role perfectly.  You get the sense that he's whacked in real life, and while he might not try to turn prep schoolers into rock stars, he just weird enough to make it possible.  But he is also part of what is wrong with the movie (a small part, but still ...).  There are moments where he just makes you want to cringe from all his weirdness, like when he sings a song he wrote to the class.  It goes on way too long and is, well, creepy.  Not good weird, but sad weird.  Because like his character in High Fidelity (a much better performance, I think, in a much better movie), Jack comes across like a guy who is, deep down, a sad, alienated loser; a guy who sits in a subway doing word search puzzles--maybe homeless, certainly dateless, and maybe a bit cranky.  And smart.<p>As for the rest of the film, the child actors are okay.  Nothing to write home about, but at least they're not cringeworthy.  The rest of the cast basically mails it in, but that's okay since Jack is a one man army.  So raise your goblet of rock and see this thing; you'll be mildly amused.  Which is more than okay.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>Oh, how to best convey the majesty that is Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock', starring Jack Black and Joan Cusack? Maybe I could say it rocked? Nah, too obvious. Maybe I could talk about the music? Nah, anyone can see what the soundtrack was just by looking at the relevant IMDb page. Maybe I should say how guilty yet excited I feel to have enjoyed this movie far more than all the arthouse stuff and Oscar-bait I've seen this year - but that makes the film seem like a guilty pleasure, and there's nothing wrong with holding your head up high and saying you love Linklater, Black, Cusack, writer Mike White and co-star Sarah Silverman.<br /><br />Or maybe - just maybe - I could say that when I got in last night, I still felt charmed and elated and deliriously happy by the spell that this movie - this silly, sentimental little commercial movie - had cast on me. This is a feel-good movie where the feel-good ending is actually the best part, rather than a syrupy, predictable letdown. The characters have damn well earned that happy ending, and you want them to get it so badly, even as Linklater adds enough grace notes of harsh reality to let you know that our heroes may not succeed. And he sells you on this, too.<br /><br />Up until recently, the playfully philosophical Linklater's most mainstream movie was his glorious 70s ensemble comedy 'Dazed & Confused' (1993). Dewey Finn, the central character in this movie, played by Jack Black as an even goofier extension of Jack Black, feels like one of the kids from that movie all grown up - or rather, not grown up. Dewey still believes in the power of rock to change lives, to change the world, even - but The Man has ground his spirit down. Many reviews note how Mike White's script doesn't really seem to believe in the power of rock as much as Dewey does, and it's true that 'School of Rock' is hardly an underground missive from the scene like, say, Alex Cox's rock films are. But that's intentional. Dewey is adrift without a 'scene' to back him up, and he slowly has to accept that no, there's nothing he can do about the fact that The Man rules the world. All he can do is build his little corner of it.<br /><br />And build it he does. Dewey's audacious plan is to pose as a substitute teacher and use the kids under his tutelage to form the most rocking band who ever were - The School Of Rock - and blow his old band off the stage at the Battle of the Bands. What's good about the kids is a microcosm of what's good about the film - the audience never laughs at them, always with them, and their appreciation of music is sincere and unaffected. The kids are non-actors (like the kids in Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund's 'City of God') chosen for their musical ability, and it's a joy seeing their fingers dance dexterously around a panoply of instruments. They rock, too - so many movies about music are brought down by the unremarkable nature of their fictional bands, but if School Of Rock were a real band, man, I'd buy their CD in a heartbeat.<br /><br />The other good quality shared by the kids and the movie is this; they both know their stuff, and while adhering to the structure of a formula comedy, enough esoterica and clever parodies are thrown in to tickle even the most [...] of rock lovers. The references can get as obscurely hilarious as the countless operas, wines and psychology in-jokes in 'Frasier': it just deals in a different area. So we get Dewey waxing lyrical about the keyboard solos on Yes songs, film clips of Angus Young and Keith Moon are shown without spelling out who they are for the audience, and the winning band at the climatic Battle sound hilariously akin to inexplicably popular post-grunge whingers Staind.<br /><br />'School of Rock' captures the giddy excitement of being young and cocky and creative like no film I've ever seen; it features the best performance to date from Jack Black, a whirling, borderline-psychotic, hilariously hammy tornado ripping through the film; it allows the frequently underused Joan Cusack to be funny and even sexy within the confines of an 'authority' role; it is the best film about rock and roll since 'This Is Spinal Tap' and it succeeds in transporting Linklater's style, imagination and vital humanity into the mainstream without compromise in a way that, say, the Coen brothers have yet to do. Everyone involved should give themselves a pat on the back, or better yet, a big, sweaty, post-gig group hug.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>If you like movies like this, or musicals then you might be sure to like &#34;School of Rock&#34;, in which stars Jack Black, or is it &#34;The School of Rock&#34;, I don't know. Also staring in the film is Joan Cusack, and when you add a room full of kids, how much more do you need? But do you really need to be a fan of Jack Black to enjoy this movie, and I don't know if you can call this film a family film since it is rated PG-13. As the movie opens, Dewey Finn (Jack Black) loves music, and plays with his band, which he takes long solos and dives into the crowd, but during a concert me makes a dive, but falls to the ground, and the next morning he is woken up by his roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White) and his bossy girlfriend Patty (Sarah Silverman), who wants Dewey to pay his share of the rent, but he doesn't have him, and he owes his room mate 2,200 dollars, and has no way to pay him back, for I guess back share of the rent. She tells him that he has to come with the money by the end of the week, or he will have to move out. Dewey advice his roomate to dump her, but Ned doesn't want to because he is afarid that he may never have another girlfriend again. Ned works at a substitute teacher, that he working to become a cetrifed teacher, and then his band decides to take the upcoming band of bands, seriously, and they fire him, and replaces by the time he finds out. And Dewey is mad to hear that he band has decided to vote him out of the banbd, so he decides to form a new one, even though he if the founder of the band that kicked him out of the band, then a call from a Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack)  who is the  principal of a prep school named Horce Green, lookingo for Ned who came reccomend by a person from another school, to sub for a teacher name Mrs. Dumbam when she falls, and brakes her leg. Dewey shows up to the school pretending to be Ned, and takes the job. At first he tells the kids to have ressces, nad tears down dermit sheet, and tells the kids there will be no grades, gold stars or demits. And the next day, he just sleeps at the desk, until one of the students wants to learn from the teacher, but when Dewey discovers that the kids can play music, he turns the classroom into a studio by the time that they come back from music class, and soon everybody has a job in a class project, and he puts 3 of the studnets, including one of th student Summer (Miranda Cosgrove) groupies, but she finds out that her job is to sleep with the band, I get from an on;-ine disctory, this is what groupie means:<br /><br />Main Entry: group?ie<br /><br />Pronunciation: 'gr&uuml;-pE<br /><br />Function: noun<br /><br />1 : a fan of a rock group who usually follows the group around on concert tours<br /><br />2 : an admirer of a celebrity who attends as many of his or her public appearances as possible<br /><br />3 : ENTHUSIAST, AFICIONADO &#60;a political groupie&#62; &#60;golf groupies&#62;<br /><br />And then Dewey/Ned gives her a promtion to band manger, and puts her in charge of everything. Now if Dewey reall is the founder of the band that kicks him out, why doesn't he disband the band, I don't know.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>The School of Rock has potential; the kids were cute, and the movies gets funnier each time you watch it, but, it is a movie that is more serious and tries to be funny.

I would say rent this movie before buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Jack Black, hmm he was funny in a superior movie, High Fidelity, so I kept hoping he'd find something where his &quot;in your face edgy style&quot; would work, but alas, it does not work in School of Rock. This movie was not funny from start to finish because the &quot;Black&quot; shtick is wearing thin. How can this comedian play the same slacker over and over. He has no range at all. Hey, Bob Hope is overrated too. Also, the idea that smart kids learning nerdy stuff like classical music and algebra are creativly inhibited and unhappy is so completly wrongheaded, I couldn't bear to watch the poor little tykes go punk. Children should have the basics in youth. If they want to be rock stars and get laid, they ought to wait till they're at least 13. This movie is just wrong and Black has jumped the shark.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I watched this movie with a bad attitude coming into it. I thought it would be a stupid and weird movie but when a friend brought it over, I watched it to be polite and to say it quite frankly, it rocked! Wow, was I surprised but it was some great fun and good laughs.<br /><br />The movie is about a rock star who is mad becuase he gets kicked out of his group. He then after getting a phonecall, takes a job as a substitute teacher for 5th graders. And when he learns that they can play musical instruments, he trains them to compete in a competiton where he hopes to beat his old band. The movie is quite simply fuuny and is also just really fun. You'll like all of the kids but you'll especially like Jack Black who was great. This is no brainer rent and a worthy buy as it's fuuny, interesting and really cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"School of Rock" has been called formulaic, predictable, silly, etc.  What it hasn't been called is boring or uninteresting.  That's what makes this movie so great.  Even though you pretty much know what is going to happen through all of the film, you enjoy every minute of it.  From Black's idiotic Dewey character to his outrageous scheme to find lost rock glory, this entire film entertains.  With a solid supporting cast and brilliant young actors and actresses, this film is worth the price.<br /><br />Much like with "Shallow Hal," Black shows us that being the geeky kid or the quiet kid or the chubby kid doesn't matter as long as you believe in yourself and enjoy what you do.  Black takes a bunch of kids with insecurities and turns them into a group of confident youngsters who rock with the best of them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really great feel-good flick that most of the family can enjoy.  There is a little language, but other than that, Black keeps the movie pretty clean.<br /><br />I recommend it to folks who like classic rock, family comedy, or the erratic stylings of Jack Black.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>THE SCHOOL OF ROCK is about a man named Dewey Finn who just won't "grow up."  Dewey has been doing odd jobs the last several years, living off his roommate and best friend, all so he can keep playing with his band and eventually get their big break. Then, one of the younger members of the band has a mutiny and kicks Dewey out. Dewey is despondent and after being seriously threatened to be thrown out of his apartment, he takes a job as a substitute music teacher at a high class private school pretending to be his roommate. Dewey gets the bright idea of getting the kids to be his new band and the musical hilarity begins.<br /><br />THE SCHOOL OF ROCK is implausible and is predictable (almost completely). However, it's also highly amusing and entertaining. I am not a huge fan of the rock music that is triumphed in the movie. Despite this, I was able to enjoy the movie and it's soundtrack. Jack Black is at his finest.  Also, Joan Cusack is perfect in her role as the strict principal, Rosalie Mullins, who longs for a little bit of love and friendship. The kids in the film are a joy to watch and the play off of Black's manic energy with an eager glee that the best of performers would have a difficult time dealing with.  The movie doesn't have any violence or foul language, though there are a few crude jokes and references to drug use. Rock on, man and stick it to the man.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EZMV5DSWU8TU.html">A1EZMV5DSWU8TU</a><br/><p>I don't know how many of you are familiar with the career of Jack Black, but I first became acquainted with his work through his musical project &quot;Tenacious D&quot; through a friend, and have received much amusement from his antics since then. inclusive of collecting all downloadable music including rare and hilarious pieces like &quot;Sasquach&quot;, &quot;Spiderman&quot;, and a vocal version of the Star Trek theme - all of which they do perform at their concerts, incidentally. I was initially attracted by the cover featuring a rendition of Tarot Card # 15: &quot;The Devil&quot;. When it comes to music, as anyone will inform you, Jack Black loves to, above all, ROCK. He tends to focus on the rather exaggerated and epic aesthetics reminiscent to that of the Spinal Tap and KISS spectacles with a musical bent partial to Led Zeppelin and AC/DC in particular with a contagiously exuberant effervescence and comedy-style conducive to an eternal man-child, which is always a pleasure to observe, and with the right person, even participate in.<br /><br /> Now the lokian jester has Quang Jin Fong Amanahoed in another film {for those unfamiliar, he has also been an actor for a number of years, acting in primarily bit parts in releases such as &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; and &quot;Saving Silverman&quot;} named &quot;School of Rock&quot; in which he plays a musician in need of some quick money - but being unemployed and recently ousted from his own band, who were basically jealous because he frequently &quot;stole the spotlight&quot; with his prolonged guitar solos and stage-diving antics; so from this, he seeks revenge upon those who did not appreciate his talent, subsequently garnering the cooperation of some 4th-graders to revive his Heavy Metal vision, by impersonating a &quot;Mr. Sneebley&quot;, his room-mate, disillusioned ex-band-mate, and substitute teacher, intercepting a call intended for him.<br /><br /> He eventually meets up with the Principal {Joan Cusack, whom you may recall as playing the role of the despicable &quot;Debbie Jilinsky&quot; from Addams Family Values}, and after a series of secret musical instructions, convinces her through charm and inebriation to allow his class to go on a specialized &quot;field trip&quot; for some Beethoven, but is really &quot;The Battle of The Bands&quot;. So after determining each student's talent, places them to participate in the aptly named &quot;School of Rock&quot;, and they perform marvelously despite the protests from horrified parents {who along with the Principal, learned that he was an imposter}, and a doubtful event promoter {whom Finn convinced to have them perform because they were dying from a rare disease - which sounded remarkably similar to &quot;stick it to the man&quot;}.<br /><br /> Quite a fun movie overall, and I also particularly enjoyed the ending sequence during the &quot;concluding jam&quot;, as it were.<br /><br /> The DVD includes a &quot;making of&quot; featurette , &quot;The Diary of Jack Black&quot; {in which he visits K.G. for an improvised session with the complete D!}, the kids' diary, the music video, previews, and an imploration unto Led Zeppelin, that they allow a song of theirs be included in the film, which it was.<br /><br /> So there you have it - the character of Dewy Finn and Jack Black are not at all too far removed, and this film works around his personality.</p></br><a href="../users/A7P9LPMSBAAME.html">A7P9LPMSBAAME</a><br/><p>Pretty much a normal Jack Black vehicle, but for the element of kids and opening the world of music to them and all the positive, life affirming changes that are a result of this musical education. Black is very good (for what it is) in this role. In the back story in special features, the director said he wrote this for Jack Black, specifically. Very few actors could have done as good in this part as Black. In real life, Black is an accomplished musician, and, I believe a nice guy that is still a kid at heart. That really comes across in this movie. And there are laughs. And the music is good. This movie is not, necessarily, a long term keeper, but I liked watching it and I would watch it again knowing I would like it again. I recommend it. GOOD JOB JACK.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Don't bother taking the movie seriously (Dewey apparently has no money for rent but money for closed circuit cameras and software) and just enjoy it as a fun comedy with good music and a perfectly-cast Jack Black.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>I caught SCHOOL OF ROCK on network television and was thoroughly entertained.  Jack Black stars as Dewey Finn, a down-on-his-luck rock musician who is out of work and out of excuses.  Well, with a little fast talking and identity theft Finn takes the identity of his zombie roommate and assumes the role of substitute teacher at a prestigious academy.  The kids he is to teach are expecting him to teach standard school subjects.  Dewey, a rock musician, is not prepared to teach them anything.  But, there is one subject that touches his soul--that is rock music.  It turns out that several of his students are musically inclined, and they end up developing a musical ensemble, while avoiding the suspicious unlooking of an uptight  school superintendent (Joan Cusak).  This is pure fantasy, but, Jack Black is a terrific physical comedian [comparable, perhaps, to the late, great Chris Farley].  The kids are hilarious and come from varying backgrounds and it's wonderful to watch Dewey bring them to life with music.  From what I have heard, this is one of the better Jack Black films.  I think that this is definitely worth a place in your NetFlix queue.  Very cute!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>School of Rock is one of those films that's tailor-made for the comedian performing in it.  This has become all the rage since Robin Williams played the Genie in Aladdin, Jim Carey in The Mask, or Will Ferrell in Elf.  These sorts of films play to the comedian's strengths and minimize their weaknesses, and when they get it right, it's movie magic.<br /><br />And so Black gets his moment in School of Rock.  Black's been playing the overweight guy pining for the good old days of rock like geeks pine over the original Star Trek series, with pop-eyed enthusiasm far outweighing the energy that most people muster for just about anything.  Black is truly the uber-music geek and the title is well earned through a film history of Black essentially playing the same guy: Bio-Dome (as Tenacious D), High Fidelity (as Barry), Shallow Hal (as Hal), and of course Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. In short, if there's going to be a film about kids learning about the pedigree of rock and roll, Black would be the guy who wrote, directed, and acted in it.<br /><br />What's surprising is that this movie ISN'T Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny.  As a music geek, Black's tastes for music could easily alienate much of the audience.  School of Rock isn't just about rock; it's about music appreciation, the lack of attention paid to kids in school, teacher malaise, and a society that no longer fights the Man.  Or to put it another way, this is a movie made for the mainstream.<br /><br />Which is what makes it so much fun.  Our slacker hero, Dewey Finn (Jack Black), has been crashing at his substitute teacher friend's house (Ned, played by Mike White).  When Ned's girlfriend (the lovely Sarah Silverman, playing a decidedly unfunny role) pushes for Dewey's ouster, the slob has to get a job.  And so he does, by impersonating Ned at a private school for upper class kids. It's not long before Dewey throws out the curriculum and teaches the kids his own brand of history: good old, wholesome rock and roll.<br /><br />School of Rock spends a lot of time struggling to justify the madness: the kids soundproof the room, teachers occasionally think they hear something, the uptight principal springs surprise visits (played by the delightfully naughty Joan Cusack), and parents start to get worried.  Just about none of it is believable, most specifically when Dewey is finally caught by the police and ends up dashing down the hallway, two guitars in hand, without any further consequences.<br /><br />But that's beside the point.  Who cares if School of Rock bends the laws of time and space to allow Dewey's one chance in the sun, not as a rock star but as the aging patriarch of a band of insanely talented pre-teens?  We came to see a rock show, and we get it.<br /><br />Black flops around, he sweats, he tosses his head with manic glee, but most of all he passionately TEACHES.  He teaches a large girl that her weight doesn't matter, teaches the geek that he should ignore the kids who make fun of him, teaches the brat some discipline, and encourages the brilliance of the lead queen bee to use her powers for good instead of evil.  He makes a difference with the kids by bringing what he knows best to the room; not school learning, but plain old-fashioned street smarts.  Dewey's, and by extension Black's, sheer enthusiasm makes up for his rough edges.<br /><br />If only teachers were this enthusiastic about anything these days!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Whether you agree with any given review of "School of Rock" is determined entirely by whether you are a fan of Jack Black or if you think he is the most annoying actor working today.  Full disclosure -- I love his work, just as I generally can't stand the films of Adam Sandler or David Spade.  (You realize that you really, really need to get a life when you realize you have just participated in a raging debate over the respective merits and flaws of "Joe Dirt," "Happy Gilmore," and "School of Rock.")<br /><br />In a role that Jack Black could play in his sleep, Black plays Dewey Finn, a slacker whose dream is to be a God of Rock.  (As a child of the 70s, I knew a few guys liks this -- the kind of guy who can't study for a history final but has memorized all the liner notes for every Metallica album.)  A talented guitarist who is too in love with the music, Finn is booted out of his band after too many 20-minute solos and unsuccesful stage dives.  And all just before a Battle of the Bands is scheduled, with a hefty purse.  In the life of Dewey Finn, this rises to the level of tragedy.<br /><br />To make matters worse, his best buddy's girlfriend has shrewishly demanded that Finn be kicked out of their apartment for the mere fact that Finn does not pay his share of the rent. Wonder of wonders, Finn intercepts a phone call meant for his buddy (a substitute teacher, whom Finn hilariously keeps referring to as "temping") from the uptight principal (Joan Cusack) of the most exclusive school in town.  Thinking quickly, Finn is soon on board as the substitute in his friend's place -- at least he can get the paycheck and keep his corner of the apartment.<br /><br />As can be expected, the class is a bunch of wonderfully cute, very talented kids who have all creativity stifled by the school and their uptight parents.  But in a fit of inspiration, Finn concocts a scheme to have these kids be his band (he will of course sing lead vocals and play lead guitar) so he can enter the Battle of the Bands.<br /><br />Here is where the movie takes off.  The kids all ring true, and Finn exercises a lot of creativity to make sure that all 20-odd kids have roles in the band, even if they can't play an instrument.  And the kids who can play an instrument or sing are pretty darn good.  In perhaps the movie's most touching component, Finn realizes that while he can teach these kids a lot about music ("Rock History," "Rock Appreciation and Theory," etc.), he can learn a lot from them, too.  And he doesn't learn sappy "lessons about life" -- he learns that these kids are gifted musicians who can teach him more about music, as well.<br /><br />As charming as the kids are, this is Jack Black's picture from start to finish.  His inherent mania for rock music is apparent in every scene, and Black may have the most devious set of eyes in film today.  Contrary to W.C. Fields, who said that no actor should ever work with kids or animals, Black is also very comfortable working with the kids, treating them with a nice balance of respect and disdain that seems very true to his character.  The delightful Joan Cusack gets some nice moments as the repressed principal with a Stevie Nicks fetish, but this isn't her meatiest role.<br /><br />A genuinely funny movie that has a conventional plot (is there any wonder whether these kids will get to play in the Battle of the Bands?), "School of Rock" is a fun entertainment.  Surprisingly kid-friendly (I expected more profanity) without being mawkish, this movie offers a good balance of cliche and originality that makes it worthy of the film library.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>I didn't see this movie when it hit the theaters but have always been surprised that my friends who are proabably the most 'jaded' of critics all seemed to like the film. Not in the sense that it is a MUST SEE FILM but rather that it's a very enjoyable 'escape from reality' ....<br /><br />OK so if its a menatl escape movie you really have to allow the writers some creative leeway that set up the story of a down and out rocker, Jack Balke, managing to get a substitute teacher position at a very very up-tight prep school run by the principal Joan Cusak. Both of them certainly carry the movie and make their roles believable. Similarily the director manages to maintain the prep school 'geek' persona of the students who form the band right until the very end when the 'school' band manages to make it to a battle of the bands rock concert ....<br /><br />Rather than being a laughing out loud type of comedy this is certainly a great great enjoyable feel good film ....</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>We enjoyed watching this as a family.  The kids enjoyed watching the kids stepping out of the roles of being just kids and having a lot of fun.  Jack Black is who he is and we find that pretty funny, but we can see how others might not.  And I think Joan Cusack makes everything she is in even better.<p>The kids in the class Jack Black is subbing for are all charming and do a fine job being transformed from a bunch of preppy uniforms into a rock band (of sorts).  Of course the premise is implausible and every objection you can raise about the reality of this film is probably true.  But I would reply that you might benefit from lightening up and just having fun.  I know we did.  We laughed and we enjoyed saying, "Yeah, RIGHT!" at the more ridiculous plot points.  This isn't supposed to be a serious movie.  It was just a fun time and you will likely enjoy it if you can get in the same mindset.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>If you love Jack Black, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, probably not so much, as it relies heavily on large doses of Black in the starring role as a grimacing, hyperkinetic ruffian bent on turning a bunch of fifth graders into punkish rockers.  Joan Cusack lends just the right amount of support as the uptight principal of the stuffy private school where Black's subversive activities take place. It's all great fun in a PG sort of way, but you really have to work hard at suspending disbelief most of the time. Thumbs up, but not WAY up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>Why does Jack Black keep getting lead roles in movies?<p>After reading the reviews here I was expecting so much more with this movie, but was flatly disappointed.  The kids were cute, yes, and Joan Cusack did a fantastic job, yes, but that was as good as the movie got.  Oh, and the jam session during the closing credits was pretty good as well.<p>First off, Jack's character (Dewey) was just unlikable.  There was nothing that had me rooting for the guy.  He was deceitful, greedy, and unloving.  Worst off, he just wasn't all that funny.  There was one scene that actually made me laugh out loud... but I laugh easily so this isn't saying much.  And it is most definitely not a reason to keep handing this guy lead roles.  Supporting cast... yeah, he does great there.  But lead role?  He is not of that caliber.  Leave that to the pros.<p>Second, the story was too unbelievable.  I can handle a little bit of make-believe, but this had you saying, "Yeah, right!!" throughout most of the movie.  Basically because you've got an IDIOT who dupes a school of geniouses into thinking he is the real thing.  If the top private schools were this easily dupes I would never have served detention in the public schools I attended.<p>If you are a Jack Black fan, then see this movie.  It is very typical of his other roles.  If you cringed through Shallow Hal, don't waste your time/money/patience on this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>I found this film to be extremely funny and worth repeated viewings.  Directed by Richard Linklater, who also did Slackers (1991), Dazed and Confused (1993), and SubUrbia (1996), The School of Rock (2003) stars the hyper-kinetic and unpredictable Jack Black in a role specifically written for him by co-star Mike White.<p>Black plays Dewey Finn, a dedicated rocker who believes he and his band are on the verge of greatness, their main goal to win a locale battle of the Bands contest, get the prize money, recognition and, hopefully, a record contract.  Problem is Dewey tends to 'rock hard' on stage, which his band members feel is clownish and not fitting in with the image they want to project.  Thusly, Dewey soon finds himself voted out of the band and out of a means of income.  To top things off his meek roommate, Ned Schneebly (Mike White) and Ned's overbearing girlfriend, played by Sarah Silverman, decide Dewey must move out due to his inability to pay rent.  When it rains, it pours...<p>Anyway, while pondering thoughts of his situation, Dewey takes a phone call for Ned, who is a substitute teacher.  An exclusive preparatory school needs someone to fill in, and on discovering the decent amount of money involved, Dewey pretends he is Ned, and takes the job.  What was going to be some quick money soon turns out to be more as Dewey learns that the children are musically inclined, and gets the idea to try and build a band around the youngsters, and compete in the upcoming Battle of the Bands contest.  He passes the idea off on the children as a secret school project, and thus their education into 'hard rockin' begins.<p>Jack Black is the star of this movie, no doubt, with his spastic energy and erratic nature, but he certainly has a lot of help with his great supporting cast including Joan Cusack as the principal of the school (I am truly glad to see her back on the big screen as of late all I've been seeing her in is annoying wireless phone commercials) and all the talented children that comprise his class.  I was happy to see the filmmakers decided on going with a cast of relatively unknown children, rather than `cutesy', overused children we've seen in many other films.  And these children can truly perform, not only with acting, but also with their ability with their respective instruments.  The story is pretty classic one, a grown up somewhat forced into involvement with a group of children who soon finds he having an effect on his students, and, in turn, they are having an effect on him.  Personal growth develops all around, and we all get the warm fuzzies.  While some of other films of this nature tend to get a bit schmaltzy, The School of Rock seems to narrowly sidestep it, and avoids the tooth decaying sweetness so often involved in a stories like this one.<p>And let's not forget the music...Led Zeppelin, Cream, The Ramones, AC/DC, The Who and many more.  I was glad to hear so many great, classic songs accompany the movie, enhancing the complete hard rocking experience that is The School of Rock.  <p>Special features are numerous, encompassing around four hours of material, but the best part for me was the inclusion of Jack Black's video pitch to legendary rock gods Led Zeppelin to use their Immigrant Song within the film.  Also included are separate commentaries by Black and the children, a video diary, trailers, interactive features, weblinks, a music video for the original song created for the finale, and more.  <p>While the plot of the movie is pretty far-fetched and requires the viewer to suspend a great deal of belief, it worked for me and was a truly satisfying way to spend an hour and fifty minutes.  If you liked Black and his musical abilities, you might want to check out his band, Tenacious D.  The CD and DVD are both available here.  I definitely look forward to seeing him in future projects.<p>Cookieman108</p></br></body></html>

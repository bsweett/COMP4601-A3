Although I tend to like most Johnny Depp films (esp Charlie Chocolate Factory etc...) and this film was visually amazing, in the end a good film is based on solid writing and solid acting... which this film sorely lacked in.  Bottomline, the movie seemed that it had everything going for it (special effects, the classic story, famous actors)... but it was just plain boring, I'm mean really boring.  Out of the three family members who started to watch this film, no one finished it.  Even my kid who waches almost anything, was so completely bored with this film that he just went on to do other mundane things.  Bottomline, if you value your time, skip this dud.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I had absolutely no idea Alice in Wonderland was so... dark, twisted, highly unusual and hypnotically colorful, haha.<br /><br />You see I never actually watched the original animated version because I was under the impression this was a Disney film intended exclusively for *girls* so I completely avoided it for years.  A blonde-haired little girl stumbles across a bizarre fantasy land, makes friends with many of the people, and instantly changes into a much bigger giant girl simply by drinking or eating something magical?  Yeah... not exactly what I would have considered a *cool* movie.<br /><br />Well, that all changed last night.  Hey, anything with Johnny Depp must be at least decent, right?  Well yeah... but it deserves a higher compliment than being tagged as simply "decent".  It's a really exciting adventure that's honestly a bit darker and more complex than I originally thought...<br /><br />That is, assuming this movie is exactly how the animated version goes storyline-wise.  I have no idea how different it really is to that (or any other generally accepted *official* version).<br /><br />The only thing I really know is that the animations and many unusual effects featured in this particular version of the popular childrens story are extremely psychadelically enchantingly... bizarre, haha.  No other possible way for me to describe its many vibrant layers of eye candy.<br /><br />I know one thing for sure- most of the characters are downright uniquely strange or ugly.  Talking soldier frogs?  A cat with magical disappearing abilities?  A queen that's unbearably unattractive?  A beautiful exceptionally white angel creature?  Two chubby vulnerable twin boys?  An oranged-haired joker... whatever he is (Depp's character).  A bloodhound that talks?  Oh, and who can possibly forget the extremely awesome demonic creature that just appears out of nowhere and attacks the good people of the land?  That is one really dark moment of fairy tale storytelling, and I won't dare spoil his reason for existing or what happens.<br /><br />Hmmm, now I really have to sit and wonder just what kind of person this film was intended for all along.  Children?  Well I suppose it would HAVE to be a childrens movie.  Whatever the case- the delicious smell of fabric softener coming through my living room vents from the dryer and washing machine in the basement below is making me feel really fruity and happy.  Maybe NOW is a good time to give Alice in Wonderland another shot and appreciate it in the way originally intended.  Here we go!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4.html">A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4</a><br/><p>"Alice in Wonderland" is an imaginative tale that demands to be told by an imaginative director.  Who better to fit the bill than Tim Burton.  The world he creates is a vivid one full of wonder.<br /><br />In this version, Alice is a 20 year old who feels oppressed by an unimaginative society that wants her to act like a proper lady at the expense of her individuality.  When she falls down the rabbit hole into another dimension, that dimension looks wildly different but still carries expectations that others want her to meet without question.<br />The challenge for Alice, then, is to challenge these automatic expectations and find her own identity.<br /><br />I enjoyed Tim Burton's take on this tale, but not so much the actors.  I know Burton is infatuated with Johnny Depp, but I'm not so enamoured.  I thought Depp could've been more animated playing the Mad Hatter and was surprised he played it so low key.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter played her character low-key, too, which is also surprising given she got the juicy role of the Red Queen.  Instead of screaming, "Off with her head", she said it in kind of a bored tone.  She did look funny having a oversized head to match her oversized ego, but I always expect the Red Queen to be menacing and there wasn't anything menacing about how Bonham Carter played it.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway plays the White Queen and really overdoes the delicate hands in the air, floating across the stage, bit.  And newcomer Mia Wasikowska plays Alice in a lackluster way that demanded more energy than she was willing to give.<br /><br />As far as which age bracket this movie would be best suited for, I think it would be better suited for older kids and up.  There were some scenes that could be too scary for little kids. For instance, there's one scene where a creature's eyeball is torn out of its socket and another scene where Alice walks on top of the heads of the Red Queen's beheaded victims.  Also, this movie runs a bit too long so I don't think little kids could wait it out.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, though, I still enjoyed watching Tim Burton's imagination at work.  I also like the message that if having a vivid imagination makes you mad, then perhaps that's actually a blessing in disguise.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>Bright colors, johnny depp, helena boham carter all point to tim burton movie. It had all the potential to be a great version of this wonderful movie, but instead it becomes very tiring. It is just a collection of Burton's past accomplishments wrapped up in the dressing of a classic. It just has many of the same old tired tricks that go no where quick. He could have innovated somewhere, as the book provides ample opportunity, but it never comes. Worth a redbox rental, but not worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I've never actually read the books, or seen the cartoon, so I couldn't compare this. To me, it's just another typical gothic Tim Burton movie. Of course, no Tim Burton movie can be complete without Johhny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Danny Elfman music. This was like 'The Wizard of Oz' tripping on acid. 19-year-old Alice is forced to marry, so she runs away and falls down a rabbit hole, into Wonderland. She must team up with the Mad Hatter and try to stop the evil Red Queen. I'd probably recommend ALICE IN WONDERLAND!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>As others have noted, there was a huge pile of money spent on effects and visuals here, as well as on costumes.<br />At least there is a good cast.<br /><br />The main problem is that it all seems so familiar.  I thought the Tweedles had arrived straight from Nightmare Before Christmas, the twisted tree might have been left over from Sleepy Hollow, and the music sounds like most of the music of Burton's other films.  And of course, there is Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter.  Again.<br /><br />And what was with the blending of the poem "jabberwocky" with the story of Alice?  That just didn't work at all for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Wonderland weirdness is utterly normal for Tim Burton and collaborator Johnny Depp who of course about everybody felt were perfect to do a new film version.<br /><br />My immediate reaction after just seeing this is been-there-done-that, but I vaguely recall it being a way cooler trip. Why is that?<br /><br />The highlight for me was Johnny Depp yet again perfectly transformed and fully immersed in another character, except for the ultra-goofy "dance" which was maybe the worst, most cringe inducing thing in the whole movie. But what an actor! He even came up with the look of his Mad Hatter. Perfect.<br /><br />The biggest failure of this film -I'd agree with Roger Ebert- is the big, dumb, loud and boring unnecessary third act battle.<br /><br />But I found this movie in general just really *odd*. It's a story about an upper class English girl from stuffy aristocratic society, this time in her late teens, hanging out with a bunch of weirdos, as director Tim Burton put it. Well Burton said "brat" hanging with a bunch of weirdos is basically the depth to which the story has been brought to the screen before, but here Alice seems like a pretty cool, independently minded chick ahead of her time. In fact the Burton version is basically a "you-go-girl" fable about following your bliss (literally following your dreams in this case) and having the courage to be yourself...<br /><br />It felt familiar but wasn't what I expected at the same time and the story didn't truly hold my interest and exactly why I can't put my finger on. Combination of things. Burton's attempt to add a tad more depth to these dream creatures and this being Alice's second trip down the rabbit hole? The pacing of events and subplots? I don't recall the Disney cartoon so much or the original Lewis Carrol story at all but there were details in this version that were weird. Members of The Red Queen's court and the intrigues, the Knave of Hearts, just the look of some of these characters and the castle were creepy, but not in a good way to me. This movie will give many kids some weird dreams by the way.<br />The special effects were OK but for a person not too big on cgi I was again underwhelmed. Props on The Cheshire Cat tho... I dug that. To be sure there were some moments. I went in with an open mind towards the cgi and the 3-D and I gotta say I think 3-D is overall just lame. It strikes me as mostly a gimmick and the visuals will look more vibrant and colorful in good ole 2-dimension in your home on Blue Ray. (Although I want to add as a side note the preview for a 3-D documentary of the mission to repair to Hubble Telescope was incredible!!)<br /><br />Sorry don't want to harsh anybody's high.<br />2.8 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>For me, Tim Burton has always been more miss than hit.  For every excellent effort (ED WOOD, SWEENEY TODD) there seem to be several misfires (SLEEPY HOLLOW, CORPSE BRIDE, BIG FISH.)  Unfortunately, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is mostly a miss for me.  I looked very much forward to his twisted vision, as the ALICE books were insane mash-ups of verbal nonsense and visual oddness (thanks to the classic illustrations from Teniel.)<br /><br />Burton's film is full of some stunning visuals, most bearing no resemblance to the illustrations...but I'm okay with that.  Burton and his collaborators have re-imagined the look for Wonderland, and that's actually a perfectly valid approach.  Plenty of other ALICE films have tried to hew more closely to the look of the original books.  But what I didn't like was the story Burton chose to tell.<br /><br />ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS are very difficult to handle cinematically, because they don't really tell a cohesive story.  Yes, there is the barest filament of a plot...but it's mostly a string of incidents as Alice meets weird creatures who tell strange and often nonsensical stories.  (There's a reason Jefferson Airplane wrote the song "White Rabbit.")  So I can understand that Burton and crew wanted to force a real plot for all these familiar characters to enact.  However, I think Burton made two mistakes that resulted in one big problem.<br /><br />Mistake #1 was to set the story later in the life of Alice, so that she's a young lady on the verge of being engaged to a man very much not right for her...instead of a young girl.  It makes sense that a young girl could observe the insanity of wonderland and accept it all.  Rabbits that talk?  Sure, no problem.  A giant caterpillar smoking a hookah?  Yep.  Living playing cards?  Fun!  But as a 19 year old young lady, who is clearly intelligent...wouldn't you at least expect some raised eyebrows?  Granted, the Alice we meet is a curious & imaginative person...but she still seems to have little trouble drinking one potion to shrink and nibbling on something else to grow without giving it a thought.<br /><br />Mistake #2 was to focus on the politics of Wonderland (actually, in this film, it is called Underland, sadly).  We get this story of the evil Red Queen and the virtuous White Queen, and how their animosity has affected the citizens of the land.  The poor creatures are suffering under the yolk of the bad queen.  It smelled just a little too much like Narnia to me (without the religious overtones).<br /><br />The net effect of these two mistakes was to sap the film of any real sense of wonder.  I ADMIRED much of the visual look:  Tweedledum & Tweedledee were suitably creepy/funny.  The life-size playing cards / soldiers were well-rendered.  Helena Bonham Carter was a visual marvel as the Red Queen.  But I wasn't swept away.  I didn't feel transported to a new world, I felt invited to a viewing of a really cool set and some nifty CGI.  Wonderland didn't feel REAL, and the story didn't feel compelling.<br /><br />Mia Wasikowska made for a very striking Alice.  Even though I disagreed with making her a "grown up," I can't fault the actress for that.  She plays her underwritten, one-dimensional role as well as possible.  (I'll say right now that one of Burton's biggest flaws, to me, is that he seldom creates well-rounded characters...usually just a collection of traits.  Some actors can wrangle those quirks and ticks into a believable person...others cannot.)  I enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen...again, she was seldom asked to do much, but she tore into her role with relish.  A lot of the voice work was very good as well:  Alan Rickman is perfect for the Caterpillar and I always like Stephen Fry (Cheshire Cat.)<br /><br />Less successful were Crispin Glover as Stayne, the Knave of Hearts.  If ever a character needed to be unhinged, it's Stayne...and usually Glover can deliver unhinged with the best of them.  But he mostly came across as stoic.  Anne Hathaway was bland.  And most disappointing was the usually reliable Johnny Depp.  I'm used to him being the best thing in any Burton movie.  He was flat-out brilliant as Ed Wood, full of wonder as Scissorhands and deliciously villainous as Sweeney.  Yet as the Mad-Hatter, he's all over the map.  Burton has tried to take a minor character from the original books, and stretch him into being the conscious of Wonderland...the IDEA of Depp as the Hatter was great, but reinventing the character just to give your star more to do was a mistake.  He's amusing to look at for a few minutes...but his accent jumps around (and worse, he's often unintelligible in his mumblings) and he appears to have a rather odd fixation on Alice.  Is he "in love" with the lovely young woman he sees now, or is he "in love" with his memory of the 10 year old girl he once met...which is highly creepy, but seems to be the case.<br /><br />ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a huge disappointment.  Burton is an awkward storyteller but a visual genius.  This time, however, even those skills are found wanting.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 7:57 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews the new Tim Burton movie, "Alice in Wonderland" starring Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anne Hathaway.<br /><br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>So sayeth The White Queen, who was experiencing time backwards, but what 'happens' in this movie is a little hit and miss.<br /><br />When it works, it works well, and some of the casting, especially of Depp and Hathaway, was inspired.<br /><br />The story is, as usual, a blend of the two books, with the added re-entrant twist that an adult Alice is returning to Wonderland/Underland. The special effects are well done, although I hated the enlarged head that Burton gave to Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen. She is a beautiful, classically-trained actress and the absurd distortion serves only to irritate and distract.<br /><br />The final Joan of Arc-style battle against the Jabberwock at least lifts the movie towards the end, before shambling back into the sterile, over-stereotyped garden party.<br /><br />For me, it fell well short of what it should have been, despite some solid performances. If you are going to effectively rewrite/extend the Alice saga, what is the point in stopping short of REALLY rebuilding the story arc, and taking it onto another level?<br /><br />The four stars are for Bonham Carter, Depp and Hathaway, who all injected their otherworldly magic into a movie that was barely worthy of their talent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>Tim Burton will always be one of my favorite directors. While his library is not perfect, he is one of the greatest story tellers in film history. With worlds of the outlandish and incredible heartfilled characters there was no doubt that Disney would call upon him for bringing one of the most beloved childrens tales to life, in Alice In Wonderland.<br /><br />Now, in order to truly appreciate this film you need to know your Alice 101. If you have never read the two Alice books (yes not many people know there were two books) Or if you haven't seen the 1953 Disney animated film, chances are this will not be the best experience for you. What makes this film so great is that Tim Burton wanted to give his audience something fresh, so he made his very own unoffical 3rd Installment. This Alice In Wonderland is sort of what Stephen Speilberg's Hook did for Peter Pan. In Tim Burtons' fims whether good or bad his cast is always great (most of the time because it's the same). The best performances here have come from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Cater filling in the shoes and head of the Red Queen gives you a true 'you love to hate me' character. Johnny Depp turns on his Jack Sparrow/Willy Wonka charm, but kicks it up one huge knotch. The only beef I had with this movie I think the CGI was a tad overdone. Sure we have come to an age where the CGI is king. Still, you compare it to so many of the Burton films before, the lack of CGI just made them all the more whimsical. Still, the movie is entertaing and so much fun to watch. I would say proceed with caution if you haven't caught up on the story in a while. If you are an Alice fan, it will be a good one for you.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>In Tim Burton-directed "Alice in Wonderland," the titular heroine re-visits (not just visits) the strange world where Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter live. Though two original books of Lewis Carroll serve as the basis of the plot (newly written for the film by Linda Woolverton), Tim Burton's latest offering is about the journey and adventures of grown-up Alice (Mia Wasikowska), now 19 years old, who has almost completely forgotten the magical world, or "Underland," where she once travelled when she was much younger.<br /><br />This is the second time I was disappointed with Tim Burton's films (the first being "Planet of the Apes" - I love "Mars Attack" for its sheer ridiculousness). The change of the heroine's age is OK with me as long as the story is interesting. The generic plotline never gives her a chance to show what she can do, however, and I admit Mia Wasikowska is doing her best, Alice's character remains boring and lifeless.<br /><br />I am not saying there is nothing to be wondered at in "Alice in Wonderland." Though they lack in style, the pitch-perfect visuals are gorgeous to look at. Helena Bonham Carter's big-headed Red Queen is amusing to see, and so is Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp in a delightfully tongue-in-cheek way. One regrettable thing is that these characters are trapped somewhere in the computer-graphic extravaganza and usual "Good vs Evil" dichotomy. I almost forgot to say that this is a Disney film.<br /><br />As in the book, "Curiouser and curiouser!" Alice says in Tim Burton's adaptation. My impression about the film is opposite. Alice's new journey looks derivative and uninspired, something I didn't expect from the director of "Edward Scissorhands."</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>When I first saw the 1951 animated version of  Disney's "Alice in Wonderland" I liked it immediately and it remained my favorite Disney animated feature ever since.  FIrst because of the funny and crazy design of the film and also because, as a radio listener,  I recognized most of the great voices used in the picture:  Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, Sterling Holloway, et al.  When I heard that the Disney Co. had undertaken a remake of this story, I feared the worst: It would be modernized, it would lose  its charm and humor.  As is often the case, I was wrong:  The two versions are completely different in approach and both are most entertaining.<br /><br />The new film is a masterpiece of production design and wonderful characterizations given by a fine British cast.  Even beyond this are the amazing visual effects that give the Blu-ray version a real advantage.  Nearly every scene involves complicated processing which is seamless and impossible to analyze on first viewing.  The additional features, which explain how some of this was accomplished, indicate what a grueling effort the making of this film must have been.<br /><br />Mia Wasikowska is a lovely (older) Alice.  The Mad Hatter and the Red Queen are wonderfully played by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.  The voices used for various animated characters are superb choices:  Alan Rickman, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall, Barbara Windsor, Michael Gough.  One remembers Michael Gough as an important player in the Alec Guinness comedy, "The Man in the White Suit," made by Ealing Studios sixty years ago and Mr. Gough is still working, bless him.<br /><br />Not to be repetitive, this film is one of the great examples of the advantages of Blu-ray.  Having both versions to compare, I was very impressed by the additional detail brought forward by Blu-ray and how much can be missed watching the standard DVD.  For example, at the very beginning of the opening title, it's very easy to miss the clouds briefly forming a smiling face across the moon.<br /><br />My only serious reservation with the new version is the annoying and inappropriate vocalizing  that is heard at the beginning of the closing credits completely dispelling the atmosphere left by Danny Elfman's superb score.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>After taking a Wonderland Hiatus, Alice finds herself gorwn up and in the thralls of a marriage she really doesn't want. As she is deciding what to do - or how to escape - a little rabbit with a nice pocketwatch appears in the brush and starts his run. alice follows him, finds a hole leading dooown, and ends up in a place that she knows - sort of.<br /><br />When I watched this movie, I had mixed feelings on the outcome. First of all, they introduced the Jabberwakee (sorry about the spelling) and I really didn't like what I saw. I had always pictured it as something worse than it was - something that was Wonderlandish and really out-of-place when it came to description.<br /><br />Next, there was the state of the world we see. We have a caterpillar that is small and that doesn't have the sdame impact that he did once upon a time. Since he was a favorite of mine, that really messed with something I enjoyed quite a bit.<br /><br />Another thing is the whole thing with the White and Red Queen. All of my comments are meant not to be spoilers (that's why I don't explain what the Jabber is) but I can say a few things like I really didn't like the way that the Cards play out against Chess Pieces, that the Queens are both decorative but not the things I liked, and that certain things are not the way they would be best suited. Sometimes, certain things seem to take the path of least resistance. The C. Cat, for example, if nice but not exactly as fun as he could be. It was as if he was being anchored in a bay of trival ideas and not being given free reign.<br /><br />The good is good, however, and I have to give a lot of stuff props. I like the visuals, do like the movement of some of the pieces, and I really liked how the Hatter is explored. This is a social and political commentary on a world that is having a civil war - it isn't seen through a little girl's eyes and perhaps she sees more. This is played out well and, much like older times, it updates some ideas. Still, I really thought that a doormouse, the selection of eyes, and a few beasts being friendly seemed like they came from other movie ideas.<br />It bites and scratches but loves you in the end - have you seen that before?<br /><br />I know a lot more pros could have been listed nad, seeing the movie again, I can say that I would like it more. Thhe first glance is one of expectation and, well, it did not live up to what I thought of. Tim Burton's style is partially to credit and to bblame, working as a sword that cuts on both sides. If you love it you will love the movie - hate it and the movie will hurt your love for Wonderland.<br /><br />Should you see it? If you noted the first taste of the thing then I would say yes. I liked the first myself and I saw it because of this BUT I must say that I didn't like some of the introduction and some of the same tricks. - Eat me, Drink Me - That was something I knew. Heads in a moat - nice upgrade. So, I give it a 4 because of some of the stuff but I think it is a 4 that comes from a place that was birthed way back when.<br />See it but look over what you are seeing first (and, pllllease, avoid any spoilers that you can that will give away the big stuff that progresses)</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>Adaptations can be difficult to pull off. Even if you're not adapting a work that is particularly well known among the masses you have to look at how the source material speaks to you and what you want to say to the audience with your film. Beyond that you have to consider what you possibly might need to change in your adaptation to make the source more cinematically viable. If you're working on a project that is ingrained in the public consciousness, or adapted previously into a universally adored film, then the line you walk can feel like the green mile.<br /><br />Tim Burton has had a lot of experience with film adaptations, making massive hits with Batman, Batman Returns, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (which is not a remake, but that's a discussion for another blog post). He's also at times shown a capacity for not really understanding the source material. For his adaptation of Alice in Wonderland for Disney Burton said, "It's a funny project. The story is obviously a classic with iconic images and ideas and thoughts. But with all the movie versions, well, I've just never seen one that really had any impact to me. It's always just a series of weird events. Every character is strange and she's just kind of wandering through all of the encounters as just a sort of observer," but such observations ignore that this was Lewis Carroll's intention in his writing. In the end though, Burton's film became only the sixth film to gross more than $1 billion worldwide.<br /><br />Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is 19 years old and on the verge of getting engaged to a man she doesn't love. But when she sees a white rabbit she feels compelled to follow it down the rabbit hole (so to speak). When she arrives in Wonderland, a place that she has been to before but doesn't remember, she's confronted by various creatures telling her that she's the wrong Alice. Soon she learns that on the fateful Frabjous Day she is supposed to become the champion of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and slay the Jabberwocky to restore the kingdom from the clutches of the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).<br /><br />Tim Burton has a tendency to view the world through dark shades. If Armani made a pair of gothic sunglasses they would belong to Burton. For a film like Alice and Wonderland which is known for its bright Day-Glo colors he might not seem like the right choice to direct, but in the end his style works well for his interpretation of the source material. You still have the bright colors and Burton retains some of the tones of outrageous zaniness that were present in the Carroll stories and in previous incarnations of the tale.<br /><br />A relative newcomer to the Hollywood stage, Wasikowska is the biggest acting surprise of the movie. She adds a certain gravitas that grounds the flick when it could have easily been lost in its excesses, and it could serve Wasikowska far beyond films of this nature. Helena Bonham Carter (whose casting in Burton films has been blamed on nepotism) steals every scene that she's in. She's typically brilliant and the choice to not hold back in this particular performance allows her to reign as an evil queen should. I must make a note here on Johnny Depp who more than a few people have made a note that he seems to be unable to properly act anymore without donning crazy makeup and disguises. Here I feel that the Mad Hatter he plays was taken in a hopelessly dark direction that should have been lightened up quite a bit more. Although watching the film I did look forward to his "Scottish" freak outs.<br /><br />There's a certain detachment from the material of the movie though. I don't really feel that Burton actually invested much of himself into this flick the way he did with, say, Nightmare on Elm Street or Ed Wood. His view of the world here, that imagination builds confidence, feels generic at the end of the day as if he were a hired hand who felt the need to put his stamp on the film out of necessity rather than artistically. The animation borders on ironic, which in 2D works quite well, but didn't hold up as well in the initial 3D viewing. Also, I felt the end was compromised slightly by the Mad Hatter's Futterwacken which seemed a bit too modern styled to fit with the rest of the narrative. In the end it just ended up being corny.<br /><br />Critically, this turned out to be Burton's third least enjoyed films among critics. (Planet of the Apes being his critical worst and Mars Attacks! which I think is underrated, not being far behind.) That's interesting considering Tim Burton only has three films that are considered by Rotten Tomatoes to be rotten. In my humble but honest opinion this is far from Burton's best film, but it's also not that close to being his worst film. I recommend you give it a try if you haven't already. It's a fun flick even if it isn't quite as perfect as I, or even some of you, wanted it to be.<br /><br />3.5/5<br /><br />Be sure to check out: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K7WZ7S">Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work</a>!</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Alice in Wonderland(released Feb/10)stars Johnny Depp(as the Mad Hatter),Helena Bonham Carter(as the Queen of Hearts),Anne Hathaway as the White Queen,Crispin Glover as the Knave of Hearts and Mia Wasakowska in the title role as Alice.Depp of course has collaborated with Burton on more than a few of his projects and,as usual,Depp steals every scene he is in.I must say off the top that I am no Tim Burton fan at all.He has had some real stinkers like Cabin Boy and Mars Attacks,his animated films do absolutely nothing for me and he usually directs with a very heavy hand,Pee Wees Big Adventure being a prime example;a movie that should have been much better if it had been lighter in tone and faster paced.So to get me to see a Burton film,let alone review one,has got to take some doing.A friend of mine got after me repeatedly to watch this,so I finally caved.I found Burtons heavy hand again and a totally miscast and uninteresting Alice in Mia Wasakowska.The movie only really starts to come to life once she is down the rabbit hole under the tree,before and after is sheer boredom.But I found it interesting enough to give it at least an average mark.<br />The story involves Carroll`s beloved character of Alice here betrothed to a rather obnoxious society Lord.As he proposes in a gazebo under the scrutiny of all at the huge garden soiree,she spies a rabbit and excuses herself to run after it.She finds a large hole underneath of a tree and tumbles into it.After attempts at growing and shrinking she finally enters Wonderland.She apparently has been there before but it takes almost the entire film for her to realize her strange dreams over the years were based on real events.She runs into a plethora of Wonderland characters including Tweedledum and Tweedledee,the White Rabbit,the blue Caterpillar,the Dormouse,The Cheshire cat,the March Hare,among many,many others.What she discovers is this land is ruled by the psychotic Queen of Hearts,she of the bulbous head and deadly swift temper.<br />At one point Alice comes upon a long table at which sits the dormouse,the March Hare and the Mad Hatter.Depp is a master of the exotic and strange in his characters and this is no exception,as he embues the Hatter with the right mix of madness,a marvelous vulnerability and pathos,all wrapped up in a kind heart.Over time Alice becomes mixed up in the ruling Queens court and finds the Vorpal sword which is the only thing capable of killing the Jaberwocky(a dragon like creature),a venture she is destined to perform.She escapes with it to the White Queen,the Queen of Hearts nice sister,who previously ruled wonderland.In the meantime the Hatter has been arrested but he escapes and provokes an uprising against the Queen of Hearts.The resistance,for the moment,is quashed but the `rebels`escape to the White Queen.There they amass,regroup and return in a final epic battle with the Queen of Hearts troops.<br />It is now Frabjous Day,the day of the final battle and the day Alice,with Vorpal sword in hand,and dressed in battle armour,confronts the Jabberwocky.In the end all is returned to normal as the Queen of Hearts and her consort,the Knave of Hearts,are banished from the kingdom.Alice says a farewell to her friends and returns to the ``real`` world above.Little time has passed since she left and she returns to the gazebo,refuses the request for marriage and enters into a mutually beneficial business partnership with her uncle.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and is in its original a/r of 1:78:1.Extras include three featurettes on the making of the film.<br />All in all just an average Burton entry.It would have gotten higher marks if the film had been more interesting in the pre and post Wonderland sequences.Also Mia Wasakowska is totally miscast and a bore as Alice,with little or no life in her portrayal.Depp is the entire show here,along with Carroll`s wonderful Wonderland characters and with Helena Bonham Carter coming in in third place.For Depp fans this is a must.For the rest of us...the usual.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>I can't get over on how good this movie is. i for sure that it was going to suck, ssilly me, how can i ever doubt Tim Burton and disney. this is a great movie, love the story, special effects and the actors are awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Given his flair for the whimsical, the surrealistic, and the preposterous, Tim Burton would seem the ideal choice to direct a modern movie version of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." And turns out he is. (Terry Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro, whose "Pan's Labyrinth" was already a variant of sorts on the story, are two others who might have done as well).<br /><br />Lewis Carroll's darkly humorous Victorian Era classic chronicles the adventures of a spunky, imaginative young girl who tumbles down a rabbit hole into a fantastic world of talking animals, size-altering potions, and memorably eccentric characters, a land ruled over by the evil, bulbous-headed Red Queen, played with petulant haughtiness by Helena Bonham Carter.  The screenplay for the film - now called simply "Alice in Wonderland" - by Linda Woolverton draws from both "Wonderland" and its first sequel "Through the Looking Glass" (as most previous film versions have done), and captures both the darkness and the humor of the material.<br /><br />All of Carroll's beloved creations are here, some played by actors in costumes and makeup, some generated entirely through CGI, and some - like The Red Queen - produced through a canny combination of the two.  There's the mad Mad Hatter (played by a typically loopy Johnny Depp), the growling Bandersnatch, the slyly smiling Cheshire Cat, the virtuous White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the roly-poly twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the dragon-like Jabberwocky, which it has been prophesied Alice will slay, thereby liberating the people of the kingdom from their tyrannical queen.<br /><br />Burton breathes new life into this oft-told and oft-filmed tale thanks to a team of visual and special effects wizards who come as close to capturing the world of Carroll's imagination as any group of filmmakers could ever be expected to, given the enormity of the challenge.<br /><br />As the heroine who must learn to accept the impossible before she can know who she truly is, Mia Wasikowska manages to keep Alice life-sized and appealing even in the midst of all the larger-than-life pyrotechnics going on around her.<br /><br />A masterpiece of art direction, costume design and special effects, this "Alice in Wonderland" is the next best thing to the books themselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>I like the fact this was a sequel and not a remake. I loved the animated Disney version as a kid, it was my absolute favorite! I was a little afraid of a dark, weird version of the story messing with my fond childhood memories. The cartoon version is a classic and Disney knew that classics should not be remade, even when it is their OWN classic! The new version is colorful with some dark undertones but it's a fun movie and it's kid friendly. It also is a totally different storyline from the original where we see a 19 year old grownup Alice who remembers little of the strange dream she had as a child.<br /><br />I think the movie did a good job of being different and original as well as bringing back our favorite old characters only in a human form. I really liked Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter! The Red Queen was especially mean even more so than in the original and she was on the brink of being annoying. Anne Hathaway overacted a little bit in her role as the White Queen though usually she is great in fantasy-like roles like this. I think it was partially the White Queen's makeup too, I thought it was a little harsh. Otherwise the costumes were awesome...and at least the question is answered that many little girls asked when they saw the cartoon, "How does Alice's clothing grow and shrink with her?" LOL! Well, we see her go through several wardrobe changes throughout the movie so the new generation finally has an answer to this question!<br /><br />Personally, I think Tim Burton could have added a little more color and fun. Wonderland (now Underland...what is up with the title?) should be a bright, colorful place. Tim also missed the mark a little bit in other areas too. The very nature of the "Alice" story had a paradoxical, crazy, dreamy kind of vibe. What we see is a gray, dark world that is in ruin because of the evil Red Queen. I would have LOVED to see the White Queen change it back to the colorful, happy place I remember in my childhood but that doesn't happen. It has a good ending that I don't want to spoil but it still left me wanting the crazy, fun and wacky Wonderland that we all are familiar with.<br /><br />Then again, this is a Tim Burton movie so a lot of it was sort of what I expected. Personally, I think Tim has done ENOUGH with the 'dark' theme. His movies are starting to all look the same. I do appreciate the gift he has for thinking outside the box. Unfortunately though, I think he needs to look outside the box when it comes to his style! I would like to see him make something that is just as flashy and eye catching but that has a little bit lighter of a feel. His work is becoming predictable.<br /><br />I think they should have chosen a different title for this movie like "Return to Wonderland" or something like that. It isn't the same story as the original and the name is a little misleading. It is rated PG and this seems appropriate. It IS definitely more of a kid's movie but it does have a lot of action and intense scary music that might be a little much for very small children. I did like this movie and I was entertained. It wasn't boring and would probably hold the attention of kids or adults who are into kid's movies. I would probably watch it again though I don't think I would pay to see it. Honestly, Disney's animated version was better and I would rate it five stars in a heartbeat! Tim Burton's version in my opinion is only worth 4 stars. It was a good movie but it wasn't a great one. It is MUCH better than Tim's terrible "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" remake but I still felt like something about this movie was missing...hence the reason my rating is missing a star!</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>I read in an interview that Tim Burton was not pleased with the original Alice in Wonderland book as he never felt a connection with the characters. So with this movie he sets out a clever reimagining of the classic. Alice is shown as a complete opposite of the expectations of women of that period. The book is familiar to most of us however the retelling is what drew me to this movie. Tim Burton does not disappoint in bringing the book to life with vivid scenery and colorful landscapes with colors out of this world with the help of amazing makeup and costumes. I enjoyed this movie for these features and gave it three stars. 10/16/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>For starters, it seems that everyone I know is shocked when I tell them that this Alice in Wonderland is a sequel of sorts. At the age of 19 and about to be forced into marriage, this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland. I'm glad Tim Burton and his team came up with a new story that still featured all the great characters from the original source material. That's also where the weakest part of the movie lies. The dialogue given to the characters is great, but the script is razor thin. I think if more effort went into this particular aspect, I might have given it five stars.<br /><br />I saw it in IMAX 3-D and the visuals are as grand and beautiful as you would expect from Burton. It's not quite as eye-popping as Avatar, which was shot completely in IMAX 3-D, whereas, Alice in Wonderland was upconverted (Clash of the Titans did the same thing to bad effect). The music by Danny Elfman is some of his best stuff in recent years and the costumes/makeup are top notch.<br /><br />Aside from the look of film, the acting also makes it very memorable. There are so many well animated and voice acted characters running around I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with those made of flesh and blood. I didn't like Depp's take on Willy Wonka that much, and I'm a big fan of his, but his Mad Hatter is just the right amount of crazy. His voice goes back and forth from having a lisp to sounding like William Wallace from Braveheart. His look is so jarring, you probably wouldn't even know it was him if you somehow dodged all the advertisements before entering the theater. Helena Bonham Carter played the Red Queen brilliantly. I couldn't take my eyes off her giant head. Anne Hathaway really surprised me here (in a good way) with her take on the White Queen and it was nice to see Crispin Glover back on the big screen in a role that suited him. Last, but certainly not least, Mia Wasikowska was absolutely captivating as Alice. The way she talked and her reactions were just what the film needed in it's central role. All the digital animal characters were great, but my favorites were the Cheshire Cat, voice by Stephen Fry, and the March Hare voiced by Paul Whitehouse.<br /><br />I'm somewhat surprised that the combination of violence and meanness, along with the smoking Blue Caterpillar didn't get this a PG-13 rating. It's not too harsh, but young kids might get a little freaked out.<br /><br />Overall, Alice in Wonderland looks like a polished jewel, has great acting/voice acting, wonderful music and even manages to get quite a few laughs in the process. If only the simple story didn't let me down in the end, this could have been a classic in the making. Even still, I wouldn't mind Tim Burton taking us on another trip down the rabbit hole in a few years.</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>Most of the many attempts at filming Alice In Wonderland haven't been particularly successful, for two reasons. First, directors seem to feel that the movie must have a strong male character. Lewis Carroll didn't give them one (all the male characters in the books are rather spineless and feeble) so they invent their own, usually, for some reason, the Mad Hatter. Second, they misread the character of Alice. In the book she is headstrong, inquisitive and feisty; she dominates the other characters even as she takes part in their fantastic world. She is not a spectator, watching what they do, but a full participant, accepting. or more often rejecting, their view of life. She's not, nor is she meant to be, a nice girl meekly accepting what befalls her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Tim Burton's 'Alice' falls into both these traps. Instead of being a passing character Alice meets along the way, the Mad Hatter becomes central to the film and in doing so destroys much of the point of the tale. Alice herself, though she has her moments of rebellion, is played far too passively; she's more often merely watching what goes on in  Wonderland. In making her character too detached, Burton loses the involvement that the audience should feel and which has made the books so successful for so long.<br /><br />On the plus side, Wonderland itself is marvelously realized. I love the bright colors, the ever-more-convincing computer graphics and the strange flora and fauna which inhabit this suitably dream-like place. Everything looks as it's supposed to- distorted versions of reality, only possible in the imagination. The story meanders far from the original tales, but I have no problem with that, as long as it holds together. Tim Burton is the master at making a fantasy world come to life.<br /><br />It's a fun movie to watch. It just doesn't make the audience feel involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>I went to see Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland the day it opened in theaters. I'm a fan of Burton films and I waited a long time to see this film. I wasn't dissapointed. The visuals are gorgeous and really creative, Wonderland is in one word "fantastic", the characters blend effortessly in the Wonderland scenery (sorry Underland). The plot is predictable but the performances of the characters make this a truly engaging experience. Johhny Depp is fantastic as the Mad Hatter as is Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. Crispin Glover also was good as the Knave of Hearts. The vocal performances for the animated characters are top-notch (especially Alan Rickman as the Caterpillar (Absolem) and Stephen Fry as the Chesire Cat). Mia Wasikowska gave an excellent first impression in the title role. As conclusion, Disney and Burton delivered an imaginative, visually stunning, well performed film.<br /><br />The Bluray/DVD/Digital Copy combo is excellent. The picture looks stunning in Bluray and Wonderland is gorgeus. The sound is equally impressive. An excellent transfer. The DVD, loses some of the richness in hi def but nonetheless is an excellent transfer for SD. The extras are a little short in time but they will entertain you. An excellent combo for a nice film.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Many of the complaints about this movie I hear from fans of the book, and I can see where they're coming from. However, if you don't hold this to the standards of the book, it is a fairly enjoyable film on its own. The reason this story is so different is because Alice is supposed to be grown-up, having been to Wonderland before but having forgotten it.<br /><br />Some things in this movie are not explained well. I didn't like the Red Queen's head being so huge, it felt unneccessary to me. And the White Queen's physical demeanor, with her hands/arms constantly in the air was just weird. And I also didn't like Alice's actress. It's not that she was ugly, but she just didn't feel like an appropriate choice for the role, and this is one role (Mad hatter) that Johnny Depp simply failed to pull off. If you're a die-hard Alice in Wonderland fan, you might not like this. Considerable liberties have been taken from Lewis Carroll's original story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Alice in Wonderland (Tim Burton, 2010)<br /><br />I just looked back over the spreadsheet, after sorting by director and year. With the inclusion of Alice in Wonderland, I have seen, reviewed, and rated ten Tim Burton-directed films. (Two others, Batman Returns and Mars Attacks!, I've seen, but don't remember enough about to rate. I plan to go back and rewatch them eventually.) I was initially kind of surprised at the average rating, which is pretty low, but when it comes right down to it, the best "Tim Burton" movie ever made was not actually directed by Burton (Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas, on which Burton served as a producer). And his recent outings have fared pretty miserably with me, with the exception of The Corpse Bride. I don't think it's a case, as was hypothesized on The Rotten Tomatoes Show, of the public (in this case, me) getting tired of Burton's same old visual tricks. No, when I look a little further into this, I see a pattern, and the Corpse Bride exception noted above may have already tipped you off to it: in every case but one on my spreadsheet, the higher-rated movies are Burton originals, and the lower-rated movies are adaptations. (The sole exception is Burton's first Batman film.) And in that regard, Alice in Wonderland is my favorite Burton adaptation since that first Batman movie over twenty years ago, but I still don't think it measures up to Burton classics like Beetlejuice and Ed Wood.<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland gives us, in essence, a sequel to the story we're all used to from countless other films based on Carroll; in this one, Alice (Skin's Mia Wasikowska) is nineteen and believes her childhood trip to Wonderland was a dream. On the verge of becoming engaged to Hamish (Kinky Boots' Leo Bill), Alice, who has ever strained against Victorian conformity, runs off following a hare in a waistcoat. Then down the rabbit hole, &c., &c., and back to the world that she believes to be in her dreams. She hooks up with the usual suspects, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), and is told of her true destiny: the kingdom is dying under the reign of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and her pet enforcer, the Jabberwocky (voice of Christopher Lee). The Hatter and his rebel pals want to see the White Queen (Brokeback Mountain's Anne Hathaway) reinstalled on the throne, and it has been foretold that only Alice can defeat the jabberwocky in battle. But first, she has to get the Vorpal Sword, which is in the possession of the Red Queen...<br /><br />what a cast Burton assembled for this spectacle. Aside form the abovementioned, Marton Csokas, Timothy Spall, Crispin Glover, Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, and Imelda Staunton, among many others. And the casting is right in line with Burton's oft-mentioned, sometimes-criticized method of filmmaking, which is "throw as much spectacle at the screen as possible and have the audience hang on for the ride." Too often, the spectacle is used as a cover for the boringness of the plot, the entire lack of plot, or Burton's odd inability to actually present a compelling case for the adaptation/remake/what-have-you in question. After seeing early reviews for Alice in Wonderland, I expected the same sort of thing here, but I didn't get it; there's actually more of a plot to this than there was to Burton's pale, boring Sweeney Todd, and that plot is more coherent than it was in his confusing, silly Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Which pretty much by default makes it his best adaptation in the past decade. (I refuse to watch Big Fish; every bad actor gets one good film, and Ewan MacGregor, who is a terrible actor, got his with Little Voice.) Still, many of the criticisms levelled at the movie are well warranted. Wasikowska is a stunning lass, to be sure, but her portrayal of Alice is rather wooden. (And, much to the disappointment of quite a few people in my party, she spends a great deal of time falling out of her clothing, but never gets naked.) In reflection, though, it should be no surprise that Depp and Carter steal the show; the two of them have been thick as thieves with Burton for years now. Who's going to be allowed to yank the spotlight away? Which makes the wooden-ness of Wasikowska's portrayal a minor thing, really; think of this as an ensemble piece and it will be less noticeable. The spectacle is in place, Depp and Carter are in fine form, and there are many, many worse ways to spend a couple of hours in a darkened theater.<br /><br />Which would be a perfect place to end this review, but I feel compelled to mention that if you're looking for a visual-spectacle version of Alice where acting is less important than visuals, it's been done before, and better, and is available through your DVD-by-mail rental subscription, whichever one you may have (I know Netflix, BBO, and GreenCine all have copies)--Alice, Jan Svankmajer's superlative 1988 film. I haven't seen it recently enough to be able to point out specific places where Burton's film parallels it, but I remember enough of it, in that vague sort of way, to see how Burton is at least aware of Svankmajer's film and is paying homage to it with some of his choices here. If you saw Burton's film and were less than impressed, see Svankmajer's. Or even if you loved Burton's film, see Svankmajer's. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>Alas, this is the second film I've seen in recent weeks that is rich in visuals and impoverished in emotion and intellect; the other was Terry Gilliam's "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus".<br /><br />The problem here is the characters -- not a single one, from the Cheshire Cat to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, has the slightest appeal, either in their design, personality, or dialog.  Even the voices of the CGI characters are poorly chosen here, as opposed to, say, the Shrek films, where the voices of Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, Cameron Diaz, and Mike Myers are so perfectly suited to Donkey, Puss, Fiona, and Shrek.<br /><br />As a result, the viewer really doesn't care much what happens to Alice or her new-found companions in "Underland".<br /><br />A plot of sorts is grafted onto her adventure -- slay the dragon-like Jabberwocky -- and much is made of the way she finds the courage to face her fearsome foe and her real-life tormentors, but it is far from clear what really motivates her to do so.<br /><br />If you want to show off your new HDTV, you will likely be gratified by the spectacle armies of CGI technicians have served up here.  But if you like a movie with warmth, humor, and pathos, you will not want to peer into this particular looking glass.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LAA9SCENXLKN.html">A2LAA9SCENXLKN</a><br/><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />Ah, whatever your thinking, IS WRONG!!!! Unless it is that the theory of relativity is false...Okay, there's been a weird trend, the return of good kids movies. Where the Wild Things Are, to A Christmas Carol, The Princess and the Frog, and they're making a new video game called "Epic Mickey" (Although those who are 8 will have nightmares playing this game.) I expected this to be among the war against crap. I...was flipping wrong! This is the equivalent to Hollywood BullCrap<br /><br />What does it start out as? Well, it actually starts out pretty good, I like the first scene with Alice as a 6 year old very much, it was very well done. The next scene, was alright, a little unnecessary and not exactly for those who are 5 to talk about *cough*Alice is forced to marry a crapper*cough* Yeah, I meant to say that. Here's the good part about that scene though: three of the characters in that scene (and I controversially recognize a fourth) are in the same portray as characters later featured in Underland or... *cough*IT'S WONDERLAND YOU IDIOTS!*cough*I do not care if the book said it or not, and no I have not read the book.  So, here's where the good transition happens. The rabbit appears, and Alice wants to chase it. Awesome, Alice does chase it, and falls down a rabbit hole in a tree, Awesome! Then, she drinks a potion and turns small! Awesome! Eats a cake and makes her big! Awesome! Then, the crappiest voices for the characters and the worst plot of all time...Oh Heck No!<br /><br />So this is where we enter Wonderland. Wow, they really took a weird adaptation to Wonderland's scenery, I thought they should have kept a itsy bitsy closer to the dark realms that were featured in the Disney version, it was produced by Disney Pictures right? Right? But, it's okay, not the worst part of this movie. Ugh, I hate Tweedle Dee and Dum, they are completely and utterly stereotyped, where as in the original (as I recall) were a little more character like. The Rabbit, why does he co-operate with Alice? Why not just run away? I understand SOME changes have to be made, but even if they're going for a sequel, it should be the same idea every time. Like, in almost all Godzilla movies (minus 2) Godzilla is fighting another monster. I understand if they don't have him fight a monster, but what if he tagged up with a monster and didn't fight one? It would be immature at the best.<br /><br />Who's this mouse? A character from the book? I can respect that, but she is way to corny. Infact, they're all corny except for the Dodo bird, and he's gone in a jiffy and doesn't talk...AND THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT CORNY! Well, all the introduction characters are corny. The Chesier cat (is that how you spell it?) Is pretty cool, I don't think he has the same charm, but he's alright. He had the best line that SO should have been the purple cat's line...I can imagine Pooh and Kah saying that "I don't get involved...in...politics." PERFECTION! So, they're talking about this Jabberwocky (Jabberwocky woo woo woo) (You will understand my most embarrassing moment near the end of this review) and, I like the Jabberwocky in other adaptations, but I decided early that I didn't like it because......He only shows up in the final battle and does not speak more than 10 words! WHY ABUSE CHRISTPOPHER LEE AKA COUNT DOOKU AKA COUNT DRACULA LIKE THIS!!!!!!<br /><br />So, then comes this gigantic rabid white cat...Umm...God, I should have watched the 1951 yesterday, I don't think I remember him but he seems familiar. Anyway, he starts beating people up and capturing them for the "Red Queen" (who's opposite is "The White Queen." I understand this book was written before MLK, but please, you don't haft to keep to the book to details and not retain the entire plot of the 1951 movie, it should be reversed.) Not to mention, she is called The Queen of Hearts in the original book, but Red Queen in the sequel. So, this is a sequel but...You catch my drift. I guess I realized this was gonna be pretty corny from there on, so I can't remember too much.<br /><br />Oh, but you will hear me rant about this holly crap. Johnny Depp. Now, I know what your thinking "overacting, we understand you Ca$hman." NO! He underacts! What the heck! I'd rather have overacting than underacting!!! OIY SCHABATSCHE! And, he isn't even the same size as the hare! Oh, BTW, that hare isn't psychotic like in the original, but more like a wound up old senior citizen with a bad case of "post-WWE-career" syndrome. (P.S. I love WWE and TNA for that matter.)  But, come on! THE HATTER IS SUPPOSED TO BE PSYCHOTIC! I like that the cat and the hatter and hare...and the mouse, all sat down for tea, but it wasn't carried in the way I would have appreciated. And, they all react to her like some hero, was she a hero in the original? I remember her being harassed by everyone in Wonderland.<br /><br />The Red Queen...okay...I understand you should have made her skinny because people are more sensitive to biases, and Walt wasn't the best about being Politically Correct but...Did they haft to paint her face white??!!! That's even worse! At least it is natural to be fat (yes...it is...) but it is not natural to have your entire face painted white! I understand, maybe some painting of face paint...but this is ridiculous. And, boy, they made the White Queen all human, but The Red Queen inhumane. Or inhuman? Whoops. But seriously, inhumane, she orders a frog to have his head chopped off for drinking wine out of the royal glass or something, and then has a pig be her foot stool while she sits in her throne. BTW, she doesn't even say "OFF WITH HER HEAD!!!" Right! She did in the trailer!!!! What the heck!!! And can't we have a similar voice instead of this...well...it goes well with the attire and body type. The White Queen feels like someone from Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts...nuff said.<br /><br />The servant of the queen is kinda cool, but I feel bad for him having to be trapped with this slave driver. She acts cool to him, but to have to see this torture in front of him...ugh. And, she isn't exactly good looking. I swear, (and she is 19 in this movie) the only remotely attractive person in this movie was Alice, and that's not cool! You make what we think is an innocent kid look attractive? Then put back our heads on with a Wikipedia page that LONGER THAN ANY OSCAR WINNING MOVIE?!?!?!?!!??!!?!?!?! Oh, and they also include the flowers, but for barely any time at all. That's another thing they miss, they keep introducing characters throughout the original but just stay with a certain group in this one. I mean, after we get introduced to the White Queen there's really nobody else introduced.<br /><br />Wait! Another guy I forgot about because he was barely included. The Blue Caterpillar, I know he's called something else but I just like The Caterpillar.  He smokes, but in the original he just gives Alice trouble, instead here, we actually get what we expect, words of wisdom. It be cool if the original wasn't such a donkey, which I miss. Well, here we go, the Jabberwockey (that is how you spell it correct?) As I said, he talks no more than ten words, you wanna know why? Because that jerk Alice (actually, I really think she's cool in this movie, but I still like the original better) cut off his tongue! I know your trying to kill him but...Hey, Tim Burton, there's a lot of things wrong with your mother, can I tell you?<br /><br />The epic clash is not so epic, she talks through the hole thing with no Christopher Lee, which bugs me. She cuts off his head, I would expect at least a little blood. It kinda felt like they were going video game style. But, I didn't get to play as Alice during the final chapter because IT'S A MOVIE!<br /><br />Now, here's where "Jabberwockey, Jabberwockey, woo woo woo" makes sense. After the jabberwockey is defeated and the White Queen is queen again, Red Queen almost gets killed by the servant yadda yadda yadda, The Hatter (AKA not Johnny Depp in this scene) does a disco dance off! No lyrics, you may as well insert my lyrics, it's just THAT CORNY! I think of the Rick Roll<br />every time I see this.<br /><br />I like the ending, Alice showing a little attitude. Again, I liked Alice in this movie.  Okay, there was one last scene that was very corny after that, but I'm considering that the official ending.<br /><br />Well, I've written a ton of paragraphs about a movie that I don't like (EPIC FAIL) and I guess I'll give it a summary. Somebody took Tim Burton, Walt Disney, Martin Luther King Jr. and Harry Potter in a blender with a rotten pickle, and forced it down a 5 year old's face! This tried to be all four great flavors, and it wound up being really bad. It had great intentions, like I said I thought it was going to be great, but it was bad.<br /><br />The Rating? 2/5.<br /><br />I, Da Ca$hman Signing Off.</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>I wasn't terribly taken with this version of Alice In Wonderland.  While it was amazing as far as graphics go, the story was actually boggling.  I couldn't really understand what the point of the plot was.<br /><br />Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is at a party when she sees a mysterious white rabbit.  After falling down a hole, she comes to wonderland.  But it is much changed from the wonderland we all know as our childhood.  She actually encounters the Tweedles fairly quickly as well as a few other characters who tell her her destiny is to slay the Jabberwocky.<br /><br />A bit incredulous Alice is led to the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and associates.  He sets down his life to save her from the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and tells her to seek out the White Queen (Anne Hathaway).  There she prepares for the ultimate battle against the Jabberwocky.<br /><br />The characters in this movie, to me, were lukewarm at best.  While I always enjoy Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, they played the only characters that I actually enjoyed in the movie.  Even Alice didn't hold the charm for me she should have.  The rest of the characters seemed minor and weren't really developed.  One other exception would be the Cheshire cat, I found him delightful.<br /><br />While Burton's done some wonderful work, I just don't think this was up to his usual standard.  Even the music was only so-so any nothing that really made me go "wow".<br /><br />The makeup and visuals in this film are outstanding however.  They are very crazy looking but don't look fake or not well done.  A lot of care was put in the costumes and it made it very realistic.  Even the Mad Hatter's hat played an integral roll in the movie.<br /><br />Overall I wasn't terribly impressed.  But for a night with nothing else to do, I'd definitely watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>Comme Ci, Comme Ca.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway casually out-quirkied Johnny Depp, who was mostly retreading and reusing old mannerisms, and Crispin Glover, who was handicapped by his costume. Mia Wasikowska held her own as Alice against the heavyweight stars. Visually; the movie looked good but didn't break any new ground. I was actually most impressed by the slowly growing mushrooms and vines framing the end credits. Lovely.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>Give Johnny Depp a chance to don fantastic make-up and costumes and pair him up with director Tim Burton, and you can expect something bizarre and creepy. "Alice in Wonderland" (2001 in 3D and IMAX) takes great liberties with Lewis Carroll's books, and drags them into the world of the surreal, the violent, and nuttsyland. There's a lot of claptrap and scary stuff in this one, and I think it will frighten some younger tykes. The bad Red Queen with a huge head literally and figuratively is played by Helena Bonham Carter. "Off with their heads" is her constant refrain.<br /> At the beginning of the movie when Alice is among ordinary people, she doesn't look well with those dark circles under her eyes, kind of a haunted look. Mia Wasikowska plays Alice. A young woman, she is at her engagement party, and she doesn't want to marry the foolish fop her mother is pushing on her. She wanders off and drops into the world she had been in as a child, Underland or Wonderland with its weird characters. Alice's father had told Alice all the best people are mad so she shouldn't worry about her fanciful imaginings.<br /> Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter, and he becomes a pivotal character. There's Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the fat roly-poly twins, the March Hare, the disappearing Chesire Cat, the hookah-smoking Blue Caterpillar (Abosolom), and the White Rabbit. At one point Depp recites part of Lewis Carroll's famous poem "The Jabberwocky" in which Carroll used some of his invented portmanteau words. The jabberwocky is a species of dragon that Alice has to slay on a Frabjous Day.<br /> If you are looking for a faithful rendition of Carroll's 1865 masterpiece, you best look elsewhere. This is kind of a mishmash with fantastic colors and special effects. Alice grows to giant size by drinking a potion and then shrinks to tiny size by eating cake. The Bandersnatch is a monster pursuing Alice, The aim is to depose the evil Red Queen and reinstate the good White Queen.<br /> On its own terms, disregarding fidelity to its source, this movie can be fun and also enlightening because of all the interesting vocabulary introduced. It's a deluscious treat. Carroll might turn over in his grave, but Disney would probably be pleased by the result though it's not as tame as his original stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>Some of my children are real Tim Burton fans, e.g., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C3L27U">Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00447L4JG">Nightmare Before Christmas</a>, but to be frank I haven't been that interested.<br /><br />This evening my 11-yr old daughter invited me to watch Burton's version of "Alice in Wonderland", so we sat down and watched it together.  I must admit that I went into the experience with low expectations, but was soon drawn into the story.  Without giving anything away, I saw parallels between the tradtional story and Burton's, even before Alice went down the rabbit hole to "Underland."  That made it fun.<br /><br />It wasn't long before I saw that this version is a sequel to the original tale, and that was fun too.<br /><br />The imagery was classic Tim Burton...the shapes of the trees, etc., just oozed Burton through and through, and, of course, everything was mostly dark and dreary...again, Burton-esque.<br /><br />Burton's development of the story on screen was inventive and visionary, combining live action and aminated components to weave the tale.<br /><br />So, in the end I was engaged and interested all the way through...surprising myself with that!<br /><br />All in all I'd say that I liked it very much, though I wouldn't say that I loved it.  Even so, it's highly watchable, mainly for viewers over the age of 10 or so, but not for young children...at least that's where I'd pitch it.  There are a few somewhat gruesome scenes, but nothing I'd call gory.<br /><br />This is a a solid 4-star offering for me...a 50+ dad who likes a wide variety of movies.  This is one that can be enjoyed by viewers of different generations.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>ALICE IN WONDERLAND<br /><br />I have to say that I am indeed a fan of Lewis Carroll the person who wrote the stories on which this film was based [yes I said stories as in multiple, it's true look it up], and am a huge fan of the animated film that we all know and love, CLASSIC. Add in that I am a Tim Burton fan, a Johnny Depp fan [my girl loves him], and a huge Helena Bonham Carter fan [I love her]. So naturally we all got together to see this film opening night and had a great time. Also naturally when released on this three disc combo pack I had to have it, the day and minute it was released it was mine. Did I love the film that much, is it a classic, is it five stars, are all questions I am sure you want to ask me after reading that. Well before any are answered here in the review let me say this, I believe in supporting people you claim to be a fan of. So regardless I would have bought this any way luckily I liked this film so it was all good.<br /><br />This is not the classic animated version you all remember from back in the day, no, this is Tim Burton's take on this. In this version of the film Alice is older and on the verge of getting married, or so her hopeful husband to be thinks. Of course she is not in love and doesn't want to do it plus she thinks she is seeing a rabbit every where she goes. It is at a party in which the future husband [he hopes, or is it expects] will be asking for her hand that she follows the rabbit. Of course you all know she falls into the hole at the bottom of the tree only to end up in Underworld, oops I mean Wonderland [which is it, I guess you will have to watch]. Now that we are here there are a few familiar faces, or maybe not so much if you are Alice. It turns out she doesn't remember any of them or she may not be the real Alice at all.<br /><br />All of your favorites are here of course from Tweedledee and Tweedledum, White Rabbit, Blue Caterpillar, and of course the Cheshire Cat along with so much more. But yes as I am sure you all know the Mad Hatter is here and plays a big role in the film. You see the Red Queen and her huge head are planning on killing Alice so she can't kill the Jabberwocky. But if she isn't Alice how can she defeat this monster and why should she even try, this is not her battle after all. So off we go on a crazy adventure that I can honestly say I enjoyed as did my little cuz, she loved it.<br /><br />This is with out a doubt a Tim Burton film as it has his style all over it but I wonder what type of film this would have been if it would not have been geared towards kids. Still I found it to be a very entertaining film that was just straight fun. If I would have went in expecting more I may have been disappointed but if little 5 year old cuz and my girl enjoyed it then so would I, and I did. It must have been kinda hard for writer Linda Woolverton to not only write this but write a visual film for 3-D. the visuals are amazing and look flawless and bring magic to the screen, the colors and creatures of this world are wonderful. DP Dariusz Wolski did a great job with this film as it looks excellent.<br /><br />Now if the story changes are too much for you in the script or you feel Burton's take was not what you expected there is one thing you can count on, the performances. We will start with our lead, Mia Wasikowska, the way she portrays Alice is wonderful. In fact it is possible she may be the best Alice yet from all of the live action films and TV shows. Johnny Depp of course is excellent as The Mad Hatter and brings a new version of the famous charter to life, switching between a sweet yet mad version and a more menacing version when talking about the Red queen and such. Depp has always been able to bring any character to life and does a great job here, especially after watching the special features I love this Hatter. Just an example is how Depp had them put one eye slightly off from the other, the reason for doing so, you will have to buy and see for your self.<br /><br />Now before I get to any one else I have to say my absolute favorite in the film for sure is the Red Queen, Helena Bonham Carter. I have to admit that I love her as she is one of my favorite actresses ever, of all time, and well you get the idea. Her over sized head just gave me more to look at while she was giving the show stealing performance in my opinion. She hits the "Off with his head" line perfectly throughout the film and delivers me and my girl's favorite part off the film. That of course is when she yells "IDIOT" at Stayne; you know she is very much like my lady in this film. She yells that at me a lot 2, I'll let it slide today. Speaking of Stayne Crispin Glover as does an excellent job in this film and looks very, well, awkward I guess as he is very tall and thin. Still it was cool to see him in another theatrical release; I have always liked him ["Willard" is a classic].<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast they are all as good as the ones previously mentioned such as Anne Hathaway who plays the White Queen. Matt Lucas plays both the Tweedle brothers, Michael Sheen is the rabbit, Alan Rickman plays the Blue Caterpillar, but the show stealer from voice over characters has to be Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat. He steals every scene that he shows up in plus he is a big lazy looking cat like one that I own [it is her cat I swear, she made me get it, I never wanted to own cats but she forced them upon me I swear]. Well regardless of that the Cat is still a bright spot in this film, in fact the one thing that people who didn't like the movie can agree upon is that the acting was great.<br /><br />I must also say that the special features on this 3 Disc edition are wonderful and highly recommended, so get the Blu-Ray/DVD combo like we did. Also I think another reason I enjoyed this film so much [aside from Helena Bonham Carter, love her] is that my girl she loves Depp] and little cuz had a wonderful time with this film. Of course my cuz loved it because she is 6 and was completely sucked in by the wonderful images and characters that were before her. Whatever the case was for why I enjoyed this film so much I guess it really doesn't matter, this review is for my lady since she loved this film and would give it 5 out of 5. So here ya go baby the review I am sure you would have written yourself, Love You and happy Birthday.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>Let me get this out of the way first.<br />And I have a feeling many of you will laugh when you read this.<br />But....I have never read the original story.<br />All I knew was some girl named Alice fell down a hole and met a bunch of strange characters and that's about it.<br />Honestly?<br />I think that gave me an advantage to actually watch the film without expecting things to go a certain way.<br />I know a lot of critics are saying this version is too much like "Lord of the Rings".<br />I can't say if that's accurate or not but the ending hardly reminded me of anything out of "Lord of the Rings".<br />I was scared, I mean REALLY scared that Burton, even with Depp and the rest of the cast wouldn't be able to pull this off.<br />I was scared right in the beginning that the film would rapidly dissolve into something so bad and so corny it would be painful to watch.<br />It didn't.<br />In a sea of weird movies, this one has to be Burton's crowing jewel of weirdness.<br />If you thought "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was weird, you haven't seen ANYTHING.<br />This movie ups the weirdness factor by 100.<br />Is that a good thing?<br />It depends.....<br />Did you like "Charlie"?

It didn't, it blends seamlessly with the human actors into a film quite like no other.

I may or may not go see it again in 3D but I'm anxious to read what others say about the 3D version.<br />All in all,<br />"Alice in Wonderland" comes....<br />Highly Recommended!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>I've written a review of the film elsewhere -- it should be under the DVD reviews, dated in early March.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray... It's an improvement over the theatrical 3D version, as there are no glasses to dim the image, or cause a slight color shift. It is a beautiful film that takes full advantage of CGI and digital grading to create a plausible fantasy world. (Bayard the hound is particularly remarkable.) The transfer is gorgeous.<br /><br />My feelings about the film itself have not changed. Carroll's story is impossible to film in any way that's consistent with what we commonly expect from a motion picture. It's little more than a sequence of disconnected events, with no particular dramatic arc. This adaptation might not be ideal, but it's better than most -- there's a coherent storyline, and the overall approach is adult and on the dark side, as you would expect from a Tim Burton film. It is an acceptable and generally entertaining adaptation, which is why I've given it 4 stars. As other people will likely weight the film's strengths and weakness differently, their opinions will differ.<br /><br />One of the best things about the original story is that Alice has always been a plucky, argumentative character who's not easily intimidated -- so there's never been a need to redefine her in "feminist" terms. She only has to recover a bit of her "muchness" to face the Jabberwock -- Which, for some unknown reason, is referred to as the "Jabberwocky". How can Linda Wolverton /not/ have known the latter is the title of the poem -- not the monster?<br /><br />Lewis Carroll would probably have been less bothered by the changes to the story than by the more-explicit violence. (The original has a lot of nasty behavior and implied violence.) However, as a mathematician, he would undoubtedly been fascinated by our ability to model things as numbers, and manipulate them as desired.<br /><br />PS: The Mad Hatter's recitation of "Jabberwocky" has several significant errors. Why weren't they caught?</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>In many ways this is a good movie but is  it  Lewis Carroll's "Alice"?  Burton has taken some of the characters from Alice and "Through The Looking Glass" and stuffed them into this screen play which seems to be constructed from scraps of the books but with a  new and darker view.  The original works were very episodic but Burton has added details  and  more  of a plot in an attempt to make sense out of the original.  The result is a movie that is well done but barely resembles Alice.  However, many of the Alice characters are spectacularly drawn.  The Cheshire Cat is particularly well done as are Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, but the Dormouse seems to have drunk to much caffeine.  Depp's Mad Hatter is well done but is a new  and different  character whose madness seems to be  in his dress and appearance rather than in any disconnect from reality.  Gone are the talking flowers, the Duchess, and  many other parts of Wonderland along with Alice the young girl.  Instead the movie begins with Alice -- who is now 21 rather than 12 -- at a party.  This sequence is too long too boring and a ridiculous attempt to avoid the governess and a bored Alice falling down a rabbit  hole.  The end  of the movie concludes with another 10 minutes of these ridiculous people which does nothing for the film other than extend  it.  But, as bad as this party is it  is trumped by the totally awful dance done by Depp at the end of the movie.  The Jitterbug scene  was scrapped from Wizard of OZ because it would have spoiled the movie -- the Depp Dance Scene should have been scrapped from this one because it really ruined this movie.<br /><br /> Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" was very well done and clearly he wanted to meet or  exceed that standard but alas he has fallen short.  Nevertheless this is a  spectacular movie in many ways.  Wonderland is truly a wonder and the various characters very well done.  But Alice In Wonderland it  is not.  It is worth seeing but not worth seeing  again.  It is a 3 star effort at best.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I wish this film would have been more pyscadelic and trippy and less violent and boring.  I think they should have left out the battle sequence with the jaborwocky.  It reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings.  The only character I found interesting was Helena Bonham's character as the red queen.  Anne Hathaway totally overacted as the white queen and Johnny Depp was annoying as usual.  How could you mess up Alice in Wonderland?  It's not rocket science people.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Mad as a hatter and wildly audacious, this fantastical 2010 adventure turns Lewis Carroll's classic tale of surreal logic displacement on its ear. Who better to translate this story into a female empowerment parable than the master of quirky darkness, director Tim Burton, and his favorite muse Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter? The excesses of Burton's imagination, guided by Linda Woolverton's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB4">The Lion King</a>) sharp-tongued screenplay, result in a particularly idiosyncratic adaptation. Yet, as dazzling and sometimes scarifying as the computer-generated images are, the film is not overwhelmed by the visual elements and retains the basic themes of the original stories.<br /><br />Combining elements of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402725027">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a> with its sequel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0543900568">Through the Looking Glass</a>, the movie begins when a young Alice awakens from a nightmare in which she has visited Wonderland. The obviously precocious child questions her sanity to which her father assures her that it's fine to be "bonkers", all the best people are. Flash forward several years later, and Alice has become a rebellious nineteen-year-old on her way to a garden party where all the guests are to witness her being engaged to a patronizing fop named Hamish. She hesitates and asks for a moment at which point she chases a rabbit from her earlier dream into a hole. Perpetually shrinking and enlarging, she finds herself in not Wonderland but Underland where she sees all the talking creatures from her dream, but this time, they all question whether she is the real Alice. They all need the Alice of their collective memory, the one who would have no trouble defeating the monstrous Jabberwocky and ending the reign of the evil Red Queen.<br /><br />Once Alice joins the Mad Hatter's party, it becomes clear she is not in a dream of her making, that she is being signaled to make her own way in life and within Underland, ensure that the virtuous White Queen be restored to the throne, even donning Joan of Arc-like armor for the climactic battle scene. Australian actress Mia Wasikowska (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030E5NJ6">Amelia</a>) makes a terrifically wary Alice whose sense of wonder is tempered by her palpable search for self-confidence. As you would expect, Depp has the showiest role as the Mad Hatter, all leering smiles and electro-shock orange hair, and he makes the most of it despite an incongruous dance solo toward the end. With her head blown up three times its normal size, Helena Bonham Carter has a field day as the decapitation-crazed Red Queen as she barks orders at her lackeys and demands to be pampered with pigs being used as footrests.<br /><br />The rest of the cast make the impressions needed within the dimensions of the story - Stephen Fry as the dapper but cowardly Cheshire Cat; Crispin Glover as the villainous Knave of Hearts tending to the Red Queen's absurd orders; Alan Rickman as the surly, hookah-smoking Caterpillar; and English comedian Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, perhaps the most Disneyesque of the characters conceived here. Only Anne Hathaway disappoints in an arch turn as the White Queen, appearing to channel her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006L948">The Princess Diaries</a> co-star, Julie Andrews, in accentuated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JRB16U">Mary Poppins</a> mode. All the production values are first-class from Robert Stromberg's wildly varied production design to Dariusz Wolski's rich cinematography and Danny Elfman's bombastic music score. The movie does meander at various points, primarily to establish the next story turn, but fans of Burton's and Depp's work shouldn't be too disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>There was quite the schism when Tim Burton remade <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BB1MI2">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>.  Some felt like he'd injected a much needed dose of modern madness to Dahl's tale of Kids Behaving Badly.  Others felt like he'd bastardized an already <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009FGWN0">pitch perfect film</a> by making the whole thing acidic and aggressive.  He made the factory grander, weirder, and far more unsettling, and he took Gene Wilder's impishly subdued Wonka and made him into a twitchy germaphobe with creepy teeth.  I found it difficult to compare the two films, because it seemed like they were trying to do two completely different things.  The first film was about childish wonder and the fine line between growing up and growing old.  The second film was about daddy issues and the dangers of drug abuse.  I think.<br /><br />Burton's next big remake, ALICE IN WONDERLAND suffers from the same division of purpose.  In fact, it would be far better if the film had been billed as a sequel.  ALICE IN WONDERLAND II: BEYOND THE THUNDERDOME.  Alice is no longer a precocious and curious child, and when she falls down the rabbit hole this second time, she realizes that she misheard the name of the place when she was younger.  It's not called Wonderland.  It's called Underland.  Burton is known for his darkness, and that name change gives you a good idea of just where Burton applied most of the strokes of his grim, black brush.  The effect is contrary to what most people (fans of the original, for sure) will be expecting from the film.  The original was about the wonder and beauty of a child's imagination; this film is about the dreary blackness of control.<br /><br />Of course, the original Wonderland had its dark sides (not the least of which being a queen with a penchant for beheadings), but those dark sides were the unavoidable shadows you got from all the loony brightness that dripped from the trees or exploded from the ground (or just appeared out of thin air).  What Burton has done is take all that background menace and bring it straight to the fore, so that the wonder and enchantment take a backseat to the film's angry (and rather dull) plot.  What we have here is a Wonderland -- excuse me; I mean Underland -- that is steadily decaying under the rule of its Machiavellian queen ("It's better to be feared than loved," she mutters, a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979415403">The Prince</a> surely hidden beneath her dress).  According to a prophetic scroll, Alice must return and restore order to the world by dispatching of the queen's barbarous pet, the Jabberwocky (a beast lifted from a few of Carroll's poems).<br /><br />Wonderland as Carroll described it was always distinctly amoral.  It sprawled and seethed and pulsed with chaotic color.  Burton's Underland is all about justice and slavishness and it hisses with murky moodiness.  Instead of having a Mad Hatter of dizzying antics and baffling wordplay, you now have Depp's (oddly Scottish) Hatter, a man who is less mad than he is bi-polar.  One minute he is railing against the queen and crying for rebellion, the next minute he's sadly melting into himself as if struggling with senility.  He shares the screen with the excessively plastic White Queen (Anne Hathaway cheesing it up big time) and the encephalitic Red Queen (played by an emotionally mute Helena Bonham Carter; she uses about as many facial expressions as an actual deck of cards, and I never once believed her when she called for yet another person's head).  The only character who really lights up the screen is, of course, the Cheshire Cat, and even his psychotic omnipresence is neutered by the film's insistence on rules (I CANNOT believe a character actually claimed there were rules in Wonderland!) and structure.<br /><br />There's no real plot to Carroll's tale, and that was part of its beauty and charm.  Burton's movie, on the other hand, is what you get when people pretend that madness is supposed to make sense.  Although it doesn't need to be said that Burton has created a visually arresting tale (the 3D mostly a so-so addition), he hasn't done anything to enchant the mind or heart.  He has instead replaced Carroll's whimsy with bellicose dreariness, and he's supplanted the frivolity with your basic (and boring) movie morals: Believe in yourself!  Don't back down from adversity!  Enslave the Chinese with the opium trade!<br /><br />Forget I said that last part.  I'm not sure what it has to do with the movie, unless it's Burton's way of slapping himself in his own face.  You won't get the reference unless you see the film to the very end anyway.  If you do, then you might find, like I did, that this final moment of the movie makes the preceding bits all the darker.  It proves that, although fun in all the most obvious ways, Burton's film still lacks charm, grandeur, and the kind of loony and limitless innocence that makes Wonderland a place anyone -- young or old -- would ever want to visit.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Alice in Wonderland is a splendid movie by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as the mad hatter, and Mia Masikowska as Alice. The special effects are amazing and the storyline is very well-written. The music is effective and overall it is a movie that I very much liked to watch. Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter also play their parts to perfection. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>OK, I had my doubts about this film.<br /><br />I will STILL watch the 1951 Disney classic above  this one.<br /><br />I had doubts when "Pocahontas" was released in 1995.  Turned out to be a great film.<br /><br />This film is good NOT GREAT.  I have never read the Lewis Carroll book, just know the 1951 film.<br /><br />Of course, we do NOT have songs in this 1.  You can always listen to the songs in the 1951 film.<br /><br />Depp, he has done this type of role before, so this was no stretch for him.  Carter, Burton's girlfriend so that is how she keeps getting these parts in his film, good as the Red Queen.  The big head bit....with special effects the way the are today this effect should have been done better.  Hathaway needs Disney to get hit films.  OK job as the White Queen with no screen time till 2cd half of film.<br /><br />Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum were a let down compared to the 1951 film.  All the animated characters NOT even close to the classic film.<br /><br />The ending was bit of a let down.<br /><br />NOW, I find myself having to say this with recent Disney DVD releases.<br />A line on the back of this DVD case describing the film "The extraordinary characters you've loved come to life richer and MORE COLORFUL THAN EVER".  OK, Disney, if you are prompting how the film looks then why are you guys resorting to PLAIN SILVER DVD' LIKE WHEN DVD'S CAME OUT IN THE LATE 1990'S?<br /><br />No chapter search list or any information on film inside.<br /><br />Disney has gone CHEAP & I just hate this.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>ALICE IN WONDERLAND  is a merry mixed bag of a film.  The criticisms range from adulation to condemnation and that usually identifies an artwork worth visiting.  No, this is not Lewis Carroll's wondrous book intact: it s a variation on a theme of that book and there are so many aspects of the original here that those whose childhoods (and adulthoods) captured so much of the wild imagination and hilarious dialogue of this ma group of otherland creations that the film will at least connect on many levels to everyone.  One suspects that with the manner in which the movie begins (a haughty 'engagement announcement' party at which the now 19 year old Alice Kingsleigh is set up to become betrothed to a dullard geek and runs from the gazebo setting out of dismay) is the reason for the restoration of individualism in the Alice that returns from slide down the rabbit hole return to Wonderland.  Linda Woolverton's screenplay is creaky at times, but wisely keeps enough of the fantasy alive before drowning it in an ending that is perilously close to gluttonous CGI mess.<br /><br />The flavor is pure Tim Burton and his style fits this adaptation well.  To justify the return of the elder Alice to the world at the end of the rabbit hole Burton has to have a driver: Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is needed to evict the evil Red Queen (Helen Bonham Carter so that the good White Queen (a miscast Anne Hathaway) can restore calm and order to Underland.  Many of Carroll's characters are used as CGI creations - Tweedledum/Tweedledee (voice of Matt Lucas), Cheshire Cat (voice of Stephen Fry), the White Rabbit (voice of Michael Sheen), the Blue Caterpillar (a wonderful voice character for Alan Rickman), the talking Flowers (voice of Imelda Staunton), and the hound dog Bayard (voice of Timothy Spall), etc.  The Mad Hatter is well captured by Johnny Depp and some genuine realism is added via the transformative presence of Marton Csokas as the young Alice's now departed father Charles Kingsleigh.<br /><br />Where the movie gets off track is the final battle with the monsters that protect the Red Queen.  It just gets expensively silly here and certainly not a film for young children: the violence is disturbing.  But there is enough to like in this DVD version - even without the advantage (I suppose there was one) of theatrical 3D.  And as Alice keeps reminding everyone, 'This is MY dream.'

In fact, they are full of it!  I have to admit, I went into ALICE IN WONDERLAND expecting the worst.  I had heard some terrible things from friends who had already seen it, and the trailers didn't give me much hope, either.  But since I frequently believe in six impossible things before breakfast, I decided to try ALICE IN WONDERLAND for myself. And I am so glad that I did.  ALICE IN WONDERLAND is an incredible mash up of Lewis Carroll's two Alice books - "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There."<br /><br />Let's face it.  Tim Burton is a very odd director, and the original Alice books are quite odd themselves.  Put the two together and you get amazing brilliance.  Remember, Disney's animated Alice in Wonderland is not very true to the source material; rather it is, well, a Disneyfied version of a small part of Lewis Carroll's original works.  Carroll accomplished quite a feat with the Alice books:  he wrote a fanciful story that really appealed to children, and combined it with a strong satire very relevant to the political world of the time.  And perhaps the most astonishing thing of all is that his works continue to be so well known.  Many, many words and phrases from the Alice stories have become part of our lexicon and are still in use, even today.<br /><br />But, back to this film rendition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  This ALICE IN WONDERLAND opens with Alice, age 19, about to get engaged.  She doesn't really want to, but it is what is expected of her.  We realized that Alice is an unusual girl:  she has a mind of her own, modern ideas, and she has been plagued by mysterious dreams all her life.  Alice is dreading her engagement (she doesn't even particularly like the young man), when suddenly she is distracted by a rabbit...in a waistcoat, no less!  Of course, she follows him, avoids her own proposal, and falls down a rabbit hole.  Once she lands, a long, long way down, there are many of the expected Alice experiences from the original book, ending with Alice eventually being the right size to enter Wonderland.  Once she is there, people keep asking if she is THE Alice, the REAL Alice, and Alice slowly begins to understand that her dreams...her nightmares...have perhaps, maybe, been memories.  But is she the real Alice?  Is she the champion?  And can she save Wonderland from the Red Queen?<br /><br />Tim Burton works his usual brand of extraordinary magic bringing Wonderland to life.  The sets and effects in ALICE IN WONDERLAND are outstanding - dark, colorful, and wonderfully weird.  The bandersnach, the jubjub bird, and the jabberwock look very similar to the original illustrations and exactly as I have pictured them in my head all these years.  Dee and Dum are definitely Tweedly.  And the beamish vorpal sword does indeed go snicker-snack on the Frabjous day.  The Rev. Dodgson would have been amazed and proud at seeing his imagination brought to life so vividly.  The acting and voice talent are incredible, including the incomparable Johnny Depp as the appropriately mad Hatter, Stephen Fry as the voice of a delicious Cheshire cat, Severus Snape, uh, I mean Alan Rickman as the voice of the hookah-smoking Blue Caterpillar, Mia Wasikowska as a near perfect Alice, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway as ideal opposite foils portraying the Red and White Queens respectively, Christopher Lee as the terrible Jabberwock, and a veritable host of others.  The cast assembled for ALICE IN WONDERLAND is what makes this film click, and all put in amazing performances.<br /><br />I can certainly see that ALICE IN WONDERLAND is not for everyone.  It is a very odd and strange film, but, in my humble opinion, in a good way.  And in a way that is true to Lewis Carroll's original writings.  If you like the bizarre and unusual, if you think you CAN believe in six impossible things before breakfast, then this ALICE IN WONDERLAND is definitely for you.  My husband and I really loved it, when we had not expected to.  It really surprised us.  And that is what defines ALICE IN WONDERLAND as a truly great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>Tim Burton and Johnny Depp never fail to please!

While these films all have their charms, they do tend to be tough going for some viewers.  Part of this stems from the fact that the original story is very episodic.  The titular heroine basically jumps from meeting one weird character to the next with no real growth until she wakes up from her "dream."  The other obstacle is the fact that Alice can sometimes come across as insufferable prig!!!  In an attempt to address these problems, Tim Burton tried not to recreate the novel itself, but to fashion a sequel of sorts featuring a now 19 year old Alice.  When she gets a marriage proposal from an insipid lord at a "surprise" engagement party., she sees a very familiar White Rabbit nearby.  She escapes the party and chases the Rabbit to the usual rabbit hole and falls into a new adventure where she not only must help her old acquaintances, but discover herself as well.<br /><br />As always, Burton has a dark sensibility that actually works with the subject material and the art direction of this film is nothing short of spectacular.  This sensitivity also extends to the varied residents as well.  Danny Elfman provides a wonderfully quirky score to match the mood.  Mia Wasikowska makes for a lovely Alice.  However, it takes her about a quarter of the film before she really becomes likable. Still, she does help ground the film with an otherwise solid performance.  Johnny Depp is always interesting to watch, and his daft Mad Hatter is no exception here.  Unfortunately, his performance is not quite on a par of such more recent roles like Sweeney Todd or Capt. Jack Sparrow.  Part of that stems from the Scottish accent in his more serious moments that seems more like a gimmick than real emotion.  Ann Hathaway's spacey White Queen doesn't fare much better.  More fun is the voice work of British comedian Stephen Fry who is a delightfully suave Cheshire Cat.  Alan Rickman and Christopher Lee do solid work as the a hookah smoking caterpillar and  the Jabberwocky respectively.  However, it is Helena Bonham Carter who steals the show with her wild over-the-top turn as the wicked Red Queen.<br /><br />The film goes at a rather leisurely pace that definitely picks up as you take in the delightful visuals.  The story starts out quite promising, but it does end with a climax that is very derivative. Despite all that, there is much to recommend for this version.  Diehard Carroll fans might howl at the liberties taken with this "sequel" but this is still a film worth seeing and recommending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>There's a lot of criticism focusing around Tim Burton at the moment and it's spiked at the release of this film. The major criticisms directed at Burton focus on his lack of any original ideas and the re-casting of the same actors in every film he makes. Johnny Depp is a great actor; I don't think anybody would deny this, but to cast him in almost every movie made by Burton is just insane and has become repetitive to the point it runs the possibility of damaging his career and casting a negative shadow over the serious roles he has played in the past and may play in the future. Anyway, back to the film...<br /><br />19 year old Alice Kingsleigh is a girl in a difficult situation. Haunted by weird dreams and still mourning the loss of her father, Alice is faced with the decision of deciding whether to marry a man she cannot foresee a life with, despite her family's wishes to marry the man in question. Events lead her to find herself falling down a hole, landing her in a place called Underland which is filled with a number of strange people and creatures and turns her perception of her own life upside down. Greeted by Doremouse, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and the white rabbit, she is told that she is the right Alice and that it is her destiny to fight the Red Queen's Jabberwocky on Frabjous day to restore the White Queen to power.<br /><br />That is the general gist of the movie plot, but naturally, the story includes the legendary Mad Hatter (Depp) and other wondrous creatures which are lead by a truly brilliant cast. The main cast, both voicing and live action consist of Hatter (Depp), Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter), Absolem (Alan Rickman), Tweedledum & Dee (Matt Lucas), White Queen (Anne Hathaway), Nivens McTwisp (Michael Sheen) to name but a few. I would say that the cast are the real saviours of this film as without them, this would have been a bland attempt at re-inventing the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland story.<br /><br />I like Burton's work, I really do. Beetlejuice is up there as one of my all time favourites and Edward Scissorhands isn't far behind. But these were new and fresh ideas created solely from the mind of a genius; but his most recent works have simply been gothic reinventions of classic novels or movies we have all heard of at some point. This is where Burton fails in my head as, although I find his style of film making interesting and visually, the films become quite intriguing, it's all the same just with a different plot. It has come to a point where you can safely say to people that when you've seen one Burton movie, you've seen them all. When considering his works over the past decade, that couldn't be more true.<br /><br />That aside, I liked this film. It was a simple and easy way to kill a few hours and I have to admit that it was kind of interesting to see Burton's twist on this classic tale, so it's sort of understandable to see exactly why he still manages to release financially successful movies. I would recommend this if you already have the curiosity to see this, or if you have some time to kill; otherwise, if I were you, I just wouldn't bother.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This movie is an interesting blend of excellent professionalism in production and acting along with a very personal interpretation of the Wonderland venue. The execution of the component parts of the film are all first class and very competent; it's just the overall result is rather grim and excessive.<br /><br />Johnny Depp does his usual remarkable job of being strange; his versatility continues to amaze me as he shifts roles and appearances like a real pro from film to film. The sound and video quality on the Blu-ray version left nothing to be desired.<br /><br />As one reviewer pointed out this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland; the first one was initially forgotten by Alice but comes back to her toward the end of the movie where she begins to remember bits and pieces of her first trip.<br /><br />I watched this movie as a rental and I'm glad I did; I will probably never seek it out to watch it again. Although it's rated PG I would caution parents of small children about the threatening and rather dark ambience of the film.<br /><br />Your enjoyment of this movie may likely depend on the extent of your enthusiasm for Tim Burton's style of directing; if you are a fan you will probably love this movie. If you're not sure whether you're a fan or not, rent it first.</p></br><a href="../users/A8S11VP9Z36D6.html">A8S11VP9Z36D6</a><br/><p>I was totally disinterested in seeing this movie until I saw the preview at the El Capitan. Visually, this movie had me hooked immediately! Lush (yet dark), detailed, and full of wonderful imagery, it was a feast for the eyes. The movie itself didn't disappoint, and neither did this blu-ray version. Rather than retell the previously oft-filmed tale, Burton picks up where the other two Lewis Carroll tales ended and gives us an exploration of Alice's emotional state as she transitions from childhood to adulthood. Alice's father has passed on, and she is about to be proposed to by an extremely nerdy (but wealthy) Lord. Unsure that this is the future that she wants, escapes the engagement party by following the white rabbit and promptly falling into a rabbit hole to find herself in Underland. Much darker than the Wonderland we are used to, Underland is held hostage by the evildoings of The Red Queen. Waiting for Alice to find her "muchness" and rescue it, The Mad Hatter and The White Queen have waited a long time for her to return. Will Alice be up to the task of leading The White Queen's Army to save Underland?<br /><br />It is a lot of fun along the way with fantastic performances by the Tim Burton troupe of actors that you usually find in his flicks: Johnny Depp (a perfectly fresh interpretation of The Mad Hatter, thus redeeming himself from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BBOUU4">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>), Helena Bonham Carter (practically steals the show as The Red Queen), Crispin Glover (characteristically dark, quirky, and evil as The Knave of Hearts), and Anne Hathaway (showing her acting versatility as The White Queen). With all of the talent surrounding her, it is a testimony to the talent of Mia Wasikowska (Alice) that she is able to act without getting swallowed up and upstaged by the others.<br /><br />There are plenty of special effects and computer graphics here, but the fantastic part is that one only notices the beauty of the film and the wonderfully wacky characters. The mood of the film is enhanced by the music of Danny Elfman.<br /><br />As for the quality of the blu-ray transfer, it is superb. Just as in the theater, the computer graphics are well rendered and the picture is rich (albeit dark because of the tone of the film) and the sound is rich and robust.<br /><br />3-Disc Combo Pack comes with Blu-ray with feature and extras, a DVD copy with feature and extras, and a Digital Copy of Feature Film.<br /><br />SPECS:<br />Video: 1080p High Def 1:78.1<br />Audio: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48Hz/24-bit); English 2.0 DVS, French & Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround * Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />BONUS FEATURES (Video: 1080p High Def or 480i * Audio: English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital * Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish)<br /><br />Sneak Previews: Tinker Bell promotes the Blu-ray format, Disney Movie Rewards ad, Beauty & The Beast Diamond Edition (Blu-ray), James & The Giant Peach Special Edition (Blu-ray), Fantasia Diamond Edition (Blu-ray), Disney Parks ad, Family Blu-ray & Combo Packs Ad, The Sorcerer's Apprentice with Nic Cage trailer, Tinker Bell & The Great Fairy Rescue, and an Anti-Smoking ad!<br /><br />Featurettes:<br /><br />Although not overly long, they were a fantastic look into the making of the film, with all of the major participants being interviewed, including Johnny Depp, Crispin Glover, Danny Elfman, and the rest of the gang.<br /><br />Wonderland Characters (27:56)<br /><br />1. Finding Alice: Talks about Alice's emotional journey as she learns to embrace her courage and matures into womanhood.<br /><br />2. The Mad Hatter: Depp talks about how The Mad Hatter has been frozen in time, waiting for Alice to return. Interesting to hear how he developed his characterization. Both he and Burton independently made sketches of how they thought the character should look. Very cool to see them side-by-side!<br /><br />3. The Futterwacken: This is the one part of the movie I thought was lame. Still, the guy who did the dance for Depp (yup, just found out it wasn't Depp who actually danced in the movie! As he states, "Another man futterwacked for me!") is very talented. He was found through a clip on Youtube!<br /><br />4. The Red Queen: Carter obviously relished this role (even though she lost her voice daily from the loudness of her character). The combination of villainy and childlike petulance actually makes her somewhat endearing, and she pulls it off marvelously. Carter also loved the props--the glasses, the scepter. These were actual props (not CG) that helped her with her characterization.<br /><br />5. Time Lapse: Sculpting the Red Queen: 3 hours each day in the makeup chair! See it all come together.<br /><br />6. The White Queen: Hathaway's performance was an unexpected treat. Depp states, "She made me jealous--I wanted to play the White Queen." Burton let Hathaway show a little darkness and "explore the off-side of someone who is supposed to be good." Hathaway herself says that her character is "A little ditsy, but very clued in--kind of a Norma Desmond thing."<br /><br />Making Wonderland (19:28)<br />1. Scoring Wonderland: Danny Elfman collaborates again with Tim Burton (for about the 12th time). You'll want to listen closely to the music on the next viewing after listening to Elfman talk about how and why he created some of the eerie vocal choruses in the film.<br /><br />2. Effecting Wonderland: Tim Burton relates how the cast had to feel like they were in the real AND the unreal world. Really amazing what a fantastic job all the actors did, especially considering that many of the costumes, sets, and more were done post-production on the computer. The film is a melding of CG, motion capture, and live action. Interesting to see how the Red Queen's head is enlarged. This is all way beyond my comprehension of how they figured it out and then kept track of all this stuff!<br /><br />3. Stunts of Wonerland: Garrett Warren (stunt coordinator) discusses how he read the script and had to break down each scene into what would need stunts and how they would be done. Shows green-screen filming of Mia as Alice as she tumbles down the rabbit hole.<br /><br />4. Making The Proper Size: Tells of the frustration experienced by Mia when having to be different sizes in the film, acting towards different site lines since most of the size change was done post-filming on a computer.<br /><br />5. Cakes of Wonderland: Made by the Cake Divas (Joan Spitler and Leigh Grode), even this tiny detail was given much attention. They researched and then baked items that would be found at a Victorian Tea Party. The table had to be reset 12 times! And yes, the "Eat Me" cake was truly edible, as Alice had to bite into it for filming 32 times.<br /><br />6. Tea Party Props: details the decor on the Mad Hatter's tea party. The look is inspired by what one would expect at a wartime tea or the great depression. Much work had to go into this scene, as 3 of everything had to be made in addition to breakaway pieces for the destruction. In all, there were about 150 pieces to manage and keep track of.<br /><br />OVERALL: HIGHLY recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>I didn't feel a compulsion to see this film. I like Johnny Depp but don't have the need to see whatever role he's taken on.<br /><br />But a friend wanted to go and I tagged along.<br /><br />Here are a few things that surprised me.<br /><br />I liked it. Didn't love it but liked it enough that I can suggest that those who love good vs. evil, mythical war scenes and mild to moderate adventure to give it a shot.<br /><br />Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter is a skillfully played and entertaining if sadly whimsical character but he is not the main player. The point of view is primarily Alice. The Hatter doesn't appear until about a half hour or so into the film and then comes and goes after that. His film time ends up being maybe half of the film. The Red Queen is a slightly bigger (pun intended) player in the whole storyline. The well done and creepily compelling characterization by Helena Bonham Carter may never, never leave my psyche.<br /><br />The plot line is a parallel story to the traditional Alice adventure. Some of the plot is familiar like the shrinking and growing Alice, tea parties and beheadings. What's not familiar is an interesting addition to a more grown-up version. The first 15-20 minutes is very low key in the adventure department so don't expect to find yourself plunging immediately into a rabbit hole.<br /><br />I don't know that I'd recommend this film for very sensitive children. Tim Burton and Depp fans may or may not love it. I'd watch it again and probably will but I probably won't own it for regular viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>I was not too excited about the upcoming 3D adaptation - continuation of the classical books by the English Math Professor known to the world as Lewis Carroll about the adventures of a young girl named Alice in the Wonder/Under-land. I consider the best adaptation of the book, the closest to its spirit directed by Jan Svankmajer in 1988. I went to see Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton in 3D because I remembered how wonderful it was to see Avatar few months ago in 3D. The 3D features in Alice are nice addition to the film, and I would never say that the Burton's film is not beautiful, and the Wonderland he creates is not magical and entertaining but I felt that something was missing. I wanted to be amazed, fascinated, to be changed constantly like Alice herself but it did not happen. While watching the film I was thinking, oh, it is so much like The Wizard of Oz for 21st Century - the Good Witch, the Wicked Witch, and the brave girl who returns to the world she visited once and can't forget. Then, during the final battle Alice transforms into a Jean of Arc - like warrior with the magic sword in the shining arms. The story of the grown up Alice that bookends the Wonderland visions seems to be written to make Alice who is not a child but a 19 years old in the film, an inspirational young woman, the early feminist. It's been a long time since I read fabulously twisted Carroll's stories but as far as I remember, their charm is in the captivating words games, in the unexplained and extraordinary strange situations and deliciously absurd characters. It is also in the ability to look on the same event from totally different perspective. Just remember how many times and how suddenly and instantly Alice changes her size and perception of unreal reality. Tim Burton and his screenwriter tried to give some logic and explanation to the world of dreams, fantasy and absurdity. As a result, the film turned into another version of the struggle between good and evil, which closely resembles the story of the girl named Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. I felt like in the struggle between Tim Burton, a highly creative, imaginative Artist who is at his best while producing the dark visions, and the Disney studio that financed the film, there is no convincing victory. For the film that was made to include the young children as the target audience, Alice is too dark, complex, and scary. For the older viewers open to any complexity coming from the union of Burton and Carroll made in the cinematic haven, the film is strangely dull, slow, and boring. It could be easily described by one simple equation, Barton + Disney = Cheshire cat without a smile. It is really strange because the production values of the film are very high, and the actors enjoy playing weird and creepy characters. It was pleasure to see Johnny Depp as a Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous big-headed Red Queen but I think that Crispin Glover deserves special mention as the Knave of Hearts, the personal assassin to the Red Queen and her confidant.<br /><br />I don't regret seeing Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland at the theater but next time I want to see the cinematic equivalent of the Carroll's book, I'd pull from the shelf DVD Jan Svankmajer's Alice which is still my favorite Carroll's adaptation</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>For someone who is not a big fan of the story "Alice in Wonderland," I am surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. In Tim Burton's film, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is all grown up and escapes from an unwanted marriage proposal by falling down a rabbit hole and returning to the strange world she visited during her childhood. The kingdom is in peril, suffering under the rule of the Red Queen (played brilliantly by Helena Bonham Cater, who is by far the best part of the movie). Alice encounters many old friends, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), who attempts to help Alice slay the Red Queen's Jabberwocky and save the kingdom.<br /><br />This is a very good film. The story is clever and the cast is very good, with the exception of Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. (Her idea of acting in this film is keeping her arms raised above her head the entire time. So annoying.) I saw the movie in 3D, which is something I didn't think I would enjoy but actually did. Instead of being a distraction, the 3D effects just served to make Alice's world look even stranger.<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" still isn't my favorite fairy tale, but this new and improved version is much more enjoyable than the original Disney cartoon, and I recommend seeing it in the theatre for the 3D experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Watching Alice, you'd never think you were watching a Tim Burton film. Burton is a creative director with an eye for whimsy and colorful as well as strange and macabre-but you feel none of that when watching Alice in Woderland. Yes it is vivid and full of color and wonky shaped objects fill every screen-but it never really resonates with you. There is no mystery or 'wow' factor. It's sort of pretty to look at, but that's all it is.<br /><br />The actual story is a tad confusing as well as you're not really sure if you are watching a sequel to anything or a retelling. It just feels sort of hasty and rushed in certain parts. There is no flow or direction and then your at the end of the film and it all just feels...strange. And speaking of strange, I just found the ending (after she leaves Wonderland) really weird and pointless, unless I missed something entirely while watching the very beginning.<br /><br />In regards to characters and acting, Helena Bonham Carter is the star of this production, by far. She's crazy, delusional and utterly perfect in this role. Even hearing "off with their head!" didn't get stale after so long. Johhny Depp as the Mad Hatter was a dissapointment. He's supposed to be loony, but there are times when you think he knows exactly what he's doing. His accent is distracting and overall, I just wasn't feeling the performance. Anne Hathaway has a short but cute part as the White Queen, the evil Queen of Heart's sister. It's slightly over the top but works for her. As for the Alice herself, played by Mia Wasikowska, well to be honest, I barely remember her. She was very passive and bland throughout the entire film and didn't really emote , well, anything. I can't review this film properly without including Mr. Alan Rickman...He plays Caterpillar, of course, and though his role is very small, it is also quite enjoyable. It's amazing what that man does with his voice. He flawlessy goes from berating to indifferent to sarcastic all in the span of a sentence. Just brilliant.<br /><br />All in all I was dissapointed. What should have been a slam dunk for Burton turned out to be a bore-fest. All the ingredients are there-but he just didn't cook up a good one this time around...</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>The good news is that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, as a team, always dazzle - and this time is no exception. Effects are truly special: the Tweedles, Red Queen, and all the rest come across with utterly realistic surrealism. The initial fall down the rabbit hole has just the right roller-coaster sensation: scary, but not too scary. And the star power here - too many notables to name - means that acting talent will help smooth over bumps in the scripting. Then, Burton's inevitable dark note brought this closer to Dodgson's Alice than nearly any other. I expected this to supplant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305779635">Svankmajer's</a> peculiar fantasy or that amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CG8I8">BBC version</a> as my favorite.<br /><br />My favorites need not have worried. This movie offers fair adventure, a young heroine rising to heroic demands, a modern bit of rebellion against Victorian constraints, and delighfully bizarre fantasy. It just doesn't offer Alice as we knew her. Instead, Burton let Alice grow up, then placed her within a sequel to Lewis Carroll's originals. I always have reservations about modern writers collaborating posthumously with others no longer able to defend their work - and this just helps solidify that distrust.<br /><br />So, this movie presents an effect-filled romp, with some novel effects that I expect to see more of. It brings a modern rewriting to straight-jacketed Victorian sexism. It splashes the screen with amazing visuals (even in 2D). It just isn't Alice. Therein lies my disappointment.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Not your childhood Alice by any means. Tim Burton directed it, Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter, and the voice of the hookah-smoking caterpillar is Alan Rickman (aka Professor Snape). A lovely young Mia Wasikowska plays Alice as a 19-year-old who has followed a rabbit in a waistcoat down a rabbit hole to escape a put-up job of an engagement party to a total twirp of a young lord.<br /><br />This one answers a question I had as a child: why did Alice's clothes shrink and grow when she did? In this one, they do not. When she's tiny, and hiding in a tea pot so that the knave of hearts won't find her, Hatter fashions a little dress for her from the shreds of the dress (or maybe chemise?) she was wearing as of the earlier shrinking. Then when she's in the Red Queen's garden and grows very large, she is hiding behind some trees because she "outgrew" her clothes.<br /><br />The story is that this is (or is not?) the same Alice who was in Underland when she was a child, and called it Wonderland. This time her mission is to take up the Vorpel sword and slay the Jabberwock.<br /><br />The funniest character in the story is the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who has an enormous head -- literally. Also an enormous ego. She has a sort of lisp, and sounds a lot like Madeline Kahn. In fact, I was surprised to find that the actress was one I had not heard of before; the sound of her voice was so familiar.<br /><br />Great fun, especially if you can put aside any expectation that it follows the original story.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />This is a review of the Blu-Ray version (non-3D) of this film.  The video was almost excellent.  Some of the scenes, and faces, seemed soft and dull, and that may just be how the movie was made.  Lot's of detail mostly.<br /><br />The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio ES 6.1 Matrix, whatever that means.  Anyway, it was very good to great.  Lot's of surround sound.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>I'm sure the 3D version was better with lots of eye candy.<br /><br />Given that the usual high end people were involved with this production, I wasn't impressed.<br /><br />e.g. Willy Wonka - The Chocolate Factory<br />This movie was delightfully twisted from the original Gene Wilder version.<br /><br />Frankly, I think Burton should have gone R with this movie to make it interesting.<br />I was falling asleep, so thankfully it was terse.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the story, there was nothing new to report.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010) had an excellent surprise - for me, anyway - in the form of the beautiful, enchanting Mia Wasikowska as Alice. I don't care what this actress' age is: she is sexy, she is sweet and she can act. And boy, did she have to really act in this otherwise strange, lifeless film.<br /><br />I know, I know: it's TIM BURTON! It's JOHNNY DEPP! It's a ton of British and other loveable voices from today's Great Age of Cinema! It's innovative in color, CGI animation and other nonentities. Ho-HUM!!<br /><br />Why am I so icy about this film? Well, where to start. 1) Crispin Glover (THE DONNER PARTY) whom I have always loved deserves a better major comeback than this. 2) Alan Rickman could have found a different speech cadence than Severus Snape to play the caterpillar. Also ... enough of Helena Bonham Carter and her amateurish, over-the-top nonsense and one may say the same about Depp, by the way. Where is the Depp of SLEEPY HOLLOW?<br /><br />The great Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat was one of the highlights of this rather boring and at times disturbing 'sequel' to the classic Alice in Wonderland story I know from my childhood. (Never liked it.) Michael Sheen was a very welcome voice; Anne Hathaway was downright creepy as she usually is. Christopher Lee, a lifelong favorite of mine, sounds too much like Count Dooku.<br /><br />I'd only add: buy at your own risk. Though it has superlative special effects and some brightness of spirit, I didn't like it, but that's just me. So don't come throwing hate-mail-wrapped bricks through my windows.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>"Alice in Wonderland" is Tim Burton-lite but that will appeal to the young and old, without becoming overly dark or twisted.<br /><br />The 2010 film directed by Tim Burton ("Corpse Bride", "The Nightmare Before Christmas", "Beetlejuice") and a screenplay by Linda Woolverton ("The Lion Queen", "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey", "Beauty & the Beast") is loosely based on the Lewis Carrol 1903 classic "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".<br /><br />Featuring a production by Team Todd (The Austin Powers films, "Memento", "Across the Universe"), the 2010 Disney incarnation received a lot of buzz when the announcement was made that the film would feature a reunion of both director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp but the that the film would feature a cast tat would include Mia Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Alan Rickman and many more.  The film would also receive buzz about the creation of the world of Wonderland and the extensive use of CG, especially with its steep production budgeted at around $200 million.<br /><br />Despite receiving reviews that were 50/50 from film critics, there is no denying that a Tim Burton film would bring people to the theaters and in this case, the Burton and Depp mystique would help bring in over $996 million dollars in the box office.  The film would achieve the sixth highest grossing opening weekend of all time and the highest opening weekend for a non-sequel and also surpassing "Avatar" in the IMAX and is currently the highest grossing film of 2010.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1) and for the most part, "Alice in Wonderland" is a film that showcases a great amount of detail on Blu-ray but in terms of colors, for example, Alice going with her mother for a party, the color seem quite muted (like it's overcast) and I looked at it as a way for the film to show the viewer how Alice was a bit disenchanted with her life.  When she falls into the hole, we notice a different, surreal landscape that was created digitally.<br /><br />In fact, you will see in the special features that a large part of the film was created alongside a green screen, so for the most part, the film is CG-heavy and one can expect gorgeous CG graphics for Wonderland.  Blacks are nice and deep and scenes such as the Red Queen's lair and the use of reds are quite vibrant.  And as mentioned, there is a good amount of detail.  From Mad Hatter's hat to the tea party and more.<br /><br />As for the DVD version that is included with the three-disc Blu-ray release, the DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 (enhanced for 16?9 televisions).<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit), English 2.0 DVS,  Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The lossless audio was very well done as the film is quite immersive.  From crowd ambiance, to the smallest noises created by the Red Queen's servants to the thunder clouds approaching nearby, to the galloping horses, the march of the soldiers and more.  Dialogue is crystal clear through the front channels as Danny Elfman's music utilizes the front channels while the surrounds utilize the special effects.  From Alice falling through the hole and hitting various objects to the various characters running from the Red Queen's soldiers and more.<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" may not be action-heavy but the 5.1 DTS-HD MA is no slouch either.  Audio is well done for this film and overall, a satisfying, immersive lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />As for the DVD version that is included with the three-disc Blu-ray release, the DVD is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and English 2.0 DVS French and Spanish.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the film is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" comes with the following special features (in 1080p High Definition or 480i, Audio in English 5.1 or 2.0 and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish):<br /><br />  * WONDERLAND CHARACTERS: (27:56)  This segment contains the following special features:<br /><br />- Finding Alice - The special effects, costume design and more.<br /><br />- The Futterwacken Dance - Futterwhat?

The 3-Disc release comes with a slip cover featuring artwork different than the main cover insert.  Also, the film comes with a DVD version of "Alice in Wonderland" and a Digital Copy.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Tim Burton was able to create a magical world of Wonderland with its characters with the heavy use of CG.  The film was literally filmed with a big green screen all around and people having to wear it while most of the work was then added via post-production in making sure the characters, the scenery and of courts the animals and inhabitants of this world are captured quite well in the film.  So, I had no doubt that the Blu-ray release would look good because mostly everything is CG-driven.<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" is a film that was received 50/50 and for the majority of the critics who are familiar with the Lewis Carrol novel, the film was a major deviation from the actual story.  Whereas the novel was about a young Alice who ends up in Wonderland and interacts with the inhabitants of the land including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen and Duchess and literally an adventurous experience of a girl in a new land.<br /><br />As for the Linda Woolverton screenplay, the film is about a young adult Alice who faces adulthood.  Not knowing how to explain her emotions and being asked to take part in a marriage (in which she doesn't love the man), she just wants to escape.  In Wonderland, this escape from reality is where Alice gets to know her true self and learn how to stand up for herself without anyone calling the shots in her life.  Call it a coming-of-age film, "Alice in Wonderland" deals with a young woman not knowing her true strength but when her life and her new friends lives are in danger, she is the only one that can defeat the Red Queen's biggest weapon.  She may not think that it is possible but her brief stay in Wonderland will eventually be an incredible test.<br /><br />Typically, I am a reviewer who tends to find CG-driven films to be quite banal of late.  Granted, "Avatar" was a film that was extremely well-crafted and as for "Alice in Wonderland", I actually enjoyed the world that Tim Burton and staff was able to create. Wonderland may be lush but a CG film can only go so far.  It depends on the characters and its storyline.  And reading a number of reviews, the film was split 50/50 for critics who enjoyed it or those who felt the film was to astray when compared to the original novel or just more eye candy and an unappealing film.<br /><br />Sean P. Menas, film critic for The Salt Lake Tribune wrote, "Burton's overamped, visually frenetic and chaotically action-heavy adaptation of "Alice in Wonderland" manages to be both too much and not enough of what a retelling of Alice should be."<br /><br />I have to agree with Sean P. Menas and that "Alice in Wonderland" is a film that could have been an amazing trilogy if given the chance.  As I pondered about the film, sure, images of "Lord of the Rings" came to mind but it would have been great if there was more to the story of "Alice in Wonderland" because 109 minutes did not seem enough.  And I felt that Tim Burton's storyline was diluted by its pacing of trying to get from point A to point B so quickly that I found myself more in-tuned with Alice's character and Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter was just a creepy character that needed more time.  Even the Cheshire Cat which was so instrumental in the novel was left with very little in the film.<br /><br />Michael Smith of the Tulsa World writes, "A disappointment on a massive scale canvas, Burton's "Alice in Wonderland" is a beautiful, giant bore that's almost comedy-free. It may be of some interest to adults, but kids will be bored to tears, unless they don't listen to the leaden dialogue and imagine they are watching a new video game."<br /><br />Although, I didn't find "Alice in Wonderland" as a giant bore, I found it to be entertaining and felt it was a film that had potential but in the end, making you feel it was OK or good but not fantastic.  I can't call the film a disappointment on a massive scale, especially as it is one of the highest grossing films of all time.  I also feel that with the pairing of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, the films success was facile and if anything, their pairing would lead to financial box office success but I may not be an erudite when it comes to the original novel's storyline but I do feel for the film, the story of "Alice in Wonderland" could have led to more sequels and stretch out the story to make us care for the characters and even Wonderland itself.<br /><br />We are told that Alice has been to the Wonderland many times before, even painting roses for the Red Queen and this is where I find the biggest fault of the film.  The original novel would have served a better first film for "Alice in Wonderland", taking her to adulthood and bringing her back as featured in this film as a sequel.  This would have made sense and a much more engaging film.<br /><br />I did enjoy Mia Wasikowska as Alice.  She fit the part of a young woman trying to find herself and both Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway did a wonderful job playing the queens.  And Johnny Depp, he was wonderful as the Mad Hatter but for each of these three characters, once again, I just felt there was more storyline for these characters that could have been developed.  I felt there was too much emphasis on the glitz and the look of the world while watching a girl who was trying to find her inner strength.  Granted, that was the writer's intention but for all these characters introduced, including the CG animated animals who play a major part in the film, it would have been great to see these characters explored a bit more.  If anything, making the viewer care enough to see them rescued or have created some emotional connect to them.  I just felt the pacing of the film was a bit rushed.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, there is no doubt that "Alice in Wonderland" is a beautiful film with tremendous detail.  The lossless soundtrack is very good.  A good amount of special features and you do get a DVD and digital copy for the 3-disc release.  So, as a total package, its a pretty solid Blu-ray release from Disney.  If you enjoyed the film, you will most definitely enjoy the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, I was content with "Alice in Wonderland" and I'm sure that both parents and children may find the film entertaining.  Those who are familiar with the original story may feel the storyline's deviance from Lewis Carroll's work to be too much of a difference and for children, for the most part, this is a safe film with not much violent content until the latter end of the film in which Alice goes against the Jabberwocky.  Some parents might find the scene a bit too much for younger children and in that case, parental guidance is suggested.<br /><br />But for me, I felt the film had tremendous potential but missed its target.  Sure, it was a box office success but as  I watched the film alongside with my seven-year-old son, after the film was done, the words that came out of his mouth was  "is that it?"  And like my son, I felt the same way about "Alice in Wonderland"... "is that it?".</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Alice In Wonderland" is great!

Alice embarks on a fantastical journey to find her true destiny and end the Red Queen's reign of terror.<br /><br />The cast led by Johnny Depp (in his 7th collaboration with Tim Burton) (as The Mad Hatter), Anne Hathaway (as The White Queen), Helena Bonham Carter (as The Red Queen) (in her 6th collaboration with Tim Burton) & Mia Wasikowska (as Alice) is great!

This is another well-done film from Tim Burton, which this seemly enough, fits him. This is another hit for Depp & Burton.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>It was only a matter of time before a director as visually inclined as Tim Burton would latch onto "Alice in Wonderland," quite possibly one of the most vivid and stirring fairy tales of the last century and a half. Indeed, it has given Burton whole new vistas to explore; never before has his imagination been so fully realized, so finely detailed, so delightfully eccentric. In some ways, he has been set free, the computer technologies of today's day and age having finally caught up with the vision in his mind's eye. He and his team have thoroughly created a world of phantasmagoric delights, a successful blend of live action, computer animation, and performance capture all distorted into wonderfully weird settings and characters. As an added bonus, all of this is presented in 3-D, which doesn't assault our eyes so much as envelope us, like a blanket.<br /><br />The problem is that Burton insisted on creating a story. Despite the classic title, this is not an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" or "Through the Looking Glass." It's in fact, for lack of a better term, a third chapter, one that disregards Carroll's literary nonsense in favor of a generic Good vs. Evil fable. There are heroes and villains where none existed before. Alice, once just a curious little girl, is now conditioned to be a champion, which means she will go through a series of challenges before having to engage in a battle to the death. Most importantly, there's now a beginning-middle-and-end plot rather than a series of vignettes. All of this is done well, and it will play even better if a traditional story is what you crave.<br /><br />But that's the thing - the story as Carroll intended it was NOT traditional. That's what made it so appealing, I think. Giving this movie a conventional storyline is sort of like providing an answer to the riddle of why a raven is like a writing desk. It takes the fun out of it.<br /><br />In this version, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is a nineteen year old young woman who, after having visited Wonderland thirteen years earlier, has been plagued by strange dreams. This is of no consequence to her family or friends, all Victorian in every sense of the word - prim, proper, and snooty. They only want her to find the right suitor, and lo and behold, they have arranged an engagement party for her and her intended, the hopelessly uptight Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill). But ... what's that off in the distance? Why, it's the White Rabbit! And he's nervously tapping on a pocket watch, as if to say he's late, he's late for a very important date. Alice uses this as an opportunity to flee, and in due time, she peers into a rabbit hole, loses her grip, and falls down, down, down.<br /><br />In the blink of an eye, she finds herself in a locked chamber. The only way out is through a tiny door, the key of which rests on a very large table. After a few hits and misses with a shrinking "Drink Me" potion and an enlarging "Eat Me" cake, she unlocks the door and finds herself back in Underland. Really? Not Wonderland? No. Underland. Anyway, the citizens of this world desperately need Alice's help: The wicked, big-headed Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) has overthrown her sister, the overly dramatic White Queen (Anne Hathaway), and now rules Underland with an iron fist. If Alice can obtain a magical sword and slay the dreaded Jabberwock, everything will return to normal. Unfortunately, Alice doesn't remember ever having been here, nor does she remember the many colorful residents. As far as she's concerned, this is all a dream.<br /><br />Naturally, every creature or person Alice meets is strange, if not altogether insane. To start with, there's the Mad Hatter, played by Burton regular Johnny Depp. As usual, he completely disappears into his role, letting the character emerge through inhuman eyes, deranged clown makeup, a mismatched wardrobe, and a voice that alternates between a foppish lisp and a William Wallace imitation. Why the different voices? Because he's mad, I guess. There's also Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both played by Matt Lucas), who look like a cross between Humpty Dumpty and Pugsley Addams. There's the sly, sneaky Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), who freely appears and disappears in a puff of smoke and lets his extra wide smile linger a moment or two more than necessary. There's the arrogant Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover), the enigmatic Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman), and the March Hare (voiced by Paul Whitehouse), who's absolutely off his rocker.<br /><br />There are many things about "Alice in Wonderland" to praise. It's a stunning technical achievement, not only for the computer artists, but also for cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, production designer Robert Stromberg, and costume designer Colleen Atwood. The performances are decent; I particularly enjoyed Anne Hathaway, who plays the White Queen with the exaggerated poise of a Disney princess. But I have to admit, I was a little disappointed by the story. Tim Burton has taken two highly off-the-wall tales and forced them to be ordinary. I think part of the reason many of us grew up on Carroll's books is because they were anything but ordinary - all character, setting, and manipulation of logic. I can't speak for everyone, but for my money, I'd rather not know why a raven is like a writing desk.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A beautiful film indeed. Beautiful because of the images themselves. Systematically light, colorful, very dynamic, surprising in all kinds of way, frightening a few times but most of the time enchanting and magic. Beautiful because of the actors who play so well and are so well adapted to their roles. Of course the Mad Hatter is the best in that line, even in a way better than Alice who is more standard, more exactly the way we imagine her. The queens are fine too but the White Queen does not have the charisma she should have to be able to inspire a struggle and revolution of the type she leads. The Red Queen is just hateful and odious. She is perfect in her role there but she has no charm and no appeal. She is repellent from the very start. Then you have the animals that are so lovable, even the big monstrosity that flies and is supposed to be some kind of distorted and out of shape dragon. Of course this one is most lovable when his head is down on the ground. Beautiful too because of the simple story, though it is deeply political. A good queen, fights for the crown that has been confiscated by a bad queen. It is the story of a liberation, though it is very simple, nearly na?ve and the transporting of the crown from one head to the other at the end by the invisible cat is kind of too simple to be true. But of course it is a tale and it is clear that freedom is not possible without a fight, though the fight is reduced to very few people, heroes in a way, not real people fighting together to bring the future to life. The original story is of course responsible for this naivet&eacute; of the fight between two sisters, a good one and a bad one. But all is well that ends well, and it ends well. Alice will not marry her promised Lord and will become a navigator, for commerce of course and with China mind you. We will forget that at the time the story was written the English managed to manipulate China into opium wars and some other horrors of the type. Let's just consider that today opium does not come from China and China is our future.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I curse the day I prayed for this to happen.  Seriously, if you read the review I wrote for Disney's animated version of `Alice in Wonderland' I said that Tim Burton needed to make this a live action film.  I was salivating over the idea.  When my dreams came true I was ecstatic.  I just knew that this film would be everything I hoped it would be and then, well, it wasn't.<br /><br />It really, REALLY wasn't.<br /><br />First off, everyone and their mother needs to be forewarned that this film is NOT a direct adaptation of the classic original we all know and love.  That isn't to say that this isn't pulled from Lewis Carroll's books, it is just that it doesn't follow the animated classic we all have grown up loving.  This film follows an older Alice who has just been proposed to by a nasty young man.  She flees the scene of the proposal and falls down the rabbit hole once again except she can't remember anything from before (although she does recall some lost memories she assumes are part of a recurring dream) and so she does a lot of repeat work (I assume in an effort to draw on the nostalgia of it all) before she uncovers the reality of why she is where she is.  She has to help overthrow the Red Queen by defeating some dragon creature so that the White Queen can take her rightful place on the throne.<br /><br />Thank god for Helena Bonham-Carter.<br /><br />Ok, so let's be honest here.  This film is a total mess.  The issue here is that Burton doesn't know how to edit himself.  He throws so much at you, assuming that more is more when in actuality, it's a freakish overkill.  `Alice in Wonderland' is a trashcan filled to the brim with a months worth of leftovers that spills out onto every frame.  From the overload of colorful set pieces that just overtakes every scene to the nightmarish performance by Johnny Depp, this film is garish to an extreme.  The plotting is underwhelming.  In reading Tim Burton's take on the film, he had mentioned being unmoved and emotionally disconnected to the actual flow of the books and the original films.  He said that he wanted to create a human element here, but he lost the whole point of the tale and instead shoved a generically clich&eacute;d `formula' at us and called it UNDERLAND.<br /><br />I won't say that the visuals are bad because they are not.  In many instances they are slick and exciting, but there are just TOO MANY OF THEM.  This film is far too loud.  Sure, some may say that the point of this film is to be loud, and to an extent they are right, but this film doesn't carry the right visual feel.  This film feels forced and unfocused.  Far too much (FAR TOO MUCH) attention was given to creating dreamlike set pieces that cross the line of `tasteful' into `tacky', and far too little attention was given to fleshing out the childlike curiosity that embodied the original.<br /><br />Burton didn't `get it' and so his take on the story doesn't `get it'.<br /><br />The less said about Johnny Depp's embarrassing portrayal of The Mad Hatter the better.  Why won't he just go away?<br /><br />In the end, there are two things worth mentioning here.  The score is on one hand rather loud and forbearing but it is also appropriately used and beautiful in its own right.  Also, Helena Bonham-Carter is BRILLIANT here.  I really think she needs to divorce (at least professionally) Tim Burton and solely work with other directors, but it is apparent that her talent was needed here since she livens her every scene and creates an unforgettable presence in The Red Queen.<br /><br />She's magnificent.<br /><br />Skip this trash heap, seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>"Alice in Wonderland" is a literary/intellectual story, full of clever ideas and wordplay, which render it essentially unfilmable. It's highly episodic and has no particular point (unlike "Though the Looking Glass", which at least offers the conceit that the story represents a chess game). But its fantasy elements have tempted too many filmmakers who ought to have known better.<br /><br />I haven't seen every version, but up to now, the least-bad has been -- yes -- the 1951 Disney version, which, when it sticks with the original, is quite good. But I've long felt that, if you're going to turn "Alice" into a film, it should be aimed at adults, and emphasize the darker elements of the story.<br /><br />This is what Tim Burton has finally given us. Linda Woolverton (who penned several successful Disney features) put together a script that provides dramatic movement -- Alice is destined to kill the Jabberwock *, which the Red Queen uses to threaten those who would oppose her. Whether this is the best-possible dramatic arc, I don't know, but it's at least broadly consistent with the original story. It also roughly parallels Alice's need to stand up for herself and reject the wussy twit her mother and late father's business partner have chosen for her to marry. Yes, this is trite and obvious -- but how many basic storylines /are/ there? This is one of the two most-basic -- someone has to make an important decision. (The other is "someone wants something they're blocked from getting".)<br /><br />Not only is the Burton/Woolverton take on the story dark, but so is the imagery. With the exception of the White Queen's abode, "Underland" is a dark and often-dismal place. This is absolutely not a film for children much under the age of 12. It comes close to PG-13, not so much for content, but for tone. The tykes will neither appreciate it nor enjoy it.<br /><br />Adults probably will. Recommended, if you like your fairy tales on the dark side.<br /><br />PS: I just made some revisions and noted the "5 out of 11" helpful votes. (As we all know, these votes are more-often based on whether a review correlates with what the reader /hopes/ the review will say, rather than whether it provides any useful information.) What do you /want/ me to say, that this "Alice" is one of the greatest family films of all time, and you should grab the kids and rush right out in a viewing frenzy? Well, it isn't, and you shouldn't. It's a film for teens (not tykes) and adults. I've told you why, and you ought to be grateful enough to give the review a "helpful" vote. So there.<br /><br />* With one exception, the Jabberwock is referred to as the "Jabberwocky" -- but that's the name of the poem, not the monster. It's perhaps worth noting the Tenniel's drawing of the monster is rather uglier and more-frightening that Burton's. I'm surprised it wasn't used.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>For starters, it seems that everyone I know is shocked when I tell them that this Alice in Wonderland is a sequel of sorts. At the age of 19 and about to be forced into marriage, this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland. I'm glad Tim Burton and his team came up with a new story that still featured all the great characters from the original source material. That's also where the weakest part of the movie lies. The dialogue given to the characters is great, but the script is razor thin. I think if more effort went into this particular aspect, I would have given it five stars.<br /><br />I saw it in IMAX 3-D and the visuals are as grand and beautiful as you would expect from Burton. It's not quite as eye-popping as Avatar, which was shot completely in IMAX 3-D, whereas, Alice in Wonderland was upconverted (Clash of the Titans is doing the same thing). The music by Danny Elfman is some of his best stuff in recent years and the costumes/makeup are top notch.<br /><br />Aside from the look of film, the acting also makes it very memorable. There are so many well animated and voice acted characters running around I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with those made of flesh and blood. I didn't like Depp's take on Willy Wonka that much, and I'm a big fan of his, but his Mad Hatter is just the right amount of crazy. His voice goes back and forth from having a lisp to sounding like William Wallace from Braveheart. His look is so jarring, you probably wouldn't even know it was him if you somehow dodged all the advertisements before entering the theater. Helena Bonham Carter played the Red Queen brilliantly. I couldn't take my eyes off her giant head. Anne Hathaway really surprised me here (in a good way) with her take on the White Queen and it was nice to see Crispin Glover back on the big screen in a role that suited him. Last, but certainly not least, Mia Wasikowska was absolutely captivating as Alice. The way she talked and her reactions were just what the film needed in it's central role. All the digital animal characters were great, but my favorites were the Cheshire Cat, voice by Stephen Fry, and the March Hare voiced by Paul Whitehouse.<br /><br />I'm somewhat surprised that the combination of violence and meanness, along with the smoking Blue Caterpillar didn't get this a PG-13 rating. It's not too harsh, but young kids might get a little freaked out.<br /><br />Overall, Alice in Wonderland looks like a polished jewel, has great acting/voice acting, wonderful music and even manages to get quite a few laughs in the process. If only the simple story didn't let me down in the end, this could have been a classic in the making. Even still, I wouldn't mind Tim Burton taking us on another trip down the rabbit hole in a few years.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>Having read "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There" several times over the course of my life (and loving these stories), I was disappointed in Disney's newest cinematic version.  Lewis Carroll's adventures of a little girl who falls down a rabbit hole to discover a strange world is "mad" enough...  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp over did it.  I suppose that's what Disney wanted or else they could have picked someone else to direct/produce and star in the film, but in my opinion they both were not the best choices.  The only live human who really "worked" was Helena Bonham-Carter as the Red Queen.  She was fantastic.  Ann Hathaway as the White Queen was strange, Mia Wasikowska did not seem like the lively Alice of the book or of the earlier animated version of Disney's Alice in Wonderland and again, Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter was overkill.  The whole production was overkill and too far off the farm... and it ruined the story, which is a shame because the original story is an awesome one.<br /><br />p.s.  A rating of PG was a little low considering the intensity of the film.  I think PG-13 would have been a better choice... very small children may be frightened.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I think I am in the minority, but I didn't like Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland" very much. This latest Johnny Depp vehicle just seems to solidify my feelings about the filmmaker's works in general. Burton devotes so much time and attention to the visual, creating amazing, unusual, exciting worlds and landscapes for his films. This isn't a bad thing, necessarily, but without a significant amount of attention devoted to story and character development, "Alice" just begins looking dour. Many of Burton's films suffer from this imbalance.<br /><br />Alice (Mia Wasikowska, "Amelia", "Defiance") runs from an arranged engagement with an unhappy young man with a sourpuss face and falls into the rabbit hole. Back in Wonderland, she quickly meets up with the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen), the Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman) and Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas, "Little Britain"). She also learns she has role to play in the battle between the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).<br /><br />Burton is easily one of the most artistic directors working in film and he treats his celluloid like a canvas. "Alice In Wonderland" is no exception. And "Alice in Wonderland" is also an example of the two Burton's at conflict. The beginning and end of the film take place in a country estate in England. A large party has gathered, everyone wearing whites and pastels to perfectly match the country setting, to witness the news of Alice's engagement, something she is unaware of. As soon as she learns of the news, she becomes overwhelmed and runs through the countryside. These bits are presumably filmed on real locations or sets. As soon as Alice enters Wonderland, everything becomes even more surrealistic as we delve into a computer-generated world. Not only are we watching real actors perform in this new world, they interact with a number of characters that are also created through the use of CGI. Then, throw in the use of 3-D and Wonderland becomes an eye-popping spectacle. Burton would never depict Wonderland as an amusement park attraction. Instead, as in most of his films, he is drawn to the darker side of the story and the setting. While there are plenty of eye popping pastels, Burton almost seems to use a gray filter on his camera, giving everything a more ominous tone. Later, when the two queens battle, the sky is overcast and dark. This is definitely not a Wonderland we have seen before. Burton is absolutely the right choice to update the look of this well-known classic.<br /><br />But Burton, the director, is not as interested in creating fully developed characters. Beyond Alice, and her need for escape, we don't really learn a lot about the individual characters and most of these performances are just not that interesting.<br /><br />Even Depp, Burton's muse, is unable to break free of the ridiculous hairstyle and make-up to transform his character into something completely interesting. Depp always seems to play this same type of character in Burton's films; someone who is deeply disturbed or strange in some way, trying to assimilate into society or simply get by. The Mad Hatter is really no different from any of these characters and Depp's performance has a 'been there, done that' feeling. The Mad Hatter wants to make sure he doesn't rock the boat too much. He must appear to be on the side of the Red Queen, to appease her, when in fact he supports the White Queen. Because he waffles back and forth, and titters madly whenever his deception may come undone, his character seems more wishy washy than anything else.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter steals the film. Her performance as the insecure, physically and morally short Red Queen hits all the right notes. The Queen, eager to prove powerful, overcompensates for her short stature. She also wears sunglasses, peering over them throughout, trying to intimidate those around her. When she feels even slightly threatened, she almost starts to throw a temper tantrum, threatening to hold her breath until she gets what she wants. Her behavior frequently appears more like a spoiled debutante or rock star, someone so used to getting their way, they are completely unaware of what others feel around them, how others are reacting around them. None of her strange requests seem to faze others. The sunglasses make me feel like she is playing a riff on the stereotype of how a spoiled, bratty Hollywood star talks and behaves. At one point, she yells "PIG" and a big pig slides under her feet, providing a footrest.<br /><br />The 1933 version features Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Edward Everett Horton as the Mad Hatter. This new version seems to follow the tradition and casts Stephen Fry, Alan Rickman, Michael Sheen and Matt Lucas in various supporting roles. To be honest, most are so obscured by the CGI characters they "wear" it is difficult to tell who they are. I think this is part of the appeal for these actors. They are able to participate in a film like this and have some fun. If the film is a success, they can point to their role as an interesting diversion. If not, they will probably not be remembered for the role. To be honest, I didn't even recognize Matt Lucas, one of the stars of the very bawdy British television series "Little Britain". He plays both Tweedledee and Tweedledum and the characters are largely created with CGI. Yes, they share some of the features of his face, but the characters just aren't distinctive enough to be that memorable.<br /><br />Because the film is so beautiful to look at, and the film was designed and shot in 3D (something people should beware of after the release of "Clash of the Titans") the 3-D is beautiful, amazing and enhances the film really well. The technique becomes more predominant once Alice arrives in Wonderland. In the real world, when she is on the country estate, the use of this effect seems muted. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but it helps set the two worlds apart. The 3-D is particularly striking as Alice falls down the rabbit hole.<br /><br />There are indications and moments throughout leading us to believe Alice is RETURNING to Wonderland. Frankly, I'm not sure why they did this, as she seems to be covering the same basic territory as the original story. The references and the idea of her 'return' only seem confusing. Were Burton and Disney afraid of competing with the animated Classic? If so, they were silly to think such a thing. Burton's "Wonderland" would benefit considerably from removing this one confusing thread, providing les distraction.<br /><br />Visually, as with all Burton's films, "Alice" is a wonder. Narratively, as with most Burton films, "Alice" is a problem.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>I am no great fan of Tim Burton's work. I find it tends to all be basically the same movie with slightly different costumes. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns, for example, all felt very similar to me. In fact the only one of his movies I enjoy and want to see again and again is Ed Wood.<br /><br />Well, now to this list we can probably add Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />The movie takes place some twelve years after the original story that most of us are familiar with from the Disney version. Alice, now 19 and on the verge of marriage, freaks out a bit and finds herself down the rabbit hole once more. She has no memory of having been here before, and all the folk she meets, like the White rabbit, the March Hare, the Doormouse and, of course, the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter, aren't sure she is who she says she is. Well, the Hatter might be, but he's mad.<br /><br />All those worthys are engaged in a little light rebellion against the Red Queen (played by Helena Bohnam Carter, who appears to be channeling Miranda Richardson's Queen Elizabeth from Black Adder II), who sics the Bandersnatch and Jub Jub bird on anyone who challenges her authority. With the Knave of Hearts by her side, she wages a campaign of tough hate on the people of Wonderland as her sister, the White Queen, does frak-all but wait for Alice to turn up, obtain the Vorpal Blade and go snicker-snack on the Jabberwocky.<br /><br />If all this sounds a little on the mixed-up side, it is. The only thing we're really missing is an appearance by the Walrus and the Carpenter, and I'm surprised we didn't have them show up.<br /><br />But despite mixing in just about everything from Lewis Carrol's works, the film isn't muddled and stays surprisingly coherent. It's helped by some great performances (including Johnny Depp as the somewhat restrained Mad Hatter), and an incredible production design that uses some of the old-style illustrations of the characters to make them look very inhuman, particularly the Red Queen and the Tweedles.<br /><br />At no point was the movie boring and at no point did it fail to entertain. As an adult, I don't recommend seeing it on a Saturday afternoon, like I did, but rather suggest seeing it while all the little kiddies are in school. Also, since the theatre I go to still does not have 3-D capability, I had to see it in 2-D, so I can't say how it would look in the other format.<br /><br />But, yes, this was a film worth seeing, so kudos to Tim Burton and company! Oh, and for the record... they both have quills.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>When it comes to Tim Burton, he really LOVES to make us wait for his next movie. No surprise, it's been like that ever since he released 2 movies in the same year in 2005 (Charlie and Corpse Bride). And when I heard he was creating his own vision of Alice in Wonderland, I was really excited. I certainly couldn't wait, it sounded like it was going to be an excellent movie. However, of course, I got pissed when back in MAY 08, I find out that it would be released in 10 months. So I waited patiently, and when I saw it last night, I wasn't disappointing.<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland currently has a polarized audience reaction going on right now. Either you love it, or you hate it. I was well aware of this when I went to go see it. So that said, I stripped myself of all expectations, left them at the theater door, and just went in ready to take in what the movie was about to give me. And you know what? I wasn't disappointed. Was it Shakespeare-level? No. Was it exactly great? Maybe not, but I REALLY liked it, I have almost nothing (except for a couple boring spots and the ending) to complain about. Therefore, it was enjoyable for me.<br /><br />13 years after the events that Alice experienced, Alice is 19, and lives with her family. She is being pressured upon to accept an engagement from a man she doesn't like. So at the engagement party, after seeing the rabbit show her that she is very late for her important date, she runs to where the rabbit hole is and falls down it one more time. After struggles to shrink herself, she meets up with everyone she knows once again and is taken to The Mad Hatter, who reveals to her that The Red Queen is terrorizing wonderland once again. She must help The Mad Hatter and the white queen stop the Red Queen from eventually overtaking Wonderland before it's too late.<br /><br />So in total, that isn't exactly the best plot for a sequel, is it? Well, I didn't think it was, but that didn't prevent me from really loving the movie. The visuals are very gorgeous like we see in the trailer. The CG is well rendered, and in short it looks gorgeous. As for performances, Alice was portrayed very well by Mia Wasikowska. She really did a great job, she really nailed the role big time. Bonham Carter was great as The Red Queen too- she really has come a long way as her role as the junkie Marla in Fight Club. Of course, Depp never fails to entertain, and Alice in Wonderland is proof- his wacky performance as The Mad Hatter is certainly enough to keep your attention. The only performance that wasn't exactly great was Crispin Glover as Knave of Hearts- that may be in part due to his character, but he wasn't bad in the movie, he did quite good. Just he wasn't one of the better performances.<br /><br />I do have but two complaints- I thought the ending seemed really fanfic-ish, and the movie was slow in a few spots. And also, one more thing- if you're going to see it in 3D, it is really good. I definitely recommend it, as it is well used. That said, I really liked the movie and I can't really see why people are complaining. I guess people need SOMETHING to complain about. So guys, don't be a puppet of the critics, and DON'T let your expectations run away with you. See the movie and decide for yourself.<br /><br />Oh, and someone please tell me where I can learn some of the hatter's funky dance moves.<br /><br />IN TOTAL:<br />Entertainment: 8/10<br />Violence: 4/10- quite a bit in this movie<br />Depp: Mad as a Hatter indeed<br />Gorgeous visuals: A visual feast<br />Burton: May be getting unoriginal, but not declining in terms of directing<br /><br />***Recommended***</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>As an "Alice" purist I generally cringe at the assortment of attempts to adapt either of Lewis Carroll's works "Alice in Wonderland" and/or "Through the Looking Glass" to the movie screen.  These have been of varying quality but even the best are no more than satisfactory ("Dreamchild" being an exception but it was more about the real Alice than about the Wonderland Alice).<br /><br />But I had a pretty good idea what I was getting into before shelling out the bucks to see this Burton effort in 3-D.  I knew that despite what many have said and despite its title, this is not an adaptation of Carroll's books.  Accordingly I knew that this would greatly increase my toleration level.  They could do what they liked with the traditional characters and play around with whatever sort of plot elements intrigued them; I would not take particular offense.<br /><br />That said I had no real problem with anything about the film.  In Burton and writer Linda Woolverton's story, Alice revisits Wonderland/The Looking Glass House 13 years after waking up from her original dreams.  Alice, now almost 20, is attending her sister's garden party, which she discovers is intended to be her engagement party.  Cringing at a marriage proposal from the unappealing son of her father's former business partner, she runs from the party and follows a white rabbit down an immense hole.<br /><br />Her seemingly endless fall is arguably the best scene of the film and is by far the best Hollywood has ever assembled; even including a slick twist at the bottom where her hair is standing on end.  Then she repeats the drink-me eat-me shrinking-growing bit from the book.  And these two sequences are pretty much the only thing other than the characters that come directly out of the book.  One advantage of having a 20-year-old Alice is that her clothes do not shrink or grow with her size changes.  She must improvise on each occasion and this adds a touch of physical comedy to the transformations.<br /><br />For her part Alice seems to have suppressed the memory of her two childhood dreams, showing little familiarity with the characters she is meeting for a second time (in some cases a third time).  And initially they are unsure that she is the same Alice who visited them over a decade earlier.  But for the white rabbit, the dormouse, the Tweedles, and the smoking caterpillar she has be the right Alice because they have lured her back to fulfill a prophecy.  It has been foretold that  Alice will slay the Jabberwocky (a dragon worthy of the lizards in the old 50's sci-fi films) with a magical sword.  This will change the balance of power, with the good White Queen getting the crown from the wicked Red Queen. We've seen this thing before, insert: "Narnia, Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings" here. And they throw in a few visuals from "The Neverending Story" series.<br /><br />Ultimately Alice goes all "Joan of Arc" or at least "Jane and the Dragon" and becomes a knight in armor.  Many have lamented this action adventure turn of the story but the actual showdown takes only about 10 minutes so I don't think it is that big of a deal.  And it has some considerable basis as Alice had been the White Queen's Pawn (because the Queen's daughter Lily was too young to play) throughout the chess match in "Through the Looking Glass". That story was just one big chess game with a lengthy combat segment between the White Knight and the Red Knight, as well as a fight between the "Gladstone" Lion and the "Disraeli" Unicorn for the crown.  The only problem I see is that the combat is all too predictable.<br /><br />Mia Waisikowska strikes a perfect balance as the title character, playing the bravest heroine in literary history requires a lot of nonverbal stuff and she sells her reluctance nicely along with giving her character a subtle sensual dimension.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter pretty much steals the film, although she is upstaged on occasion by the grinning Cheshire cat.  Depp's Mad Hatter never quite comes into focus, playing the character as a schizophrenic (at least that's what I assume he was doing) introduced a little too much pain into this type of story; in much the same way that his take on Willy Wonka just brought the viewer down.  A run-of-the-mill lunatic would worked better.<br /><br />As the White Queen, Anne Hathaway was pretty much irrelevant and was most likely cast because of her "small" head (her features seem to take up her entire face-especially with the extreme make-up),  a kind of good-guy bad-guy balance for her evil sister's big head.  But I did like the off-kilter Morticia Addams take she gave her character; rather than playing her as a goody-two-shoes.<br /><br />The audience during my showing was attentive and entertained from beginning to end (well almost to the end as the film goes out on a couple of extremely weak scenes back on the surface).  But most bolted before the closing credits, which played over Avril Lavigne singing "Alice" (Avril also appears in the film's trailer).  Given that it is mostly up-scale theaters with state-of-the-art sound systems showing this film, those who left missed one of the best moments of the whole viewing experience.

I am (believe it or not) a fan of the Alice in Wonderland story, which is the reason why I do not like this 3-D version of "Alice in Wonderland"<br /><br />This film is set many years after the first/original version. Alice is about to get married, when once again, she spots the white rabbit, and follows him. Once back in Wonderland Alice embarks on her true destiny: end the red queen's reign of power.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this film really did not have a great plot, it was just same old, same old. Its like Tim Burton was more focused on the special effects then the story-line.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>3.7 stars<br /><br />This begins off so well and then after about 30 minutes gets boringer and boringer. I had such great hopes at the start and soon gave them up when I saw how badly the script had messed with Carroll's original vision. That story and its magic wordplay is what made AIW great, not just the characters.<br /><br />Making this Alice's second visit down the hole is pointless and ends up killing the momentum. Carter steals the show and is the film's highlight, Depp is merely there as the Hatter, and Mia is, sorry to say, a very unexciting Alice. Is that really the best casting they could do? She just isn't much fun to watch here; we need an Alice of great verve and zing! Carroll's Alice is much sassier and just a lot more interesting, all told.<br /><br />But it's hard not to like the wonderful colors and fine sets, though the CGI gets old after about an hour. Nonetheless, the many fine visions make up for some of the meandering plot, if not nearly enough.<br /><br />Dang it, Tim: why mess with perfection? You could have stuck to the first and best story and made a real classic, but instead you used an unappealing older girl who leaches the fun out of everything, and a story that can't begin to compare with the faultless whimsy of the original.<br /><br />Sigh. Better luck next remake.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Tim Burton is a master of visuals; usually, he's a master storyteller, too.  And you'd think he would be the perfect fit to bring Lewis Carroll's psychedelic little novel to life.  And, if Burton and company had stuck to the novels, perhaps they would have a great film on their hands.  Alas, this film takes place AFTER Alice's initial visit to Wonderland.  Instead of the prepubescent charmer (borderline nymph) that inspired Carroll to tell his tale, we get a decidedly more mature Alice (no subtlety here).  She's come back to Wonderland, except the Mad Hatter (a minor character in the novels, a major player here) is the only one who's really sure.  But the Red Queen doesn't care if Alice is or isn't THE Alice.  Off with her head anyways!<br /><br />True, the visuals are amazing; I only saw it in 2D, and I was blown away.  But the rest of the film falls amazingly flat.  Even Johnny Depp, perhaps the most talented actor of his generation, doesn't seem to know what to do--to make the Hatter whimsical or serious?  (And what's with the break dancing?)  Mia Wasikowska proves she's got talent, but she doesn't have much to do here in the titular role.  We get some decent voice acting from Michael Sheen, and some genuinely fantastic voice acting from Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat (his performance alone, small as it is, is worth the ticket price).  Christopher Lee has one line (no kidding: one), and Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter, both amazingly talented actresses, are stuck in a rut here, never able to break free of their confines.  Crispin Glover, good as he usually is, just doesn't come off as too villainous; and Alan Rickman, as the Blue Caterpillar, is merely here for show; he's better than this and he knows it.<br /><br />Overall, ALICE IN WONDERLAND serves as a decent family film--kids won't care that the performances and stories lag, and parents will probably be enthralled with the visuals.  But for those of us craving a decent take on the book--well, there's always the old cartoon, still one of my personal faves.  Here's hoping the next Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration will be more noteworthy, like their prior efforts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed it!  There were all ages at the theater.  It was a very nicely put together combination of people and creatures. (I think you call it animatronics?)  While I remember the basic Alice story from years ago, I don't necessarily remember all the fine details to compare it to the original.<br /><br />The story begins with several businessmen discussing possible ventures when little Alice comes downstairs.  Daddy says, "Another nightmare?"  Alice affirms and daddy takes her back upstairs and tucks her back into bed after another dream of strange creatures with funny names.<br /><br />Fast forward 13 years.  Alice and Mom are traveling through the English Countryside.  Daddy has passed on to "the other side".  They are going to visit one of the business partners who also bought Daddy's share of the business.  Arriving at the partner's beautiful English country estate, Alice is paired up with their son Hamish and soon finds out that Hamish will ask for her hand.  Now, let me side step here for a minute.  Alice doesn't exactly seem all that thrilled with Hamish but he is breathing without assistance and the family has money.  Well-meaning relatives quickly point out, "Your face won't last forever," which translates to "you had better grab some guy before you get ugly and nuts like Aunt xxxx."<br /><br />While all this dialog business is going on, Alice keeps seeing a white rabbit in a topcoat with a stop watch. Hmmmm.  Finally, Hamish asks for Alice's hand in front of the whole gathering but she hesitates.  Thinking, "Do I REALLY wanna do this?" she spots the white rabbit again.  He is pointing to his stopwatch, indicating there is not much time left.  Alice excuses herself and runs off to follow the rabbit that no one sees but her.<br /><br />Alice soon falls down a hole. Down, down, down - landing in a locked circular room.  The key on the table isn't helping because it only unlocks a small doggie-sized door.  She finds some potion to drink that makes her small, and a cake to eat that makes her big.  You hear a male and female voice talking in the background saying, "You'd think she'd remember all this from the first time."  She gets through the door and finds herself in a strange garden where a blue caterpillar is smoking a hooka pipe.  He is the "wisdom" guy.  As Alice meets the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and other characters, there is discussion as to whether or not she is the RIGHT Alice.  A  mean-looking polar bear type creature chases her and her friends, as does a mean buzzard.  The mean creatures all belong to the Red Queen, as does the  "Jabberberrywalkie" (a dragon).  The Queen likes to behead anything and anyone who displeases her.  She has a frog beheaded for eating her fruit tart.  Every other word out of her mouth is "off with his/her head!"  (Fortunately, you don't see them beheaded.)<br /><br />Once upon a time, the land was beautiful, but the Red Queen, her warriors, and the mean creatures raged war and the dragon fried what was left of the land.  The "prophecy" was that Alice would return and slay the dragon, but this Alice is a peace-nic.<br /><br />We also meet the White Queen, who is the nice one.  Alice is actually supposed to steal this special sword, return it to the White Queen, become her Champion in the battle against the Red Queen, and then slay the dragon.  Oh, BTW, the Queens are sisters.<br /><br />I found the movie quite enjoyable.  Johnny Depp was absolutely wonderful, as always.  It amazes me how he made his character come alive!  He is very talented and was the real star of the movie.<br /><br />This is a nice story about facing fears, transformation, friendship, and about a young woman who is stronger than she thought she was.  There is also an underlying message to Alice that she is not a girl who has to take the first guy who comes along, especially when she has no special feelings for him.<br /><br />END OF REVIEW<br />_______________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Do not read my last paragraph below unless you want to know if your children should see the show.<br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Is it for young children?  I think it's iffy.  This is not really a children's movie anyway.  It is an adaptation of one for adults. It's not bad, but you do have the concept of beheading people/charachters and the dragon shooting out fire.  You also have the 2 monsters, one getting his eye plucked out with a sword.  You see an almost beheading of a person and a monster gets his head chopped off.  It might give your children nightmares, so, be careful.  They may not be as unaffected as you think.  I say this because I made the same mistake with my son.  He told me about how it affected him many years later. That was when I found out I wasn't as smart as I thought I was.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>An older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland after escaping a planned engagement party, that was planned by everyone but her. While in Wonderland, the white rabbit thinks he might have lured the wrong Alice into the Rabbit's hole. But the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) believes she's the real Alice and that she's the chosen one to bring down the Red Queen (Helen Bohen Carter). The Red Queen stole the thrown from her good sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and has forced everyone to worship her.<br /><br />  I like that it's not an unnecessary remake, we have had the same story done over and over again enough times. The movie is fun with a brilliant cast. Burton does his most imaginative work even if we didn't really need a big fight between good and evil in an Alice and Wonderland movie. All of that felt like a combination of Narnia and Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />  I've seen some reviews where dumb critics say Depp was the only good thing about the movie. He was good, but I don't think it was his best work. I don't know why his Mad Hatter had accent on and off that makes him sound like a leprechaun. Hell, he even occasionally sounded a lot like BeetleJuice. Other than that, he was perfect in the role. However, the film would be less effective if Wasikowska wasn't cast as Alice. She's a real find and was excellent as Alice, she was possibly even the best I've seen. I'd love to see a Burton remake of the Wizard of Oz, but only if he doesn't think the Wizard of Oz would need an big epic battle between good and evil. It would also be nice to get a break from Depp and Helen Bohen Carter in everything he does. We don't need Carter as the Wicked Witch and Depp as the Scare Crow.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>This IS HELENA BONHAM CARTER's show!  She gives us a total 3 dimensional Queen - with the "haps" and "sads" and "funnies" with just a little touch of Better Davis?  Perhaps the rings, the wig, something very next.<br /><br />DEPP is great as the Hatter - but the accents confuse - sometimes Scots, sometimes North Country.<br /><br />I loved the small touches on Hatter - bloodied finger - too many sewing needles - the thimballs .....<br /><br />COLLEEN ATWOOD's realization of the costumes are always picture perfect - down to the fabric ....... important doing period work.<br /><br />HATHAWAY, MIA W., GLOVER, the rest of the ensemble fit perfectly - this is what Carol intended us to see ...... including the dark sides ....... the moat with the heads.<br /><br />Tiny touch of "OZ" - but Alice came before "OZ" - so maybe its the reverse.<br /><br />THIS MUST be seen in IMAX - you have to be IN the picture.<br /><br />Fave?

I got bored after watching it twice within one year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>You'd think by all the negative reviews that everyone expected Tim Burton, of all creative people, to follow the book ( ALICE IN WONDERLAND ) in reverential lockstep. It is pretty apparent from the opening scenes that this will not be the case ( and, personally speaking, I would have been disappointed had he chosen to do so ). I do agree that the plot was a bit plodding at times, and on more than a few occasions it seemed as though both the cast and crew had wandered into LSD-land, but there was some good dialogue, and fun takes on classic characters ( Alan Rickman's Caterpillar, Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen, and especially Stephen Fry's wonderful Cheshire Cat ), and despite some false steps, the casting of Mia Wasikowska as a grown up version of Carroll's heroine was inspired.<br /><br />It isn't Burton's, or Depp's finest work, but it is quite watchable, and I did not find the CGI to be anywhere near as reprehensible as some seemed to believe it was.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>Just finished watching the movie.

Of course I don't like too much of creepiness, so it took me a little while to start liking the movie. But it's absolutely great. After 30 minutes I liked it more and more with each moment until I realized that this is it. I love it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>This is the most notable and the most used line: "Off with his Head!" This is exclaimed by the Queen of Hearts once someone does something to upset her. This character along with the Mad Hatter make this movie truly hilarious and enjoyable. If you are looking for a serious film with a strong plot, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The strength of this film is in the area of its visuals, no effort is spared here, it is a lot of fun to watch. The story concept is one that has been beaten to a pulp. This is: start in the real world, go to fantasy world, end back in the real world. But, who cares, it can work here too.<br /><br />This film continues where the original book ended off. Alice is now grown up. At first she has difficulty in coming to terms with her return to Wonderland. But as time goes along she comes to terms with her destiny. There is a lot of action and quirky aspects that has become the hallmark of the director, Mr. Tim Burton.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I like Burton's films, and can go a long way to stretch with him on his abstract take on things.  While I liked the spin the cast put on their roles and the modern visuals of the characters, an overall cohesion was lacking in the direction that left me wanting more.  Wrapping the classic story in a modern metaphor of innocence lost and adult perspective on childhood was an original take.  The film's a good one to watch if you're a Burton or Depp fan, or if you enjoy dark fantasy, but likely not for fans of the storybook variety of Alice.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>"Alice" has a bit of a slow start, and to any viewer not familiar with the story, it can be confusing for awhile. Yet it wins a person over, voice by voice, visual by visual, and step-by-Depp. Johnny continues to amaze me with his versatility as an actor. He has become one of those guys who makes anything he is in better, even if he can't save them all (like Michael Caine in that respect.) Director Burton has filled the cast with great British character actor vocalizations, and the screen with oddball colors and drawings that amuse, frighten or delight. I think the best way to enjoy his version of "Alice" is to see the Disney animated 1950's effort first, which is great, and then the new twist on the story. If a mom or dad could read the poem "Jabberwocky" to the kids and explain a bit about Lewis Carroll, the author, first, so much the better. Burton does assume a certain literacy and familiarity with the tale and the poem that may give contemporary kids too much credit, but he has done a good job overall. If watching this version of "Alice" leads some young folk to read the original prose, hurrah!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is a story about a brat (Mairi Ella Challen) that grew up to a demure young lady (Mia Wasikowska), and lost her snot factor. Can she gain it back through adventure?  The story needed some adjustment due to the age factor of the victim. So this is why we get a more of a return the Underland in place of the original Wonderland. The wit is replaces with action, the cunning with swordplay and so forth.<br /><br />I do not want to give away any surprises but this presentation is a unique made for the actors and to be politically correct for this day and age. Alice is facing marriage to the son of her defunct father's old business partner.  She has been having problem with being distracted by a rabbit in a waistcoat.  She falls for the rabbit and we began to think back fondly of the story we were told as children.  If she can adjust her size the adventure takes a sad turn into a swashbuckler; unfortunately it is Alice not The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Will Alice be eaten, scratched, beheaded, or otherwise dispatched? Or will she return, get married, and realize there is no place like home.<br /><br />I only saw the 2D version so I cannot comment on 3D. The parts were extremely well acted by many of the best known actors of the time. No telling what the movie would be if the characters were a tad more traditional.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>There seems to be a new constant surrounding Tim Burton: the cast will most likely include Johnny Depp and real-life companion Helena Bonham Carter, that it will be visually arresting and have incredibly unique art designs, and will most likely include the music compositions of Danny Elfman. But now there's a 4th: it might not be that good. Ever since Mars Attacks! in 1996, he's been weirdly inconsistent from the great (Big Fish, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd) to the mediocre (Planet of the Apes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). It's hard to tell whether it's studio manhandling or whether he's lost "the touch" or whatever it is but the one-after-another success of the late 80's/early 90's is kind of gone and whenever he makes a good movie now, it almost seems like a "finally!" reaction than anything. So when faced with the notion of adapting one of the king's of wild imagery which is very present in the Alice in Wonderland story, I'm thinking Tim Burton, one of the last few directors with an unmistakable style, will go completely hog-wild with it. So visually, yeah, it works. The rest?<br /><br />Rather than re-tell the old familiar story of young Alice encountering Wonderland for the first time, Burton and Co. instead do what Steven Spielberg did with "Hook": a returning hero who can't remember ever having been there but everyone knows they have. So this time we have 19 year old Alice journeying back to Underland (as "Wonderland" was what she thought it was) and revisiting the old characters from the pipe-smoking caterpillar Absolem, the dimwitted twins Twiddledee and Twiddledum, the time-obsessed White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter. But if everyone's back then that also means the Red Queen is as well and Alice returning isn't making anything easier on her still-present love of beheadings.<br /><br />Disney so far has had an excellent track record with stunning Blu-Ray image transfers and this allows the visuals of the film to shine and Burton still continues his knack for making some unique and at times, almost stunning visuals. But then you see the images created by computers (of which there is many) and it becomes a bit too obvious and certain scenes and characters almost look unfinished and just scream "we're green screen!" but the film on a visual standpoint does have a great look about it, unfinished or no. The score though by Danny Elfman is quite strong and while I wouldn't say it's one of his top works on a Burton movie, it's certainly one of the better ones in years.<br /><br />Now we come down to the casting which to be honest, is really all over the place. The lead role played by Mia Wasikowska is part of it as she indeed has that confidence and almost bravado about the role yet at the same time that wonder and "what's going on?" attitude is clearly missing. I mean, even though she can't remember the first time she's been there, having disappearing cats with huge smiles or walking playing cards would certainly bring a bigger reaction than she does. Johnny Depp seems to be echoing his eccentric role as Willy Wonka but it isn't quite as lovable as Captain Jack was, another unhinged character. But then we have Helena Bonham Carter nearly completely stealing the movie as the Red Queen with a bulbous head (which strangely enough seems unnecessary when you see how well she looks sans digital ballooning) and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. The voice work of Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Michael Sheen and Stephen Fry are very much recommended as well.<br /><br />Another slight problem I have with the movie is that it just feels slow, not necessarily boring like others have said but on one hand I felt like I didn't want to turn the movie off as I was being entertained by what I was seeing but I felt like I needed some snap in its step if you will, just a quicker pace. But then the 3rd act comes in and it's almost like a watered-down Chronicles of Narnia ending complete with a fight against a fire-breathing dragon, Alice in a metal knight armor and that damn DANCE! It's here the 3rd act just becomes too noticeable as a problem and whether you're into the tone and pace and visuals of the film or not, the last parts feel really out of place.<br /><br />Is the film worth seeing? I would suggest a viewing but when you have people saying it was one of the worst films this year to other people saying they really loved it, well, kind makes a recommend hard but I will say that the film isn't a travesty nor is it a misunderstood masterpiece. It's good, sadly nothing more and luckily nothing less.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>A fun adaption of the Carroll classic that adds some elements which I think are from the books but not seen in the popular movie adaptions.

The real scene stealer of this film is newcomer, Mia Wasikowska who plays Alice - she brings a quiet but stubborn quality to the role and I just loved Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, she's a funny little thing!

The 2010 "Alice in Wonderland" has an enchanting spark that somehow eluded Disney nearly 60 years earlier. Mia Wasikowska's inspired performance as a refreshingly mature Alice is well-matched by Helena Bonham Carter's wicked Red Queen and Johnny Depp's twisted Mad Hatter. A tad slow at times, but endlessly imaginative in the Burton tradition.

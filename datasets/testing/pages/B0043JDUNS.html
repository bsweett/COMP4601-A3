This is how the story goes: The world is aware that billionaire inventor Tony Stark is the armored Super Hero Iron Man. Under pressure from the government, the press and the public to share his technology with the military, Tony is unwilling to divulge the secrets behind the Iron Man armor because he fears the information will slip into the wrong hands. With Pepper Potts, and James "Rhodey" Rhodes at his side, Tony forges new alliances and confronts powerful new forces.<br /><br />The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (impressive again as Tony Stark), Gwyneth Paltrow (as Pepper Potts), Don Cheadle (as Rhodey), Scarlett Johansson (as Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff), Sam Rockwell (as Justin Hammer), Mickey Rourke (as Ivan Vanko) & Samuel L.

Robert Downey Jr. impresses again in another excellent performance. This is better than most comic-book sequels out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>With the world now aware of his dual life as the armored superhero Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark faces pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military. Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts and James "Rhodey" Rhodes at his side, must forge new alliances and confront powerful enemies.<br /><br />Downey is actually better than ever in this sequel.  Iron Man 2 knows how to jump the hurdles and have you wanting more. Mickey Rourke is outrageous as a russian killing machine. Iron Man 2 isn't content with one bad guy, there's lots more. Iron Man 2 is very entertaining, But it's the talented Downey who makes Iron Man 2 something to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>This film was a true worthy follow-up to one of the best superhero films of all time. Inspired by the storyline from the late 80s 'Armor Wars' arc, Iron Man 2 has our hero fighting against his invention being weaponized while at the same time fighting those who are stealing his tech. There is no one who can pull off Tony Stark like Robert Downey Jr. His portrayal is worth watching even if he never dons the suit. This is good, because Iron Man gets very little screen time against his alter ego in this installment. A perfect precusor to Avengers and Thor, with a slight nod to Captain America. You cannot go wrong here!</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>I want to start off by saying that all the people who said this movie spent too much time pushing the Avenger Initiative forward, were kind of wrong. I say "kind of", instead of just plain "wrong", because, while there are scenes devoted to that agenda, the focus is still definitely Tony Stark and the Iron Man "weapon". Robert Downey Jr. returns to the role that reinvigorated his career, and he's better than ever. RDJ's portrayal is possibly the most spot-on comic book character that I have seen come to life off of a page. Yes, Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best, but his Tony Stark is a very close second. As for the rest of the performances, they ranged from adequate to great. I never understood why people doubted Don Cheadle replacing Terrence as Rhodey/War Machine from the start. I never did, and he did just what I expected him to. He didn't overact, he didn't steal the show (although I doubt that's possible when your co-start is RDJ), and his voice fit the commanding character that I felt Rhodey's should have been in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I like Terrence Howard in particular roles, but not as Rhodey. I felt his talent was misplaced. And don't get me started on Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Yeah, she's triple covert, and oh my god. That's all I need to say. (wipes drool from mouth). Gwyneth Paltrow returns from the first film, and she's just as quirky. She and RDJ play off of each other very well. That's definitely a dynamic that I enjoy revisiting these films to see.<br /><br />Now Sam Jackson just so happens to be my favorite actor, due to his natural cool guy persona. Him being in this universe is enough for me to be giddy about, yet alone playing such a pivotal role in the Avengers Initiative. While he didn't have a lot of screen time as Nick Fury, I still feel like he still did a great job at capturing the character from Mark Millar's The Ultimates. Ironically, Millar's updated, black Nick Fury was based on Sam Jackson's likeness before he even knew. I feel like I would be doing this guy a disservice if I didn't at least mention Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson. He has actually grown on me as a character after seeing him in almost every film in the quasi-series. Now for the villains. I love Iron Man, and Jeff Bridges. While I thought he made a great corporate villain, something about him being inside of the Iron Monger suit rubbed me the wrong way. I just never really believed it, but it got the job done. Fast forward to Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Rockwell's Justin Hammer was played more for humor, and the jokes often fell flat. He was still a little funny, and I probably wouldn't be able to chose anyone else for his roles but he just didn't serve as the comic relief that he was intended to be. He reminded me of a skinny version of Austin Powers, except he couldn't fight. That's probably not much of an insult coming from me, because I'm skinny, but I'd like to think I can defend myself. It's not even as if the film needed any more comic relief. Tony Stark was the funniest one in it, and his interactions with Pepper, and Rhodey, have enough to supply the laughs. I was waiting to see Hammer get his due because I loved his character, but that didn't happen in this movie. Perhaps he'll be one of the villains again in the third installment.<br /><br />Now for the main villain, played by Mickey Rourke. Rourke rounds out the all-star cast as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, if that's what you want to call him. Don't get me wrong, he was Whiplash, in essence, but if you've never picked up an Iron Man comic before (or watched the cartoon from the 90's), you'd only know him as Ivan Vanko. He was a more fearsome adversary than Jeff Bridges as Iron Monger. His badassedness was not displayed quite as much as I had hoped, but you still got the message that he was not to be messed with, a few times. I genuinely felt for his character at first, because his father didn't deserve to live, and die, the way he was forced to, after working with Howard Stark to design the very arc reactor that powered the Iron Man suit, and kept Tony alive. It was his choice of handling that situation that drives you to loathe him. Rourke played him a bit cartooney, but he still did a fine job, even if you can't always understand the Russian accent. Sadly, his final showdown with War Machine and Iron Man is so short that you will miss it if you blink. To be fair, the finale in Iron Man 2 still pissed on the finale in the first one. My only complaint about Iron Man is the lack of a decent final fight. That rooftop/street showdown was very anticlimactic, so I was looking forward to Jon Favreau upping the ante for the sequel. He definitely did, and it wreaks havoc on your sound system. Wow. Window shattering, neighbor waking stuff. Even though I said that the movie did not spend too much time pushing the Avengers into existence, it was still very there. Front and center, to be honest, but never overbearing, like it has been made out to be. There were a few nicely placed little easter eggs that very clearly winked at us fans of the Marvel Universe.<br /><br />One golden nugget (or red, white, and blue, to be exact) actually made me laugh with excitement for what has now become my second favorite Marvel Studios production, after the first Iron Man. That would be Captain America: The First Avenger. Overall, the film was pretty funny. More humorous than anything else, but that's not to say that the action was not impressive. It was definitely good stuff, but this movie still didn't meet my expectations, as far as the hype that was built around it. It's surprising that this all-star cast could not elevate this sequel about its predecessor. I would rank it on the lower side of Marvel Studios' filmography, but still fairly high in comparison to your average comic book movies. My ranking thus far (pre-Avengers) is: (1) Iron Man, (2) Captain America: The First Avenger, (3) The Incredible Hulk (which really needs a sequel, by the way, whether it be with Ruffalo or Norton -- obviously Ruffalo), (4) Iron Man 2, and (5) Thor (don't let me ranking it last fool you, I really like it). Anyway, back to the film at hand. I probably loved this movie more than the average moviegoer, or film enthusiast, due to me being such a huge comic geek, and Marvel fan. But nevertheless, this is a good movie. If you were to separate it from the first film, it probably wouldn't hold up quite as well, but it would still be good. I've defended this movie from the claims that it's just an Avengers preview throughout this review, and I stand by that, but to be honest, had Favreau chosen not to put as many Avengers easter eggs and set-ups in it, it would probably stand on its own merit better. So to wrap this up, I liked it less than the original, but I still highly recommend it to fans of the Marvel U, or comic book flicks in general. If you're not into comic book films, I say rent it first.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>I like this one more than the first. Everything was already set up in the first movie, so with this.one we get to jump right in to Iron Man. Mickey Rourke makes a great villian and he has been in some great movies here lately. The wrestler was a great movie. Downey has been making a hell of a come back to. Check this one out, then go see avengers!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>First, I want to say that this review is for the movie and not the box. I hate it when you read a review and some idiot starts out by reviewing the damn box the movie came in. I guess if I dropped a turd in a cute little box and sealed it up good that's enough for a 5 star review. Give me a break!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the original Iron Man more the 2nd time around. I started the sequel but never finished it. I recently came back to it with a fresher perspective and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, the sequel pits Iron Man against 3 foes: a vengeful Russian named Ivan (Mickey Rourke), a rival battle-suit maker played by Sam Rockwell, and finally himself as the hardware in the middle of his chest supporting his body is going bad. The story was decent enough for the world that this film takes place in. The action scenes and special effects were well done. If I had a choice between Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard I'd take Howard only because I believe that his charisma matches up with Downey's.<br /><br />This film was definitely not as good as the first film in the story department but the action was as good if not better. And I think the film set up next year's Avengers movie well. I wonder if the Hulk's going to be in that film? Anyway, like I said, Iron Man 2 is a good, not great, sequel and if you go into it with realistic expectations you will like the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>Pretty darn good. Functions reasonably well as a stand alone film. Functions very well as a continuation of the build toward the Avengers movie. Avoids the trap of multiplying villains with each sequel. Continues adding depth (though not tremendous depth) to all of the characters. Jon Favreau accomplishes a difficult and thankless task with style and aplomb in continuing this franchise. And I admire his geek-knowledge foresight in giving himself a tiny part in IM1 as the character who eventually marries Gwyneth Paltrow's character. Smooth, buddy, smooth.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>After the events of the first movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) has revealed to the world and himself that he is Iron-Man as he is making history. Ivan Vanko (Michael Rouke Jr.) avenges his father's death whom his father believed his ideas were stolen by the Starks years ago, Ivan becomes Whiplash who is hellbent on destroying Stark. However, Tony is dealing with some health problems from that radiation of his artificial heart energy source but needs to make an improved one that can cure him and make him better. Now with the help of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), James Rhodes (Don Chadel), Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and BlackWidow (Scarlett Johanson) he must conflict an enemy worse than the last one he dealt with.<br /><br />A terrific and entertaining sequel to the surprisingly well done 2008 Marvel film, Jon Feravue returns back as director. I like how this movie deals with conflict including great character development and good acting. The action sequences are even bigger this time around including a very satisfying race track sequence that is just mind-blowing. There's also psychological issues in the film on the main character's conflict about what he is dealing with even with his love for Pepper. I should say this is a very good sequel that sets up for "Thor" at the very end of this movie.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray/DVD combo offers fresh brilliant picture and sound quality that skyrockets to the roof with wonderful extras like audio commentary, Footage Scan Mode which explores SHIELD data that pops up during the movie, The Vault which digs deeper into weapons and all that kind of stuff. On-and-off storyboards and animatics during the movie, 8 deleted scenes, documentary, featurettes, art galleries, trailers, music video and Marvel trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>With this review of Iron Man 2, I have seen the film twice in theaters.<br /><br />The sequel is following in the steps of recent blockbuster sequels in that it has so many storylines to follow. (even though the director mentioned they wanted to keep things simple)<br /><br />While not as complex as Batman Begins, Iron Man 2 is full of new characters and actions scenes. The additional action scenes are a warm welcome to the lack from the first film while some of the new characters were a painful need.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr returns as Tony Stark/Iron Man. With fame all around, Stark must deal with his mortality as the power source in his chest is slowly poisoning him to death.<br /><br />Don Cheadle fills in as Col. Rhodes. I like this actor switch. Cheadle brings a weight that "that other guy" missed. In this film, we get to see War Machine in his full glory: guns blazing and heavy duty explosions.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson star as Black Widow even though they never use this name in the film. She is part of SHIELD and is tasked with keeping an eye on Stark. She has a dizzying fight scene near the end of the film.<br /><br />In fact, if the entire movie had the thrill of the last few minutes, this movie would be truly epic.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts and is given the job as Stark Industry CEO. The quick banter between Potts and Stark returns but their chemistry is on the short side (once again victim of too many new characters)<br /><br />Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's main business rival. I suppose you could call him a villain but he just wanted to be the country's main source of weapons. I think there was too much Rockwell in this movie...too much not-funny Rockwell.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is the main villain in Iron Man 2. He's on a vengeance kick against Stark because of some bad family blood with their respected fathers. I still don't get why this guy is seen as such a good actor.<br /><br />Samuel L Jackson returns as Nick Fury. At this point every character is Jackson regardless of the character's name. Supposedly Jackson got the studio to contract him into 9 films in order to be in this film. Ego much?<br /><br />Iron Man 2 doesn't quick live up to the hype but it was some big hype. The final battle scenes make the entire movie. It seems as if Jon Favreau took the criticism from the first movie (poor final battle) and upped the octane.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Thinking that it's probably another sequel that doesn't match up to the original. I was wrong; I thought Iron Man 2 was better, a more likable and entertaining film than the first! Of course, it helps to know in advance that the "hero" ("Ton Stark," played by Robert Downey) is even more obnoxious in this film. Knowing that, I didn't let that bother me and just enjoyed the good acting in here and the excellent special-effects.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke ("Ivan Vanko") is almost always interesting to watch so I enjoyed his role, too, even if I had a hard time understanding his Russian accent.<br /><br />The story is, yes, sophomoric but most action films today are. Just enjoy the funny lines, CGI, the pretty women (Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johannson) and wild heroes and villains and you should get your money's worth out of the viewing. See it on Blu-Ray and you'll enjoy it that much more.</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>Hearing about the (implied) problems the director had with the people from Marvel, who own the rights to the character, one realises we were lucky this film is as good as it is. It is a shame when a film (Iron Man) whose success was uncertain and which was a gamble, but which turned out to be very profitable can be a curse. Everyone involved wants to repeat the success, especially the financial return, but at what cost?<br /><br />I will always be glad we got the first film, which I feel is a classic. I just hope things don't get worse with Iron Man 3 - a lot of us know how sequel quality seems to go downhill, yet we still support them and make up the audience for them - strange, isn't it?</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>While Iron Man 2 may not be perfect, it is a very solid and fun sequel. Improvements include better action sequences and some great characters added to the franchise. Unfortunately there is a lot going on here and even though it isn't hard to follow, there isn't enough time to give each sub plot the proper screen time it deserves. Oddly enough for a super hero film, I think they could have edited some of the talky scenes down and added a little more Iron Man action.<br /><br />A good example of this is when we meet Natasha Romanova she isn't given much to do and I found myself wondering if she was going to be The Black Widow on screen. She is only in one action sequence(a great one with one of the funniest moments in the film)late in the movie and she and Nick Fury are really only there to set up The Avengers movie. I'm not saying it should be edited out, but there is only so much ground you can cover in two hours. Whiplash is played with gusto by Mickey Rourke, but he doesn't have much screen time either and that seems to be the problem with this film, no one but Tony Stark gets enough screen time.<br /><br />After the first encounter with Whiplash in Monaco on the race track, we don't really get a good dose of Iron man until the final battle, which means there is over an hour of time where there isn't that much action. Considering what I had read about this being an action packed film, I found it to be very talky. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the characters are well developed and the actors are all really good here.<br /><br />The final battle is very good with some very cool Iron Man destruction and some nifty moves, but it's surprising and anti-climatic when Whiplash is defeated very quickly. In the first film, I thought the final battle was too long and in this one, it just seems to end too abruptly. I'm not bashing this film in any way as it is a very fun film that I will most certainly own the DVD/Blu Ray when it is released, but I think the story may have been a little too ambitious for one film.<br /><br />Overall I give Iron Man 2 a solid B(4 stars)and I think Favreau did a very good job all things considered. Of course if you are seeing this in a theater, then stick around until the end of the credits role for a little teaser scene about another Marvel Hero who will be hitting theaters next year.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>At the end of 2008, I made two bold assertions: (1) That "Iron Man" was one of the year's best films; (2) that "Iron Man" was one of the greatest superhero films ever made. I still believe both to be true. Now we have "Iron Man 2." While it is thoroughly entertaining, it's also a bit conventional when compared to its predecessor, having less of a compelling story but more in the ways of action, special effects, gadgets, humor, and stunt work. It's a comic book through and through. That's fine by me - what it lacks in introspection it more than makes up for in sheer fun. We have plenty to cheer for, not the least of which is our hero, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), who when we last left him had shut down the weapon's division of his company to focus on more humanitarian uses for technology. The result was a high tech metal suit equipped with rocket boosters and missile launchers.<br /><br />It's now six months after Stark revealed himself as Iron Man at a press conference. Despite the demands of a United States Senate committee, he refuses to share his technology with the American military, believing that world peace can be maintained only if it's privatized. At this meeting, he humiliates Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the CEO of a rival company who has unsuccessfully tried to outdo Stark's technology with his own prototype machines; in an effort to get ahead, Hammer appeals to Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who publically revealed his grudge against Stark by attacking him as he was car racing in Monaco. For as yet unknown reasons, Vanko has constructed an arc reactor very similar to the one implanted in Stark's chest. He has improved the design by attaching whips that surge with bolts of electrical energy.<br /><br />Stark, meanwhile, is realizing that his chest implant, originally constructed as a way to keep him alive, contains an element that's slowly poisoning him. He doesn't handle it well. He acts out. He drinks in excess. He hastily appoints his former personal assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), as the new CEO of his company. If he's to survive, he must replace the core of the implant with an entirely new element, one he has tried but failed to create on his own. Out of the blue comes special agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who suggests that Stark look to his father's research for guidance.<br /><br />New to the cast is Don Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard as Stark's dedicated but weary friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes. Also new is Scarlett Johansson as Stark's newly hired personal assistant Natalie Rushman, who says she's from the company's legal department.<br /><br />Watching this movie, I was quite dazzled by the sights and sounds, and I found the plot engaging in a suspension-of-disbelief kind of way. I did not, however, find it persuasive, as I did the first film, which I felt put a refreshing and thought-provoking spin on the traditional comic book adversary; Stark might have physically battled with the power-hungry Obadiah Stane, but his real enemies were war and injustice, both of which he took part in by selling weapons of mass destruction. This time around, it's much more by the book - a superhero pitted against a madman out for revenge, a fight to the finish that includes a lot of things blowing up, a showcase of digital wizardry and highly choreographed stunts. There are a number of films that can give you pretty much the same thing.<br /><br />That being said, there's no denying the quality of the performances, especially Downey, whose cocky take on Stark makes the film fun but not jokey. Rockwell is quite good, playing Hammer is if he were Stark's slightly goofier evil twin - comedy relief with a hint of something darker, you might say. Credit also to Rourke, who truly does convey the anger, resentment, and pain his character feels in every one of his scenes. He isn't given all that much screen time, but when he's on, he's on, resonating with a deep, calm, frighteningly low voice and an imposing build.<br /><br />If there is an "Iron Man 3," and I have no doubt that there will be, I can only hope it doesn't follow its predecessor's lead and decline in quality. The original "Iron Man" was a superb film, redefining the superhero genre for both old and new generations of moviegoers. "Iron Man 2" is a great looking and wonderfully performed sequel, although its approach to the story is routine, more so than I had preferred it to be. Still, you've got to hand it to director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux - they sure know how to entertain an audience. There's an early scene in which Stark, dressed as Iron Man, jumps off a plane, flies through the sky, and lands unharmed in the middle of one of his own lavishly high tech expos in New York City. Throngs of people cheer him on. I suspect the audiences for this movie will do the same when it's over.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>There's nothing like that first kiss, yeah, and so even though IRON MAN 2 comes out and unleashes its share of awesomeness, even though it is very much worth a look, the mystery is gone, the expectations met, we've, er, already copped that feel. IRON MAN 2, good as it is, doesn't drop on us like lightning in a bottle, and so it isn't quite as exhilarating. What it does give us is more of that good Robert Downey, Jr.<br /><br />The guy has made the Invincible Iron Man into his own, and I can't see anyone else now as Tony Stark, and I'm betting you can't, either. Downey brings the same devilish, bigger-than-life charisma, that same brash "I'm Tony Stark! Who the eff are you?!" swagger. Tony Stark is brilliant and ego-centric, but he's got good intentions. His heart's in the right place, and so we forgive the rampant narcissism. Plus, he's a fun dude to be around.<br /><br />IRON MAN 2 chronicles Tony's fall from grace and his redemption. Six months ago Tony Stark told the world that he was Iron Man. But has fame and success gone to his head? He's been more eccentric lately, indulging even more in hedonism lately, and he's conducting the Stark Expo like it's a rock concert (which is actually bloody cool). Certain parties are worried. Iron Man's arrival had gone a ways into ensuring global peace or at least global detente. But six months later, the American government - as embodied in the person of the slimy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) - is itching to get its paws on the Iron Man tech and, so, Tony has to attend senate hearings. Stark, in his own inimitable manner, blows the hearings out of the water.<br /><br />There's a fatal flaw in the schematics, a gremlin in the wires. Carefree on the outside, on the inside Tony is very concerned. The palladium element in the arc reactor in his chest is gradually poisoning him, and each use of the Iron Man armor accelerates the condition. But he keeps up the pretense, having informed no one of his impending death. Maybe you can't blame the guy for carrying on so.<br /><br />I actually expected this movie to delve into Tony's alcoholism (from the classic story arc in the comics), but we only get a peek at the man's fondness for booze. We do get moments when we see the flamboyant playboy take a sippy, as well as one epic drunken binge at a party (while in armor, no less). This public eff-up sends Tony's credibility plummeting, and that slimy senator's smirk just got even smirkier.<br /><br />Rival industrialist Justin Hammer isn't the Big Bad of the movie, but Sam Rockwell supplies him with a pronounced air of unctuousness, and you hate him. Hammer, fed up with languishing in Stark's shadow, hires a crazed and tattooed Russian physicist to craft his own arsenal of armored suits, and a Russian physicist played by the menacing Mickey Rourke probably would have no choice but to be crazed and tattooed. They don't call Rourke's character by his supervillain code name, but it's Whiplash (with a smidge of Crimson Dynamo thrown in). He nurses a serious grudge against Tony and Tony's father, Howard Stark, who had a falling out with Whiplash's own inventor father. But how does Rourke get away with chewing a toothpick all the time?<br /><br />IRON MAN 2 isn't magic like the first movie and that initial sense of novelty has worn off, but it's still terrific and the scale is bigger. Downey's presence drives the thing, and the fact that we don't mind that Tony Stark is onscreen more than Iron Man says something about the skills set Downey brings to the party. We still get that good banter between him and Gwyneth Paltrow. Don Cheadle takes over from Terrence Howard, and it's like he's always been on board as Rhodey. The f/x is flawless state of the art stuff; there's nothing like heavy metal clashing resoundingly. If you've at all seen the posters and the trailer, then you already know War Machine would make his debut, and he may not be as impressive as the ol' shellhead but, damn, he's got all those big mounted guns. And, for dessert, curvy Scarlett Johansson steps into the franchise as the smoking hot Black Widow and she demonstrates high levels of kickassery. And oh that sexy black leather....<br /><br />I only wish Pepper Potts were given more stuff to do.<br /><br />Jon Favreau features himself more as Happy Hogan, a chauffer in this incarnation, and I'm not mad at Favreau. What's the point of being director if you can't call your own number once in a while? Meanwhile, IRON MAN 2, in a scene here and there, gets us another step closer to that Avengers movie. Somewhere, executives from DC Comics must be gnashing their teeth, late to the game, lagging behind. The Green Lantern movie had better be something.<br /><br />And, as become a habit with Marvel Studios flicks, stick around until after the closing credits, yeah? Nerd nirvana awaits.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>A director who always stars in his own movies?  The last time we had this successful combo was Alfred Hitchcock.  Lately, we have Jon Favreau and his Iron Man movies.  Based on the Marvel Comics and starring his friend Robert Downey Junior, Iron Man 1 and 2 were box office successes and rated well with critics.  This 2nd installation takes of where the first one ended, and employs the same comedy, sarcasm, action style, and main characters as the first one, though with different villians of course.  And in this movie, the romance between Iron Man and his secretary / assistant leads to their first kiss.  As usual, the special effects are great, the story is original, the plot keeps the audience on their toes, and we have the SHIELD organization lurking in the background.  All told, a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.5<br /><br />In 2008, Iron Man took the box office by storm garnering high praise from fans and critics alike and grossing over $500 million worldwide. Personally, I was very surprised at how I liked it for its storytelling, witty humor, and blockbuster production values. It was thoughtful enough in establishing Tony Stark as a meaningful character, while at the same time providing loads of entertainment. With expectations set high, Iron Man 2 has a lot of anticipation going for it. And while it doesn't quite exceed its predecessor, I think it's just as good. The plot opens up 6 months after the end of the first film and puts Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in the presence of a senate hearing where the government basically wants him to turn the Iron Man suit over at the "interest of national security." But being the egotistical, yet virtuous, man that he is, Stark defends his case with ease by nonchalantly proving it'd be safer under his own personal use. Seeing this from afar, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), is sickened by Stark's actions and false pretenses and vows to put him in his place. In the meantime, rival weapons contractor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) takes notice of Vanko's ambition and offers his resources in a joint effort to take down both Iron Man, as well as an ailing Tony Stark. Narrative wise, IM2 is a little less personable than the first as we were introduced to Stark, saw him realize his guilt, then become Iron Man in an effort of redemption. Here, after discovering that his palladium chest piece is slowly killing him, Stark must face his own mortality in and outside of the suit. But at the same time, being who he is (i.e. very kept to himself), he refuses confide in anyone. As a result, it alienates him and tarnishes his more likable portrayal from the first film. However, once he comes to terms with his father's legacy, he realizes his mistake and strives to become, not just Iron Man again, but the Iron Man worthy of his Avengers candidacy. The real diverging point in IM2, though, (and probably something that's greatly divided the fanbase) is the excess of comic book elements thrown in. The additions of Nick Fury, Black Widow, War Machine, Whiplash, Justin Hammer, and his robot army might feel a bit overwhelming with their newness. But I personally love the feeling of expansion it gives, especially considering the massive amount of crossovers, cameos, and references that will have to be made when Thor, Captain America, Iron Man 3, and The Avengers movies are done. But don't let that deter you. Despite all of the extra components, IM2 is still fun to watch with a snarkier script, more brisk pacing, better special effects, stellar action sequences, and a star-studded cast of actors. The next two years can't come soon enough.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />Iron Man 2 presents itself with a much fuller image than the first movie. I absolutely love the filmic texture this one has in comparison. The slightly darker look may throw some people off, but I think it helps a great deal in CG effects integration, making for quite a pristine picture. To start off, colors possess an amazing amount of vibrancy. Red, gold, orange, yellow, occasional blues, and a little bit of green (in the Japanese garden) dominate the palette presenting some very cool shots, especially for action scenes. Blacks are deep and inky, while shadow delineation reveals an adequate amount of depth in all the tiny little lines and textures, nothing less from a Blu-ray with a newly minted transfer. Contrast helps to balance things out and doesn't waver a bit in terms of saturation levels or screen lighting. Facial features and flesh tones look excellent, particularly Scarlett Johansson with her pouty lips and pretty green eyes when we see her for the first time and she gets into the training ring. But getting back to the CG, I have to reiterate just how flawless it all looks and fits into the picture and overall scope of the plot. I thought IM1 looked good. But considering how much more action-packed IM2 is, it's amazing to even contemplate the amount of work that went into producing this special effects extravaganza. You can pretty much use any of the action sequences as demo material for the video or audio. But if I had to narrow it down to specific scenes, I'd say the fight in Monaco is definitely good for contrast (being the only daytime fight scene in the entire movie), the meeting with Nick Fury for black levels (not a racial thing, he just happens to be wearing a lot of black, which shows some good detail in his clothes), and the final battle at the Stark Expo/Japanese Garden for overall color (lots of greens, pinks, and charcoals, especially recommended). There's a little bit of banding in the digital backgrounds, but it's only a minor quibble in an otherwise reference video presentation. There are no signs EE, DNR, or a single artifact to sully, yet, another very fine transfer from the people at Paramount.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Like the video, the audio portion of this film also outdoes its predecessor. The DTS-HD track here is instant go-to material and very representative of the advantages of lossless audio in general. From the very beginning of the movie, we get an enticing tease of what to expect in terms of directionality, separation, and LFEs as the opening credits introduce us to some ominous music, Ivan working on his own Arc Reactor, and some pounding bass effects. Aside from the obvious gunfire and weapons mayhem, the sound design for IM2 greatly utilizes all four surround speakers. Crowd noise and cheering make up a good deal of ambience during the more low-key dialogue sequences such as the intro of the Stark Expo (minus the flashy entrance) or Stark's hearing in front of the senate. There's some especially nice reverberation in Downey Jr.'s voice when he speaks on the microphones, and I'm very pleased at how much clarity and buoyancy came through. Dynamic and discrete effects from Jarvis and all the little workshop noises are on par with the previous film, though I might even be inclined to say it sounds better as a result of the balanced score. The score, by the way, is a big improvement. No disrespect to Ramin Djiwadi for his catchy riffs and rhythms from IM1, but John Debney did an outstanding job fusing both a traditional orchestral feel, as well as a contemporary rock one (thanks in big part to Tom Morello for his guitar work). But of course, the real highlight of this audio track is its riveting display of action. All sorts of weapons fire fill the soundscape in every which direction with the rears and sub getting a good portion of the home theater workout. Explosions, palladium-powered armaments and flight, landing suits of armor, and other large machinery showcase some of the finest LFEs I've heard in retrospect to screenplay and mood setting. Again, the obvious choices to use for reference are any of the action sequences mentioned above. But don't be afraid to test the Stark Expo or Senate Hearing scenes either. Fans of the film will be quite pleased with this awesome presentation.<br /><br />Extras - 5.0<br /><br />For those who really enjoy special features, this combo pack comes loaded with hours of excellent production and background information. To start, disc 1 comes with an audio commentary by director Jon Favreau, a S.H.I.E.L.D. Vault trivia database, and a P-i-P pre-viz track that can play along with the movie. The commentary makes for an extremely entertaining and informative listen. Favreau maintains a good pace with lots of useful tidbits about the filming itself, elements of the story, and the occasional anecdote. This is probably my favorite feature of all the extras, as it really changed my overall perspective of the plot and its character development, as well as reconfirming my notion that it was all a result of setting up future Avengers stuff. He never leaves a lot of dead space and sounds very enthused about the work he accomplished. The Vault is a cool novelty that can be accessed from the menu by itself or as a pop up video track during the film via Footage Scan Mode. During the film, it doesn't do much. But as a standalone feature it provides a lot of interesting trivia for this building Marvel Movie Universe. Meanwhile, the pre-viz video track is exactly what it sounds like and makes for maybe one decent sitting at most. On disc 2, we get the meat of the making-of features. Ultimate Iron Man spans almost an hour and a half and covers just about everything up through post-production. The making-of they had on IM1 was great, and I liked how consistent this felt in conjunction to this proposed trilogy. Rounding out the rest of the relevant extras is another 30 minutes of Featurettes. Here, they give some extra coverage on set design and a little bit of background info on Nick Fury, Black Widow, and War Machine. When I first heard they were going to include these, I was expecting much longer segments like the 49-minute exposition they had for Tony Stark on IM1's specials. Unfortunately, the segments for these three don't even amount to half of what they had for Stark. But despite my disappointment, I still dig the commentary enough that I won't deduct any points. It's a very recommended listen.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />Iron Man 2 may be something of a mixed bag for general audiences, as the greater scope of things might be a little too overwhelming. I, however, have no qualms with the direction this took and am actually quite excited to see how things will eventually tie together when all the Avengers canon is complete. But regardless of what people may think of the story, IM2 is still heartful enough and is even more witty, charming, and thoroughly action-packed as the first. With reference A/V specs and a pleasing set of extras led by one of the best commentaries I've heard in a while, Iron Man 2 comes highly recommended, and is a must-own for fans.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film, but don't think it was as good as the first one.

It is a sequel to 2008's Iron Man and other than James Rhodes (who was portrayed by Terrence Howard in the first film but is now played by Don Cheadle) the cast has returned.  It is hard to rave about a movie that is for the most part a simple sequel that isn't a huge improvement on the original, but on the other hand the first film was so good it's important to include Iron Man 2 as among the best comic book films to be made so far within a relatively newer sub-genre in its renaissance.  Jon Favreau directs and once again walks a fine line between serious drama and kitsch with great success.  He has to be one of the brightest filmmakers doing pure Hollywood blockbusters today.  He's a filmmaker doing what he wants and having fun with it, but making the suits very happy.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 brings the arrogant drunk arms dealer Tony Stark, whose just charming enough to like, back but under the scrutiny of  Senator Stern (played by Gary Shandling) for withholding a serious weapon; himself.  Stark is human enough to work on screen and it makes it all the more intriguing when we see a flawed personality like him make good decisions.  He is a greater hero than most casual comic book readers give him credit for and it is nice to see this franchise get this kind of outstanding treatment.  Tony's Iron Man technology is something that Stern feels could get into the wrong hands and used against the United States, but Stark quickly demonstrates that this just isn't the case. Of course the film's most notable baddie demonstrates otherwise when he shows up and attacks Iron Man himself.  He is Ivan Vanko, a maniacal super genius physicist who has harnessed some of Stark's technology to create giant appendages that can cut cars in half.  In the spirit of the comics Vanko is aesthetically an interpretation of the more obscure Whiplash and that is his name, but he is essentially The Crimson Dynamo as I remember him, and Ivan's father (a rival of Stark's father) even bears the classic villain's real name, Anton.  Either way it is a fantastic hybrid and with Mickey Rourke at his absolute best Iron Man 2 has a villain more than worthy of top praise.  Whiplash is awesome and I was openly cheering for him the whole time.  He is funded by naive and clumsy Justin Hammer (played by Sam Rockwell) who is really the archetype rich boy villain.  He's like one of those rich guys on those horrific reality shows that everyone hates with blind passion.  He is Tony Stark without the witty humor, ethics, intelligence, and style.  He's Tony Stark if Brett Ratner directed Iron Man.  Regardless, Hammer is a great villain and Sam Rockwell deserves some praise for a truly thankless performance.  All these great casting choices and I almost forget to mention that Iron Man gets some awesome help with the return of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, the first screen appearance of sexy future Avenger Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and of course James Rhodes, who becomes War Machine.<br /><br />That is of course a summary worthy of some top of the line special effects and that is what these movies need if they are going to make big money.  They get it here within some outstanding action scenes, but Iron Man 2 deserves extra praise for being a thoughtfully written film that truly puts together one of the best casts I've ever seen for roles like this.  Gwenyth Paltrow (who returns as Pepper Potts) and Robert Downey, Jr. have chemistry well beyond the standards of normal action fare and Jon Favreau himself lends some legitimate comic relief, a staple in these films, hamming it up as Happy Hogan.  This is a fantastic action film that puts all the elements it takes to make a good film in their right place.  One nitpicking might be that I wanted to see more duel screen time for Rourke and Downey, Jr., being that both actors are at the top of their game and making us forget that they are still in the midst of their respective comebacks.  Iron Man versus Whiplash is turned into a rivalry that tops all but Batman and The Joker in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight</a>.  I can't wait to see what the future brings for Marvel Studios and Iron Man.  Oh, and do not forget to wait and watch after the credits for more hints toward future Marvel Studios projects.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>This was more like a behind the scenes in the life of an action hero where we got to see the high and low points of the main character.

Instead of a perfect being with super powers fighting the bad guys we see a man with problems like everyone else but one using a special gift to fight the forces of evil. As a result there is a little less action but just as much fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Director Jon Favreau continues to excel with Marvel's new superhero franchise in the exciting blockbuster sequel "Iron Man 2". With the world now aware of his secret, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is determined to ensure that his Iron Man technology doesn't fall into the wrong hands, despite the countless pressures from the US government to turn over his technology for military application. If knowing that his personal arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body wasn't bad enough, Stark must also deal with the vengeful scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and the greedy industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). "Iron Man 2" delivers everything that one would expect for a big Summer blockbuster sequel. Though it does fall short of the original, many of the key elements are still present in the sequel, and it definitely offers a very good dose of exciting action and impressive special effects. Robert Downey Jr. continues to dominate the role of Tony Stark. The cast also includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" is one of this year's biggest movies, and Paramount certainly delivers a standout fully-loaded 3-disc presentation that ranks as one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year. The blockbuster sequel is presented in a 2.35:1 HD format. The picture quality is excellent and its DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound is certainly amazing. Among special features, it includes a commentary track by director Jon Favreau, the four-part documentary "Ultimate Iron Man: The Making of Iron Man 2", 6 behind-the-scenes featurettes (Creating Stark Expo, Practical Meets Digital, Illustrated Origin: Nick Fury, Illustrated Origin: Black Widow, Illustrated Origin: War Machine & Working With DJ AM), picture galleries, trailers and 8 deleted scenes. Overall, "Iron Man 2" scores an "A-".</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Iron Man 2" finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), billionaire owner of Stark Industries, very much out of the closet as Iron Man. He's enjoying the notoriety that superhero status has given him, gloating about all he has done for humankind in the past few years. Actually, his behavior seems out of control, and personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is increasingly frustrated by Tony's self-destructive antics. Little does she know that the palladium core of the arc reactor Tony wears is slowly killing him. Meanwhile, the US government is demanding that Stark turn over his Iron Man suits to the Defense Department. And a new rival, Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), is building his own arc reactor to avenge an old score.<br /><br />The "Iron Man" franchise continues to distinguish itself from other films based on Marvel Comics characters with its sense of humor. These are action-comedies that, perhaps ironically, also have the strongest socio-political subtexts. Leave it to Robert Downey, Jr. to play crazy, funny, and heroic at the same time. Sam Rockwell is an inspired, not necessarily obvious, choice to play Stark's arch-rival in business Justin Hammer, CEO of a rival defense contractor. Director Jon Favreau has done a great job with the visuals and managed to find the right tone as the film vacillates between high-octane action and slightly hammy comedy. "Iron Man 2" isn't as strong as 2008's "Iron Man", partly because introducing the SHIELD organization into the mix creates too many characters.<br /><br />I'm not a reader of comic books, so the introduction of characters from other storylines seems odd to me. I understand that comic books do this a lot, but it can be problematic in a 2-hour film, where maintaining focus among a change of CEOs at Stark Industries, a sinister plot involving a Russian scientist and rival businessman, a crusading senator, a military friend who may be foe, a drunken and desperate hero, and a lot of explosions already presents a challenge. Scarlett Johanssen is probably fine as SHIELD babe Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff, but I can't say that her action scenes were convincing. Other than that, "Iron Man 2" is a lot of fun and is happy to be over-the-top in everything it does. And its sly jabs at the defense industry are pretty funny.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2010 single disc edition): The single disc offers an audio commentary by director Jon Favreau. He talks a lot about his decisions, what he chose to do or not to do and why, the reason for the sequence at the beginning of the film, themes, what was included or had to be left out. It's a good commentary if you're interested in directorial decisions or cutting. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French. Descriptive video service (DVS) is also available in English for the visually impaired.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>This is an intense action film at points. But at other points there seems to be too much cross-talk between Stark and his CEO (I find her voice to be particularly irritating). While the film has its moments, the producers of the film have a hidden agenda, that is to keep the Iron Man movies as a profitable franchise.<br /><br />Stark comes across as a spoilt brat that wants the world to be at his beck and call. The unit in his chest is slowly killing him and he resorts to recklessness as a solution. I feel that a successful person at that level would have been more mature and responsible.<br /><br />The final battle scene is at night ... again a bit of a let down.<br /><br />In order to set the stage for the next sequel, there are scenes with Samuel Jackson, who is the head of some sort of Justice League group and alludes to his troubles in the south-west. These scenes do not really add any present value to the film but ensures that the franchise will survive.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Iron Man 2 is a fun, albeit flawed, sequel that also serves as more of a set-up for future Marvel movies.  That being said, this sequel doesn't have enough of what made the first film so much fun: action, Downey improv & banter, and a villain that doesn't get near enough screen time.  This time around, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is battling the blood poisoning that is slowly killing him, while also taking on rival industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Russian genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke).  Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Stark's love interest/assistant Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as James Rhodes (who dons the War Machine armor, and seems to wind up being a better acting choice as well), Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as the Black Widow, and Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury; all of which are pretty servicable, but once again, it's Downey's show, and he's loving every minute of it.  I personally dug Rourke's take on Whiplash as he proves to be the most interesting character here other than Stark, but his screen time is sadly lacking.  Still, director Jon Favreau (who has quite a bit of an expanded role here than he did the last time around as Stark's bodyguard) manages to weave a fun sequel, even if it doesn't have that same kind of magic that the first film had before it.  And of course, make sure to hang around after the credits.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>How do you follow up a highly praised popcorn flick?

And when I say "plenty," I mean there's more going on than in any season of most TV shows.  This movie has so many irons in the fire (pardon the pun) that keeping up with them is a job.  If I had to find one fault with this film, there is so much awesome content that I can't keep all of it straight.  A little trimming might not be amiss.<br /><br />Months after revealing his secret identity, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark as Iron Man (got that?) has brought world peace, become even more of a celebrity, and lost control of his life.  So he promoted his assistant to CEO, hires Scarlett Johanssen to keep his schedule, and gives Nick Fury the cold shoulder.  But he has secret rivals: Mickey Rourke wants to reclaim his father's legacy, and Don Cheadle as Rhodey wants Stark tech in U.S. Army hands.<br /><br />For a movie stuffed with lickety-split comic book action, this one also carries a lot of smart character development, dry humor, and real-world political commentary.  But you already know that if you saw the first one.  This one contains no surprises; it just pushes the dynamics from the first film to even greater heights of accomplishment.  It's not so much a sequel as the second half of a single film.<br /><br />But as I say, it's overstuffed.  It runs 125 minutes, a hair shorter than the original, but feels much longer.  Between business, politics, romance, heroism, military, and more, this movie has more threads running through than a knitters' convention.  Not one of them is poor, and I loved them all, but when a character comes back after a thirty-minute absence and I can't recall who that is, the film is too busy.<br /><br />This movie made me laugh, cheer, and think.  I enjoyed it.  It has good set pieces, smart characters, an energetic story, and plenty to keep a diverse audience engaged.  I just wish it were a little slimmer, so I could keep all the numerous story elements in mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>The Iron Man 2 sequel begins in Moscow.  It is snowing outside, while an old man, Anton Vanko, lay dying in his bed, his son Ivan sitting next to him.  Apparently Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark) and Anton had worked together many years ago developing plans, but Howard had Anton shipped off to Siberia where he lived the rest of his life in poverty, while Howard Stark became filthy rich. Needless to say, Ivan is a bit upset when daddy dies.  He grabs some plans and starts working feverishly on an Iron Man "heart".<br /><br />Back in New York, Tony Stark is telling the world he is Iron Man and celebrating with a big Expo celebration for single-handedly achieving world peace.  He is summoned to Washington DC to testify before some Senate Committee and asked to turn over the Iron Man suit to the government because it is a weapon.  Of course, his answer is no.<br /><br />Back in Stark's ocean-front Malibu home, we find out the paladium core so vital to Iron Man is also killing Tony slowly by increasing his blood toxicity levels.  Not telling Gwenyth Paltrow, he appoints her CEO of Stark Industries and his successor, if anything happens to him.<br /><br />In the famous Monaco street race is where bad-guy Ivan catches up with Tony.  He comes at him with a bad attitude and a bad invention he has cooked up in his little make-shift Moscow lab.<br /><br />There is a lot of action that follows with the good-guy/bad-guy thing while Tony is trying to find something to keep him from paladium meltdown.  The CGI is great and the Iron Man characters are bigger than life.<br /><br />I thought the first one was better, maybe because the concept was new or maybe because I waited for this one for awhile.  In any case, the movie was still excellent and well worth seeing.  It was hard to believe that Ivan was Mickey Rourke.  He just looked so totally different to me.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, is flying high, at the top of his game, or so it seems.  He's single-handedly managed to shut down the arms race, achieving de facto world peace, and his rivals aren't even close. Or so he thinks.  It turns out he and his father before him have made some hidden enemies along the way to corporate and personal success, and the U.S. military (not to mention nearly every other world power) doesn't like being preempted by a cocky upstart, and won't rest until they own the Iron Man suit or its equivalent.  Add to that daddy issues, frustrations at work with a frazzled overcompensating secretary and a beautiful and dangerous new assistant, and the stage is set for a classic escalation towards a massive climax.  It gets busy, and even goes dark here and there, especially when we see the super baddy evil genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), but never loses the playful and comic tone established by Robert Downey, Jr., his best friend Don Cheadle (Lt. Rhodes), and his incompetent archrival Sam Rockwell (Justin Hammer). For me the coolest parts of both films were the construction sequences, that make engineering complex and high power equipment look more fun than video games - as in this one when Stark gets a bright idea and remodels his entire house in order to construct a cool new energy source. Nothing profound, but lots of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>The best asset of a superhero franchise is when any installment lacks hubris:  either from its hero or from those who design it.  When a superhero is thrust in such peril that the outcome is in question, and the usual assumption that the good guy always wins has to be drawn back to consciousness, you know the creators have assembled a great movie.<br /><br />All the parts are intact:  The trajectory is fun; the enemy is menacing; the dialog is witty and clever; and the story is cogent and clear--easy enough to understand, but detailed enough to be stimulating without overloading our efforts to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />This time Iron Man [aka Tony Stark] (Downey Jr.) faces off with a Congressional committeeman, headed by Senator Stern (Chandling) who challenges his personal armored technology as dangerous and capable of escalating the arms race when brought to the wrong hands.  Stark's snappy answers win the day, but his lack of concessions bring a headlong, prideful fall that sends him unraveling.<br /><br />The Senator's witness, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell)[another arms' dealer] doesn't take his defeat in stride.  While showing off his prowess at auto race in Monaco, Stark faces his biggest challenge when an equally disgruntled Russian nemesis, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) unveils his electrifying half-man, half-human hybrid imitation.  From there Hammer builds an alliance with Vanko that makes inroads into the U.S. military, including with Stark's closest ally, Lt. Col James Rhodey (Cheadle).<br /><br />Of course the trajectory of the movie doesn't work without the fun.  A celebrated Iron Man must be chastened by all his handlers, including Pwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, his still wise-cracking assistant.  New to the fray is Scarlett Johansson in a refreshing, make-over role as the attractive and lethal duo identity Natalie/Natasha.  And while Stark's adolescent tendencies are not towed in line by both leading femme fatales, Cheadle and Jackson give able support.<br /><br />This adventure does go to the edge of danger, but not enough to fully pay dirt.  In some ways this isn't a five-star film for what I first thought were intangibles.  My first inclination was to dock the movie for its overlong half-time exposition, but that's not really fair.  An adventure movie that takes time out to think shouldn't be diminished, particularly when it delivers on the intelligence.  It also helps that Iron Man has some health/toxicity issues, thickening the plot, even if it is a dropped opportunity to provide more tension.<br /><br />The freshness and fun are just as apparent; it just comes down to the one factor I started out with at the beginning:  Do you have to stop and wonder (while you're clinging to someone's hand [or your chair] and sitting at the edge of your seat) how this guy is going to get out of all the mess?  What this sequel has going for it will propel it to at least two more sequels, but to have the cliffhanger feel of a sequel, like, say, 'Spider Man 2' is a bit of a stretch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>When I was a young boy I played with all sorts of action figures, GI Joes and Transformers the most.  Later as a young teen I got my first job at a comic book store.  What I often thought of was a collaboration of my favorites.  As Hollywood has slowly embraced a genre specifically steered towards the Comic-Con crowd I have looked on with great interest.  Having loved the original Iron Man, I can say unequivocally that Iron Man 2 is awesome in every way.<br /><br />The sequel deals quite a bit with the palladium and arc reactor technology behind Iron Man, and how that technology adversely affects Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.).  As the U.S. government, via LTC James Rhodes (Cheadle) demands access to the design, use, and replication of Iron Man's scientific advancements - something Stark refuses - the man behind the mask must face not only his government and his mortality, but also a competing industrialist, the nefarious Justin Hammer (Rockwell), and the Russian villain Ivan "Whiplash" Vanko (Rourke), who has reverse engineered Iron Man's arc reactor technology (adding weapons along the way) to satisfy a family vendetta.  On top of all that Stark still has to be the hard-partying, scotch-pounding womanizer who must placate Pepper Potts (Paltrow) on a daily basis, ogle new assistant Natasha Romanoff (Johansson), and contemplate an affiliation with SHIELD - a top secret government organization led by front-man Nick Fury (Jackson).<br /><br />Some may say this movie fails because it lacks action.  And by "lacks action" most people mean "isn't Transformers 2."  In my opinion, the more detailed storyline uncovering Stark's personal, psychological, and physical dilemmas is the essence of the flawed superhero, and avoiding the zeitgeist makes is superior to the bam, pow FX-heavy of Transformers 2, et al.  But when Iron Man 2 DID ratchet up the action - initially with a battle between Iron Man and Rhodes, but later in an epic Iron Man robot battle royal - it was edge the seat, floor rumbling, front row of the rollercoaster exciting.<br /><br />It should go without saying, but the incredible cast performs just as one would expect.  Downey, Jr. is the boisterous, swaggering Tony Stark personified, and Paltrow, whose smug attitude I typically loathe, is nearly perfect as Potts.  Rockwell and Jackson turn in inspired, albeit secondary efforts.  Johannson is minimally used, but serves her Matrix-esque purpose in a skin-tight outfit and awesome fight scene.  The scene stealer, however, is clearly Mickey Rourke.  The demented, evil look, the spot-on accent, the eccentricity is electric (pun intended).<br /><br />Great movie, succeeds where others have failed, builds upon the story perfectly, provides something for all audiences, and for me, it put the GI Joe into a Transformer costume.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Let's get this straight: If it hadn't been for THE DARK KNIGHT coming out a couple months later, IRON MAN would have been THE superhero movie of 2008.  It's still one of the best entries in the genre, with a complex plot, superior special effects, and the quick wit and sharp poignancy of Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />The sequel, while featuring all three, is a letdown; while I knew to lower my expectations, they still weren't met.  The problems here are two-fold: miscasting, and a script that doesn't dare to be dark enough.  For the miscasting: obviously, Downey is still in fine form, though he doesn't get to ad-lib as much here.  Mickey Rourke doesn't have a whole lot to do; he and Downey share one (and only one) non-combat scene together, which is indeed a highlight of the film, even with minimal dialogue--proof that, when you put two great actors together alone in a room, you'll get great things.  Don Cheadle simply does not have Terrence Howard's charisma; he's a fine actor, but the role of Rhodey calls for more than mere talent.  Scarlett Johansson is utterly wasted; she's an amazing actress, but she's here for eye candy and nothing but.  Gwyneth Paltrow is as charming here as she was in the first film; and Sam Rockwell, in an utterly two-dimensional villainous role, does the best with what he's got.  Sam Jackson does his Sam Jackson thing as Nick Fury; take it or leave it, unfortunately his character isn't that essential to the film.<br /><br />Now for the script, from otherwise-talented scribe (and actor) Justin Theroux.  It's not deep; it's not dark.  And yet it tries to be both.  Is Rourke's Ivan Vanko justified in his anger towards Tony Stark?  Was Stark's father maybe not the paragon of virtue that Tony always thought?  How is Stark coping with the fact that he's dying (not a spoiler, by the way; you find out early enough)?  These are deep, penetrating issues, which promised to elevate IRON MAN 2 to an almost DARK KNIGHT level.  Instead, when a problem arises, we have an answer within a few minutes, miraculously provided by a minor character.  The movie doesn't deal with issues--it avoids them like the plague.  The first IRON MAN had a dark underbelly; it was never overly prominent, but it was there, lending the film an edge usually missing from the genre.  IRON MAN 2 is more family-friendly; it's meant to be a pleasing popcorn flick and nothing more.  It should have been more, which is why the film comes off as so disappointing.  For a film with such talent behind it--director, writer, cast--IRON MAN 2 fizzles halfway through, never reaching its potential, never being what we all wanted it to be.  It's less than the sum of its parts; it's still entertaining (hence the 3 Stars), and it's worth a repeated viewing or two, but in a post-IRON MAN/DARK KNIGHT world, we need more from our superhero movies than guys in costumes finding other guys in costumes.  We need depth, and you won't find much here.  The most poignant thing here is Vanko's love for his bird; for avian enthusiasts, maybe that's enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), AKA Iron Man, is targeted by Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist with a hunger for vengeance and a talent for designing powerful energy whips, and Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a venal munitions manufacturer who covets Stark's fame and success.<br /><br />It has become almost obligatory for everyone to say that this film is not as good as the first, but I liked it more.  Director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux incorporated a large number of elements from the Marvel Universe (Iron Man, Whiplash, Nick Fury and SHIELD, the Black Widow, Justin Hammer, War Machine) but made it all pull together in a coherent narrative.  This bodes well for the upcoming Avengers film, which Favreau will help produce.  The motif of the basically good but also weak man within the invulnerable suit of armor is used to good effect, but even the more weighty aspects of the film are handled with a light touch that keeps it hugely entertaining.  Also, character is not sacrificed for the sake of spectacle.  There may not be as much action as some might wish, but when it comes it really lets loose and the context gives it real stakes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>Had the good fortune to see this while in Asia. Ha ha!<br /><br />I was worried because the first review I read panned it for many issues, foremost of which was having too many disparate plot threads and a low-stakes tussle (over who wins an arms deal). I'm happy to say this is not the case at all.<br /><br />IM2 picks up where 1 left off. Tony Stark is a one-man peacekeeping (and peacemaking) machine, but he's gradually being poisoned by the palladium in his power source. This is turning him to drink and general recklessness, which puts his friends and others at risk, in a few exciting set pieces throughout, one of which is an amazing attack during an F1 race.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mickey Rourke plays Vanko, the son of his father's ex-partner who is hatching plans for what he considers revenge, having access to similar technical knowledge. I will not divulge further details, so you can guess at what is true and what is not.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is a rival arms manufacturer, Hammer, who tries to use Vanko to further his arms race against Stark. As usual, the exchanges between him and Vanko are the most boring and predictable of the movie, because we all know what bad guys are going to say, well ahead of time, because, well, they're bad. (As one writer has put it, it is the saints (in this case, Tony and friends) who are the real characters; they're more believable and unpredictable because of their internal struggles.) But they do their best with the material they're given. He does his dancing cameo here, never fear.<br /><br />So, as the negative review I first read says, the stakes seem to be really low - it's about who wins the arms deal. But it really isn't, and I think you'll see that. The deal is only the surface of a greater threat.<br /><br />Another thread is Tony's interest in Johannson's character versus Paltrow's. But this is also part of the overall scheme of things, not a throwaway. I didn't see at first how Tony could get sidetracked from Pepper, but I guess it's part of his deterioration, and of course makes for some romantic tension. As seen in the previews, Johannson will get into some matrix-like action, interspersed with some other (fighting) action involving Tony's driver to humorous effect.<br /><br />Yet another thread is resolving Tony's relationship with his father. Was his father, whom he felt always held him at arm's length, a cheat, or something worse? Did his father hold the key to Tony's salvation? A little far-fetched, but this is a comic, right?<br /><br />Don Cheadle is the foil to Tony's self-destructive downslide, and their friendship is strained by competing interests besides, one of whom is Gary Shandling's oily, bloated politician who is insisting that Stark turns over the suit to the US - actually an interesting point, since the question is, do we want to put all our eggs in Tony's basket? Shandling is cast as the "bad" guy of sorts, but it's a grey area and he gets a surprising dig in the end.<br /><br />The effects are well done. There is mundo action and destruction, also touched with humor in the midst of terrifying threats. I felt some aspects of the pre-final battle were a little too easy, but it makes sense in terms of the major players (Hammer vs. Stark) and their companies as "characters", which is built up throughout the movie.<br /><br />We have hints of the Avenger initiative, but not much - stay for the after-credits teaser, thin though it is.<br /><br />Everything comes together and every part makes for a great time at the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>IRON MAN 2 is mostly a formality for me to review, as I was rather taken with the original film and I try to cover sequels when possible. Sadly, this film is a disappointing Ny-quel, and barely ranks up there with the TRANSFORMERS. In this oddly paced and virtually uninteresting oeuvre, Tony Stark is hogging the screen in an annoying way, but even worse is the I'm-totally-stupid-live-on-CNN kind of air.<br /><br />That tends to stink up a film really quickly for me, anyway. I presume there was supposed to be a storyline about Stark "privatizing world peace" and the decay in his body from the heart-plug. Jeez, call me a purist, but I can't see this happening to good old Iron Man at this insane level. And having a character 'rate' Tony Stark as a narcissist doesn't help. Downey is barely earning his paycheck here, simply by showing up--not a good sign.<br /><br />I hope he doesn't do that in SHERLOCK HOLMES 2....<br /><br />This film had ZERO humor in it--did anyone else notice that? The first film was 100 times better.  Scarlett Johansson was literally a YAWN, which, to me, she usually is. Her squeaky little girlie appeals have no effect on me whatsoever, though I thought the action scenes were well executed. (I'm sure that isn't her in those scenes.) Samuel L. Jackson and the usually impressive Mickey Rourke were sad afterthoughts the way they were presented here, and...Sam Rockwell??...what the hell??<br /><br />Don Cheadle always cheers me up, and here he is a class act as well. So, uh, someone tell me again why does he act like a complete blow-hole to his friend Tony Stark?--anyway, good to see him and Mickey Rourke (who does a brilliant Russian, by the way).<br /><br />Most interesting to me, ignored for the most part of course, was the appearance and significance of Tony Stark's father, Howard (a guy I always liked, John Slattery). He's half Howard Hughes, half Walt Disney (amazing how these three resemble one another). So of course he gets a few seconds onscreen and...what was I even saying?<br /><br />And that is how you'll feel after you've seen this: like you're either getting Alzheimer's, or else you just don't get it.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Sequels are notoriously difficult to pull off. While the first Iron Man was great, this one just comes off as well, a sequel. The plot is basically an excuse to give Iron Man another villain. Unfortunately, this is where things fall apart. Rather than have an interesting plot the builds over time, the film just pits Iron Man against a Russian super genius Vanko who wants revenge against the stark family. I suspect that part of the problem is that Iron Man was simply too powerful in the first movie, so the producers never found a suitable challenge for the hero. Indeed, as far as the plot goes, you could substitute almost any comic book hero and not tell the difference.<br /><br />However, unlike most comic book movies nowadays, Robert Downey Jr.'s (Stark/Iron Man) performance makes up for some of the weaknesses in the plot. His carefree attitude and sassiness are a joy to watch. He personifies the secret desire many of us have to just give the world the finger (in fact, he nearly does do that during testimony before the Senate). The film has some strong moments when Stark realizes he might die soon and struggles with how to live the rest of his life. But these parts are too few and too far in between to save the plot. Overall, I'd give the film 3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AH1OH4PWR7NV6.html">AH1OH4PWR7NV6</a><br/><p>It seemed like there was too much going on.  I had to rewind a couple of times to figure out how the characters tie into each other.  I have always been a fan of Robert Downey Jr, but never too pleased knowing about his substance abuse which seems to play into this movie.  Overall, the movie was not done very well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>Robert Downey Jr. returns as the superhero with a new foe, the son of his Father's former partner. This leads to the usual exciting finale of the battle between the hero and the villain. The film lacks the sense of discovery that the first Iron Man had, with Tony Stark's Iron Man now a well-known public figure. The introduction of Scarlett Johansson as a karate expert is a welcome addition to the franchise, as her character kicks some serious booty. Overall, disappointing. The first was much better. Seeing Iron Man put the suit together and emerge as a superhero was what made the original exciting. This one is just a below average action film.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>The sequel was just like Transformers.<br />Make the first one serious, then have fun.<br /><br />Instead of private greed, there was public greed.<br /><br />The only misplaced element was Nick Fury.<br />Lame ...<br /><br />Like Iron Man would take this j***a*s seriously, just blow him away<br /><br />Hopefully 3 will have more action<br />;)</p></br><a href="../users/A23XVF23C7BHP0.html">A23XVF23C7BHP0</a><br/><p>Having really enjoyed the first Iron Man film, I was really looking forward to seeing this follow-up. Knowing that Chaplin's Robert Downey Junior was once again assigned to the lead role, I was reassured that this would not be another of those sequels that merely trades off the success of its predecessor (see Police Academy). The film didn't disappoint. It was more of the same, both in quality and tone, which is what I wanted, and I suppose most other Iron Man fans wanted.<br /><br />The story follows up from the original film, but is heavily influenced by Robocop and its sequels, with humour undercutting the drama in many places. It isn't so comedic that the serious part is undermined, but there are quite a few broad comedy moments. The character of Tony Stark disturbs a little in places, his self-destructive nature in terms of his business, his environment, and his health are all darker features of the character that elsewhere exhibits great optimism and positivity. Downey Junior brings this complex character to life - so that when he is out partying, you can see in his eyes the darker undertones of his personality. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, although a reset switch appears to have been hit, and the closeness they achieved towards the end of the first film is forgotten about and she is just his assistant, rather than nearly his wife. The relationship follows pretty much the same path this film, although she has a rival in the form of a sexy spy Scarlett Johansson, and an all star cast is completed with appearances from a very dirty looking Mickey Rourke as a Russian physicist with a grudge against Tony and Samuel Jackson as a spy pretty similar to the role he played in the Matrix.<br /><br />Don Cheadle is great as his friend, Rhodey, but he's a recast from Terrence Howard in the first film. Don makes a very good job of this and by the end, you forget that he's not the same actor, and Marvel Comics boss Stan Lee's cameo as Larry King has to be seen to be believed! Gary Shandling puts in a semi-comic performance as a senator, who is there to needle Stark, and threaten to take away his Iron Man suit. Shandling is just right for the role, looking now rather like a grinning Jimmy Carter/Kennedy type politician.<br /><br />Overall, the look of this on blu-ray is excellent, and you can see how well the sets and effects have been made, although it's a shame that the extras are very pedestrian, and it feels like little effort has been made with these. Clearly they are holding something back for the two disc edition, but this feels a bit mean, and makes disc collectors like me want to wait for "ultimate edition"s before buying. This doesn't detract from the film though, which is heartily recommended to anyone who liked the original film.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I will admit that I was a tad worried about Iron Man 2, because, well let's face it, the first movie was so fantastic that it was almost untouchable. I mean, with the first movie, you had the extraordinary talents of Downey, Howard, Paltrow, Bridges and plenty more anchoring what was an incredible must-see summer slam of a movie. However, seeing the trailers for the second movie made me think "Uh oh, Spider Man 3 all over again." Sequels, especially superhero ones, seem to think that since they bring tons of random crap and characters into the frame, that they are always better, and as excited as I was for this movie, I felt it was going to be another one of those movies. So upon going into the theater, I kept those worries in mind.<br /><br />Well, I can now officially say that those worries didn't prevent me from loving the movie.<br /><br />Remember when Michael Bay tried to accomplish something epic with Transformers 2 with all these new characters and stuff? Well, Jon Faverau has managed to accomplish what Michael Bay never did- make a near-perfect sequel that manages to be just as great as the first. Now like the first, there's not a ton of action, but those scenes where action is absent, Faverau manages to make the most out of them. Complete with great action, laughs and characters, Iron Man 2 is the first big summer movie, and a must see on the big screen for sure, especially if you see it in digital!<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br />Iron Man 2 picks up half a year from when the first movie left off. The Stark Expo has just begun in Flushing, New York, and is to last all year. Tony, in a televised hearing, privatizes world peace. Life seems to be great, except for the fact that the reactor keeping him alive is killing him. This doesn't stop him from being Iron Man though- he continues to go on as Iron Man for the moment. He even considers replacing Pepper Potts with Natalie Rushman, appointing Potts a CEO to Stark Industries. However, in Russia, Ivan Vanko, the son of physicist Anton Vanko, having just lost his father and jealous of Stark's success, creates his own arc reactor, and becomes Whiplash, a badass villain with two electrified whips that can split anything in half with enough force.<br /><br />His first appearance is at a race in Monaco, and after a brief (and failed) attempt to kill Tony, he meets up with Justin Hammer, Stark's rival, and they both collaborate to build a new technology that will hopefully overthrow Tony. However, with a stint at Tony's house appointing James Rhodes as War Machine, and several other plots, Tony Stark, suffering through personal problems, doesn't know if he really can be Iron Man and resolve all this.<br /><br />Now the plot may not sound that great, but when you see it in the movie, you will be impressed with how complex it is. To not spoil too much, I left some stuff out, because the movie is that great. Aside from the plot, everything else is great. The acting here is fantastic! Robert Downey Jr. has his usual charm here, playing the lovable jerk that is Tony Stark. Replacing Terrence Howard is Don Cheadle, and he does it well! I can't believe I am saying this but I actually preferred him to Howard. Howard was great but wooden in places, whereas Cheadle was great the whole way. And Scarlett Johannson... whoa. When is she NEVER eye candy? As for her performance- this movie proves she is not just another pretty face. Her fight scene is just... mind blowingly amazing! Mickey Rourke gives a a fantastic performance as well, and manages to shine as the villain,<br /><br />Of course, halfway through, the movie takes a break from the action and focuses on some character development- I was worried about it at first hearing but as I was watching the movie, I realized that sometimes, in superhero movies, character development does more than whiz-bang action. Don't worry guys, the scenes where action is absent are just as great as the scenes with action. But the action scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!! People are exaggerating the lack of action- the last 20 minutes alone has more action than the first, and is certainly more thrilling than the first too. The climax certainly is a thrill, and I gotta say I had a blast seeing it on the big screen.<br /><br />So in short, Iron Man 2 is a success. I had tons of fun seeing it on the big screen. A great sequel and a great standalone movie, Iron Man 2 is a sequel that truly kicks ass. Whatever worries you may have, I recommend you cast them aside, because you're in for a 2 hour fun ride. So if you wanna see a sequel that truly kicks ass, this movie is it!</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Iron Man is back in this smash sequel to the first movie.

That made it more like a drama. Yet, it's a half-baked drama because  it's not given enough time to move me. Just when the drama was building up, it moved to the action scenes. However, these were too brief to provide excitement. For example, the fighting at the race track looked good but it ended too quickly. The last action scenes with hundreds of Ironman clones looked like cartoon.<br /><br />There were less funny dialogues than the first film.<br />Overall, this picture is over-hyped.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>The inevitable sequel to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">2008 smash hit</a> proves once again the perfect fit between actor and character as Robert Downey Jr. plays the title role with his rakish wit and deep sense of irony fully intact from the first film. Sharply directed once again by actor Jon Favreau and shrewdly written by another actor, Justin Theroux, the 2010 blockbuster is as much an actors' showcase as it is a special effects-saturated comic book adventure. This precarious balance is what made the first film so ideal, and while the surprise element has been replaced in part by a breezy familiarity in the sequel, the result is still far more entertaining than most in its genre. This is despite the fact that the movie is overpopulated with colorful characters, most worthy of a film of their own.<br /><br />Overkill is a common problem in heavily invested Hollywood studio product like this, and one can quibble that nobody except Downey gets sufficient screen time to make a compelling impression. As hedonistic billionaire Tony Stark, the actor has to face off with no less than three villains, two other figures who are intentionally put on a nebulous fence between good and evil, the mysterious director of a clandestine organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and a love interest designed to be either a sharp, take-charge businesswoman or a helpless damsel in distress depending on the plot machinations. The story picks up Stark six months after the ending of the first film as he boasts to a rapt audience at the re-instituted Stark Expo how he has maintained world peace with his impenetrable suit of armor. However, underneath his hubris, Stark hides the fact that he is dying from poisoning by the palladium core in the arc reactor that gives him not only his unique powers but his re-born life.<br /><br />Meanwhile, taciturn, cockatoo-loving Russian physicist Ivan Vanko is plotting revenge against Stark for the act of betrayal he feels Stark's father committed against his dying arms-dealer father. In fact, Vanko has designed his own arc reactor with the intent of destroying Stark, an act almost realized at the Circuit de Monaco. Stark's smarmy business rival, fellow weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer, will stop at nothing to secure the secret to Stark's armored suit, while U.S. Senator Stern of Pennsylvania wants Stark prosecuted for crimes against the state. On the fence about Stark is a carryover from the first storyline, Lt. Colonel James "Rhodey" Rhodes, whose friendship with the billionaire is severely tested by Stark's excessively destructive behavior. A new character, Natalie Rushman, is introduced in an ambivalent manner as a new assistant to replace Pepper Potts, Stark's feisty gal Friday-turned-CEO. Natalie's motivations are revealed in due time. It all comes to a head at the expo where Vanko and Hammer have colluded to produce an aerial battle royale.<br /><br />That's a whole lot of plot to fit into a 124-minute movie, but at least the momentum never flags. The problem for comic fanboys may well be the dearth of action sequences. The showdowns between Stark and Vanko create the necessary tension although the build-ups are rather predictable, and the climactic battle sequence feels more like a swirling meteor shower since it takes place at night. Still, cinematographer Matthew Libatique and art director J. Michael Riva do first-rate work here with the production details. Moreover, the actors do their best even if their characters are given short shrift in the screenplay. Mickey Rourke relies on his own uncomfortably maniacal screen persona and idiosyncratic touches to embody Vanko's two-dimensional motives, while Sam Rockwell is even more cartoonish with a petulant, hammy albeit amusing turn as Hammer.<br /><br />Replacing Terrence Howard, Don Cheadle does what he can as the put-upon best friend and archetypal soldier, but Rhodey has to represent the film's most thankless role. A surprisingly cast Garry Shandling brings a nice edge to the avuncular senator, and Favreau himself repeats his role as Stark's loyal chauffeur Happy Hogan. No fool as a director, he gets to face off to primarily comic effect with Scarlett Johansson, properly feline and physically adroit in her black catsuit, as Natalie. Her ball-breaking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056PMV">Charlie's Angels</a>-style fight sequence is entertaining if a bit derivative. As Pepper, Gwyneth Paltrow gets more to do this time around, bantering with Downey with Nick-and-Nora-level &eacute;lan, but the character is near-impossible to believe. Fans, however, will have no problem loving and believing in the sequel, but the pervasive one-liners and the wild zigzags between hubris and insecurity make a strong case to redub the hero Irony Man.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 5:05 Mins<br /><br /></span>Gina from Haunted Flower reviews "Iron Man 2" directed by Jon Favreau and starring Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, and Scarlett Johansson.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The first Iron Man was and still is a very strong comic book film. It would have been the best of 2008 by far if not for a little movie called The Dark Knight. Now, a couple of years later we have the two leads back with a number of new big name additions, and some impressive CGI as expected.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. continues to shine as Tony Stark, with an ego the size of the planet, and Gwyneth Paltrow still has great chemistry with him. Add to the mix a neat villain, Whiplash, played by the always excellent Mickey Rourke, the lovely Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Don Cheadle as Rhodey/War Machine, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. You won't find a film in this genre with a cast list this strong. Even though it felt like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson were stuck in here just for a reference towards The Avengers movie of the future, it worked for me, especially Scarlett's fight scene towards the end. Don Cheadle was a great choice for replacing Terrence Howard. I'm still not sure why they got rid of him, but I didn't miss his feminine voice one bit. For me, as great as Robert Downey is in this role, both villains stole the show. The brilliant choice to underplay the part worked wonders for Mickey Rourke. His muscular body, covered head to toe in tattoos, along with his multi-colored hair, gold teeth, Russian accent, toothpick, and complete with a parrot on his shoulder, made him one of the most interesting characters for appearances alone. He could have gone way overboard with this character, but he keeps his cool and is even more believable for it. Sam Rockwell has always been an actor that may not have name recognition to everyone, but from the time I first saw him in The Green Mile until last years Moon, he turns in one solid performance after the next. He is like a darker version of Tony Stark, complete with a large personality and more than his share of funny lines.<br /><br />I have only a few gripes. I didn't care for the pacing. It seemed much longer than two hours and I typically have no problem watching long movies. Compared to the first Iron Man, some scenes were closing in on boring, but thankfully what works here, works really well. The dialogue was pretty strong and often very funny, but the script as a whole could have been thought out a little better. There is almost too much going on and too many people to fit into one story. Like the previous film, there is also a lack of action. The story always comes first, but this sequel could have let loose a whole lot more. When it does, you get some real good stuff, like the scene with Whiplash slicing up the race cars.<br /><br />As far as sequels go, Iron Man 2 is better than most, but it's not everything it could have been, or what most people were hoping for. Still, it's a fun ride from start to finish and a great way to start off the summer movie season.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>Almost always sequels, especially action-packed sequels, suffer by comparison with the first production. That is the case here with Iron Man 2. What made the original Iron Man interesting, beyond the finely-tuned performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the "frat brat", poor little rich boy, Tony Stark, out to find his place in the world, and incidentally act as the sole defensive shield necessary to save the old U.S.A., was the creation of Iron Man and that first struggle against the world's evil metal. IM2 already figured to extend that monster metal notion, although harking back to the old Cold War days with a Russian antagonist (Mickey Rourke, as Ivan Vanko) out to revenge old hurts was a curious twist. Iron Man, naturally, despite a few aging "heart" problems single-handedly (oops, double-handedly, he has a partner here). The plot left me with this feeling-Ya okay, what of it.<br /><br />As for the boy meets girl aspect (Downey and his administrative assistant, Paltrow), or I should say "boy met girl" since they already got kind of moony-eyed in the first picture, an aspect that is always sexually and romantically understated in these comic book-drawn movies (Spider Man, Super Man, etc.) they continue that chaste romance here. What I don't get is why a sensible woman like Downey's "Girl Friday" would have anything to do with a, well yes, a good-looking guy with a zillion dollars, with some "boss" fast cars, and with access to all kinds of techno-gadgets. A no-brainer, right?  At least, serious, chaste, "kick butt" governmental agent Scarlett Johansson didn't fall for all that superficial stuff. And she trashed his performance (not a team player) as well. Smart woman.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>So it is official Tony Stark is Iron Man and he has been given quite a task. What kind of a hero is he going to be and will he destroy himself in the process.<br /><br />This movie of course is only a small portion of what is on the way and now it is no longer a secret. In this movie Iron Man is being taken on by villains and heroes alike. There is a new villain out there who apparently had some connections with Tony's dad wants revenge. Because of his extra fame as an industrialist and a super-hero Nick Fury is trying to make sure that he doesn't get out of control even if it means taking him off the roster of the Avengers.<br /><br />I really can't figure out how to put this review together because that is pretty much what the movie was like. It was a great deal of fun, but it was very much reminiscent of a Jackson Pollock. Just throw your characters to the canvas and hopefully a story will pop out of it. Well thankfully the humor and the great action sequences were able to keep the crowd interested and the movie did make quite a large amount in the box office. Still, in my opinion Marvel has to keep their heads on strait and stick to the plan ahead. There is a monster movie franchise brewing here and if they keep putting together movies like Iron Man 2 people will get very skeptical about the future projects.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>In this sequel , Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is up against an ingenious Russian (Mickey Rourke) that wants revenge on the Stark family for having his father deported from America. While a rich weapons manufacturer (Sam Rockwell) wants to use Rourke to build him Iron Man suits since Stark won't give his up to the government. While Stark has to find a new energy source that can keep him alive and isn't too confident that he can. But Stark's military friend (Don Cheadle) is more than ready to step in his shoes with the War Machine outfit.<br /><br />  The movie is as slow as the first to pick up and give us some action. The first is a little better though since it doesn't take as long to give us some action. Plus some viewers might find the end fight to be too short and not even as good as the end fight of the first film. Still, I wouldn't call Iron Man 2 a disappointment, the movie is far better than a lot of the summer movies that came out last summer, like Transformers 2. Transformers 2 had a lot more action, but it was too loud and un-involving.<br /><br />  When I watching the first Iron Man yesterday, I realized that Stark should have at least looked more in pain and weak after the operation that removed half his chest. I mean his body took too it too well I thought. So what I really liked about Iron Man 2 is that his body is starting to have a negative reaction to what saved his life in the first film. It was also nice to see more comic book characters in this sequel like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Whiplash (Mickey Rourke).</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>HEY! YOU DON'T SAY A REVIEW ISN'T HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE OPINION EXPRESSED! GET A LIFE!<br /><br />Though biased, since I didn't exactly love the first Iron Man, I can safely assume I am not alone when I say this was a complete disappointment. Like many others, the superhero genre is one I watch in earnest, never criticizing it for comedic relief, stellar effects, and villains that make Lugosi look like an infant. Still, we have all been let down by the recent slew of crap that has been parading in theaters for the past several summers, and this release proves studios are just done trying to keep us from getting pissed off. Strong words, but the fact that there is an actual scene where Stark pretends to crap himself in the suit (oh yes, this happens) makes for a perfect example of laziness. The final battle is definitely better than the anticlimactic one from the previous film, but it's the only interesting thing about the movie. Less action this time, and more emphasis on Stark's struggles, not all that interesting considering the plot holed story (Nick Fury isn't indicated in SHIELD until he's on screen for at least ten minutes, leaving people in the dark to who the hell he is.) and bogus comedy, which is as immature as the racist robots from Transformers 2; a decent comparison, to be quite frank. Stay far away from this Marvel fiasco<br /><br />let's take everything that was good about the first one and do it bigger!! forget character development! the best part of this movie was when Tony finds the message from his father that says "You were my greatest creation." That right there was the only redeeming quality of the screenplay i could find. i felt like they were trying to do too many things with this film, just like spider man 3. after this, i don't want to hear anymore complaining about spiderman 3 because this movie has the same exact problems and no one puts this film on blast like they do spider man 3!! another problem i had is that all the battle scenes are in the lamest locations! Tony's luxury apartment that looks like a night club? i don't want to see iron man face off with war machine in a night club looking luxury apartment. that is lame. out of all the locations on this planet they pick a luxury apartment. also not enough mickey rourke!! i hated the whole Hammer scheme thing, i felt like i was watching a movie from Fox news!! yuck! also why is black widow in this? she serves no purpose other than to have fans say "hey that's black widow!" her role was empty and hollow. also what's with the director giving himself his own action scene?! stay behind the camera fatty!! i didn't pay to see a white man in a tux fight, i paid to see iron man!!!! also the way Tony addresses the court or investigators was sooooo far fetched it was like "c'mon nobody can talk like that to an official." also how convenient was it for tony to wirelessly send satellite projections across the screen during that investigation. it was like c'mon!!! at least try to be creative in presenting your information. i hate it when characters magically do computer hacks when in reality it's far more complicated than that!! also the way Don took Tony's suit was soooo lame, almost like how your kid brother goes into your closet when your not looking to take your clothes. so Tony has all this high tech stuff but can't put a lock on his war machine suit?! this is Don, "Tony give up the suit." this is Tony, "No." don then goes into Tony's closet and steals it like it was a polo shirt. THAT DEFINITLY WAS NOT HOW MY DREAM BATTLE BETWEEN TONY AND WAR MACHINE WAS SUPPOSE TO BE!!!!!there was something also about how Tony was carrying himself in this film, as if his road to redemption in the first film never happened;he just went right back to being a narcissitic capitalistic pig. point blank, this movie sucked and i only gave it 2 stars for the cinematography. poor writing, poor set locations, poor directing, and the worst final showdown of all time!! bad guy is beaten with a tag teaming fart, plew! mickeys dead...</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>Plenty of action. Plenty of drama, partying, flirting. But it lacked the heart of the first film (pardon the pun) and felt more choppy and predictable. There was one very satisfying relational moment, but other than that, I felt pretty indifferent and glad I didn't hand over the moulah to see it in the theater. I'd suggest trying before buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>Iron Man 2... Hmm, well, I guess I'll just start by saying I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one. For one, the villain didn't feel fleshed out enough, felt kinda flat honestly. I also don't like how they changed actors for the role of Rhodey (think I spelled it right?), I hate when they change up actors like that. I didn't care for the story as much as the first one. I do like how they gave Black Widow a role, though, she was pretty great. I also like how it kinda shows a Thor-like cameo-thing at the end. It's a decent movie with some strong points, but not as good as the first one. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>Boring! Action films should never be tedious, this one is a yawn. Two stars for ACDC soundtrack and Downey Jnr being Downey Jnr.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />Word has it that Robert Downey Jr. requested the screenwriting services of Justin Theroux, who was one of the writers of Tropic Thunder.  Tropic Thunder was hilarious.  Iron Man 2, overall, was not.  It seemed like a poor attempt for Robert Downey Jr. and Justin Theroux to make Iron Man more comedic.  Jon Favreau should have known better.  While Iron Man has some funny moments here and there, the character is not supposed to be funny overall.  We had some light moments in the original film that worked really well.  But in the end, Stark was true to his goal and he took it seriously.  In this film, Stark seems to take nothing serious at all.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 tries to be a lighter movie than the previous one, while taking on a "darker" spin on the character of Tony Stark and his new nemesis, Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash.  Iron Man 2 fails on both fronts.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 isn't nearly has fun and innovative as the first film; a movie that had plenty of action and charm, with enough characterization for Tony Stark, Pepper Potts, and Obadiah Stane.  In this film, Iron Man casually makes only a couple of appearances, and it isn't enough to keep the audience involved.  Tony Stark dominates the film.  We see very little of Pepper Potts at all, and what could have been a great character in Ivan Vanko, is all but placed secondary to the very goofy Justin Hammer, poorly played by Sam Rockwell.<br /><br />Tony Stark's battle with alcoholism is addressed here.  In the comic books, it is tragic, and we see the fall of a great character and his battle to overcome it.  In this film, they chose to make Stark look like a buffoon.  He spends his time drunk, dancing around ridiculously in his Iron Man suit, and even making a silly bathroom stunt by "showing" his fellow party friends how Iron Man goes to the bathroom in his suit of armor.  It doesn't work.  The laughs that the filmmakers were hoping for were sporadic at best when I was at the premiere showing.<br /><br />Ivan Vanko is actually a combination of two villains...Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo.  They actually set up a good premise with this character; a Russian man who is the son of an inventor who worked with Tony's father.  When tragedy struck Ivan's father, he obviously holds Tony Stark responsible and vows revenge.  Taking on the mantle of "Whiplash," and utilizing the same technology that powers Stark's Iron Man suit, Vanko creates two energy whips that can cut through metal like butter.  It's too bad that we're only given one short battle between Iron Man and Whiplash before, in a very predictable fashion, Vanko ends up fighting Iron Man in, guess what?  Another suit of armor!<br /><br />In the comics, Justin Hammer is a cold, ruthless man who views Stark as an obstacle that must be removed, since he runs a rival company.  Instead, we're treated to Sam Rockwell who makes Hammer look clueless in anything he does.  It's truly sad that one of Iron Man's premiere villains was reduced to this.  Normally, I don't like to bring up comic book comparisons, but in this case, they completely missed the boat with this character.  Rockwell plays Hammer like he, himself, has no idea what the character is like or what he is supposed to be about.<br /><br />Don Cheadle takes over as Rhodey and he does a good job with the character.  We are treated to the addition of "War Machine," the armored superhero that Rhodey becomes.  Gwyneth Paltrow's character didn't have enough screen time, and her interactions as Pepper Potts with Tony Stark are too few and far between.  This is a shame because these two characters worked very well in the previous film.  The light banter between Potts and Stark in the previous installment is nearly gone in this film.<br /><br />Another great character that we see way too little of is Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow.  People seemed to wake up in their seats when she finally takes to the screen in her tight, black outfit and making short work of a score of guards when she breaks into Hammer's facility.  Too little screen time hurt the characterization of what should have been an interesting character.  Many superhero films make the big mistake of having too many characters.  This film finds itself among those.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 has a few redeeming things that keep it from becoming a total failure.  The actions scenes are, for the most part, well done.  Unfortunately, we see too few of them.  The attention to detail as Iron Man soars through the skies in the original film have disappeared in this film.  It's too bad.  So many people were in awe when Iron Man first takes to the skies in the first film.  The special effects are still top rate.  It's too bad there wasn't a good enough story to go with it.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 has its moments here and there.  It's worth one viewing, but frankly, I'm casting this one aside with Spider-Man 3, Superman Returns, Ghost Rider, and some of the other "failed" superhero films.  I don't know if any recent comic book film held such anticipation for its fans, and ended up being such a bitter disappointment.<br /><br />With Favreau, Downey Jr., and the rest of this talented bunch, they should have been able to deliver.  They didn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Worthwhile flick, another film based on a comic book character and worthwhile.

Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />Fantastic stuff. What it lacks in acting and personality comes back and more in soundtrack. visuals, pure awesome stunning action, and scriptwriting. Not only is this one of the biggest parties of recent years, (which is why it should have been a June/July release,) but it also deals with the mind of Tony Stark in a way nobody realizes because they are used to it. Something that we've all been through, giving up. Some of us actually do end at a drunk party with us as the host, but I believe we can be like Tony Stark and become successful.<br /><br />BARACK OBAMA! WHY ARE YOU WRITING MY REVIEW? I, I just though YOU DID NOT THINK I, I please sir GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, AND INFACT, GET OUT OF THE WHITEHOUSE! *Barack Obama walks out*. JOHN MCCAIN?!?? Okay, enough of that, but seriously folks, this definably is smarter than people think. Go and watch Mr.Blacks reviews of the two, then reverse em' and you got me. In my mind, the second was better than the first. Why? Everything is improved. While some bad things are added, actually a lot, it all blends in too the superhero type of movie.<br /><br />Lemme just say this is hyper-action. Super Hyper-Action at points. There may not be enough, but lemme put it this way. 100 pounds of crap vs. 1 pound of gold. Which would you take? You can't just go get 99 pounds more just because it's more even when you get crap. You want gold. Now, it's not quite that ratio, there are plenty of action scenes, but not nearly enough to make the hardest of critics realize. I used to think my eyes were hurting from watching too many movies I though I wasted on. Man, what do people like Zaranyzerak and Mr. Black think?<br /><br />I mean, I should have just said hyper-action and you should have spent the 20 bucks this is worth! Heck, make it 22 for a large bucket of popcorn. You also get some candy with that 22 and maybe a soda. But lemme say the visuals are also spectacular. You can't beat laser beams going everywhere while robots are going everywhere BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE! The soundtrack. The soundtrack, the soundtrack, the soundtrack. AC/DC. What else do I need to say? Well, I do. Only two times is AC/DC used, at the beginning and at the credits.  Not the very beginning though.<br /><br />The only thing I would have liked changed was Mickey Rourke's character and Hammer. Those two, ugh. I wish they knew how to communicate. Things would have worked much better, but, it does add to an element of utter compositions that lead to the apocalypse of dry air into humanity releasing gasses that shall poison all discriminating laundry detergents! But, they do a good job for what they have. All the characters are annoying really, but I can get over those. But the two I talk about I cannot get over. Tony's ego is appropriate, the ladies anger is appropriate. The politicians bull$#!T is appropriate, but not not being able to understand Russian!<br /><br />But the real reason to go to this movie is for the hyper-action, if you have no patience, fall asleep for a while. You'll miss some good stuff, so I don't recommend it.  All in all, alsoulutely awesome stuff. I can't agree more with what the people over at Marvel were thinking. For my rating, I give Iron Man 2 (Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh) 5.8/5</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>After proclaiming to the world that he indeed is the Iron Man, Tony Stark must find a cure to prevent his death which could be due to the heart that he has installed in him. The second problem that he is faced with  is in the form of  certain Russian science wacko, Ivan Vanko ( Mickey Rourke ) colluding with a ratty Sam Rockwell, then there are the usual chemical attractions with his assistant ( Pepper Potts) Gwyneth Paltrow. Scarlett Johansson, along with Don Cheadle and Samuel Jackson trying to get him to join Avengers ( new movie) keep things afloat.<br />The first hour was great and the action fast paced to keep things interesting, some have claimed that they found the first half was boring. I thought it could have been more engaging than the first one especially if the goal is to make the sequel better than the original and not just make pots of money trading on the past glories.

It is not and was never intended to be great cinematic art but it is a fun movie and entertaining.<br /><br />Property Destruction = 4 stars -- The Taliban must be dying of envy<br />Special effects = 3 stars -- lack of creativity and more and more iron men doesn't make the special effects better.<br />Screen Play = 4 stars -- saved by final scene with Senator Stern which was very clever<br />Character Development  = 4 stars -- Good supporting cast<br />Acting = 4 stars -- Downey may be a waste as a person but he has immense talent and it is fully used in this movie.  Well done.  Paltrow also does a great job and given a much better chance to show her talent in this sequel. Mickey Rourke also did an excellent job especially with the accent.  In fact the entire cast did a great job.<br />Sound track = 2 stars -- the sound track at the beginning was so annoying it destracted from the movie rather than enhancing it.<br />Personal Hygiene = 1 star -- I am sort  of tired of seeing the leading men walking around looking like they haven't shaved in days or taken  a bath in weeks.<br /><br />Nevertheless this is a fun movie -- not quite as good as the original but fun nevertheless. Downey and Paltrow are a pleasure to watch and probably saved the movie because it would be hard to imagine anyone else playing these parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A82R4WKX62LEK.html">A82R4WKX62LEK</a><br/><p>One of the worst movies i ever watched.

So what was good about the movie? I did like the way 2 of the iron men suits were moving and the special effects. I have a feeling that Scarlett had a significant role in this movie. As a sexy, unbeatable agent. Lol I had seen what Hollywood did to her moves, she didn't blink even once(script don't allow that because in Hollywood we are the heroes and we set the rules. And rules are:America as a world dominator, world saviour,world's best bla bla bla they have the sexiest women on earth with no American descent in real life, plastic surgery, lots of make up, even more added sexiness with special effects to already pretty women and they should know at least 9 languages, marshall arts,be special agents and they should in the end win over the bad guys easily, whatever, you name it). And her moves so ummm ''very realistic''. I swear when I saw her moves in the air and all that, I was looking for defects in the movie like a cable or cord around her waist that allowed her to move freely. I don't do that usually. It was the first time that I recall when I was laughing over all these things. And then she just had to train all her moves and repeat them until it goes flawlessly. And remember real American hero kicks ass and does not blink and it all shall be paced within 1 minute. LOL. What next? Downey is not one of my favorite characters. In the first Iron man he was a lot better. But in Iron Man 2 he is so arrogant and boring I was hoping for a bad guys to kick his ***. His relationship with his lover is looking cheap, similar to other movies, where if it worked in one movie, the other ten movies will destroy it by copying all the things that once made it fun to watch. And which we loved. This movie has money, special effects but no story whatsoever, plot is terrible. Some actors could have been better. If there should be Iron Man 3, I wish it to be something set in the far far future where it has nothing to do with Downey and previous suits or actors. Like as if it is another suit by design with other upgrades. And please no rubbish. Special effects put here and there and everywhere will not go well with a bad story and characters which some of us can't and don't want to see anymore. And for the last. It is very typical of Hollywood to show off Russians like that. And who was that actor who played Russian? Mickey Rourke. I didn't like nothing about what they've done. It's just a Hollywood standards. Directors get paid, people eat this rubbish and so they think they are the most supreme race in the world? Oh please. When will there be done a real good movie by Hollywood that will not include all this ****? I'm sick and tired of all the same things.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>Fireworks for explosives; simplistic flashy gunfire; cartoonish quality CGI; poorly performed martial arts; juvenile dialogue; really bad science - all should tell you a lot about the quality of this disappointing sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9.html">A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9</a><br/><p>This review actually pertains to the movie HAMLET 2, which I've reviewed a number of times and for whatever reason the good people at Amazon.com continually refuse to publish.

While the first Iron Man was great, this one just comes off as well, a sequel. The plot is basically an excuse to give Iron Man another villain. Unfortunately, this is where things fall apart. Rather than have an interesting plot the builds over time, the film just pits Iron Man against a Russian super genius Vanko who wants revenge against the stark family. I suspect that part of the problem is that Iron Man was simply too powerful in the first movie, so the producers never found a suitable challenge for the hero. Indeed, as far as the plot goes, you could substitute almost any comic book hero and not tell the difference.<br /><br />However, unlike most comic book movies nowadays, Robert Downey Jr.'s (Stark/Iron Man) performance makes up for some of the weaknesses in the plot. His carefree attitude and sassiness are a joy to watch. He personifies the secret desire many of us have to just give the world the finger (in fact, he nearly does do that during testimony before the Senate). The film has some strong moments when Stark realizes he might die soon and struggles with how to live the rest of his life. But these parts are too few and too far in between to save the plot. Overall, I'd give the film 3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />As "Iron Man 2" opens, Tony Stark, the wunderkind head of Stark Industries, has just revealed to the world at large that it is indeed he lurking inside the metallic suit of the planet's latest crime-fighting superhero.  But such a public admission comes with a steep price.  For now the United States government wants him to register himself as a deadly weapon; a rival defense contractor (Sam Rockwell) is determined to beat Stark at his own game by creating his own army of iron-clad warriors; and an arch-nemesis (Mickey Rourke) from the former Soviet Union has suddenly appeared on the scene in his own superhero getup to destroy Stark in a mano-a-mano battle on the streets of Monaco.<br /><br />As a piece of pure Saturday-matinee popcorn entertainment, "Iron Man 2," directed by Jon Favreau, is, perhaps predictably, a notch or two below its dazzling 2008 predecessor.  However, the sequel still has enough quality elements - most of them holdovers from the first film - to recommend seeing it:  namely, Robert Downey Jr. as the wisecracking, hard-living but lovable boy genius, Stark; Gwyneth Paltrow as his endearing personal assistant, now CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts; and enough funny one-liners to take the edge off of some - though not all - of the script's numerous plot contrivances.  As with the previous film, Downey Jr. and Paltrow achieve a wonderful love/hate chemistry between them, and the cast has been expanded to include Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson (who had an uncredited role in the first one), and Kate Mara as well.<br /><br />The screenplay by Justin Theroux makes at least one right choice by having Stark becoming ever more gravely ill as a result of the chemical he has to keep pumping into his chest to survive in his semi-cybernetic condition.  This has the effect of humanizing the character, making him destructible and vulnerable and, thus, someone whose fate we can come to care deeply about.  And, needless to say, Downey Jr.'s smart, savvy performance is equally instrumental in helping us to connect with the character.<br /><br />The special effects and actions scenes are impressive, of course, but it is Downey Jr. and Paltrow who once again make the movie soar.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>The sequel to Iron Man promised to be an entirely different movie because it took the standard trope - playboy superhero trying to lead a double life - and turned it on its ear by having Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity to the world. Iron Man is the Batman of the Marvel universe, so you can imagine the implications of a billionaire with an arsenal of firepower at his fingertips.  The government, for one, is extremely nervous about a private enterprise waging wars in foreign countries - a topical concern in today's world of "security firms" operating in America's wars. Shareholders, for another, fret that the often intoxicated Stark is such a warped genius that he will self-destruct ala Charlie Sheen.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 is further complicated by aggrieved Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) codenamed Whiplash, who teams up with Steve Jobs-like Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a second stringer defense contractor.  To make matters worse, Stark's palladium core - the miniature reactor in his chest - is poisoning him.  The world has it out for Mr. Stark.<br /><br />There are several plot points that Iron Man 2 struggles to juggle simultaneously: the leadership of Stark Industries, the government's demands for the Iron Man plans, Stark's romance with his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his past relationship with his deceased father (a genius in the Walt Disney mold who built his own World's Fair-like Stark Expo), his looming death, his battle with alcoholism, and his rivalry with a competitor (Hammer) and the son of the original developer of a similar suit (Vanko).  And oh yeah, there's a little matter of the Avengers trying Stark out for membership.<br /><br />There's so much going on that inevitably some of these plot points suffer.  Stark's romance with Potts is more implied than acted, his alcoholism is played up for laughs, and both villains are poorly realized in comparison to the other people in Starks' orbit.  Rockwell, in particular, comes off as an incompetent boob incapable of actually leading a company much less rivaling Stark. Vanko, on the other hand, has such a dangerous presence that it's hard to believe he's both a brilliant scientist AND a bird-loving, whip-wielding thug.<br /><br />When Iron Man does bust loose though, it rocks.  War Machine is a welcome sight, and the conflict between Stark and Vanko in the middle of the Circuit de Monaco is thrilling. The fight scenes are exciting, more akin to jet fighters in flight than human-sized tanks.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 doesn't have the emotional heft of its predecessor - it's far too busy to worry about peoples' feelings - but it does pack a solid punch.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>If action is what you want Iron Man 2 has some good action sequences. This film wasn't that much different than the first film in quality or substance. It was basically everything that you would expect it to be, having seen the first film. Some of the characters' were even better in Iron Man 2, like Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson who is always interesting to watch. The film itself makes it a point to entertain and that it does more like a comic book than some of the other super hero films. Obviously not reality but somewhat based upon reality in some way. Even Gary Shandling has a small part in the film playing a senator no less.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>More is less in a disappointing follow-up to the 2008 Marvel Comics blockbuster. "Iron Man 2" lacks the qualities that made the original so engaging. The inimitable Robert Downey Jr. and a stalwart cast are wasted in this overlong, badly paced superhero saga. Jon Favreau's once-sharp direction goes on autopilot - weighed down by Justin Theroux's needlessly cluttered, drawn-out script. Plenty of CGI overkill, yet precious little excitement. The already-planned "Iron Man 3" has nowhere to go but up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>The plot in IRON MAN II was somewhat lame by comparison to IRON MAN I, and Mickey Rourke's mangled 'Russian' accent was almost laughable. The Introduction of War Machine was sweet, and the fight sequences were quite fun, especially those involving Iron Man and Rourke's  Whiplash character, even though I thought ( like several others, apparently ) that it should have been longer, and that the rather tiring mid-section of the film could have been abbreviated. Johansson's kickass Black Widow was excellent, but Pepper Potts ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) was more annoying than anything else. Also, perhaps the director could have just placed a banner announcing the upcoming AVENGERS movie in the background instead of hitting everyone over the head with not so subtle references to it every time they had some dead space to fill. Still, Robert Downey Jr. is awfully fun ( and 'funny' ) to watch- so I give it 3 1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>What makes the Iron Man movies great is that it all looks so real and Director Jon Favreau does an excellent job making it all believable too. And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an "iron" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but can fly.<br /><br />And who better to be in the role of the eccentric, wise-guy Tony Stark than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark in Iron Man 1 and he hits it on the head again in 2! The rest of the cast, including Mickey Rourke, and acting in the movie were terrific. Rourke has about 3 lines in the movie, but that's all he needed. His character was well played and effective. And kudos to Sam Rockwell for an equally effective Justin Hammer portrayal.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 picks up where 1 left off and has Rourke as Ivan Vanko out to avenge is father for a slight by Stark Industries. And Justin Hammer is just the man to help Ivan exact his revenge. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing once again has the viewer clamoring more Jon Favreau's in Marvel's series of Avengers related films over the next several years...I can't wait.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 lost a little of the original shine that 1 had, but it's still an excellent movie. Worthy of collection and at minimum a Netflix must.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I don't read the Iron Man comic series, so I can't compare the canon in the comic and this movie, so my review is based solely on my impression of the film itself and what little I do know of the Marvel and Iron Man universe.<br /><br />The visuals and action was sweet. The fight scenes were thrilling. Ivan Vanko was played well and I liked the actor chosen for the role. The story was enjoyable and believable, with convincing villains and two-faced politicians. I enjoyed Iron Man 1 more than I did this, but the second installment of this film is a definite solid movie and more than worthy of four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>Behind the armored suits and superb special effects, Iron Man 2 is a tough story of a fall from grace and redemption. Director Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. (reprising Tony Stark/Iron Man) dare to give the man behind the iron mask a mission besides saving the world: saving himself, with a little help from unexpected friends.<br /><br />As the story begins, Tony Stark faces the consequences of revealing his Iron Man identity.  The government and a rival arms inventor (an over-the-top Sam Rockwell) want the suit; a revenge-seeking Russian physicist (a perfectly cast Mickey Rourke) is after Tony; and Tony himself is being poisoned by the miniature nuclear reactor that keeps him alive.  Tony slowly self-destructs, wrecking his business, his relationships with long-suffering personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Air Force buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle), and finally his status as Iron Man.<br /><br />At rock bottom, Tony gets a hand up from Colonel Nick Fury of SHIELD (a nicely restrained Samuel L. Jackson).  Fury provides Tony with a means, and a motivation, to work out his own salvation.  En route to a smashing finale, Tony gets a key assist from Fury's undercover contact inside Stark Industries.  As enigmatic SHIELD agent Black Widow, Scarlett Johansson is "all that" in a form-fitting unitard; her thrilling hallway fight sequence might have been the centerpiece of a movie with less visual firepower.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" is very highly recommended to fans of the franchise as an excellent sequel.  There are hints the next sequel may be an "Avengers" movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>It is inevitable to compare the sequel to it's 2008 original, and the first IRON MAN was great, fanboy status aside I recommended it to everyone....I would make the same recommendation for IM2, across the board.... But if you are a fanboy, you already know this because you went to the midnight show!<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr.  was talked about connected with the role long before it became a fact, so he is still dream casting for the role of Tony Stark, and he still exceeds expectations as the Industrialist, this time facing certain death due to his HEARTcondition. Tony overindulges in the Celebrity, parties and booze as he embraces while searching for a cure and trying to find himself, too . This is a classic IM storyline from the comics, as is his confrontation with WhipLash a.K.a Ivan Venko a.k.a. Mickey Rourke, out to reclaim his family right to the Stark Legacy. Meanwhile,  the government and wacky , rival weapons-manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) are pressuring Tony to turn the IRON MAN tech over to the government. Once flippantly reassuring the Senate committee that he has things under control, Venko appears and all hell busts loose. Stark's best bud Col 'Rhodey' Rhodes (played this time Don Cheadle)is out to help Tony back on track while struggling with his own duties and responsibilities to protect the Country.<br /><br />The story is a little crowed with Whiplash working on his revenge, Rhodey overcoming his personal obstacles and Tony's, the slinky agent Black widow infiltrating Stark Industries while Tony's unrequited love Pepper Potts (Paltrow) takes over the Company while it appears that holding on to the IM tech was a mistake, once an armored super villain appears, and later a haywire drone army. Although, I would question the point of Scarlett Johansson's character , but for the super-spy cat suit fight sequence along with director Jon Favreau, which causes me to preemptively retract said statement and enjoy the spandex and party dresses. And Venko's backstory is thankfully short , as is the movie get to the action, from the Opening scene the film is high energy and beautiful graphics.... everything  from the dancing EXPO  girls...the Iron Man-ites, to  the fight between IRON MAN and War Machine (for non-geeks War Machine is the armor Rhodes wears during his time as IRON MAN in the comics, seen in IM1). In fact the fight between Tony and Rhodes at the party to a mix-music is worth admission!!!<br /><br />Cheadle as Rhodey was a good swap the great chemistry between him and RDJr., RDJr. and Paltrow still great. Robert Downey Jr. slips right back ...I'm reminded by IM2 why I was a such a hugh Rourke fan even thru the STUPId Yrs...he does soooo much with soooo little, count Rourke's lines, most  in Russian and tell me it ain't an amazing performance, the presences...(while you are at it look up Angel Heart and Prayer for the Dying, 2 great Mickey Rourke movies). Watch for an homage or two to other AVENGERS characters as the Marvel movies move grow ever nearer to those future releases.... Next stop Thor:The Movie....<br /><br />Again,  War Machine vs. Iron Man in the same film is worth admission.... War Machine teamed with Iron Man for show down, bonus<br />stayed after the credits...I advise you to stay....upshot on the film....it rocked don't let some Chicago Tribune reviewer tell ya different, (Tribune gave an uncalled for 2 1/2 ) like the first film, fanboyness aside, it was GOOD!</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Although only one screenwriter is credited, "Iron Man 2" has the classic hallmark of scripts that have gone through multiple writers and script doctors: a plethora of disparate elements shoehorned together without regard for the narrative as a whole.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" starts off promising, with an interesting conflict between Stark and the Federal Government.  The first 10 minutes set it up as "Atlas Shrugged" with a powersuit, featuring Tony Stark as Hank Reardon.  The Feds and their favored contractors are, unsurprisingly, not happy at being cut out of the defense business by a non-state actor.  Indeed, the enemies Iron Man faces in the course of the movie are non-state actors as well, a nod (conscious or unconscious) to the unsustainability of the welfare-warfare state.<br /><br />But enough of that.  Instead of a tight, interesting movie, we get a bunch of diversions that keep Iron Man from encountering the Stinky Russian, his primary enemy, until 30 minutes in.  Mickey Rourke plays Stinky Russian, and you can darn near smell him whenever he's on screen.  OK, that's cool, but then there's some corporate succession issues, the pointless use of SHIELD, and Scarlett Johansson phoning it in as Stark's new assistant.  Every scene with her is grating and unnecessary.  Oh, then there are some other plot points that would be spoilers that I will avoid.  Rather than a complete narrative, we get bogged down in Act 2 and just stay there from a long time spinning our wheels.  Even when the movie finally gets going again, the climax manages to be anticlimactic.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" is saved only by Downey, Rourke and Rockwell.  All three are so talented that they uplift the material and keep this move from becoming a complete trainwreck.  The cleverness and tight writing of the first movie is absent here.  Rent if you must, but you are likely to be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>I really loved the first IRON MAN, and am very pleased that they released IRON MAN 2, so that Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., and IRON MAN (an interesting trinity) could continue their fight for truth, justice and the American way.  While not as good as the first, IRON MAN 2 is still a good, fun, entertaining film, one that my husband and I really enjoyed watching.<br /><br />IRON MAN 2 basically picks up where IRON MAN left off.  It has been 6 months since Tony Stark revealed to the world that he is IRON MAN.  Stark is fighting to keep his technology from being weaponized by the government, still attempting to achieve world peace, and this time, he is also fighting for his life.<br /><br />The returning cast of IRON MAN 2 (Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson) continue to be outstanding, and the newest members (Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell) are definitely up to the task.  New comic book super heroes and super villains (Black Widow and Whiplash) are added to the mix, and are very fun.  The special effects are top notch (especially dazzling are Whiplash's electric whips), and the plot is enjoyable, though not quite up to the level of the first IRON MAN.<br /><br />It looks like there is going to be an IRON MAN 3, and I hope that the get back that special "pop" that the first movie had.  There are also going to be a number of spin offs, most notably one for Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.  Hopefully, these movies, too, will live up to the original IRON MAN.  I guess we will have to wait and see.<br /><br />Overall, IRON MAN 2 is very engaging, lots of fun, and definitely worth watching, especially if you enjoyed the first IRON MAN.  RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>Taking place six months after the first Iron Man, Iron Man 2 finds a world where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has successfully "privatized world peace," but fearing other countries getting their hands on Stark's Iron Man technology the Senate seeks to have Tony hand over the technology to the government. Also seeking to steal Stark's technology is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who wants to regain a weapons contract with the military. Complicating things further, a mysterious Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) turns up to destroy Tony Stark.<br /><br />Iron Man was a huge surprise when it came out in the early summer of 2008. A 2nd tier Marvel comic book, Iron Man became one of the top grossing movies of 2008, and even held it's own very well against the juggernaut that was The Dark Knight despite it's much smaller fanbase. It also resurrected Robert Downey Jr.'s career, showing that he was capable of leading a franchise despite his past mistakes, and showed that Jon Favreau was a viable action director. Since then Downey has found himself nominated for two Golden Globes winning one of them, and added yet another big action franchise to the current notch in his belt. Of course, all eyes are on Iron Man 2 to see if the movie will top it's predecessor in the expectations department, so how does it hold up.<br /><br />In my opinion, Iron Man 2 equals it's predecessor. The second installment of Iron Man is funnier than the original, and it ups the ante on the action from the first movie as well. What really makes the movie though, is not the action, but the characterizations. Fleshing out Stark's narcissism as well as his inabilities to deal with his emotions opens new doors into the character. Favreau and new writer to the series Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunderdo a great job of handling a large cast that would normally sink most other comic book franchises.<br /><br />The casting in this movie is superb even if it seems jarring to see so many actors and actresses playing characters that aren't typical for them. Apart from The Spirit and The Island, Scarlett Johansson hasn't played an outright action fueled character, but she equips herself admirably to play the part of a believable martial arts trained heroine. Don Cheadle does a great job taking over the role of Rhodey from Terrence Howard, and even tops his predecessor. Sam Rockwell does a superb job as Stark's rival, and a man who tries his hardest to be as iconic as Tony Stark, but fails miserably on all counts. Mickey Rourke steals nearly every scene he's in, though, as Russian physicist Ivan Vanko. I was never sure if I would be able to buy him as a Russian, but the work he put into researching for the character definitely paid off.<br /><br />On the downside though, sometimes it feels as though there's too much of a rush to get from one point to the next. Scenes feel as though they move to the next before they're truly done playing out. Unfortunately, this is one of the issues of having such a large cast that needs to have proper screen time to flesh out the characters. To add to that, the second half of the film is a bit derivative of other action films. While the film may do a great job of going in a different direction than other comic book films by outing it's central character and performing a character study on a man who thrives on his popularity in that position, but in the last act of the movie it falls into the same trap as other action movies with an ending that can be clich&eacute;.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like movies based on comic books and if you like the first Iron Man. Franchises like Iron Man, the current Batman series, and Kick-Ass set a new benchmark for comic book movies and action movies in general. With great action, acting, characterization, and originality these movies have moved beyond their genres to capture something that extends beyond it's core audience.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>IRON MAN II.  May he rest in peace. As with so many of these Marvel Comics scripts there are so many add-on characters to disrupt the meager storyline that it seems like the studio tapped everyone who walked by the filming, gave them a few lines and a wow costume and said 'come one in.' Rating an obvious millions of dollars production such as this is duplicitous: CGI 5, acting 3, story 1.  But if noise, mayhem, and electrical fires are pleasing to you, then by all means jump aboard this colorful film.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. is a fine actor so he puts as much as he can into the lines allotted him to read.  Mickey Rourke is the bad guy with even more tattoos and longer hair than the Wrestler, and with a Russian accent to boot.  Don Cheadle plays Don Cheadle, and Sam Rockwell needs a shave as a supposed wily bad guy executive. Samuel L. Jackson attempts to lend some dignity.  Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be asking why she bothered until Scarlett Johansson jumps on board to give the film some much need punch.  It's good guy versus bad guy - with drones create by Rourke's disenchanted character that attempt unsuccessfully to turn the tide.  What's missing is some of Robert Downey, Jr.'s comedic banter and the brakes put on the destruction of the Stark Expo concept.  Definitely a film for those who like this sort of high volume comic book outing.  Grady Harp, October 10</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>The summer of 2010 is nearly upon us and here to ring in the blistering heat is the first official blockbuster of the season, "Iron Man 2". After the gigantic success of "Iron Man" in 2008, the inevitable sequel was quickly announced by Marvel Studios. So, with only two short years to piece together the continuing story of billionaire Tony Stark and his alter-ego Iron Man, director Jon Favreau and company quickly began working on what could possibly be one of the biggest movies, if not the biggest of the year. With expectations surrounding this follow-up understandably high, "Iron Man 2" would definitely need to up the stakes and the spectacle in order to meet audience demand. But have no fear true believer (just a little nod to Stan Lee there); this movie succeeds brilliantly on all counts.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" picks up six months after the events of the previous film. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is beginning to feel the pressure of living the life of a publicly known superhero. With his behavior growing more and more erratic, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) begin to wonder if Tony's days as Iron Man need to come to a close. Meanwhile, a new threat is emerging onto the scene, Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash (Mickey Rourke), seeking to destroy Tony Stark for sins of the father, so to speak. Plus, a rival weapons manufacturer, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), is trying to create his own version of the Iron Man armor, and will stop at nothing to achieve his ambitious goal. With so much at stake, Tony will have to look inside himself to rediscover the man behind the armor, and in a sense re-forge the Iron Man.<br /><br />The first film featured a terrific blend of action, comedy (well-written and smart, not so much tongue-in-cheek), drama, and stunning visual effects to bring the hero to life. With "Iron Man 2" the action is even more intense, with bigger special effects sequences, but this time the comedy takes more of a backseat to make room for a much more dramatic storyline. Put all of these elements together and mix them just right and you've got yourself a recipe for another successful superhero jaunt.<br /><br />The action sequences in the original were fast-paced and well-executed pieces of summer movie fun. However, the action in this film blows away everything that was done before with considerable ease. If you thought that there wasn't enough armored action the first-go-round, then "Iron Man 2" should definitely meet your needs. If nothing else, the final 30 minutes of the movie will leave even the most ardent action junkie satisfied for quite some time.<br /><br />Assisting in creating the incredible action scenes is some truly impressive visual effects work courtesy once more from Industrial Light and Magic. The visuals' seamless blend with the live action elements makes the futuristic aspects of the movie more believable rather than if the CGI had been over-the-top. Case in point, the holographic imagery Stark uses when associating/working with JARVIS in the lab. This obvious usage of CGI while very apparent doesn't seem all that removed from our reality, to the point that one could easily see this tech being available in the not so distant future. Not to mention all of the CGI intensive moments featuring Iron Man and War Machine in action are so exciting, and for comic book lovers, seeing the duo fighting side-by-side is simply incredible. Their scenes alone make it worth watching on the big screen at least one time.<br /><br />Of course, the glue holding all of the exciting visuals and thrilling action sequences together is the solid screenplay written by Justin Theroux ("Tropic Thunder"), featuring elements loosely based upon the acclaimed "Demon in a Bottle" storyline from the comic books. As I stated earlier, the original film featured plenty of humor, wit, and sarcasm (primarily from Tony), this installment opts for a more mature tone which is very appropriate given the upheavals occurring in Tony's life after his proclamation of, "I am Iron Man." So, for those of you hoping for the same light-hearted fare, sorry not this time, and honestly the movie works well without it.<br /><br />Now, there are some that felt this darker tinged story, especially in the first half of the movie, causes this entry to not feel as fun or entertaining as its predecessor. Personally, I felt the thematic shift was a natural progression for the character (not to mention keeping in-line with the comic book source material), and had the humor remained front-and-center then the story would have fallen flat on its face. While I do understand the detractors' point of view, the lesser success of the two "Fantastic Four" movies should serve as a prime example of allowing for too much humor, thus, overshadowing the potential for good dramatic storytelling. Thankfully, screenwriter Justin Theroux and director Jon Favreau managed to avoid the aforementioned movies' pratfall, and the drama was allowed a chance to thrive.<br /><br />Of course, the story would be nothing without the incredible cast assembled to breathe life into these iconic characters. Leading the assemblage once more is Hollywood's most successful comeback kid, Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Robert appears to be relishing the opportunity to reprise what could easily be called his most recognizable role. Robert once again brings his smooth talking, hyper-active personality to the character, but with a darker edge than previously seen. Portraying a man on the edge of losing his way, Robert's terrific performance was most likely influenced by his own infamous past. Even with the darker thematic elements, Downey, Jr. manages to keep things interesting and from sinking too far down during the film's gloomy, yet necessary moments.<br /><br />In the supporting roles we find actress Gwyneth Paltrow returning as Pepper Potts. While Gwyneth easily holds her own opposite Robert, and their scenes are always rife with a playful tension and chemistry; sadly, it felt like her role was somewhat diminished from that of the original film. Even though she was featured throughout the entire duration, often times she seemed to be more of an afterthought to the scenes. Obviously, in a film with such a large cast, fitting everyone in with equal time is a difficult task, so I do understand that some judicious editing had to be done. Also, I'm not saying that having a little less Pepper Potts results in a less enjoyable movie, not in the least bit. I was just surprised more than anything to see her character on the backburner.<br /><br />The character of Lt. Col. James Rhodes, portrayed this time by Don Cheadle ("Traitor") replacing Terrence Howard, is much more involved in not only the story, but also the action sequences, due to his donning of the War Machine armor. I was curious as to what I was going to think of Don Cheadle as Rhodes compared to Terrence, since I enjoyed his portrayal in the first movie. However, after seeing the movie I was left wishing Cheadle would have portrayed the character in both films. As good of an actor as Terrence Howard is, Don Cheadle really looked like he fit the part, and played the role perfectly both in and out of the armor. Cheadle just came off as a harder, more militaristic man in his portrayal, whereas Terrence seemed more on the softer side and slightly out of place in the role by comparison. It's too bad we can't go back and do some re-shoots to insert Don Cheadle into the original movie for better continuity.<br /><br />Several new characters joined the cast of the expanding Marvel movie universe as we were introduced to Stark Industries' main business rival Justin Hammer, the villainous Ivan Vanko, and undercover spy Natasha Romanoff. Sam Rockwell ("Moon") is perfectly sniveling and smarmy as Justin Hammer. He's a man who, like Tony Stark, is recognized for his weapons manufacturing, but unlike Stark he has no qualms about eliminating whoever gets in his way. As the film's primary villain, Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash, Mickey Rourke ("Sin City") is creepy, brilliant, cold, and calculating in every aspect of his plot for vengeance against the Stark family and their business empire.<br /><br />Now, Mickey Rourke may be a strange guy in the real world, and some could even argue a bit unstable, but one thing is for certain, he is one great actor. His performance was spot on every step of the way. For instance, unlike so many American actors, he never once appeared to struggle to maintain his character's Russian accent throughout the whole duration. This character will not garner him the accolades that his role in "The Wrestler" did, but he should be recognized all the same for continually putting terrific work on display every time he hits the screen.<br /><br />Rounding out the newcomers is Scarlett Johansson ("The Island") as Natasha Romanoff, otherwise known as the Black Widow in the comic book world. Scarlett establishes her character in a humorous moment early on as being much more than what she seems, and from there we are given a character that is smart, sexy, and above all, lethal. After seeing her in this movie, I can't wait to see more of Scarlett's take on the Black Widow in future installments of this series or maybe even in some of the other Marvel franchises that are in the works.<br /><br />Lastly, Samuel L. Jackson returns once more as the Director of S.H.I.E.LD., Nick Fury. At the end of the previous film, we are introduced to Nick Fury, albeit ever so briefly. Thankfully, this time around he is given a little bit more screen time, popping up every once in a while over the course of the movie. Samuel is clearly enjoying his role as the Marvel Universe's top spy, and is leaving fans wanting to see more of his character in the future films.<br /><br />So, when all is said and done, without a doubt "Iron Man 2" easily lives up to all the hype. Boasting an engaging story that is filled with terrific characters, plenty of new plot developments, and incredible action scenes that are brimming with stunning CGI; director Jon Favreau's follow-up delivers in every way imaginable and even manages to surpass its predecessor. Not a bad day's work for a superhero.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was awesome and just as good as the original. It's filled to the brim with action, explosions, suspense, and comedy. The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>[THIS IS BEING WRITTEN AT THE TIME OF THE THEATRICAL RELEASE -- AS OF THIS WRITING, THE DVD IS NOT OUT YET, THANKS.]<br /><br />Unlike other superhero films, with shoot 'em up action, crazed villains and a conflicted hero who is put into life threatening situations for himself and those he loves, director Favreau decided on a different take.<br /><br />Favreau went on an Iron-Deficient diet!  And instead created a story about Tony the man.  Tony the billionaire, arrogant playboy.  Tony, the man who is dying.<br /><br />The Paramount logo barely glows on the big screen when we hear the audio of the Senate hearings by a smarmy senator who demands the Iron suit "weapon" for the USA.  Tony wants it for himself and congratulates himself on "privatizing World Peace" *kiss kiss*<br /><br />However, the metal he is using for the energy core that is keeping him alive as well as powering the Iron suit is killing him.  CGI veins darken his neck.  But in a fit of wanting to protect those he loves by pushing them away, he gives away his art gallery, gives his CEO post to Pepper Potts and decides to party his life away.<br /><br />The world however ,was not meant to give Stark a relaxing good time.<br /><br />The other side of the world has a Russian physicist whose father worked for and later apparently discarded by Tony's father.  This man, Ivan, wants revenge.  Collaborating with a government stooge (Justin Hammer, a real idiot) he invents Iron-man clones which as we will later see will be used to bring down Stark Industries (known colloquially as "Hammer-oids").  Hey, I could NOT make this stuff up, OK??<br /><br />I disagree with critics who feel it's another Spider-man 3 [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPFH">Spider-Man 3 (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>] with a bunch of villains and mixing it up.  Far from it.<br /><br />The "women of steel" include Black Widow, working under cover for SHIELD as Tony's legal adviser (and man she is fine) and a great martial artist.  Love the fight scenes!  The other "woman of steel" is Pepper Potts, who is at her wits end about what to do about and with Tony.  She loves him but she can't stand him.  Whadda predicaminckt!<br /><br />The real player is Tony's dad.  We watch a film that would have done Disney proud as the "Key to the Future" is revealed (complete with Disney-esque music and style) but is actually more than it seems -- and gives Tony a key to his future.<br /><br />The relationship angle was a welcome change for the superhero film.  It's mostly story and plot and interaction between characters.  Yes, there are explosions and broken glass and flying bullets and guns -- but these are secondary -- even the villain is secondary -- to the man and the myth that is Stark.<br /><br />I was impressed!<br /><br />Minus one star for the slow pace.  I found that it went on a little too long, with Tony getting drunk, smashing up his own birthday party and so on.  The Shield connection and Black Widow's part could have been expanded in lieu of the silly party antics.<br /><br />Don't forget to stay to the end of the credits!  There's a cool chestnut for you Marvel Comics fans!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Character driven, real story and substance into the man that is Tony Stark, as he finds his body betraying him, as he is slowly dying and does not have a lot of options.  People who don't normally go in for these types of comic book-based films will enjoy this picture as a result of this new, original style by Favreau.<br /><br />Recommended:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00194IFQ2">Iron Man Viva Las Vegas # 1 (of 4) comic</a></p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>As in the first Iron Man movie, Robert Downey Jr's personality comes across lots bigger than his physical person. The fast patter and winning wisecracks usually carry the movie when the comic-book effects don't - and there are some great effects. Paltrow's character, 'Pepper' Potts comes across with the right urgency and sincerity. Scarlett Johansson's spy babe fits that black catsuit flawlessly. Tony Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, creates a spoiled, whiny character with too much money for his own good - the kind you love to dislike, since he's not even evil enough to hate. And, of course, Mickey Rourke's 'Vanko' makes an electrifying badguy.<br /><br />Despite the great comic book styling, a few things fell flat. Comic book outsiders will scratch their heads over Nick Fury and SHIELD ("huh? where'd that come from?"). Everyone will scratch their heads over Potts's sudden promotion, once they see how Stark seems to undermine her (or try to) every time she tries to get the new job done. And, despite hints that he's not really as out of control as he seems, Stark being that out of control is just out of character - even RDJr's free-wheeling character.<br /><br />But, c'mon. You don't go to comic book movies for deep motivation or exploration of the human soul. You go for the BamPow goodness of a summer popcorn flick - and this offers plenty.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the relase to theaters<br /><br />(PS: The chemists out there already know that I really meant "Fe" in the title of this review - all others just take my word, it's no typo.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>Watching this film made me wonder why in the world I don't own "Iron Man." I love Robert Downey Jr. in this film and think he was perfect for the part. He has the right sense of dry humor and the ability to make us believe that he really is Iron Man. The action was fun to watch. Don Cheadle was even better at his role than Terrence Howard, plus he's very nice to look at. Samuel L. Jackson in any movie always adds a little extra swagger. All of the actors played their roles well, and I enjoyed the bickering back and forth between Iron Man and his CEO ("I was going to make you an omelet and tell you").<br /><br />The basic summary of the movie is some guy takes revenge for an event Iron Man can't control and decides to copy his costume. Does he want to take over the world or just defeat Iron Man? Find out how it all works out by checking this film out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EISFBTLEQC69.html">A3EISFBTLEQC69</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the film, but the first one was stronger.  I don't want to discourage you though.  If you like Iron Man, you will enjoy this.</p></br></body></html>

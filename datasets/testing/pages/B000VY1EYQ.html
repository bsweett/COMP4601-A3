Keri Russell delivers the performance of her career as a frank and frankly unhappy small-town Southern woman. Jenna (Keri Russell) is a waitress and star pie chef at Joe's Pie Diner, where best friends Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly) also wait tables. Jenna dreams often of new pies and of escaping her self-obsessed, controlling husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto). She's annoyed to find herself pregnant and resents the idea of her impending motherhood. But Jenna finds unexpected romance and companionship with her new doctor Jim Pomatter (Nathan Fillion).<br /><br />"Waitress" finds a remarkable and surprising tone. Writer/director Adrienne Shelly takes a humorous perspective on life's shortcomings and on her characters' relationships, good and bad. Jenna doesn't like being pregnant and hates her abusive husband. This could be the stuff of melodrama, or worse, preachy. But "Waitress" had me laughing out loud while never losing sympathy for Jenna's predicament. The quirky cast of characters doesn't seem self-conscious, because they demonstrate genuine affection for each other, including a nice turn by veteran Andy Griffith as the diner's curmudgeonly owner. It's sad that Adrienne Shelly didn't live to see the film's success, because "Waitress" demonstrates great originality and wit with potentially touchy and tired material.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): "This is How We Made Waitress Pie" (10 min) interviews director, cast, and producer Michael Rioff about the film's characters and relationships. In "Written and Directed by Adrienne Shelly: A Memorial" (7 min), cast and producer Rioff talk about working with the director. "Hi! I'm Keri, I'll Be Your Waitress" (6 min) interviews Keri Russell about Jenna, the film, and its reception. "The Pies Have It!" (3 min) discusses the role of pies in the movie and everyone tells us his/her favorite pie. "The Movie Channel Presents: In Character with Keri Russell, Cheryl Hines, Nathan Fillion" (10 min) is three parts. "A Message from Keri Russell about the Adrienne Shelly Foundation" (1 min). There is an audio commentary with Keri Russell and producer Michael Rioff that talks a lot about filming scene-by-scene. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish,  French. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>The success of this film comes from the great acting, strong characters, and small scale of the plot.  Briefly, the film details a series of small-town happenings surrounding the waitresses of a pie shop, with a particular close-up on a newly pregnant waitress, Jenna (played by Keri Russell).  The people who surround her at first come off as Deep South cartoons, but the audience comes to sympathize with them fairly quickly, and that sympathy is sustained throughout the picture.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed with Andy Griffith's gruff comic performance as Old Joe.  As I was watching the film, I wondered why he hadn't made different career choices.  He has the same wisdom of character as Henry Fonda, yet Griffith has too often played country-fried characters.  Certainly, Old Joe is deep-fried, but he knows it and is reflective.  He knows that he has made poor decisions, and he knows how he could have lived differently.<br /><br />Jeremy Sisto's portrayal of Earl, Jenna's husband, is reminiscent of his work on Six Feet Under.  Sisto has perfected the neurotic, desperate, man-boy performance.  As on Six Feet Under, he is exhausting to watch for a long time, because he demands so much attention, much like a child.  I credit Sisto for making the audience sympathize (if only briefly) with Earl's ignorance of what it means to be a man and a husband.<br /><br />Nathan Fillion's performance of Dr. Pomatter is similar to Sisto's Earl.  They are both weird, bad husbands and confused men.  While Earl seems dangerous, Dr. Pomatter comes off as sweet.  The proximity of sweetness and jealousy is rather eerie, now that I think about it.<br /><br />Keri Russell is the film's protagonist, the great pie-making waitress.  She is the mold that girls-next-door are made from.  She's poor, pregnant, has a new doctor, the same manic husband, and all she wants to do is escape all of them.  The film is her story, her adventure.  She moves through a weird world as gracefully as she can.<br /><br />It might be worth pointing out the morality of this film, what Old Joe calls "indiscretions."  I think the movie is more amoral than it is moral or immoral.  The point of the plot isn't to expose a woman who strays from the path only to find her way to righteousness, nor is the film about taking joy in infidelity and disloyalty.  All of those things are thrown up in the air and allowed to settle where they may, with Jenna standing before them, offering us a good old fashioned pie and a different twist to a familiar tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Keri Russell plays Jenna, a young pie-baking waitress who finds herself in an unhappy marriage. She hopes to win a pie baking contest and take the prize money in order to leave her husband and begin a new life.<br /><br />But the new life she finds is the news that she is pregnant. Her plans are put on hold while she tries to figure what to do. Jenna bakes pies to reflect what is going on in her life. The humor in her baking and her extraordinary friends furnish support to have her daughter Lulu and to tell her husband she is finished with him.<br /><br />This is a delightful film and you find yourself pulling for Jenna the entire film.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>This is a lovely, heart-warming, slightly off-beat little film.  I loved the whole idea of pie-making.  Who ever has a real, home-made pie in a diner anymore?  Who even makes pies anymore?<br /><br />The story is sweet and just real enough to keep you engaged.  The actors are perfectly cast and do wonderful jobs.  It was a treat to see Andy Griffith again.<br /><br />I subtract one star, however, due to the ending.  It didn't quite add up to me.  After the long build up of the excessively tender and passionate relationship of the waitress and the doctor, it seemed awfully easy for her to end it.  The film tells us that she is so in love with her daughter that she doesn't need anyone else...except her pie making.  Hmmm.<br /><br />Still if you don't expect it to be too realistic or logical, it's worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>It is very sad that Adrienne Shelley will never get to direct another film.  This is a very nice small film that shows promise for a novice director.  A young woman with a lousy husband becomes pregnant and is very unhappy about it.  Throw in an improbable relationship with her gynacologist and there is the movie.  The performances are sweet, the characters are engaging and movie is fun to watch.  Something simple can be very satisfying at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>This scrappy little film isn't always neat and polished, but that's sort of appropriate, because the central character certainly isn't those things, either. Keri Russell's waitress character has a good heart and is basically likable, but she's a mess of conflicting emotions and desires as she moves into a particularly challenging crossroads of her life.  In fact, she can be so frustrating at times that we sometimes even feel bad for her abusive husband.  But ultimately we root for Ms. Russell's Jenna character to get on the right path, make the right choices, and find her way.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable, even haunting film (made more so by the tragic fate of its director and co-star, Adrienne Shelley), that's probably best described as a serious drama with a generous dose of comedy stirred in to make it all go down easier.  It was also nice to see Andy Griffith in a meaty movie role again, here playing the diner's owner and frequent customer, who comes to befriend and counsel Jenna between his meticulous and cranky food orders.<br /><br />"Waitress" looks and sounds fine on DVD and is accompanied by a generous array of extra features.  Give this one a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Keri Russell plays a waitress trapped by a controlling husband who discovers she is pregnant. Her only dream is to get away and win a pie contest. She has a gift for making amazing pies and its her refuge from the sad marriage where she has no freedom. When a handsome doctor arrives in town and pursues an unexpected affair with her, gradually her life begins to show promise of happinness with her baby and without her husband.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>Readers of this space may have noticed that most of the DVD's that I have reviewed tend to be from the black and white period of cinema history or, if later, have some overwhelming political significance like the movie Reds. For the record I do watch some current films but that I do not review them is for the most part I do not find them worthy of review in this space. However it is probably a surprise that I am reviewing a 2007 film about a spunky pie-making crazed waitress caught up in a world that is not of her own making and seemingly is a black hole as she attempts to get out.<br /><br />The plotline of this film is that a young, fetching, wholesome and whimsical working class waitress in a pie caf&eacute; has become unintentionally (on her part, at least) pregnant by her oafish, crude and violent husband out somewhere in small town America. This predicament is exactly the nightmare scenario that this woman does not want. Initially she wants neither the baby nor her husband. What she does really want is to win a big pie bake-off and flee the small burg. The plot meanders around the struggle to reach that goal. Along the way she is romantically involved with her attending physician, begins to get out from under her husband's thumb (and ultimately the good doctor, who just happens to be married) and by a stroke of good fortune (provided by the old pie caf&eacute; owner, played by Andy Griffith) she is able to be independent and raise her now loved child on her own. Well, this is one variety of the American dream, isn't it?<br /><br />But what about the politics? In a funny way the politics are very mixed. Her apparently adamant aversion to the thought of an abortion despite the boorish husband and the crimp it places on her dreams seems counter-intuitive but within the flow of current politics where the emphasis is on keeping abortion legal but rare. Her sex-crazed affair with her doctor while pregnant puts a very different spin on the assumptions about pregnancy and sexuality as previously portrayed on the screen. But in the end our little working class waitress she gets her little slice of the American dream, right? She gets her ticket to the middle class dream caf&eacute; and her personal freedom. Nobody says that a commercial film has be politically correct left or right (and despite all the clamor, most are thankfully not) or be profound but the definitely mixed messages of this film have got this old leftist scratching his head. See the thing and judge for yourselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>This movie really ran you through quite a bit.  A waitress that has a talent for baking pies stuck in an almost unbelievably bad and gets pregnant. Then her new OB/GYN is attractive and she starts having an affair with him.  Everyone around her is having an affair.  All she wants to do is run away from her husband.  Andy Griffith is a difficult customer/owner that befriends her and helps her out at the end.  The sad part is the writer/director and actress in this movie, Adriene Shelly has her life tragically shortened near the end of this movie, which is now dedicated to her, a movie to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>My wife and I have been excited about seeing this little ditty for some time now so when we finally got to sit down and watch it last night we were filled with high expectations.  I can honestly say that, for the most part, we were not let down.  `Waitress' is a delightfully funny little film that's got layers of meaning and warmth that line the sarcasm and humor beautifully.  There are moments where it seems a little overdone in my opinion, and Keri Russell's performance (while wonder in a complete sense) seems to lack a little in moments.  The script though is what really makes this movie what it is, and the late Adrienne Shelly concocted one of the most entertaining scripts of the year.  It's witty, charming, serious, connected and complete.<br /><br />`Waitress' follows the pregnancy of young Jenna, a local pie maker who hates her life in its entirety.  She's married to a jerk of a man who watches her every move and demands all her time and attention.  Her friends Becky and Dawn don't have half the life she has yet they wouldn't trade shoes with her, not ever.  When Jenna finds out that she is pregnant she is devastated.  It's just one more thing holding her back, keeping her in this town that she loathes with a man she regrets in every way.<br /><br />Jenna decides to keep the baby.  She respects its right to live even though she feels no affection for it and so she starts seeing a doctor.  Her hormones mixed with the overwhelming hinge of regret bring her to fall into an affair with her married doctor and gradually her outlook begins to change.  She has found a small slice of happiness and even though she knows that what she is doing is ultimately wrong she can't stop because it's the only thing she has to hold on to, the only thing that will keep her sane throughout this whole ordeal.<br /><br />This little film is filled with delightful performances by the entire supporting cast.  Nathan Fillion comes off a bit awkward in the beginning but as Jenna's relationship grows with Dr. Pomatter he becomes a more fleshed out and understandable.  Jeremy Sisto is insanely crazy as Jenna's husband Earl and Lew Temple and Eddie Jemison do well to bring life to their small roles as love interests of Jenna's friends.  Keri Russell gives a sweetly endearing performance that is, like I said, wonderful when looking at the complete picture.  My wife in particular loved her blunt delivery of her lines and feelings.  I felt that she was a bit too blunt at times which made it hard to crack her hard exterior and find the real woman on the inside.  There are a few scenes where she nails it, and overall she is wonderful, but there are some areas where I wish she would have worked at it a little better.<br /><br />This movie, in my humble opinion, belongs to two people, Cheryl Hines and Andy Griffith, both of whom steal every scene with their impeccable humor and delivery.  Cheryl Hines is delightfully sarcastic as Becky and Andy Griffith gives one of my favorite supporting performances of the year.  He understands Joe and this works in his, and our, favor.  Adrienne Shelly not only wrote and directed this film but also stars as Dawn, Jenna's gawky friend.  She does a great job of balancing the humor with real emotion.  The tragedy surrounding this film and her untimely death was terrible to hear about, and after seeing this film my wife was actually brought to tears when I told her about Shelly's death.<br /><br />`Waitress' is not a film that will disappoint.  It will make you smile, make you cry and make you fall in love frame by frame.  It's a sweet balance between the comic and the dramatic portions of life that we all come across.  Sit back and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/ASEBX8TBYWQWA.html">ASEBX8TBYWQWA</a><br/><p>What a great little find this "indie" was on DVD! It came and went in the theaters in the major cities and - hopefully - will be discovered on DVD by word of mouth.<br /><br />This film IS Keri Russell - whose been around for a while, though this is the first time I've seen her. She is on the screen in nearly every scene and makes you really care about her and her pregnancy (unplanned). The father of her child - as played by Jeremy Sisto - is probably the one uninteresting character in the film but he's crucial to the plot. He is a slacker and - personally - I found him annoying whenever he appeared in a scene. But I guess that's the point the film is trying to make.<br /><br />There's a back story of course about this film. It's "creator" Writer-Director, and even star in a significant role, Adrienne Shelly died shortly after the film was made. (There's even a charitable foundation set up in her name to help young female film directors.). The bonus featurettes are nicely done and we get to see Shelly at work.<br /><br />Give this one a chance. Watch it without knowing very much about it and you'll be hood. "Quiet" is a word to comes to mind. And it's not unlike the fascinating Oscar nominated film "Junebug" in its style and even parts of it's storyline.<br /><br />And - one extra word of advice: Don't watch this while you are hungry! The constant mention of mouth-watering pies will send you into hunger pangs before you get to its conclusion.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed watching this movie. Unfortunately I did not enjoy watching it end. For while in the end our protagonist gets some cash and gets away from Earl, it is not enough.<br /><br />The acting was superb.  Andy Griffith was fantastic in his role as the crusty pie shop owner. Nathan Fillion was superb as the besotted obstetrician, and Keri Russell was fabulous in her pie-making down-trodden wife role.<br /><br />The direction was also fabulous.<br />The script was a let-down.

She concocts a new recipe everyday, one that generally reflects her current mood and circumstances as they exist at that moment. Trapped in a bad marriage to a controlling, insecure male (Jeremy Sisto) Jena (Keri Russell) tries to hold her life together relying on her culinary creations and friends at the diner to add some semblance of meaning to her existence.<br /><br />Just when her plan of running away and starting fresh somewhere else seems plausible she becomes pregnant and must re-evaluate what to do. A trip to the obstetrician to confirm her pregnancy adds more confusion and emotional angst to the situation when she discovers her old doctor has retired and has been replaced by the handsome Doctor Pomatter (Nathan Fillion). Sparks soon fly between the two and the future is now more uncertain than ever.<br /><br />Critique: While primarily a "chick flick" I found this film to have a subtly about itthat was quite appealing as it looked at the drudgery of life in a loveless, dysfunctional marriage from a woman's viewpoint. There is quite a bit of depth and insight revealed within this very well conceived storyline a some good lessons to be learned such as; life was never intended to be a party and sometimes being "happy enough" is enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>I like a Sundance sort of picture as much as the next man, but this one has too much about pies in it.  Maybe if I liked pies more, I would enjoy the endless shots of pies being made, nut they needed a better food stylist here if they were going to spend reels of film pouring viscous mounds of goo from a bowl held high above the table into the waiting piecrust below.  Repeat, ad infinitum, add voiceover explaining that this was "Jenna's Feeling Bad Today Pie" or "Jenns Needs a New Sparkplug in her Love Life Pie."  The cutesy names did it for me.  I could not fully appreciate the simplicities of the story, nor the occasional good acting.<br /><br />I saw this on the heels of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW and this could not help but see some similarities between the two films.  You have the ignored wife, the callous husband, the tiny town where everyone knows your business.  In TLPS you had Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) a crusty old curmudgeon of a diner owner whose bequest changes the lives of everyone around him.  And here you have Andy Griffith, going through the Sam the Lion playbook without even a single change of dialogue, well, practically.  Never mind, it's a great old part, and somebody should be playing it in every movie.<br /><br />I can see why the actors wants to participate.  I'm not even an actor, but even I would pay good money to be able to play in one of those scenes in which the two principals who hate each other part angrily, and then in a doubletake a moment later, the madder one turns around and marches to the other and kisses him/her with all the pentup list the screen will allow.  It's in every Sundance movie, but why doesn't it happen this way in real life?</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>Kerrie Russell is lovely in the title role of this story of a hard working waitress trapped in a dead-end job with a loser husband.

An affair with a hunky OB/GYN doctor and friendship with the diner's elderly owner (Andy Griffith) open her eyes to life's new possibilities.<br /><br />The movie works better if you suspend disbelief for an hour or so.  The pies look scrumptious!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Watching this film felt like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, it reminded me of a superior film called 'The Prize Winner Of Defiance Ohio' released a couple of years ago. The film is easy enough to watch, but most of the characters are "cookie cutter" with no real depth to them. It's an OK watch though with good performances by Griffith and Russell.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>Simple and complex this story delves deep into the complexities of relationships in life.  For the most part I think everyone could find a piece of this pie that is like our lives in general.<br /><br />Jenna is the main character married to a not so nice husband named Earl.  Jenna is a sweet woman who finds out she is pregnant early on.  Most of her challenge comes from trying to find out if she really wants her baby.  It is something I am sure many women have worried about in a loveless marriage.  Jenna has just been given a new doctor after finding out her familiar doctor is retiring.  Her new doctor is a man and the complexities come from that.<br /><br />The story then seems to get more complex after that.  It becomes evident how unhappy Jenna really is and how she expresses her feelings thru her creative pie making.  As she becomes closer to her doctor they start a romantic relationship.  Jenna now must fight between her happiness she has just found and not cheating on her husband.  Of course everything could be perfect but it isn't.<br /><br />This movie is really wonderful and I am sure just about everyone will be able to relate to it in some way.  The happiness, sadness, and even anger.  Waitress does a excellent job really showing the trials and tribulations of life.  Nothing is simple for the most but making sure you as an individual is happy is the key to life.  Yes this movie has a message and a good one at that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Writer-director-star-songwriter Adrienne Shelly's final movie is a bittersweet romance film that will make you fall in love with Keri Russell (if you haven't already) and pie. There's not a false note in this sensuous (figuratively speaking) drama of a young waitress named Jenna (Keri Russell; TV's "Felicity") who is trapped in an abusive relationship with her loser s.o.b. husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto; the abysmal and blasphemous made-for-TV film "Jesus"). I won't give the plot away, though. Watch for Andy Griffith (TV's "The Andy Griffith Show" and<br />"Matlock") as the cantankerous, but warm-hearted, owner of Joe's Pie Shop. Sadly, Adrienne Shelly (who also plays Dawn in the film, besides co-writing the heart-warming song "Baby, Don't You Cry" & writing and directing and the movie) was murdered before the film was released (her killer is currently in jail), leaving behind a grieving husband and a cute little girl (who appears briefly in the film). Rated PG for some language.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RJXK6KF3LL5R.html">A1RJXK6KF3LL5R</a><br/><p>I loved it!It was terrific!A movie that shows you to believe in yourself and you will make it.Everyone who acted in this movie did a wonderful job.I will watch this over and over.This is definitely a movie worth seeing for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Ever since she was a little girl, Jenna (Keri Russell) has been concocting world-class pie recipes - a different pie, in fact, for every mood and occasion that life has to offer.  Now, in her thirties, she finds herself stuck working as a waitress in somebody else's pie shop and trapped in a loveless marriage to a domineering and physically abusive lout named Earl.  And, oh yes, she also happens to be pregnant.<br /><br />This is the set-up for "Waitress," a slick, low-budget independent romantic comedy that was one of the genuine sleeper hits of 2007.  It is also the movie that marked the final work of the gifted writer/director/co-star Adrienne Shelley who was tragically murdered by a burglar about six months prior to the release of the film.<br /><br />That morbid taint notwithstanding, "Waitress" is a generally amiable comedy that, despite its small town New England setting and naturalistic performances, isn't always as genuine and authentic as it needs to be to be effective.  The scenes between Jenna and her fellow waitresses (Shelley, Cheryl Hines) do have the ring of "girl talk" truth about them, but those involving Jenna and the dreamy young pediatrician who's just set up his practice in town come across as pure Hollywood contrivance and hokum.<br /><br />Russell has warmth and appeal as the deeply unhappy and conflicted Jenna, and she receives excellent support from Shelley and Hines as her encouraging and understanding co-workers and friends.  Nathan Fillion, however, makes for a rather bland love interest as the gallant and gorgeous - albeit married - Doctor Pomatter, while the truly talented Jeremy Sisto ("Six Feet Under") struggles under the weight of a poorly written part as Jenna`s irredeemably smarmy and churlish husband - a character that's at least a half a dozen shades too dark for a comedy as innocuous and lighthearted in tone as this one is.  In fact, one of the major weaknesses in the script is its insistence on seeing its main male characters in two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional terms.  Of the actors, though, it is the venerable Andy Griffith who steals every scene he's in as the crusty but wise owner of the diner who sets Jenna straight on a thing or two regarding how she`s choosing to live her life.<br /><br />There's a nice fairy tale ending to leave you feeling uplifted and good about life - which is just about all one really asks for from a film such as this one, I guess.<br /><br />Be forewarned, however:  this movie is not recommended for anyone who is on a strict diet or who is in any way serious about reducing calories.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Jenna (Keri Russell), a waitress at a small town pie shop in the Deep South, is married to the worst guy in the world, Earl (Jeremy Sisto). To her dismay, she learns she is pregnant, the one time in recent history that she got drunk and had sex with her husband. Her only friends are the other two waitresses at the shop. Becky (Cheryl Hines, TV's "Curb Your Enthusiasm"), a talkative woman married to a paraplegic, older man is the most demonstrative. She loves the guy, but she needs the affection of a man and has affairs. Dawn (the film's writer/ director Adrienne Shelly), is a shy woman who has been on one bad date too many. Together, these women give each other love and support and help each other through their problems. Jenna is also the baker, making the pies the shop sells. She has always had a knack for creating unusual, delicious pies. As she deals with the many problems in her life, she creates new pies, making them before our eyes, naming them after the troubles she has. Jenna is the only one of the three waitresses who will wait on Old Joe (Andy Griffith), the exacting owner of the pie shop. He comes in every day and places a meticulous order that he expects to be filled exactly as requested. He dictates when he wants his water and his orange juice and if something isn't right, he sends it back. After she learns she is pregnant, Jenna goes to her doctor and finds a new doctor; Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion, TV's "Drive" and "Firefly") has taken over the practice. Dr. Pomatter has problems of his own and becomes attracted to Jenna.<br /><br />Written and directed by Adrienne Shelly, "Waitress" is a nice, pleasant little film. It is, perhaps, a bit too `corn pone' at times, too much so for its own good. But it is a pleasant enough little film to help while away a few hours.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Shelly, a veteran of many independent films, was murdered a few months before the film premiered at Sundance. And this has become the main talking point of the film. This sad event has little bearing on the film, or it's quality.<br /><br />"Waitress" aims for a folksy-type of quality with a dash of modern day fairy tale thrown in. Keri Russell is very good and very believable as Jenna. Every moment she is on screen, we get little bits of her pain, her desperation, her escape through baking, her interest in the awkward Dr. Pomatter and more. It also seems completely natural that she would be the one person who can handle Old Joe. Facing many desperate feelings, she would naturally be kind to just about everyone she meets and Old Joe is no exception.<br /><br />As we watch Jenna bake, Russell shows how she developed through life. She recalls fond memories of baking and singing songs with her mother. She also reverently describes how her mother baked, clearly inheriting the skill. Everyone who tastes one of her pies seems transported by sheer bliss. All of this helps to balance her character and make her more believable.<br /><br />The first time Earl drives up, we get an instant vision of what he is like as a spouse. Driving up to the three waitresses sitting on the stoop of the pie shop, he honks the car's horn consistently. Here I am. Here I am. Look at me. And this serves to make Jenna more human, more interesting and more complex. She is trapped in her relationship with needy Earl and can't get out. During their conversations, he consistently reminds her that he "put the roof over her head"; he "provides everything for her." They are really co-dependent on each other.

Constantly in need of assurance, reassurance and encouragement, he doesn't want Jenna to do anything that would take her out of his control for long. She receives phone calls at work from her husband in which he needs to hear how much she loves him. When they are together, he threatens to force her to stay at home and quit her job.

To her dismay, she learns she is pregnant, the one time in recent history that she got drunk and had sex with her husband. Her only friends are the other two waitresses at the shop. Becky (Cheryl Hines, TV's "Curb Your Enthusiasm"), a talkative woman married to a paraplegic, older man is the most demonstrative. She loves the guy, but she needs the affection of a man and has affairs. Dawn (the film's writer/ director Adrienne Shelly), is a shy woman who has been on one bad date too many. Together, these women give each other love and support and help each other through their problems. Jenna is also the baker, making the pies the shop sells. She has always had a knack for creating unusual, delicious pies. As she deals with the many problems in her life, she creates new pies, making them before our eyes, naming them after the troubles she has. Jenna is the only one of the three waitresses who will wait on Old Joe (Andy Griffith), the exacting owner of the pie shop. He comes in every day and places a meticulous order that he expects to be filled exactly as requested. He dictates when he wants his water and his orange juice and if something isn't right, he sends it back. After she learns she is pregnant, Jenna goes to her doctor and finds a new doctor; Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion, TV's "Drive" and "Firefly") has taken over the practice. Dr. Pomatter has problems of his own and becomes attracted to Jenna.<br /><br />Written and directed by Adrienne Shelly, "Waitress" is a nice, pleasant little film. It is, perhaps, a bit too `corn pone' at times, too much so for its own good. But it is a pleasant enough little film to help while away a few hours.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Shelly, a veteran of many independent films, was murdered a few months before the film premiered at Sundance. And this has become the main talking point of the film. This sad event has little bearing on the film, or it's quality.<br /><br />"Waitress" aims for a folksy-type of quality with a dash of modern day fairy tale thrown in. Keri Russell is very good and very believable as Jenna. Every moment she is on screen, we get little bits of her pain, her desperation, her escape through baking, her interest in the awkward Dr. Pomatter and more. It also seems completely natural that she would be the one person who can handle Old Joe. Facing many desperate feelings, she would naturally be kind to just about everyone she meets and Old Joe is no exception.<br /><br />As we watch Jenna bake, Russell shows how she developed through life. She recalls fond memories of baking and singing songs with her mother. She also reverently describes how her mother baked, clearly inheriting the skill. Everyone who tastes one of her pies seems transported by sheer bliss. All of this helps to balance her character and make her more believable.<br /><br />The first time Earl drives up, we get an instant vision of what he is like as a spouse. Driving up to the three waitresses sitting on the stoop of the pie shop, he honks the car's horn consistently. Here I am. Here I am. Look at me. And this serves to make Jenna more human, more interesting and more complex. She is trapped in her relationship with needy Earl and can't get out. During their conversations, he consistently reminds her that he "put the roof over her head"; he "provides everything for her." They are really co-dependent on each other. It is a sad relationship, but we see why she would believe this and why she would feel trapped.<br /><br />Jeremy Sisto (HBO's "Six Feet Under", TV's "Kidnapped") plays Earl, Jenna's needy, controlling husband.

Kerri Russell will probably forever be tagged as TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006J28DM">Felicity - Senior Year Collection (The Complete Fourth Season)</a>.  As Jenna, she turns in a comic & varied performance that bounces between joy & despair, submissiveness & assertiveness.  Under director Adreienne Shelly's deft touch, the film handles the subject of domestic abuse with sensitivity and caring.<br /><br />Jeremy Sisto who will probably be remembered for his appearances on TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R4SWM">Six Feet Under - The Complete Third Season</a> plays Jenna's controlling husband Earl.  I kept flashing on the Dixie Chicks' song, but it was never used in the film that has a great musical selections.  Sisto plays the role as a bruiser, but also with levels of dependency and desperation.  His selfish nature only buys into Jenna's pregnancy when she promises not to love the baby more than she loves him.  As she promises, the irony is that she does not love him at all and lives in complete fear.  Each time he grabs the money she makes from her, pulls up and demands that she meet his needs, as an audience we cringe.<br /><br />As I watched the movie, I did not know that the waitress Dawn was also the film's director or that she was murdered before the film's release.  These real-life events give the film a haunting feel.  Shelly's performance is affecting as the girl who wants love so badly that she sets up five-minute dates so she won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Nathan Fillion who was in "Slither" and six episodes of the TV series "Drive" this year plays Dr. Pomatter who finds himself irresistibly attracted to Jenna.  The sparks that fly between the two put a smile on our face, despite the fact that we are watching two married people carry on an affair.  Again, Shelly's touch is magical as a subject that should not be funny or romantic is given such a human face that we find ourselves drawn into their world.<br /><br />Cheryl Hines from the film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRR32O">Cake</a> & TV's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" plays the third waitress, Becky.  She has one of those amazing smiles and embraces the character lovingly.  The theme of an affair is repeated again as we find that Becky cares for a disabled spouse and finds a little secret joy.<br /><br />North Carolina favorite Andy Griffith plays Old Joe who owns the pie shop.  His banter with Jenna shows a crusty old geezer who observantly dispenses advice.  It is an excellent cameo that could provide a sentimental dark horse Oscar nomination.  Lew Temple who was in "Domino" plays the diner manager Cal who badgers the waitresses every time they head to the bathroom to discuss matters.  Shelly gives him some touching levels as we see the scene where he dispenses his philosophy of life to Jenna.  Eddie Jemison who has been in all the Ocean's films (11, 12 & 13) almost steals the show as the oddball romancer Ogie whose on-the-spot poetry is hysterically touching and awful at the same time.  Shelly's screenplay reveals so many levels for each of the characters that we feel like we have been dropped into their real-world universe.  This excellent small-budget film deserves great rewards at the box office.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Towards the end of Adrienne Shelley's poignant "Waitress" there is a scene involving a very pregnant Jenna ( a luminous Kari Russell) and Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion) in which, as described by Jenna in voice-over, Pomatter embraces Jenna for 20 minutes with warmth, caring and empathy and more importantly for Jenna without a hint of lust. It's the kind of embrace that an intimate friend would give you: an embrace of platonic love, an embrace of understanding and commiseration. It is also an embrace which pretty much encapsulates all that is good and real about "Waitress": a film that is ultimately about hope and love and the redemptive properties of Pie.<br />Though often bordering on the sitcomishness of "Alice," Adrienne Shelley's ("Trust") "Waitress" manages for the most part to get at the heart of its concerns with humor and a good hearted wistfulness that never turns sour or maudlin: terms that can also be applied to Kari Russell's career making performance as Jenna.<br />"Waitress" is sly, smart and level headed. It is not always driven by anything resembling common sense but instead by those things that cling closer to the human heart like understanding and a very basic and profound humanity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Waitress is surprisingly funny, charming, delicious, and even moving at times. It's about a depressed, discontended waitress named Jenna(Keri Russell) dealing with her daily mundane job at pie shop and her abusive husband, and how she faces new challenges and a romance with a married doctor when she unintentionally became pregnant. Jenna is very unhappy woman and a very good baker. She plans to secretly save up enough money and enter a national pie baking contest and run away from her nasty husband. Her two coworkers at the pie shop are good friends and supportive to her, and they also have their share of unhappy romanctic encounters. Jenna's life becomes more chaotic when she has an affair with the local doctor whom she thought might actually be an ideal future husband material, but nothing is what it it seems sometimes. Jenna befriends her regular customer Old Joe(Andy Griffith) who is also the shop owner, and eventually this wise old man becomes her advisor when things get ugly at home with her husband. Will Jenna stay home after giving birth to the baby, and continue to be miserable? Or will she run away with the doctor and start a new life? Or does she have other options....?<br /><br />This is a very charming film and the characters have plenty of funny moments to work with. It's highly entertaining and I was very taken by Keri Russel's performances. The supporting cast all turned in strong performances. I thought the Adrianne Shelly who played the fellow waitress and her funny boyfriend had the funniest moment in the movie. The ending was kind of predictable but I also thought it had built up for the audiences to expect to see a second ending which I won't reveal.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This movie almost remind me of the TV sitcom Alice: set in a small, out-of-the-way diner run by a cranky head cook with a heart of gold, and staffed by a trio of waitresses, the brash Blondie Southern one, the child-like and naive one, and the level-headed single mom (or mom-to-be, in this case), along with the typical assortment of wacky and colorful customers. Writer/director Adrienne Shelly manages to take this template and make something wonderful from it, however.  Far from being a mere remake of Alice, Waitress is a well-conceived and well-executed exploration of one woman's fight to come into her own and realize her dreams, despite the bad choices and wrong decisions she's made along the way that weigh her down.<br /><br />What truly sets this movie apart from most other big-screen fare is the script. The dialogue, written by Adrienne Shelly - who also directed and co-stars as Dawn, the mousy waitress who eventually finds true love - sparkles with wit, charm and humor. It's fast and it's funny, but it always feels totally natural, due in no small part, of course, to the talents of the actors and actresses charged with delivering it. Unlike the writing in, say, Gilmore Girls, widely praised for it's unique character, the dialogue in Waitress never seems forced or unnatural. It's brilliant without being obtrusive.<br /><br />My only downsize to this film is the fact that the "men are dogs" message is a little heavy-handed. Without exception, all the male characters in Waitress are presented as either mean, like Earl (Jeremy Sisto), unprincipled, like Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), or just plain weird, like Ogie(Eddie Jemison's). Even Joe (Andy Griffith), who turns out to be truly kind and caring, is shown throughout most of the film to be abrasive and demanding, to the point that long-suffering Jenna is the only person who can deal with him and is truly his only friend. This is obviously a film made by a woman, primarily for a female audience, but one can't help but think that if a man made a film in which all the female characters were nothing but gold-digging, abusive, sluts, there would be a serious, if well-deserved, backlash.<br /><br />Waitress is a good movie that is well worth seeing. It's tragic that Shelly, who was brutally murdered in November 2006, won't be making any further films, as this movie will no doubt bring awareness of the writer/director's impressive talents to a much wider audience than ever before. Fortunately, Waitress is a fitting memorial by which to be remembered.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>On the surface WAITRESS is a simple, honest, unpretentious, funny, tender, and sensitive film about simple people in a small Southern town: it is the core of the film, the examination of individual's choices, consequences, rights, and fraternity that makes the little Indie so special.  And another feature that adds a dimension of significance to the movie is that actress/writer/director Adrienne Shelly did not live to see the magic she created: Shelly was murdered in November 2006, a loss of a superb budding talent.<br /><br />Using a very small cast of characters WAITRESS takes place in a Pie Diner, owned by the crusty and demanding Old Joe (Andy Griffith), managed by the grumpy Cal (Lew Temple), and run by three waitresses - frumpy little Dawn (Adrienne Shelly) looking for love, been-there-done-that Becky (Cheryl Hines) whose married to a drooling waste, and Jenna (Keri Russell), an unhappily married (to Earl - Jeremy Sisto) pie maker expert who longs to leave her marriage but has just discovered she is pregnant.  She comes under the care of the OB-GYN Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion - also married) and in the course of her care the two fall in love.  How Jenna manages to cope with the disruptive pregnancy and the other waitresses deal with their simple lives is the crux of the story.  And while this simple plot lone doesn't appear to offer much, the manner in which it is written and acted makes is a little jewel.<br /><br />Many are touting the emergence of Keri Russell as a serious actress as the reason for seeing this film, but the real genius behind the honest simplicity of the story is the sadly deceased Adrienne Shelly.  She will be missed.  In a series of fitting homages the featurettes add to the DVD version of this film. Grady Harp, November 07</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>It's hard not to resist the obvious metaphor that Adrienne Shelly's final work `Waitress' is a wonderful slice of life, but a film this rich deserves more than banal clich&eacute;s.  Nevertheless, the film is very satisfying from start to finish and is a must for anyone who wants to commiserate (soothing ginger pie) over the wounds of misogyny in an understandably jaded feminine existence.  Much like `Volver' in the sense that it is mainly a women's affair, the film has a power to satisfy anyone with a palette for well-made movies that are cleverly told and leave a lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />`The Waitress' is about, well.., a waitress.  Jenna (played true-to-life by Keri Russell, brimming with a wide range of emotion), has one passion in life:  making her pies.  With great pride she presents a host of different sweetmeats, each with its own distinctive ingredients and descriptive titles to mirror life.  Her great ambition is to enter her works in a "United States Pie" contest; one that would sustain her enough to get out from under her shackling existence with louse-spouse husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto).  His insecurity manifests itself by cueing his reluctant wife to say and confess things she doesn't mean, and by jealously guarding money that may buy out aspects of independence in her existence.  (Their heated, one-way arguments set up for unseasoned rhubarb pie.)  Add to that the ingredient of an unwanted pregnancy, and we're set up with an intent attention to the details of Jenna's story.<br /><br />Most of the focus is at Joe's Pie Diner, the main outlet for her passion.  Here she finds friendship with two fellow waitresses who are looking for respite and romance in their own lives.  Becky (Shelly) finds sparks by answering personals ads; while spirited Dawn (Cheryl Hines) finds a side dish while caring for an invalid husband.  All their lives overlap one another, even with growling cook/manager, Cal, who barks out orders with unrelenting grouchiness.  They all share about the same misery and rejuvenation (including "Falling in love [Mousse] pie").  For all her trouble, Jenna gets some just desserts in her own life.  First of all, she musters up some sweetness for elderly diner owner, Joe (Andy Griffith), who can on a turn be scathingly ornery or genuinely sweet.  Next in line, is her obstetrician Dr. Jim Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), whom she resentfully notes has replaced her familiar female doctor.  He's from Connecticut and is in some ways out of place in their deep Southern community.  Nevertheless, he manages to tear down her jaundiced demeanor and provide a slice of sweet (potato) pie.<br /><br />The extra ingredients make 'The Waitress' special.  The sensual construction of fast-lapsed pies with Jenna's own narration is well-crafted, and the music makes each scene a symphony.  Earl brings foreboding music with jaggedly edited scenes.  Jenna and Jim provide classical music one notch lower than Tchycovsky's `Romeo and Juliet,' complete with spinning camera angles, and a fussy little toddler in the diner inspires the horror of Wagner.  Topped off with some great dialogue, including narrated letters to her unborn baby that work like an unbosoming soliloquy, and we have a movie of distinct perfection.<br /><br />(`The Waitress' reminded me of loose associations to other movies, including `Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RO8">Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</a> and `Terms of Endearment,'<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000055ZF6">Terms of Endearment</a> but these are only hints for the distinctive flavor of this movie.  Noting the nature of Adrienne Shelly`s tragic death, misfortune played an even worse role in her own life. )</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>The movie tells the story of Jenna (Keri Russell), a waitress of a dinner, Keri Russell, who is married to a good for nothing man, Earl, who doesn't treat her very well and takes all the money she earns. He is also abusive and controlling. She finds herself pregnant, a fact she is not very happy about. I guess she fears she may not be a good mother and that it is not fair to any kid to have a father like Earl, who made her promise that she would not love a baby more than him. A new gynecologist, Jim, is treating her and they start an affair. One catch, he is married and so is she.<br /><br />Russell's character makes really good, should-be-in-an-award-show-pies. She uses the pies to express how she feels at the moment and the events that are happening in her life.<br /><br />Russell's character wants to escape from her marriage and start anew.<br /><br />There is something about this movie that made me not like it very much: the over-the-top acting, the dialogue and the characters themselves. The movie was unconvincing, the dialogue was unrealistic and the acting wasn't great. The film, and the actors, seemed jaded, emotionally stunted and this caused the plot to not carry out well. Maybe that was the point of the movie, how to draw the emotionally stunted Jenna out of her life and have her start anew.<br /><br />Basically, the movie reminds me of the literary genre of magical realism in that it uses certain objects, events and people in an exaggerated manner. The pies, which are Jenna's outlet, her way of expressing her emotions in a tangible way, become an integral part of the story. We are told, if it was not obvious before, what Jenna is thinking and feeling. Thus, in a way the pies are an extension of Russell's character.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Waitress tells the story of Jenna Hunterson (Keri Russell) who works at a pie diner.

It's pathetic.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I remember hearing good things about this 2007 film.  I also remember hearing about the violent murder of its writer/director Adrienne Shelly in her Greenwich Village office shortly before the film was released.  Knowing this, watching this film had a bittersweet sadness about it.  The word "bittersweet" is a good word to describe the film as well.  It's actually tagged a "comedy/drama/romance" and that it is, although the comedy part is not "laugh out loud" but the "chuckle" kind that lifts the drama above the plight which the heroine is experiencing.  This independent film defies categorization and has won quite a few awards.<br /><br />The heroine, Jenna, is played by Keri Russell.  She's a young woman with a gentle disposition who works as in a small town southern diner as waitress and is married to a bully of a husband.  She's unhappy in her marriage and becomes even more unhappy when she becomes pregnant.  Her women friends at the diner sympathize with her and add a little humor to the situation.  Dawn (played by the director/writer herself, Adrienne Shelly), is shy and unattractive until she meets a man who adores her and constantly writes bad poetry to honor her.  Another fellow waitress, Becky, is married to an invalid husband and is driven to an affair with her sour faced boss.  A theme of the film is that Jenna is an expert pie-maker and specializes in mixing unusual ingredients with a delicious result.  This is also the theme of the film. And it works beautifully.<br /><br />When Jenna goes to the doctor regarding her pregnancy, she discovers that her female gynecologist has retired and that a young attractive male doctor has taken her place.  There's immediate chemistry between Jenna and the doctor and soon they are embraced in a hot romance of their own.  He's married too and they are both confused about this but can't seem to stop.  In the meantime Jenna is getting more and more pregnant and her husband comes across as more and more of a brute. The owner of the diner is played by Andy Griffin.  He gives a fine performance as the elderly gentleman who eats breakfast at the diner each morning and gives very demanding orders to the waitresses.  He soon befriends the unhappy Jenna and even finds out about her affair.<br /><br />How this all plays out is a masterpiece of writing.  None of it seems contrived the pacing of the film makes it flow.  There wasn't one moment that I was bored, which is very unusual for me, especially in a "comedy".<br /><br />Needless to say, there is a happy ending and I was smiling at the end of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This bittersweet comedy will certainly make you hungry...the pies looked delicious.

When she discovers she's pregnant all her dreams feel crushed, until she falls in love with the town's new doctor.

I think co-star Cheryl Hines says it best in the featurette: Shelly's tragic and senseless death compels you to watch the movie through a different prism.<br /><br />I was surprised that Keri Russell wasn't nominated for any best actress awards.  I thought she was outstanding.  She's in every scene.  Her performance carries the movie.  It's really a series of interactions between she and husband Earl (a wonderfully unlikable Jeremy Sisto), she and customer/owner Old Joe (a dyspeptic Andy Griffith) and she and physician/suitor Dr. Pomatter.  In particular, the relationship between Russell's Jenna and Nathan Fillion's Pomatter is very well-played, both by the actors themselves and from Shelly's strong writing and direction.  She will be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I absolutely loved this film. The late Adrienne Shelly left this fine film as a legacy to be cherished. Can't say much that hasn't been said, but the concerns of impending motherhood have been as well expressed here as in any I've seen.  Keri Russell is luminous, a complete performance. Jeremy Sisto is fine as the macho redneck jerk husband; Cheryl Hines and Ms. Shelly herself provide fine support as her buddies. I really liked Andy Griffith, but who doesn't? Nathan Fillion was remarkable as the nervous new doctor who has the best connection with our unfortunate heroine;  the final scenes of the film are worthy of cheer. A true, feel-good film. Ms. Shelly will be missed. Her murder, when she caught an illegal Ecuadoran robber in her home, holds another argument: Why? And why was he here in the first place? The DVD I watched has lots of extras, including footage of Ms. Shelly and interviews & comments from the stars. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>This agreeably idiosyncratic 2007 dramedy has plenty to offer and includes some great moments of warmth and humor, but its eccentricities sometimes threaten to overwhelm the quiet, slightly fantastical story at the heart of the film. Fortunately, actress Adrienne Shelly shows a supple dexterity in balancing all the off-kilter elements since she wrote and directed the film. Sadly, this would also be her last film as she was murdered shortly before its debut at this year's Sundance Festival. I was previously not familiar with Shelly's work either before or behind the camera, but the uniquely fresh perspective on display here makes her loss as a filmmaking creative force feel all the more tragic.<br /><br />The plot concerns the travails of Jenna, a waitress at Joe's Pie Diner. Stuck in a loveless marriage to an abusive, childish man named Earl, she finds herself unhappily pregnant with his child and dreams of escaping her dreary life. Since her accumulated tip money is not nearly enough for her to leave, Jenna wants to enter a local pie-making contest with a grand prize of $25,000. At the diner, she shows a unique talent for creating unusual pies, and inspired by the events in her life, she makes and names a new one every day. Her best friends are the two other waitresses at the diner - sassy, breast-imbalanced Becky and vacuous, pasty-skinned Dawn, which makes the set-up feel like Martin Scorsese's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RO8">Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</a> (or more accurately the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EU1QBS">sitcom</a> it spawned). There is even a character named old Joe, the bromide-spouting owner of the diner dispensing nuggets of unsolicited advice to Jenna. Further complicating matters is the town's new gynecologist, the befuddled and sensitive Dr. Pomatter, and what happens after he and Jenna meet becomes inevitable.<br /><br />The story doesn't take many surprising turns, especially when it is clear from the outset that we are following Jenna's bumptious journey toward self-fulfillment. However, what Shelly does extremely well is add her own sense of local color and realistic character development to the potentially clich&eacute;-ridden situation. The result is often funny, sometimes poignant and at certain points, intentionally absurd. With her porcelain doll looks and previously passive demeanor, Keri Russell would seem like a shallow choice to play Jenna, but she surprises by giving a fully dimensional and affecting performance. Her best scenes are early on as her quietly desperate situation is being established. The other actors provide solid support. Nathan Fillion provides a nicely disheveled charm to the smitten Pomatter, although his character is developed more as a fantasy figure. More interesting is Jeremy Sisto as Earl, who is at turns, dangerous and pathetically needy. Sisto plays him with such simmering menace that it's hard to believe the actor played Jesus in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573629235">1999 miniseries</a> (featuring Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene!).<br /><br />Playing the saucy "Flo"-type waitress, Cheryl Hines provides expert comic support as Becky, while Shelly herself plays Dawn with quirky, bespectacled vulnerability. As old Joe, Andy Griffith shows up periodically to comment on what's going on. The film's atmospheric elements are first-rate starting with Matthew Irving's cinematography (the brightly colored finale has a fairytale feeling thanks to his expert camerawork) and a clever soundtrack sweetened by a lullaby written by Andrew Hollander and Shelly. The 2007 DVD comes with a standard set of extras including an informative commentary track by Russell and producer Michael Roiff. The ten-minute making-of featurette, "This is How We Made Waitress Pie", is mainly a series of on-set clips and interviews that look directed toward a press junket. There is a brief memorial tribute of sorts to Shelly, though the treatment feels cursory and elusive given the graphic circumstances of her death. Rounding out the extras are a profile on Russell's approach to the role of Jenna and a more superficial featurette about everyone's favorite pies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Hilarious dry, wry comedy with some laugh-out-loud moments.

The makers have managed to salvage the joy possible in even the worst of situations. A very reassuring feeling. You can't help but like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>I'm not one really all into so-called chick flicks,but this one was cool!!! I guess It was really the great storyline and ensemble of great acting talent especially Keri Russell,Cheryl Hines,Jeremy Sisto and the one and only Andy Griffith. The sad thing is the director Adrienne Shelly(who also has a supporting role in the film) was murdered in real life,her career was cut way to short.This DVD includes some great extras,especially the Memorial Featurette to director Shelly. A great "slice of pie" comedy!!! Recommended A+</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>As I've said before, I'm usually not a chick-flick guy. I'm more into horror, gore, and sick twisted comedy, but I watched this with my mom once, and it was pretty good. It has a lot of funny scenes and funny dialogue. It even has the legendary Andy Griffith in it. Jenna's husband Earl reminds me of Ronnie White from Rob Zombie's Halloween, and Doyle from Sling Blade. So, if you are a fan of comedy, pies, abuse, and Andy Griffith, then you'll love WAITRESS!</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>When the film opens, the waitress in question, Jenna, finds out she is pregnant and is telling her waitress friends.  The way they go back and forth with wit, humor, and a little bit of insight is like a play.  Adrienne Shelley's script is brilliant from start to finish.<br /><br />But don't let the DVD cover fool you.  This is not your typical romantic comedy/drama.  The cover might overplay the romance a little bit.  The film is about what it takes for one person to gather up the courage to disover what she wants in her life, instead of letting others do it for her.<br /><br />Jenna is faced with an abusive relationship with her husband, Earl, who makes Jenna promise that she love him more than the baby.  She also has an affair with her quirky doctor, who himself is married.  While trying to figure out what to do with these relationships, she gains a certain amount of respect from old Joe, the owner of the diner where she works, played brilliantly by Andy Griffith.  Throughout the film, he gives Jenna advice and undeniable truths she has to face, even though she wants to hear none of it.<br /><br />The winning script makes this film worth watching.  It's a feel good movie that doesn't slip into the pitfalls of the romantic comedy genre and has a rather unique uplifting conclusion.  Little touches like how each pie Jenna creates seems to be inspired by the moments in her life make the film special.  It's definitely one of the better films of 2007.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>Much has been made of the tragic and untimely death of actress and filmmaker Adrienne Shelley. Unfortunately, the publicity of her demise made me want to avoid this movie when it hit the theaters, fearing the sorrow of her circumstance would cloud this movie for me. Sounds illogical now, but then, it made sense. However, months after leaving the theater, and me popping this DVD into my player, time has shown her last movie "Waitress" to be an unusual movie in so many ways.<br /><br />Keri Russell, hair and all, stars in this movie about being trapped in life circumstances, and how getting out of that trap isn't so easy. Keri plays the titular Jenna, a woman trapped in a dead end marriage only to find out she's pregnant after a night of alcoholic drudgery with her own husband. Her only talent, and a very marketable one at that, is making pies, which helps her narrate this charming feature. It's Jenna's sometimes off decision making ability that drive this picture. Will she escape her horrid husband to a better life? Will she give up the baby once she has it? Will she go out of her mind?<br /><br />Russell's Jenna is extremely funny and tragic. You can tell how easy it is for a beautiful girl to make a wrong decision or two, and end up as a waitress in a pie diner in the south. It's happened to her two friends, Becky and Dawn, each who wrestle with their own unusual demons in the story. Shelley's script is wise to never allowing this film to become anything sentimental, which may have allowed the film to sap into a Hallmark special all too easily. Jenna's hatred of her pregnancy is funny and understandable.<br /><br />Rarely do films surprise me, genuinely, but I was surprised at the end of the movie, which I shall not divulge here. Shelley saved us a couple of things for the ending that both make sense and bring a sense of joy to the movie that is unsurpassed. When Jenna walks away from the diner (no spoilers here!), you are walking with her, reveling that she has finally made some good decisions after all.<br /><br />It's too bad that Shelley didn't live to see the acclaim this movie earned. It's too bad that this creative filmmaker's voice was silenced by a heinous act. But the movie Waitress is a joyous act, and a fitting tribute to women everywhere who, like Jenna, must find their ways out of their own lives, into the life of possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Waitress is a story of a small town waitress, Jenna (Keri Russell), with a knack for creating fantastic tasty pies.  She works in a diner with two waitress friends, has a childish, jealous, self-centered husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto), and a dream to win a $25,000 pie baking contest, open her own pie shop and change her unfulfilling life.<br /><br />The beginning scene shows Jenna taking a pregnancy test that shows positive.  She is now facing having an unplanned child as she was also planning on leaving her abusive husband.  She then bakes "I Don't Want an Earl's Baby Pie - a quiche of egg and cheese with a smoked ham center.<br /><br />When she visits her OB-GYN she finds she is replaced by a young, somewhat disorganized newcomer to town.  He is handsome but married.  Jenna and the new Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion) are attracted to each other and soon start a relationship that opens Jenna up to other possibilities in life.  She can make her own decisions in life.<br /><br />Several pies are concocted in Jenna's mind at critical moments in her life.  Interludes during the film show a pie being made as Jenna narrates the ingredients.<br /><br />The film finds flavor with Jenna's quick-tongued fellow waitresses along with classic television star Andy Griffith who plays Joe, the wise owner of the diner.  There is delicious drama during the fun, and although adultery is conducted as a sidebar, it looks like the characters just want a piece of happiness in their small quiet lives.<br /><br />Overall Waitress is an optimistic entertaining comedy and a story of dream fulfillment.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>There is just something about this film, WAITRESS, something indefinable that I can't quite put my finger on.  WAITRESS is a surprisingly delightful film, and my husband and I really enjoyed watching it.  This is definitely a great "snuggle on the couch together" movie.<br /><br />WAITRESS is the story of Jenna, a waitress in a small southern pie shop in a small southern town.  Jenna invents and bakes delicious, original pies (for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert), all with crazy names, like I Hate My Husband Pie, Earl Murders Me Because I'm Having An Affair Pie, Marshmallow Mermaid Pie (invented when she was 10), Bad Baby Pie, and Falling in Love Pie, all which reflect what is happening in her life at that moment.  Jenna is unhappy in her marriage to her abusive husband Earl, and has discovered she's pregnant. Things get complicated and heated and even funny when she falls for her new doctor and he falls for her.<br /><br />WAITRESS is charming and poignant; it runs a gamut of emotions.  It is a relaxed, lazy film that slowly unfolds as layers of taste, texture, and intrigue are added.  Kerry Russell shines as Jenna, breathing life and love into the character.  Nathan Fillion is enchanting as Dr. Pomatter, her quirky, loveable doctor, bringing more than his typical charming self to this role.  The other cast members, including writer-director Adrienne Shelly, bring realism and warmth to WAITRESS.  And the cherry on the top of this scrumptious pie is Andy Griffith as Joe, the curmudgeonly owner of the pie shop, who grudgingly dispenses advice, wisdom, and poetry, but is really an old cream puff deep down.  Joe has a true affection and respect for Jenna, and he does what he can to help her overcome her lot in life.<br /><br />Sweet, fun, touching, and vibrant, WAITRESS is an unexpected movie that draws the audience in from beginning to end.  You care about these characters and want what is best for them.  And what is best may surprise you.  WAITRESS is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Waitress starring Keri Russell isn't a winning dark comedy but I like how imperfect the lives of these characters are. This film is kind of choppy but thanks to Russell's delicate but fearless performance - she is the saving grace here. Adrienne Shelley wrote, directed, and co-stars in this romantic comedy, she is so believable and real - she was murdered before the film was released. Russell plays Jenna, a waitress who has a jealous and cruel husband. She ends up pregnant and starts an affair with her doctor played by cutie Nathan Fillon, and oh yeah Jenna loves to create unique and delicious pies. Whenever Jenna feels overwhelmed - baking pies is her salvation. It's a strange little film but the ending is sweet so give this indie sleeper a viewing, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>I loved this movie. I really loved this movie. In Waitress, Keri Russell plays Jenna, a small-town Southern woman stuck in a loveless marriage. Her control-freak husband won't buy her a car (he doesn't want her to go anywhere), and he systematically collects her paycheck and tips each week so she won't have enough money to leave him.<br /><br />In addition to waiting tables at Joe's Pie Shop, Jenna creates a daily special pie. All of her pies are delicious (her co-workers call her a "pie genius"), and they all have quirky names like "Spanish Dancer Pie," "Bad Baby Pie," and "Kick in the Pants Pie." Jenna loves making pies, and it's her dream to attend a pie cook-off and take first prize.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, Jenna learns that she's pregnant. And though she's keeping the baby, she's pretty miserable about it. When she goes in to her obgyn to confirm the news, she discovers that her staid old doctor has been replaced. Her new doctor is a young, hot, GUY. Dr. Pomatter (played adorably by Nathan Fillion) is immediately attracted to Jenna, and before long, the two are enjoying a torrid affair.<br /><br />As her relationship with Dr. Pomatter develops, Jenna begins to understand some things about herself and her life. She realizes that maybe she doesn't have to be stuck with her abusive husband. And that maybe her pie-making isn't just playing, but her own unique form of artistry.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film. Great performances throughout. And though the plot is not an original one, the treatment of it is beautiful. The ending is satisfying, and nearly all the characters are rounded, likable, relatable people. I loved it. Did I mention I loved it?</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>**** 2007. Written and directed by Adrienne Shelly. This motion picture is a very good surprise, it's a slice of Americana that transports us into the lives of three waitresses of the Deep South. The director had undoubtedly a style of her own which gave to this dramatic comedy a special flavour rather unusual in the actual American cinema, so tasteless in my opinion. If the first scenes of WAITRESS may seem a little TV show oriented with an immobile camera and too many witty dialogues per minute, the rest of the film is a little jewel of sensibility confined in a multicoloured box worthy of multiple viewings. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB.html">A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</a><br/><p>I first heard about Waitress due to the tragic murder of its writer / producer Adrienne Shelly shortly before the film was accepted at Sundance (Shelly wrote the script for Waitress while pregnant with her daughter Sophie, who appears in the film).<br /><br />Jenna (Keri Russell) finds out that her uber-controlling husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto) impregnated her after getting her drunk, and she's trapped in a loveless, abusive marriage and a dead-end job as a waitress in a Southern town. Jenna lives to invent pies that incorporate her latest obstacles and triumphs (I Don't Want Earl's Baby Pie, I Hate My Husband Pie, I Can't Have No Affair Because It's Wrong And I Don't Want Earl To Kill Me Pie).<br /><br />Fellow waitresses Dawn (Adrienne Shelly in her final role) and Becky (Cheryl Hines) serve as guardian angels of sorts, providing female companionship and a shoulder to lean on. Both are pursuing love affairs of their own, even as Jenna begins a passionate affair with the new OB, Dr. Pomatter.<br /><br />Diner owner Old Joe (Andy Griffith) is a persnickety customer who's always throwing out over-the-top demands and expecting every wish to be followed, but underneath the gruff exterior hides a heart of gold.<br /><br />The film has almost a fairytale quality due to the bright, primary colors, dream sequences, and yes, a fairy godfather of sorts. It took me a while to get into Waitress, but it was a mouthwatering spectacle that ultimately delights.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Jenna (Keri Russell) would like nothing more than to pack her few belongings and move away. She has never been truly appreciated -- especially by her controlling husband -- despite her talent. Jenna makes pie. And there is an upcoming pie contest with a grand prize that would allow her to finance her escape.<br /><br />Reading and thinking about the synopsis of this movie would probably lead you, as it did me, towards an expectation of a sad movie. But if you watch it, you will find a more uplifting and empowering story about a woman who is finally ready to do things that make her happy.<br /><br />The movie had its rough spots just about any time Jeremy Sisto was on screen. He played the controlling husband and his scenes were hard to watch. I have noticed that there is a distinct category of people who did not like this movie based solely on Sisto's character. I find that unfortunate since there was a very charming story here, but I can appreciate the viewpoint of anyone who fits that category.<br /><br />Waitress was very well written. There were many great lines delivered by various members of the cast, but Andy Griffith stole the show. He played Old Joe, the man who owned the pie diner where Jenna worked. He was a crotchety old man who was nice to no one...except Jenna. He played a valuable role serving as her mentor and conscience and was a key ingredient to my enjoyment of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I didn't expect much from this film from the start as it was a little bit campy at first but it got better as it went along.  The waitress is actually a woman that works at a pie diner who designs the pie of the day which is based on her feelings.  In some ways this part reminded me of "Like Water For Chocolate" where the food takes over people's emotions.<br /><br />The waitress has a very unhappy life, married to an insensitive bore, who sometimes hits her.  She gets pregnant only because he got her drunk one day.  She doesn't want "his" baby but decides to keep it because she doesn't believe in abortion.<br /><br />She goes to her gynocologist and is surprised to find that she has semi-retired and been replaced by a young male doctor.  Eventually the two of them form a liaison which for some reason reminded me of the wierd relationship in the film "The Secretary."<br /><br />Andy Griffith has a fine supporting role as the owner of the diner who nobody likes.<br /><br />The movie was a little slow to begin but by mid-point it draws you in and ends up being pretty good!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Waitress is indeed a frank, touching and sometimes painful look at how life really is for Jenna, a young woman stuck in a loveless marriage to Earl--and pregnant. Jenna has two real friends who waitress with her at the diner, Becky (Cheryl Hines) and Dawn (Adrienne Shelly). The plot moves along at a good pace and the convincing acting impressed me very much.<br /><br />The action begins when Jenna and her friends find out (in the washroom of the diner) that Jenna is pregnant by her "I'm a not so nice guy but I'm also complicated" husband, Earl. Jenna (Keri Russell) is horrified because now she fears it will be next to impossible to escape from her abusive, egotistical, sensitive husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto). Jenna's life becomes far more complicated when she impulsively starts an affair with her gynecologist/obstetrician, Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion).<br /><br />Jenna is only happy when she makes pies or fools around with Dr. Pomatter; and she knows that her life is in trouble. She can't risk Earl finding out about her affair with the doctor--he'll kill them; and she finds escaping from her marriage to Earl ever more difficult. Earl is a needy guy and somewhat vulnerable at heart but he behaves like such a brute that you sympathize with Jenna's desire to leave him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, "Old Joe" (Andy Griffith), the crusty old owner of the diner where Jenna and her friends work, has his own realistic and complicated relationship with Jenna. While on the surface Joe bosses Jenna around and gets ridiculously fussy about his order for lunch, we eventually see a softer side to Joe and a heart of true compassion that is very touching.<br /><br />Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. Will Jenna play it safe and remain miserable in her marriage to Earl? Will Earl ever find out about her affair with her doctor? What about the other two waitresses--Dawn and Becky--how will things go for them? No spoilers here, folks, you'll just have to watch the movie to find out.<br /><br />The cinematography is very well done in the diner scenes; and the choreography works well in the wedding scene, too.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a number of extras. There's a commentary, a look at how they made this film and a touching memorial to Adrienne Shelly who was tragically murdered shortly after the film was finished.<br /><br />Waitress is a very good film. It gives us an honest and refreshing look at life in a way we don't frequently see. We see people making good and bad decisions; and ultimately the film leaves you with an important message about life. I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Can a poor, pregnant Deep South waitress find happiness baking pies while married to a redneck bully and having an affair with her married gynecologist? No. But don't count on an unhappy ending once she leaves her husband, sends her lover back to his wife and then, thanks to a fortuitous death, manages to bake pies to her heart's content, and sell them, too.<br /><br />Waitress is an eccentric and affectionate look at the life and times of Jenna, played with great empathy and charm by Keri Russell. Jenna is a small-town young woman who married her boyfriend, Earl, and now realizes what a jerk he is. She wants out, with a new life and another chance at happiness. What she doesn't want is Earl or, at first, the baby. Getting it on with the new, young doctor perhaps isn't the best idea, but it gives Jenna some joy. About the only people who really appreciate her are her two friends who also wait on tables at the diner, and the old curmudgeon, played by Andy Griffin, who owns the place and wants what he wants when he wants it...namely, a slice of Jenna's special pie, served by Jenna. Jenna's pies really are deliciously unique. Her mamma taught her long ago, and now Jenna works out all her frustrations and love by inventing all sorts of pies. Despite her pies, her life looks increasingly bleak until...well, see the movie or buy the DVD. It's no spoiler to say that this slightly contrived, oddball romantic comedy has a happy ending, and that pies are the reason.<br /><br />The nice things about the movie are Russell's performance, closely followed by Griffin's. The writer/director, Adrienne Shelly, who also plays one of Jenna's waitress pals, gives the movie a kind of goofy cheer. The movie isn't a cartoon, but there is enough cheerful exaggeration that most of the time Waitress comes across as kind of charming.<br /><br />A bit off-putting, however, is the role of Earl. The guy is so down-right mean and selfish that every time he shows up on screen you'll most likely flinch. Jenna's doctor, on the other hand, comes across just as needy as Earl but also weak. If one of Shelly's messages is that a woman who needs to be strong shouldn't get entangled with most men, she gives us some first-class examples. Jenna is going to be a happy woman, we know, because of a generous bequest, her pies and her baby. I'm not sure an adult male now will ever figure in the mix.<br /><br />Waitress is the kind of feel-good movie that many people will fall in love with. I'm not sure how many times someone will want to watch it, but the first time, if you're not in a curmudgeonly mood, should be satisfying.<br /><br />And for those who occasionally think life is a series of random acts of pointlessness, Adrienne Shelly was murdered just as she was finishing the editing of Waitress. She had been in her office and had complained about the noise a worker on the floor above her was making. He came down and killed her.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>This movie was not quite what I expected.<br /><br />I expected a feel-good romp of a movie. Not so much, here. Yes, there are charming and funny Dr. Seussian - type moments. But they just add flavor to the complex characters that populate the film.<br /><br />I appreciated the positive spin on the value of the life of a baby even though it's unwanted. It is referred to as a baby the entire movie. A few characters, all married, dabble in affairs. As disappointed as that made me, I appreciated that most of the characters knew their choices were wrong and hurtful.<br /><br />On a personal note, to give you insight into where I'm coming from, my marriage weathered an affair and I've seen the damage and I've experienced the life-changing damage, so I appreciated that even though the characters chose to go there, the wrongness/pain is acknowledged.<br /><br />Jenna (Keri Russell) is gut-level honest except to her abusive husband. The conflict rips and tears at her. She carries a baby she does not want or love. Pie-making and a handful of equally complex friends save her life.<br /><br />Some scenes are so poignant and/or painful I will remember them for a long time. Others were light-hearted and laugh out loud funny. Together they make a film that reached into my chest and poked at my heart.<br /><br />If you are prone to moments of deep melancholy and expect that Waitress is a fun, simple film -- you might want pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>"Just a pie? It's a thing of beauty," Jenna is told by a regular customer of Joe's Diner when she produces another one of her tasty pies. The same goes for Waitress, the last movie to be written and directed by Adrienne Shelley before her death earlier this year.  When Jenna, a small town waitress unhappily married to the boorish and controlling Earl (Sisto), learns she's pregnant, the last thing she needs is to fall for her handsome gynaecologist Dr. Pomatter (Fillion). But fall in love she does, which, along with Earl's increasingly jealous nature, hampers her dreams of escape. Waitress is one of those films that'll get funnier with every viewing and the extremely quotable dialogue and hilarious character idiosyncrasies all point to the fact that this is a cult classic in-waiting. Russell wins me over very easily. Russell is surrounded by sound character actors whose performances elevate them above mere supporting roles: Fillion can deliver a line, Sisto shows us both sides of a childish husband but it's Matlock's Andy Griffith that's in scene-stealing form as the tell-it-like-it-is, foul-mouthed Southern gent. With dialogue that's witty, sharp and observational without trying too hard to be either, and a love story that's achingly sweet and tender without pandering to cliches.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>A conversation-starter at the Sundance Film Festival and a modest success at the box office, "Waitress" is a small tale about a small woman overcoming great odds.  Writer and director Adrienne Shelly wrote the screenplay for the film whilst pregnant with her first child Sophie and began filming in November of `05.  Principal photography wrapped three days before Christmas, a mere twenty days after it began.  With an overall budget of $2 million and Shelly directing and starring in the film while looking after her infant daughter with her husband Andy, she was a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />Sadly, Shelly would never see the film to its fruition.  Only a year after "Waitress" began filming, she was murdered by a young Ecuadorian immigrant in her Manhattan home, leaving behind Andy, Sophie and a film career that might've been.  She was forty years old.  "Waitress" is Shelly's swan song, a work that would've opened people's eyes to her talents as a screenwriter and a film director.  It is unfortunate that she will only be appreciated now posthumously.<br /><br />The film begins with Jenna Hunterson (Russell) doing what she does best - making pies.  The kitchen is her oasis, a place where her sweet machinations come to life in the form of pies, quiches and tarts.  Her saccharine creations distract from the awful monotony of her life as a waitress at Joe's Pie Diner, not to mention an unwanted pregnancy for which her jerk of a husband Earl (Sisto) is responsible.  After a pregnancy test comes out positive, she makes an appointment with her family doctor only to discover she has left the practice and been replaced by Dr. Jim Pomatter (Fillion).  Unhappily married and unhappily pregnant more so, she begins having an affair with - of all people - her obstetrician.  Dr. Pomatter (whom she insists on calling by his professional name, even while she is sleeping with him) is a nervous and bumbling sweetheart who also happens to be married and he and Jenna literally stumble into love.  No sooner does she realize she's falling in love, Jenna starts pouring her passions into her pies, much in the same way that Tita did in "Like Water For Chocolate" ("Naughty Pumpkin Pie").  All the while, Jenna grows ever larger and tries to plan her escape from Earl's clutches and take her pie-making to the next level while amusing herself with the romantic hang-ups of her co-workers Dawn (Shelly) and Becky (Hines) and putting up with persnickety Joe (Griffith), the diner's aging proprietor.<br /><br />There isn't even one bad performance here, no matter how small the part.  The standouts, of course, are Russell and the seasoned and celebrated Andy Griffith as Joe.  Russell's Jenna is almost a tragic heroine - poor but not broken, she is kind but willful, a seemingly meek woman with an irrepressible spirit.  Russell embodies her character physically and emotionally - her Jenna is heartbreakingly lovely inside and out, a petite beauty who is sad but resolute ("...though she be but little, she is fierce") and has an admirably acidic sense of humor to boot.  Who else's sense of humor can also be admired is Griffith's curmudgeon Joe, one who cackles as he says that he "loves living vicariously through the pain and suffering of others."<br /><br />Sisto's Earl is a possessive jerk, a low-scale tyrant who underneath is incredibly insecure and needs constant reassurance of Jenna's commitment to him. Fillion's awkward Dr. Pomatter is completely endearing and the surrounding cast rounds out the wonderfully entertaining ensemble.  Dry humor is speckled throughout to keep this somewhat trifling tale from getting too sickly sweet, especially after Jenna's first rendezvous with Dr. Pomatter when Joe (Griffith) points out her smeared lipstick and tells her to "wipe away her indiscretions" before serving him breakfast.<br /><br />For a small film, it has big potential.  If you peruse the shelves of Blockbuster as much as I, don't let this fantastic sleeper get lost among the big-budget bull. Rent it and let it wrap you up like a warm blanket.<br /><br />"Gonna make a pie with a heart in the middle..."</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>While the tragic death of writer/director/co-star Adrienne Shelly has given "Waitress" a bittersweet quality, the film deserves to be appreciated on it's own merits, as a terrific romantic comedy/drama.<br /><br />A 'slice-of-life' tale of a waitress at a small-town diner with a gift for pie-making (Keri Russell, in the best performance in her career), the film offers a rich variety of supporting characters, from her quirky-but-lovable fellow waitresses (Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelly), her less-than-lovable husband (Jeremy Sisto, who gets her drunk and pregnant), the gynecologist (Nathan Fillion) who falls for her, and, best of all, the cantankerous yet funny owner of the caf&eacute; (81-year-old Andy Griffith, who DESERVES a 'Supporting Actor' Oscar for this role!)<br /><br />Wickedly funny (Russell's observations on her pregnancy are hilarious, and very true), and unafraid to portray issues like spousal abuse and infidelity, Shelly's script doesn't 'sugarcoat' life in and out of the diner, or ruin the ending by tying up all the romantic 'loose ends' neatly; while the finale is perhaps predictable, it is very satisfying, and will certainly bring a smile!<br /><br />"Waitress" is a film that will brighten your day, and become a welcome addition to your DVD collection...I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>Nathan Fillion (of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AQS0F">Firefly</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHSVN2">Buffy</a> fame) is what drew me to this movie, but it was the creative storytelling and the overall great performance from the cast that made me stay.  From the grumpy old man with a sweet spot in his heart for waitress Jenna, to Jenna's quirky pie-making, to Adrienne Shelley's character Dawn, everything just worked together so well.  While it's not a complex movie (the theme of it is fairly straightforward), the way all the little plots come together makes an aspiring writer like me a little jealous!<br /><br />While "Waitress" is definitely a "feel good movie," it also avoids some of those cliches.  Darker themes are touched on in Jenna's relationship with her husband, but at the same time we never get any of those forced "Lifetime movie" moments.  Instead, we see these characters develop and grow throughout this little movie, giving us a little surprise at every turn.  Nathan Fillion, Keri Russell, and Adrienne Shelley (both as an actor and director) were the best things this movie had going for it, and it overall left me visually and emotionally satisfied.<br /><br />8/10</p></br></body></html>

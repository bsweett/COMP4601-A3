Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>Classic Vegas gangster movie.  Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci almost guarantees that it'll be great - add an Oscar-worthy performance from Sharon Stone and you have one of the greatest mob flicks of all time.  Based on the true story of Sam Rothstein, a great bookie, the story covers his rise and fall in pre-corporate Vegas.  Interesting story, great acting and some classic lines - what more can you ask for?</p></br><a href="../users/A17O7AGDZPOJSS.html">A17O7AGDZPOJSS</a><br/><p>This was a good movie not a great movie<br /><br />If you are a die hard De Niro fan or Pesci then you should get this to add to your collection<br /><br />Most of the movie stays great but some tends to lag on and seems like the movie has some extra scenes that where not needed<br /><br />as far as dramatic scenes go there arre a few and they are the best parts of the movie<br /><br />I would recomend The Goodfellas before this but if your a DE Niro fan like me get this movie</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>Definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films, Casino FINALLY gets it's due. Filmed in Super 35, it's never looked better than here. It's been a long wait from the days of laserdisc and even the original dvd release, but it's been worth it. A film like this has dialogue so crisp you want to read along, but unfortunately it is NOT closed-captioned, only subtitled and SPARSELY at that, not detailed; a minor complaint, but if you want to savor every word spoken, it's a little disappointing. Would love to have had a full-length commentary featuring De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese sitting down to talk through this but the track that is included is still very good. Excellent disc; would have been worth picking up again for the improved film transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/A31D8QKJXU93BT.html">A31D8QKJXU93BT</a><br/><p>Anyone doubting Sharon Stone's acting skills needs to see Martin Scorcese direct her in "Casino," his epic about how the Mafia lost control of gaming in Las Vegas. Although she's had duds in her sporadic career, here she is a revelation, exhibiting a wide range of emotion and nuance unseen before or since. Stone is initially exciting and ultimately moving as the wife of casino czar Robert NeNiro. She certainly deserved the Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations she got.<br /><br />She's never been in headier company. In addition to DeNiro, she holds her own with the brilliant Joe Pesci, James Woods, Kevin Pollak and, in real casting coups, Las Vegas figures Don Rickles, Alan King, Dick Smothers in non-comedic roles and, as themselves, Frankie Avalon, Steve Allen and Jayne Meadows. Stone goes from glamourous hustler, to indulged wife and mother, to pathetic alcoholic and junkie, stealing scenes from the famous names around her. She had it in her or Scorcese drew it out, but who cares? It's stunning work no matter how she achieved it.<br /><br />Stone isn't the whole show. Scorcese moves the movie along with his trademark tracking shots, multiple narrators, intense violence and attention to detail, almost documentary detail on how casinos stack the cards against the suckers at the tables. Corruption thrives at every level as DeNiro tries to play the game, turn legit, marry and raise a family. But the same cards stacked against the suckers are also stacked against him, and his psycho childhood pal (Pecsi) becomes his adult adversary. Oddly, this true story ends badly for everybody but him.<br /><br />"Casino" followed Scorcese's shattering "GoodFellas," also with DeNiro and Pecsi in another true crime classic, maybe his best. But "Casino" has virtures of its own and grabs our lapels throughout. It is engrossing when showing how casinos operate, less so when showing how distrust wrecks a marriage; yet Stone suffuses these scenes with sympathy and pity. Would that other directors would challenge her in mature roles. If I were a gambler, my money would be riding on Sharon Stone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>"Casino" briskly tells of the rise and fall of the stranglehold of organized crime over Las Vegas.  Unfortunately, it's actually two stories that sometimes fail to come together, leaving us befuddled as to each.<br /><br />The star of the show is Deniro, playing Sam "Ace" Rothstein.  Ace is to gambling what Einstein was to physics (he micromeasures each cube of dice), capable of setting the odds for any wager in America.  A man who doesn't know how to lose money, Rothstein is the lone Jew among a sea of Italians - the one man the mob can trust to run its flagship casino in Vegas.  While the leaders of organized crime watch from the distance (they can get no closer to Vegas than a general store in Kansas), Ace keeps the Casino profitable and various operatives skim the profits.  For Rothstein, Vegas is the realization of a dream - a place where his brand of gambling is legal, a moral car wash where his sins are washed away.  Trouble brews on two fronts.  The heads back home send Nicky Santoro, a mob enforcer and an old friend of Rothstein's, to keep things in order.  Played by Joe Pesci, Nicky is a one-man weapon of mass destruction, of voracious greed and infinite violence.  He's the "Conan the Barabarian" of Vegas - and in a city that seems to encourage everything, Santoro soon becomes everybody's enemy.  Vegas and Nicky seem well matched for each other, but soon the two develop a state of warfare against each other and, for his power, Santoro is eventually outmatched.  Rothstein's other thorn is the woman who will become his wife, Sharon Stone as Ginger, a hustler who will eventually steal, then break Rothstein's heart.<br /><br />While Rothstein battles his nearby demons, the mob destroys itself in Vegas, setting itself up for a ludicrous fall.  (Concerned over the diminishing "skim", the captains dispatch their most inept underboss, the man who will ultimately and unwittingly betray their entire operation to the feds.)<br /><br />While an interesting story, "Casino" is seldom a coherent story - it plays like "Goodfellas in Vegas" (complete with high-speed 1970's rock) even though the story often becomes more impersonal than "Goodfellas" was.  The plot never explains how a superlative manager like Ace let fortunes of the Casino dwindle, or why (when he was doing well) the Captains sent Santoro to Vegas at all - a decision which will easily haunt them.  (Santoro is easily more of a hazard than a help.)  Stone and Deniro have no chemistry at all - why Ace throws his heart to a woman who doesn't even like him is never explained, and they spend most of the movie hating each other.  Hurrying to match Ace's story to that of Vegas, the script runs out of steam and takes the easy way out - with a crescendo of violence that does nothing to inform the story we've spent about 3 hours watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FS9R0JXHLHEG.html">A1FS9R0JXHLHEG</a><br/><p>'Casino' is a dominant film which is based on the true story of how Las Vegas was transformed from a simple gambling mecca into a place that has as much personality and colour as Disney World. Robert De Niro stars as a casino owner who is on the ground-level of the city's change. He is a high-class crook who's able to turn profits with the help of the mafia and crooked gaming practices (a norm for all casinos). Joe Pesci is on hand as the mob assassin with the short fuse who is De Niro's right-hand man. However, no one stays on top forever and De Niro's demise is partly due to his ex-prostitute wife (Sharon Stone, in her Oscar-nominated role). Bad decision-making, shady dealings, and questionable alliances will also be key factors in his ultimate downfall. Once again Martin Scorsese has created a film that is so multi-layered and smart that the viewer is completely engrossed for the entire 182 minutes. <p>'Casino' is a crime epic, in close contrast with 'The Godfather' series of films. Scorsese accomplishes what he did with 'Raging Bull' and 'GoodFellas'. Once again De Niro and Pesci shine with his direction and the unrelenting screenplay. Sharon Stone does the best work of her career. She does not necessarily shine brighter than De Niro and Pesci, but she holds her own and never lets either of them steal her thunder and lightning. Another great thing about 'Casino' is the supporting cast: Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, James Woods, and Joe Bob Briggs all add great elements of both comedy and drama to this outstanding winner which has been overlooked on Scorsese's list of credits.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This is Las Vegas mobster film is one of Scorcese's best!!! A three hours, its little on the long side but thats fine, it's such a great film, the three hours are worth it!!! Great performances from Sharon Stone,Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci!!!The huge supporting cast is also incredible!!! Great soundtrack!!!

I am also a fan of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci. The dynamic chemistry between both actors really translated well from "Goodfellas" to "Casino". Martin Scorcese is one of the best film directors in the past couple of decades. "Casino" may not have not been a box office smash for Martin but artistically I thought it was right up his alley. I am not a big fan of Sharon Stone but "Casino" is the only movie that Sharon was able to pull off a convincing film role as the drug addict/prostitute Ginger. Granted that the film is well over two hours, time flies by whenever I watch the movie.  Based on gangster Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal and stylistically modeled after "Wiseguys" and "Goodfellas", "Casino" takes the viewer to the humble beginnings of then booking agent Ace Rosenthal who eventually rises through the ranks in the world of gangsters and soon becomes the operational manager of a Las Vegas casino. The film is narrated by both DeNiro and Pesci ala "Goodfellas". One of my favorite scenes is when DeNiro scopes out the hustlers who are trying to cheat the casino out of as much money as they could possibly get. And another favorite scene was when Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) took a pen and stabbed a guy in the beginning of the film. I am not a Don Rickles fan only because I find him to be an obnoxious, loudmouth, unfunny comedian but he was actually pretty good in the movie and that is because he wasn't trying to be funny. As I have stated earlier, I never cared for Sharon Stone but her performance as Ginger was downright convincing. Eerily too convincing perhaps. Frankly Al (Robert DeNiro) should have dumped the twit right away. Ginger was more in love with his money and power than Al himself. I think the problem with "Casino" is that Martin Scorcese tried to capitalize on the success of "Goodfellas" too soon with "Casino". Had he waited a few more years and in between films, "Casino" might have been a box office hit but compared to "Godfather 3", "Casino" is a hit.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Another classic Scorsese production.  Round up the usual suspects on this one.  Sharon Stone was the best thing in this movie and she definitely deserves her Oscar nomination on this performance.  The only problem I have with the movie was I thought Joe Pesci was still playing the character in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.  It still shines, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>This movie seems to have everything a great story requires: a colorful setting, fascinating characters, an action-filled plot sustained by a multiple of tensions and conflicts, and all manner of revelations about the uses and abuses of power in the casino world of Las Vegas. What makes this movie especially interesting to me is the sub texture of individual characters (especially those played by DeNiro and Stone) who seem to be torn between various addictions and the demands of those addictions on the heart and mind. I almost (not quite) feel sympathy for DeNiro's character ("Ace" Rothstein) who manifests all of the requisite skills of an effective CEO amidst all the corruption he accepts and thereby condones. He wants to be a loving, devoted husband and father. Except for his feelings for the character played by Stone (Ginger McKenna), he is the absolute realist. The life he offers to her is one which, from the moment he proposes marriage, she is reluctantly willing but ultimately unable to accept. The characters played by Pesci (Nicky Santoro) and Woods (Lester Diamond) are most representative of an underworld culture of crime and corruption, addiction, violence, greed, glamor, and self-interest. The first half of the movie is essentially a documentary on the casino world, crisply and (when necessary) brutally managed by those controlled by syndicate bosses headquartered elsewhere. The fictional narrative becomes dominant in the second half as the mob eventually loses its control and most of the characters lose their lives. Corruption exists at all levels of this world, varying only in terms of degree of access to the hundreds of millions of dollars processed each day. Meanwhile, conventioneers and tourists pour through the casinos, unaware of the human darkness concealed by the sparkling lights.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Directed by Martin Scorsese, Casino is a story about Sam Rothstein, a professional gambler who becomes the boss of a mob operated casino in Las Vegas during the 1970's.<br />Ace runs the business and regularly sends lots of cold cash to his bosses. Helping Ace keep the casino's employees and customers honest is his best friend Nicky.  Although Ace aims to run a relatively respectable casino, Nicky wants to take over the entire gambling mecca. Then money hungy Ginger McKenna enters the picture, further complicating Ace and Nicky's friendship. She agrees to marry Ace even though she isn't in love with him and tells him as much. As drugs and alcohol become a bigger part of Ginger's life, Ace's possessiveness and jealously drive her into an affair with Nicky.  This is a must for all Scorsese fans!</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Casino was a victim of bad timing. Released within the same five year span as Scorcese's absolute masterpiece Goodfellas, the comparisons were inevitable. Is Casino as good as Goodfellas? Flat out...No. But not many films are. Casino deserved the chance to stand on it's own merits but with De Niro and Pesci seemingly reprising their Goodfellas roles it's difficult for that to happen. Nonetheless, Bobbie D does a bang-up job as Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a professional gambler who is hand-picked to run the Tangiers Casino for a consortium of Mafia bosses from around the country. Pesci plays Nicky Santoro, the Mob's enforcer who comes to Las Vegas for one reason...to take over. As usual the performances are stunning, De Niro and Pesci work together as well as any screen tandem I've ever seen. Sharon Stone does a great job as Ace's two-timing, drug addicted, gold-digging wife. I've always despised her as a person but I have to give credit where credit is due. The more I've watched this film the more hysterical the mob bosses are to me, if this is the way the mob is really run then their in big time trouble. Anyway, as always things start of great but turn out real bad in the end for some people in Casino. It's a long film but worth the ride and a fine addition to any DVD collection. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I have owned this HD disc for a while and I never grow tire of it!! In many ways, this film is superior to "Goodfellows" which I also own in HD, not the least being--Sharon Stone!!  Her Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning performance is worth the price of the movie alone!!  A previous reviewer downgraded her performance but I believe this is a personal bias rather an objective one!! Next to her "Basic Instinct" breakthrough, "Casino" shows that with a great director, Sharon can deliver the goods as well as any of the great femme actors out there like Charlize & Hillary who I also like.  Dig this in Hi-Def for the gaudiness and the scene where Ginger throws the chips in the air while DeNiro is entranced by her.  Keep in mind though that this is a Universal release and is only available in HD, so do cop a Toshiba machine before they're gone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>The first hour of "Casino" (1995) represents Martin Scorsese at his best - a mini-masterpiece of cinematic bravado depicting the inner workings of a Las Vegas pleasure palace. Unfortunately, once you get past the dazzling semi-documentary introduction, the remaining two hours become a tired self-parody of the director's earlier crime films. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone cannot redeem a disappointingly melodramatic script by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi. In the end, the ambitious yet overlong "Casino" fails to pay off.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video was very good, but not excellent compared to new movies on Blu-Ray.

The way a casino was run and how it all relates back to mob control was fascinating to see and the various tricks the customers and casino owners use are pretty inventive. Some parts of this film are pretty graphic, as to be expected from Scorcese, but the story overall is gripping and kept me engaged the whole time. The extras disc is excellent, with some great featurettes and bonus material to really add to your understanding of the film. This is a great gangster type movie and brilliantly directed and acted.

He is sent to Vegas to run the Tangiers Casino for the mob.  Within a short period of time the profits are doubled and the mafia keeps two sets of books to hide the money from the federal tax authorities.  The mafia sees a real cash maker in Sam and they send out Nicholas Santoro to protect Sam and the casino from any problems. Nicki is not to smart and a real thug and he is quickly banned from every casino in town.  That leads him and his crew into more strong arm crime and robberies. He is a real out of control gangster.<br /><br />Sam meanwhile falls in love with the beautiful Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and they are soon married.  For multiple reasons Nicki and Sam are at each other's throats and Sam is also in trouble with the casino commissioner for firing one of his family members.  All of this action leads to more violence, betrayal and conflict......<br /><br />This is an excellent movie with an all-star cast and it is directed by Martin Scorsese who is simply one the best directors of Hollywood history.  The result is a fiery and action filled movie that depicts the history of the Las Vegas Casinos and the mafia control of gambling.  The story line is very good and with such a great cast of actors the movie just seems realistic.  There is a lot of violence and language, it is the mob after all, but it is still a very good movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot and I recommend it to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>What are the odds? Casino is a classic Las Vegas gangster film directed by Martian Scorsese. In one word Casino is: Awesome. It stars the dynamic duo of Robert De Niro and Joe Pecsi. This team made a number of great movies together, this arguably the best of the bunch.  Casino tells the story of Las Vegas: how it started and also how it ended. Robert De Niro plays Sam "Ace" Rothstein. Rothstein is a gambling extraordinaire mob backed Casino manager. His attention to detail is extensive to say the least. Throughout the film Sam explains the ins and outs of the Casino business in old school Las Vegas. Joe Pesci plays Rothstein's psychotic, visceral, and violent right hand man Nicky Santoro. Pesci really hit the mark on this one. Nicky is one of the most violent mobsters in film history.  His attitude is so over the top he leaves you terrified in your seat. Casino also includes a star studded cast of excellent players including: Sharon Stone (plays Ginger, Ace's wife, a role that earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress), Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, James Woods, and many others. To top it off Frankie Avalon plays the one and only Frankie Avalon. This film is full of great music, style, and ultimately many life lessons. It was made at the right time in the right way by Martin Scorsese. Casino is a timeless classic. Depending on your point your view: it will make you long for old Vegas or appreciate the Disney Land is has become. Take your pick just be careful when you driving around there in the desert. According to this film, there's a lot of stuff buried out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"Casino" is a crime drama film that is based on true events. Creative license has been used but essentially numerous events are similar to those experienced by Frank "Lefty" Rothstein, referred to in this movie as Sam "Ace" Rothstein.<br /><br />Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is a seasoned gambler with a history as a professional sports bettor. He is put in charge of the Las Vegas casino Tangiers as part of a Mafia effort to build a stake in the market, and to also siphon profits back to its unofficial owners before disclosing a reduced bottom line to tax agencies.<br /><br />The film narrative conveys large scale corruption and violence associated with the gaming industry. It also puts forward that there are few loyalties within the greedy and ruthless community of casino managers and owners.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

While the film is mostly a rehash of the styles and moments from Raging Bull and Goodfellas, Casino seemed to work well for me the first eighty minutes. I kept thinking to myself, "Why doesn't the film deserve a `10'?" Then the next hundred minutes answered my question. Let's focus on the first part first. I thought the editing work was not too bad but kinda excessive because of the many short lived scenes. It felt rushed, but I got the gist of what Las Vegas is all about and how Ace Rothstein does his job. Then, I was introduced to the characters as well as the many subplots. That was working out good for me until the second part came. There, I felt that the subplots were being poorly capitalized on, and more of the different characters came without knowing who the heck they are. The drama between Ace Rothstein and his wife was utterly unconvincing and didn't add very much to the movie. Joe Pesci had his moments throughout Casino yet his character is not well-developed. Rather, he is used as a tool just to stretch the time of the film. Having written that, it would have been a lot better for Martin Scorsese to cut one hour out of the film just to keep the tension tight. Instead, he probably thought that he could get away with it by letting the editing go loose and geting lazy with the running time. Increasingly, Casino was becoming about the colors of the Robert De Niro's suits, lights of Las Vegas, and Sharon Stone's wardrobe instead of built-up intense moments of explosion that are too familiar in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Cape Fear. Robert De Niro isn't too bad in his role in Casino, but he could have been given much more respect for his character's development. I would have to say that De Niro's role is almost the last time he was ever good. On the other hand, what's with Sharon Stone? She was a major distraction to Casino. I was mostly peeved by the lack of development in the overall story. All in all, Casino is not too bad of a film but falls as a victim to excessive running time and all-around poor direction. The rating of Casino is unchanged.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci star in Martin Scorsese's<br />1995 crime drama.

Very entertaining movie, a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>I was born in Chicago, and my father went to Stienmetz high school with Tony Spilotro, the mobster portrayed in this film by Joe Pesci. I grew up listening to stories about "the Ant" (not flattering), and when he was finally whacked, my old man (a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times) wrote what amounted to his obitiuary. In it he recalled such charming Spilotro antics as the time he threw acid at a girl who had rebuffed his advances and the time he tried to split open my dad's head, and thus prevent my birth, with a T-square during shop class. To top it off, I recently discovered my Dad's old yearbook (1955 or so), in which he and the future boss of Las Vegas are standing in true 1950s glory (slicked hair, plaid shirts, everybody wearing horn-rimmed glasses) next to each other on picture day. <p>So I guess you could say I had a personal interest in seeing how Marty Scorcese and his "Goodfellas" crew would tackle the subject of transplanted Chicago mobsters in the neon desert. My final verdict: they all did a hell of a job.<p>Pesci, as "Nicky Salerno" (all the names have been changed to protect the guilty) is just as horrifying and vicious here as he was as "Tommy DiVito" in "Goodfellas"; Pugnacious, bloodthirsty, bad-tempered, arrogant, and paranoid, but also capable of humor, loyalty and a certain weird charm. Some would say he was just playing the same character again, and yeah, he is, but he's so damn good at it, who cares?<p>Bobby D is superb (what else?) as "Ace Rothstien" -- the micro-managing, ego-maniacial Chicago handicapper and casino boss who trades in on his friendship with mobsters to become a big time player in Vegas, and promptly realizes he's let the snake in the manger. Nicky is what mobsters call a "Cowboy" -- a crazy, reckless hoodlum who thinks with his fists (or his gun, or the sharp end of a pen, or a telephone, or whatever's handy) and creates more wreckage than profit. He also attracts the attention of the Feds and the Nevada Gaming Commission, who soon make Ace's life miserable, and more importantly, begin to interfere with the Mob's ability to "skim" Casino profits back to Chicago. And if you know anything about the Outfit (as it is called there), you know N - O - B - O - D - Y is going to interfere with their profits and get away unscathed. <p>"Casino" is one of those movies where you watch bad guys get their hands on something really big, and drive it straight into the ground. Things blow up, people get beaten and whacked, fortunes are made and squandered, and monster egos crash against each other like bumper cars. There are many similiarities to "Goodfellas" except the stakes are much higher, and like "Goodfellas" there is not a character you really can root for -- Ace is miserly, controlling, egocentric and arrogant, Nicky is a straight up homicidal maniac, and Stone's character is your typical scheming, treacherous hooker-hustler. A lot of people felt this movie was the same thing, with the same cast, done not quite as well, and indeed, "Casino" is not as good as "Fellas" but it is a very good movie all the same. If "Fellas" had never been made, this might be a top-5 Mob movie of all time. I recommend it to anyone with a gangland fetish, 80's nostalgia and strong stomach.<p>And by the way, the actor Frank Vincent, who gets revenge on Pesci in this film (with a baseball bat) for twice getting the best of him in previous Scorsese movies ("Raging Bull" and "Goodfellas"), actually bears a stronger resemblance to the real Tony Spilotro than Joe Pesci does....wierd.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>Casino is nothing less than a Scorcese masterpiece, based primarily on the true story of the violent life and death of Tony &quot;The Ant&quot; Spilotro, who was the mob's chief enforcer during the early 70's, while protecting the mob's gambling interests run by Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. As someone interested in the development of the American mafia, Casino is a brilliant translation of the building of Bugsy Siegel's vision in the desert up to the gaudy haven for high rollers that it was during the 70s. This movie brings the dusty pages of Las Vegas history to life. Spilotro was the real thing; Joe Pesci gives us only a taste of how brutal he really was. His death in a mid-west cornfield was the final act of this particular chapter in Las Vegas history. This is perhaps Scorsese's most underrated film, Casino contains one of De Niro's finest performances--his Sam Rothstein is controlled, nuanced, quiet, contemplative, depressed, ambitious, and furious. De Niro plays all these sentiments at once, and he ultimately creates a character that may not be Scorsese's most likable but is certainly his most mesmerizingly believable. The film's rare dual voiceover is so well executed, as Pesci and De Niro's characters fight for control over the storytelling just as they battle for power over Vegas. This film is flamboyantly stylized-In many ways it is about style. There are as many flashy whip-turns and ironic soundtrack selections as there are peach blazers and white pantent leather loafers. If you want a film that is at once great entertainment and moving art, watch Casino, and let Scorsese transport you back to a rare moment in American history: &quot;The last time tough guys like us we're ever given anything that 'effing' valuable.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A1AUOVXPT5MYX4.html">A1AUOVXPT5MYX4</a><br/><p>"Casino" is, without doubt one of the best films by Scorsese. The film runs for almost three hours and events take their time to unravel, and rightly so.<br /><br />The performances: Robert De Niro is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and that's a universal fact! In this movie, he delivers a performance that qualifies as one his best after 'Raging Bull'. He appears super-cool as the Casino operator and you cannot help but sympathize with him in some later parts of the movie when he is having a bad time because of various reasons. Trust him to play an all-in-one character: a mob-connected Casino guy, a friend and a loving father all at the same time! His powerful performance in this movie has to be seen to be believed. It is nothing short of mind-blowing!<br /><br />Joe Pesci..what can one say about this guy! Delivering sharp dialogs and firing those F-words with a one-of-a-kind punch is something only he can do! He plays a wicked, wicked character who also cares for his boy-hood friend, Sam. Another brilliant performance after GoodFellas, he is the finest choice for his role.<br /><br />Sharon Stone: Superb!! I never thought I would feel that about her performance, but indeed, she gets a hell of a chance to act here..and she does it exceedingly well! The drunk hustler who cannot find happiness is played to perfection by Sharon...I guess it is also kudos to the director for bringing out the actor in her.<br /><br />Then there are some wonderful, but small supporting performances by James Woods as Lester Diamond, Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Alan King as Andy Stone and Kevin Pollak (The Usual Suspects) as Phillip Green. Special mention here, of Pasquale Cajano, who is superb as the mob boss, Remo Gaggi.<br /><br />The soundtrack is very much like that in GoodFellas. And much in the same manner, there is some playful rock'n'roll music playing in the background during any violent scene of crime!<br /><br />The dialog is brilliant. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing. The wonderful screenplay for the film is co-written by Nicolas Pileggi who is also the author of the book.<br /><br />As mentioned before, the film runs for about 3 hours but there is not a single moment when you'd want to take your eyes off the screen.<br /><br />An under-rated classic, this one deserves a rightful place up there along with Scorsese's other acclaimed classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>My favorite films range from gangster flicks (The Godfather 1 & 2), comic book adaptations (Batman '89), Sci-fi spectacles (2001: A Space Odyssey, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, The Thing), realistic thrillers (Collateral, No Country for Old Men), and animated classics (Fantasia, The Lion King). Casino is slowly being put on my list. This is a fantastic 178-minute film by Martin Scorsese, which is sadly underlooked. Maybe it's because it is quite similar to Goodfellas: two of the same cast members, same gangster themes, etc. But anyways, I seem to prefer this to Goodfellas, which is also a great movie. Here, we get to see some equally disturbing images ("In the end, I had to put his ****ing head in a vice") and a more excessive use of the F and S words (the F word being used 398 times in just under three hours).<br /><br />And not only that, we get to see some of the finest performances by De Niro, Stone, and Pesci. De Niro plays Sam Rothstein, one of the top handicappers in Las Vegas. As the owner of the fictional Tangiers casino who has connections with the Mafia, he looks to be an egotistical perfectionist, who treats his workers as if they're drug addicts. On the soft side, though, he is a caring family man who would do anything to protect his wife and child. De Niro should have at least been nominated for an oscar: here he is at the top of his game. He brings his trademark attitude into the picture, never losing his cool and never surrendering to overacting.<br /><br />You all know what Joe Pesci is capable of. Starring as Nicky Santoro, he is a hotheaded psychopath who relies on his balls instead of his head. He uses his explosively violent attitude to solve many of his problems, with disturbing and darkly hilarious results. I would NEVER want to confront a person like him. Pesci sure steals the show with his cursing and his aggressive personality, and he's clearly one of the reasons why I like Casino.<br /><br />I was never a fan of Sharon Stone, but she shines in this movie. She plays Rothstein's beautiful but obnoxious wife who takes her time smoking, drinking, taking pills, and embracing her husband's money. She is a woman that people love to hate, and she would care less what we all think of her.<br /><br />To be honest, what I like more than the performances is the overall flow of the film. This is half documentary, half mobster flick. Rothstein and Santoro become the narrators, and show us what happens in the Tangiers, and what sort of business they run. The narration may slow the film down a few times, but the information is just what we need in order to understand what type of people are running, and making money off of, the casino.<br /><br />In short, Casino is an excessively violent film with excessive profanity. Goodfellas may be the more popular film, but personally I have more admiration for Casino. Kudos to Scorsese, De Niro, Stone, Pesci, Rickles, Woods, and Vincent for making such a spectacular film.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese "Casino" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas... We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or night...<br /><br />De Niro's character, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, is based on Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper... He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country... Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them... As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys... 'Ace' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tables...<br /><br />But he had a fatal flaw... 'Ace' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions... So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him... Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power...<br /><br />Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating... Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town... For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score... So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money... 'Ace' knew that but he didn't care...What he wanted was to marry her...<br /><br />Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild... She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desires...<br /><br />Joe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops... He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer... (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.)<br /><br />To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect... Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty... 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf... Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcer...<br /><br />The clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening... They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story... 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy... And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic...</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Casino" is a "mob" movie set in 1970s and 80s Las Vegas.<br /><br />It's from the same team behind "Goodfellas" - Martin Scorsese (director and co-writer) and Nicholas Pileggi (co-writer and writer of the original book) and even includes the incomparable Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in the lead roles. It is very similar in style and tone to this earlier film.<br /><br />This similarity detracts from its impact somewhat but "Casino" is still a  very good film. It contains many memorable moments, good music, and is stylishly directed by Scorsese.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>No director has ever done a better job than Maretin Scorsese at taking moveigoers into the life of the mafia headfirst, and his 1995 movie "Casino". Though not as purely enjoyable or fast paced as "Goodfellas", "Casino" is most certainly a brilliant piece of cinema, a masterpiece that only Scorsese can provide.<br /><br />Like "Goodfellas", "Casino" is based on a true story (and also on a book based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi). Set in 1973, "Casino" tells the story of Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a small time hood who sets his sights on owning the Las Vegas strip. With the help of his lifelong friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci in a spellbinding performance on par with his unfrogettable Tommy DeVito), Ace becomes the biggest hotshot in town. He's rich, successful and married to the beautiful Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). Him and Nicky are on top of the world.<br /><br />But soon, things start to take a downfall. Nick's violent temper and mob connections get him thrown out of every casino in town, while Ace begins to lose control of his empire (and to an extent, some of his mind) in a crooked court case, and Ginger has become a drug addict and soon moves back in with her former pimp, Lester Diamond (the always fantastic James Woods). As the film reaches its shocking (and violent) climax, each of these characters heads for a swift downfall brought on by greed, betrayal and violence. It's a lurid, almost disturbing vision that only Scorsese can provide.<br /><br />"Casino" is undoubtedly one of the best movies Scorsese ever did. Everything about it clicks. I do prefer "Goodfellas" because it was more enjoyable and not as grim, but "Casino" still manages to fire on all cylinders.<br /><br />This special edition is a must for all fans of the movie. Overall, I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>Believe it or not it has been 10 years since the classic movie Casino was released. Sharon Stone made her splash in the early 90's with Basic Instinct. After the success of Sliver was questionable and with no Basic Instinct sequel in the works, many at the time looked at Casino as her career deal maker. Stone didn't disappoint. She shined in her roll as Ginger, a call girl whose character would eventually marry Robert Deniro's character. Although the movie had an all star cast, Stone was the only actor in the film to nab an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />When the film was initially released, it was scrutinized and compared to the movie Goodfella's. Joe Pesci and Deniro both appeared in this Scorcese film. The movie itself is rather long but it's a wonderful movie and I love it. The writing is great, the scenery is great, it's a good movie.<br /><br />Overtime it has not been as revered as Goodfellas, but it is still a well loved movie. For this reason Universal has released Casino-10th Anniversary Edition. A part of me wants to say that this was only released again to remind people that the movie is out on DVD.<br /><br />Okay, on to the review of this new release. It's a single disc in a standard DVD case. The film has been digitally remastered. The extra's are solely for the person really interested in the movie or the behind the scenes aspect of the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great DVD for people who want to purchase the movie and didn't buy the last DVD or for fans of the film who bought the movie the last time but were not pleased that the previous DVD didn't have any extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I loathe the inevitable comparisons made between "Casino" and "Goodfellas".  The films do share a director, Martin Scorsese, a source writer, Nicholas Pileggi, and two stars, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  That's where the similarities end.  Both films tackle stories in the criminal milieu and succeed in gripping the audience.  Scorsese manages to make this film a fast-paced experience despite a nearly three hour running time.  He's ably abetted by some snappy editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, gorgeous cinematography by Robert Richardson, and good sense of the era(love the cars and clothes).  Impeccable song choices on Scorsese's part on the soundtrack.  The film is fascinating in how it portrays Las Vegas as a shimmering city which under it's surface is motivated by greed and avarice, which in turn breeds paranoia.  Just ask the eye in the sky.  The first half of the film concerns itself with how some Midwest mobsters infiltrate a Vegas casino.  The second half shows how overreaching causes their downfall.  DeNiro is superb as the oddsmaker who goes on to manage a casino only to be brought down by his own vanity.  Pesci is equally fine as the thug who wants to make Vegas his personal playground.  Probably the best performance in the film belongs to Sharon Stone as DeNiro's wife who is at heart a hustler.  This is a difficult part to pull off because her's is essentially a character motivated by pure greed but Stone manages to convey the pathos to make her sympathetic.  I think Scorsese is a victim of his own success because this film was initially given lukewarm response from the critics and public alike.  Fortunately, time has been kind to "Casino".</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>this is the movie martin scorsese SHOULDA won his oscar for.  instead it was deemed upon its release an inferior copycat of "goodfellas", what with the same director, writer, and stars, and a similar set of circumstances.  this though is a quite different movie, and (imho) a superior one.  while "goodfellas" is set among a highly parochial little group, the gangsters are only a part of the scene in "casino": its much more widespread a saga of greed and the corruption of stupidity.  whereas joe pesci is a cartoon in the earlier film, here he is a fully fleshed out character.  de niro (more a glorified supporting character in "goodfellas") offers an insightful reading of an ordinary man with one phenomenal talent (the ability to set the correct odds) who parlays it into a position of power for which he knows he is unqualified, yet enjoys the ride.  and sharon stone gives the performance of her career as de niros unfaithful drug-addicted wife.  excellent supporting work also from james woods, don rickles, and a host of unknowns cast as aged mob bosses, &c.  not to mention a great job of art & costume direction, brilliant soundtrack, the amazing opening titles sequence, and so on.  it might not be scorses most underrated movie (thats still the hated but brilliant "king of comedy") -- but it might well be his very best.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>CASINO is the third installment of Martin Scorsese's True Crime tryptych. MEAN STREETS and GOODFELLAS preceded it, and highlighted low-level street crime and workaday organized crime. Based on a true story, CASINO takes us inside the glitzy yet seedy universe of Las Vegas in the 1970s, a period when Mob influence reached its apex and then fell, dizzyingly fast.<br /><br />Scorsese brilliantly reunites most of the GOODFELLAS crew for this three hour epic. Robert DeNiro plays "Ace" Rothstein, de facto boss of the Tangiers, while Joe Pesci plays Nicky, his closest friend, bitterest rival, and muscle. Sharon Stone garnered an Oscar nomination for her role as Ginger, a former showgirl/call girl turned Rothstein's wife, who basically makes his life miserable, abuses their daughter, and runs back to her scrawny no-account pimp (James Woods) at every opportunity.<br /><br />Pesci's "Nicky" is GOODFELLAS' "Tommy" with a bank account. More conniving and calculating than Tommy, Nicky is just as amoral and violent. Pesci taps the underlying sociopathic core of the character, drawing it forth like an oil well of evil, and making Nicky the ugly face of CASINO's enclosed world.<br /><br />DeNiro is the handsome face of Vegas, addicted to crazily color-coordinated suits, charming the high rollers, torturing the scam artists, and trying to run a good operation while earning for the boys back home.<br /><br />Both Ace and Nicky are over-the-top characterizations, all the more true to life in Vegas. As Ace muses at one point, "Anywhere else they'd put me in jail. Here they give me civic awards."<br /><br />Their private empire collapses in the end, not so much because of their many excesses, but because they simply outlived their time. The general crackdown on organized crime in the 1980s consumed Las Vegas as well, turning it from a hardcore, all-adult playground into Disneyland with roulette wheels. As the wiseguys vanished the corporations flourished.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that CASINO starts off too slowly. As in GOODFELLAS, Scorsese uses the voice over technique, this time alternating between Ace and Nicky. Scorsese errs at the outset. The voice overs are so dominant in the first half hour that the film slips into documentary mode; however, the cast quickly finds their feet and redeems the remaining two-and-a-half-hours of this film with amazing, engaging performances.<br /><br />Running a far distant second to GOODFELLAS in Scorsese's canon, CASINO is still a fine film, and is a fascinating glimpse into that real world where all of life spins black and red.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Casino is clever, witty, styilish and its a true story. Casino is a fact based mob movie that stars Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and James Woods. Casino is one of the best mob movies of all time. DeNiro, Pesci and Stone deliver Oscar worthy performances. The movie is a must see. Casino is an emotional movie and it delivers a strong message. Casino is also not a movie for everone. People who enjoy true srories, mob movies and people who want to adventure into the harsh world of sex, money, drugs and corruption through a movie screen should definetly get off their tails and BUY, or at least RENT this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>...or is this the darkest black comedy ever made? I just find Casino so amusing and funny that I hardly even notice the grim violence and harrowing drama. I also think that Casino is far, far superior to the over-rated Goodfellas. Even though it's longer, it passes in a breeze. Casino is just so colorful, multi-layered and intricate despite it's apparent simplicity. The film has three different characters narrating the story but none of it feels like exposition and it's never over-bearing.<br /><br />Adapted from a true story, the film focuses on the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. The boss is Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, his wife, volatile hustler Ginger and his psychotic 'friend' Nicky Santoro. All they needed to do was to keep the cash-flow at the Casino steady to satisfy the bosses back home. But it was just never meant to be. And everything implodes at the end.<br /><br />Casino is filled with dozens of sub-plots, tangent stories and brilliant side-characters. James Woods is especially funny as a lowlife con-man who can't even win a fight with a ten-year-old girl. Vinny Vella also amuses as long-suffering Artie Piscano. But it's Sharon Stone who walks away with the movie. Despite starring opposite loads of well-established male lead actors she owns Casino. She was absolutely robbed at the Academy Awards when they gave the Oscar to Susan Sarandon. Stone delivered a performance so authentic that it's truly unfair the amount of criticism she gets for her other, less-important films.<br /><br />The violence will satisfy gore fans. In this lovely film we have a dope with his head in a vice (after getting icepicks in his balls), a truly brutal beating with baseball bats, some moron getting a pen shoved into his neck and a cheater getting his hand mashed by a hammer. Don't let this put you off, that was the old Vegas. Nowadays you just get told not to come back.<br /><br />I know most people will call it sacrilege to condemn Goodfellas but Casino is just the better film of the two, plain and simple. Better lighting, far more impressive cinematography and more entertaining characters. It just has so much going for it that Goodfellas did not.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is absolutely stunning in 1080p and is surely reference quality stuff. The DTS HD-MA sound is also amazing and there are plenty of extras. A total must-have.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>I worked for a Mississippi casino at the time this film hit the big screen.  Obviously, there are tremendous differences between Las Vegas casinos of the 1970s and Biloxi casinos of the 1990s--but even so I was stunned by the accuracy with which Scorsese's CASINO nailed the industry and the personalities that inhabit it.  From the slick hair and pin stripe suits to the endless profanity to the count room to the survelliance room, CASINO is uncomfortably close to the truth.<p>Based on the life of 'Lefty' Rosenthal, CASINO offers the story of Las Vegas' last gasp of mob domination before the big corporations began to move in.  Robert De Niro is "Ace" Rothstein, a mob-connected gambler who rises to control of one the biggest mob-owned casinos in town--and then sees his control slips away through his misplaced love for beautiful and brazen Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and his association with gangster Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci.)  And when their various activities begin to draw heat on the mob bosses, can murder be far behind?<p>The cast is really top notch.  De Niro and Pesci offer memorable performances, as does a superior supporting cast that includes James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, and Melissa Prophet, to name but a few--but the real laurels go to Sharon Stone, who plays out the rise and fall of the glamorous Ginger with surprising skill.  But even so, and in spite of its memorable cast, dialogue, plot, and production values, CASINO has a slightly awkward feel to it.  Part of the problem is the film's inconsistent reliance on voice-over narration that shifts uneasily between De Niro and Pesci; part of the problem is the film's uneasy shifting between love story and gangster movie.  And in the final analysis the film seems overlong.<p>For all its flaws, CASINO is an extremely watchable, very memorable movie that stands up very well on its own in spite of inevitable comparisons to GOODFELLAS.  In passing, I note the DVD package has few extras, and most viewers will be as happy with the VHS version as with the DVD.  But be it DVD or VHS, the film is strongly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I have seen this film to many times to count and I am yet to become even remotely sick of it. The acting is flawless, story flows at a great pace from the hours it generates on the screen. Fans of Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci should already know what this film consist of. The leading actors mention above, are all at their usual greatness, but the pleasant surprise from this movie is the electrifying performance by Sharon Stone, (who won a Golden Globe award and got an Oscar nomination for her role) as the con-artist trophy wife. She was truly memorable in this film because she effortlessly convinces us that she was one crazy "individual" that you love to hate.<br /><br />`Casino' (1995) takes a look at the upper level mafia as `Goodfellas' (1990) looked into the lives of low to mid level hoods. Robert De Niro again does a great performance, as Sam, who is at odds between being loyal to his bosses and retaining some kind of intregity.<br /><br /> Pesci, as Joe, is one remarkable actor. This man is only 5' 6'' but can be so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. "You want me to get out of my own town?! Don't *bleep* with me, Ace!" Does he swear throughout the entire film? Oh, yeah infamously. About 400+ f-words. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history. Joe did his thing being the [...] who thinks with his gun and not with his head. James Woods, Kevin Pollack, Alan King, Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, L.Q. Jones, and Dick Smothers all have done an excellent job with their supporting roles. The whole production of the film held up really well. The camera moves as if it has a life of its own and almost every scene is set nicely with its score plus the dialogue and narration are up to par.<br /><br />Like in other Scorsese films, the violence here is sudden and comes out to you unexpectedly. Countless of other reviewers, complained about the level of violence - suggesting an NC-17 rating would have been more appropriate. Whether you will like "Casino" or not depends entirely on your tolerance for character-driven films - and, of course, heavy violence, other then that `Casino' is another great and wild piece of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R.html">A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R</a><br/><p>Without deniro and pesci this film would not have worked. Their characters absent in a mob movie is like a gun without bullets. I can watch this movie over and over and still be entertained and inrtigued. I think Joe Pesci did a way better job in Casino than he did in goodfellas because even though both characters are ruthless, casino "nicky" had a softer side than tommy in goodfellas. Sharon Stone cheese and rice, gave an oscar winning performance as deniro's wife who pretty much has a breakdown and turns into an addict, alcoholioc, and raving lunatic. Wouldnt you if you married to a controlling richie who has mob ties. She was gorgeous at the beginning with her long blonde hair, and 70's outfits and hair do. But of course as her character changed into an alcy and addict she lost her looks a little. Just a little reminder of what alcohol and drugs do to your body. And Robert Deniro was smoking hot! This was one of his last movies where he still looked great for his age. He is older now, but still looks pretty good. He's one of those guys that never loses his sex appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>"Casino" is a crowning achievment on alot of different levels.  The directing, the acting and the story.  You feel so involved while viewing it, you get so tangled up in all the crap that ends up happening.  It's an emotional investment worth the payoff.  All of the performances are brilliant, especially the scenes between Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro.  There was some funky energy between the 2, like they really hated eachother at times.  They're fights and tirades seemed so real, I was mezmorized while watching them.  When Sharon Stone finally gets confronted in the Italian restaurant, and Robert DeNiro graps her and she mutters, "I wouldn't do that if I were you", I felt the raw emotion of her performance.  This role was Sharon's crowning achievemnt in film in my oppinion.  This is one of my favourite films, I wish someone could make another epic drama like this again, there seems to be a shortage of good stuff like this around.  ENERGY PEOPLE!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>In many ways, you can consider Martin Scorsese one of the most underappreciated directors working. After scoring classics with Raging Bull and Goodfellas, a lot of people still wouldn't give him recognition like an Oscar and while the basic opinion now is that he's bound to get at least one for his recent film the Departed, the essential feeling is that they should've given him one earlier. Casino, released after little seen Age of Innocence can be seen as "return to form" and while it's gritty, unrelenting and quite violent, it's also way too long and you never seem to invest in it that much.<br /><br />Taking place in the 1970's, Sam "Ace" Rothstein starts becoming a bigger player in the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, letting players win enough and recognizing foul play and cheaters. His long-time friend, Nicky Santoro, is a pretty hyperactive and, quite frequently, violent man that becomes well-known in Vegas as a mobster-like figure. While one becomes entangled in the politics of running a casino, the other gets increasingly violent and out of control, especially when it concerns Ace's wife, Ginger.<br /><br />It's always weird watching a Scorsese film because at times I notice that I actually like the film better when I see it the 2nd time. Maybe it was the hype from everyone but watching Taxi Driver, Goodfellas or Raging Bull I thought "yeah I thought they were good movies but where's this 'masterpiece' everyone keeps saying?" But then in Goodfellas' case and moreso with Raging Bull, everything started to click. The problem with Casino is that even repeated viewings, it's still kind of a messy movie. It's hard to invest in emotionally with everything, the film's way too long with scenes that don't really go anywhere or just simply a lack of focus. It's certainly a more ambitious looking film than Goodfellas but it just seems a bit too scattered.<br /><br />How's the acting? Very straight across the board. Before being replaced by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert de Niro seemed to be Scorsese's go-to guy and he's of course great in the film. While he did show a more restrained menace in Heat, here he's practically vicious in certain scenes and likable. Joe Pesci of course plays the manic buddy who swears constantly and with a short fuse. Sharon Stone actually did receive a nomination for her work here and it was a welcome one too. Everyone else is fine too but primarily the work here is by the 3 leads and they all pull it off.<br /><br />Is it a Scorsese classic? Not really. What it have been, had certain decisions had been made? Yep. While to me it's still Raging Bull for all-time favorite film of his, Casino is at least worth a look but there's enough to like here, it's just not quite enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>I must be blind.  I just don't see what everyone is talking about.  CASINO is not (and let me emphasize "not") Scorsese's masterpiece.  I don't mean to say that it is a bad picture by any standards, but there is much more depth in Scorsese's catalog than comes to life in this film.<br /><br />CASINO provides an interesting (and long, coming it at three hours) history of Las Vegas in the 1970s.  As in GOODFELLAS, it provides us with a window to the underworld of the Mafia and allows us all to satisfy our desires to explore that world and view it from the comfortable distance of our own homes.  The story, while based on a true account, is not an unfamiliar one to filmgoer's: the tale of two men that get catapulted into the riches and glamour of money, drugs & sex, only to be chewed up, spit out, and left for dead by the business that once supported them.  In the process, they destroy all of the relationships that are near and dear to them and wind up where the story begins.<br /><br />It may seem that I am giving too much of CASINO's architecture away.  But, Scorses wisely employs the audience in this classic storyteller's technique, informing us from the very beginning about where the story will end up (as witnessed by the car bombing of De Niro's car in the opening sequence of the film).  Moreover, and this I was less thrilled with, De Niro provides a layer of dialogue that is peppered throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I did not feel that the dialogue was effective.  Rather, it served to prevent us (in some ways) from getting wrapped up in the storyline and gave the first thirty minutes of the film (where the dialogue is most obtrusive) a bit of an "amateur" feel.  After all, how tragic can the story be with De Niro providing his own reflective commentary.<br /><br />All of this being said, I did enjoy watching CASINO.  The performances by Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (in that order) are definitely worth witnessing.  Each of them brings this story alive, despite its slow pacing.  Moreover, the story is a fascinating one, particularly if you enjoy movies about the Mafia.  However, my recommendation would be to watch GOODFELLAS first, as I believe it is a superior film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZXDBATXFNZX.html">A3QZXDBATXFNZX</a><br/><p>This is by far one of Martin scorsese's best film's and always will be. Robert Richerdson's Photography is brillent and the performances are wonderful from the whole cast. The DVD is ok it has good picture and sound thats about it. But the violence is extremely graphic and I am surprized that it didnt get The NC-17 rating. But its still a very brillent picture. <p>Warning: This film contains Extremely Graphic Prolonged Brutal Violence including Strong language,Strong Drug Use,and some strong sexuality.

'Casino' is certainly not a bad movie but there are some points that don't work in it's advantage.<br /><br />Length: The real cut is almost 3 hours long and a little too long. Especially since there are now real points of rest. There is almost always a monologue by DeNiro and Pesci (occasionaly someone else) or the characters talk. There is never a period of action or silence. Sometimes the talk is almost a parody of gangstermovies.<br /><br />The music is good however, ranging from the 50s to 80s and very out there and part of the music.<br /><br />The acting is ok. Pesci is the best, deNiro his usual self but never super like in Raging Bull. Sharon Stone got an oscar nomination for her part of the wife of deNiro who keeps sliding down and down. But it's not a superpart and there have to have been better roles that year. More than 4 anyway.<br /><br />For the Scorcese fan this movie is ok. But it's long, a little too long and too fast so it might exhaust you.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I wasn't as wild about CASINO as I was about GOODFELLAS when I first saw it.  I thought CASINO tried to take on too big of a story.  GOODFELLAS was just one hood's story of the Mob from the 1950s to the 1980s--very smooth and steady.  But CASINO was not only spread out over three interesting characters, but it also tried to tell the story of Las Vegas itself.  At least Vegas of the 1970s.<br /><br />(To be honest, as much as I love Robert DeNiro, I thought his character would've been more interesting if he'd been played by a less powerful presence.  I don't have a problem with his performance--he was great--but I think someone a little less threatening would've made Pesci's monster scarier.)<br /><br />To pack it all in, CASINO had an almost-nonstop narration from a lot of the characters.  After my first viewing, I felt as overwhelmed and frazzled as a weekend in Vegas.<br /><br />I know these almost sound like complaints, but they're really just quibbles.  It's Scorcese, DeNiro, Pesci, another true story of crime and life and death in America.<br /><br />And Frank Vincent, after getting slammed in a car door by Pesci in RAGING BULL and getting stomped, knifed, and shot by Pesci and DeNiro in GOODFELLAS, finally gets some payback this time around.<br /><br />I'm glad I waited for this edition: I loved the outtakes with Scorcese's mom shooting her scenes of reacting to bad language (and scolding her own son when he repeats a line!), and, since this is a true story, you can watch the History Channel's show about the real story with the real people.<br /><br />The cameos are great: Don Rickles, Dick Smothers, L.Q. Jones, even Joe Bob Briggs.  The current mayor of Las Vegas appears as who he was back in that day: a lawyer who actually represented the guy Joe Pesci plays.<br /><br />CASINO is a sprawling but finely-crafted film about a Vegas that just doesn't exist anymore.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>When I first saw this film at the theatre I was disappointed as I compared it to Goodfellas and found it inferior.  That is a totally inadequate way to judge it, however.  Well, now, after numerous viewings, I have to admit that if Goodfellas is a 10, Casino is a 9.  The plot is suberb and De Niro and Pesci are as perfect in this film as in any other.  Interestingly, the hatred one feels for Sharon Stone's character may be the best proof of the diamond (intentional plot reference there) performance she puts forth.  Unbelievable.  The cast is superb and this is one of Martin Scorsese's finest productions.  I was incredibly impressed and remain that way today.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I love this movie!

DeNiro is given a Casino to run in order to keep a steady supply of funds going "back home" to the mob bosses in Kansas City.  However, DeNiro's desire to stay straight (he's so good at what he does he feels he doesn't need Mob protection) puts him at odds with childhood friend Pesci, who is attempting to rule Las Vegas.  Then everything begins to tumble...<br /><br />An unrelenting and brutal film, hampered only slightly by the addition of James Woods as a sleazy lowlife.  However, the acting is superlative all around (Stone was nominated for an oscar) and Scorsese's always solid direction make this a movie to see.  9.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>With De Niro and Pesci together again, I was expecting this movie to folow in the footsteps on Goodfellas as far as quality and storyline, but I was disappointed. The film is much too long simply because it just doesn't stay interesting all the way through. The dialogue is bad at times. Sharon Stone's character gets very annoying quickly. This film isnt bad, but definitely nowhere near Goodfellas or many other Scorsese films has done.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>The storyline to Casino is well written and very entertaining, but thought the graphic violence, blood and language was just too much. Especially the ending scene with Pesci, I mean there are other similar movies like this I have enjoyed but for some reason thought it went too far here.  This is by no means a family movie or one for kids.  If you like mystery/crime movies then think you will enjoy it and even though it's a very long film, should keep your attention well from beginning to end but if you don't like a lot graphic violent blood scenes like ones from horror films, then you might want to skip it.<br /><br />Peter J.

The mob is in control and then goes out of control.  The whole story makes you want to take a shower and find a safe place.<br /><br />"Casino" is a story of Las Vegas glamorous past and fairy tale exterior.  The mob runs rampant beneath the glitz and glitter as we see the stark contrast of blood money and the beautiful people who own beautiful things.  "Casino" shows the rise of a casino owner with mob connections (Robert De Niro), his friend and Mafia underboss (Joe Pesci) and in ex-prostitute with a strong will and expensive taste (Sharon Stone).<br /><br />Based on a true story, overall it is just too much of everything, blood, gore, gangsters and drugs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>I have this on HD DVD and I just bought it on Blu-Ray and out of the 150 plus Blu-Rays that I own this is the only one that takes a long time to load. Anyone else have any problems with this disc loading?</p></br><a href="../users/A35XFZN4MWNKK4.html">A35XFZN4MWNKK4</a><br/><p>A compelling tale of power, money and depravity sets the tone for this riveting crime drama. Casino has always been compared to Goodfellas and indeed one of the few variations is that this film is set in the heart of Las Vegas but the film holds enough merits to make it distinctley unique within itself and deserves to be judged on such. Robert De Niro heads the excellent cast, playing Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a master bookie turned big-shot casino manager who's astute head for business quickly deserts him when he marries ex-hooker Ginger McKenna (played convincingly by Sharon Stone). Sams boyhood acquaintance, Nicky Santoro (a superb turn from Joe Pesci) turns up with an ambitious agenda of his own thing that takes things on a further downward spiral.<br />Casino was written by Nicholas Pileggi (who received an oscar nomination for Goodfellas) who goes for absorbing realism, expertly drawn characters that are played with raw, instinctive conviction and a host of intriguing subplots. There are plenty of stomach-churning scenes of violence with such graphic images of a victims head being squeezed in a vice being one of the most brutal acts displayed in the film. The films well-thought out structure is accompanied by an enthralling and sizzling soundtrack. A genuine masterpiece!</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>Seeing it on DVD with subtitles was almost like seeing a new movie - one that I understood a lot better.  Seeing it for the second time also helped.  The first time (15 years ago at the theatre) I was too busy being shocked by the incredible violence of the film (i.e. Joe Pesci).  I didn't understand why Pesci seemed more powerful than DeNiro.  Second time I got it - Pesci's character is a 'made guy'.  DeNiro's is not.  Perhaps all those Sopranos episodes between now and the last time I saw this film tuned me into things I didn't pick up on the first time.<br /><br />I liked it the first time I saw it though not understanding why DeNiro's character let Pesci's run the show had bothered me.  The violence bothered me.  The second time, I was (a bit more) prepared for the violence and had time to notice other things - like DeNiro's character and some of the mistakes he made along the way - he wouldn't give in on little things - money issues perhaps.  These things cost him a lot more in the long run.  Take for example not letting the hick relative of a powerful politician stay on the job.  And not allowing his wife to get away with giving her ex-lover the $25,000 she seemed so bent on giving him.  Even when she returns to him he cannot let sleeping dogs lie and instead has to find out exactly how she used the 25,000 until their relationship has once again disintegrated.  While Pesci's character is wildly out of control and the  most obvious cause of what brings them down, Rosenthal's own quiet stubbornesses have enormous consequence in what later goes down as well.<br /><br />I found this movie relentlessly fascinating/horrifying and hardly noticed it was 3 hours.  To say Casino is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean Streets and GoodFellas) is just a joke.  Mean Streets is nowhere near as fast-paced (or gripping) as Casino and while Good Fellas is considered Scorceses mob masterpiece I'd venture to say Casino is roughly in the same ballpark in terms of greatness (and certainly fast-paced intensity).<br /><br />In terms of DVD special features, the Anniversary edition (anamorphic widescreen 2.35:1) is double-sided with the movie on side A, and bonus features on side B including:<br /><br />*Deleted scenes,<br /><br />*"Casino: The Story" - how Scorcese collaborated with writer Pileggi,<br /><br />*"Casino: The Cast and Characters" - a look at the real people behind the characters and how the filmmakers cast them,<br /><br />*"Moments with Scorsese, Stone, Pileggi and more!",<br /><br />*"Vegas and the Mob",<br /><br />*"True Crime Authors: Casino with Nicholas Pileggi"<br /><br />This is a fairly jam-packed single dvd for special features and well worth the 4 or so bucks it's going for on Amazon.  I think I enjoyed it more on DVD than I did at the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I've been biting at the heels to write a review of this brilliant film but, as I was when debating my Godfather review, I was hesitant for I know I could never do the movie justice.  First off, major props go to Scorsese for his brilliant direction.  It still ticks me off he hasn't won an Oscar yet.  Anyways, the film also sports brilliant acting on the parts of De Niro, Pesci and Stone, Stone standing out and nabbing the Oscar nom (and should have been win!)<br /><br />The film (based off true-crime novel 'Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas' by Nicholas Pileggi) follows friends Sam and Nicky as they work the Las Vegas gambling scene.  De Niro plays Sam 'Ace' Rothstien (based on real life gangster Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal) a man assigned by the mafia to run a casino in Las Vegas.  The first hour of the film plays like a documentary, run over with voice over explaining the mafia's involvement with gambling in the casinos.  Sam meets and falls for the sassy Ginger (Stone) who marries him mostly for money.  Sam, kind hearted as he is, actually trusts her, and this proves to be his end in many ways.  Pesci plays Nicky Santoro, Sam's backstabbing pistol of a friend, short, round and confident.  Pesci always plays the short tempered "I can't believe a guy his size would pick that battle" type character...and he always pulls it off.<br /><br />Over the course of the three-hour epic you watch as not only Sam's marriage and status but also the mafia's control of the gambling scene is jeopardized by events involving Sam, Nicky and Ginger.  This is a brilliant film that to me rises above 'Goodfellas' for it's as serious as it is intriguing and it never once begins to bore.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I saw Casino when it first came out in 1995.  I loved the story, the acting and the violence.  It was on TV a few days ago.  Nothing else interested me at the time so I thought I'd just watch a few scenes.  After all, I had seen the film before and there were a lot of nasty commercial breaks to deal with.  Well, two hours later when it ended I was still sitting in my chair, the remote control still in my hand and I hadn't even channel surfed one bit during the commercials.  Without a doubt I was completely pulled right into the story, based on some real life people and events.  The fact that I had seen this film before didn't matter at all.<br /><br />The setting is Las Vegas.  The story is about the mob and based on some real events.  Martin Scorcese's direction keeps the action flowing.  The relationship between the stars, Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone, sizzles.  And the musical score enhances the action and keeps the story upbeat, sad and violent all at the same time.  Joe Pesci is cast as a bad guy you love to hate.  His cruelty is awful, and yet I couldn't help but feel sorry for him when he, too, became a victim of the gang world which he helped create.<br /><br />The story of love and money and corruption is a universal one.  There's not a bit of this film that felt dated.  I loved every moment of it.  And, even if you've seen it before, it's worth a second look.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'Casino' is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen.  It is not for the soft-hearted.  Still good and in some ways better than 'Goodfellas'.</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>In many ways, Casino is the epic Goodfellas could not be.  Casino is about relationships between characters in and around organized crime and gambling, and it's about the arc that an entire city of pleasure takes over these people.<p>It's Scorsese and Pileggi and DeNiro and Pesci and Frank Vincent again and it's a top-notch, gorgeous gangster epic.  <p>In the early 70s the Chicago Outfit sends Sam 'Ace' Rothstein out to Las Vegas to manage the casinos they're skimming cash from.  Ace is a gambling master, a sure-bettor who never loses; soon the Tangiers is raking in more dough than ever due to his management.  In order to better 'manage', the Outfit also sends Nicky Santoro, a crafty but hot-headed soldiers (Pesci) to Vegas, to provide the muscle.  Pretty soon Pesci is smacking people around, stabbing them with pens, putting their heads in vices, and even vandalizing their cars (not to mention flat-out threatening to crack their heads open) all as he looks to set up his own empire away from the Dons in the Midwest.  <p>When Ace marries a call girl named Ginger (Sharon Stone) and attempts to start a family, things start going downhill.  Ginger is still involved with her old pimp, for one.  And let me pause to mention that James Woods has played possibly the sleaziest, most disgusting rat pimp of all time, from the subtleties like his mustache and mesh shirt to his cheap talk and bullying threats.  Eventually, Ace, Nicky, Ginger, Nicky's Vegas crew, they all manage to bring the house crashing down on them.  <p>This is all based on the true story of the Chicago Mob in Las Vegas and the hold the families had on the big casinos.  Pillegi's source book is an interesting account for sure, with more commentary from some minor characters in the film, giving it different angles than just the Deniro-Stone-Pesci trifecta.  <p>The film looks gorgeous, it has to be one of Scorsese's biggest budgets.  The 70s clothes, the cars, the settings--they manage to scrounge up enough un-touched 70s Vegas left, and they film in real casinos quite a bit.  <p>The film is three hours long; there's a lot packed into this.  Along the way it can be fun; the voiceover sequences of Ace describing the workings of a casino, or how people cheat (and get caught) playing blackjack, or the montage of Nicky's gangster antics, all make this very engaging.  The film is a lot bloodier than Goodfellas, and even had to be cut (during the infamous head-vice scene.)  <p>This can't be recommended highly enough, HOWEVER, once again we have a very lame DVD, not as bad as Goodfellas, but not much better.  You don't have to flip this one over, but for a three hour film, there are far too FEW chapters, making it very frustrating if you want to watch certain portions again.  There's a trailer, wow!  There's also some text you can read on the production and the stars, but quite frankly, that is one of the lamest features they try to put on discs.  Can't they simply print production notes in a booklet?<p>If you haven't seen this or Goodfellas, come out of the cave.  If you listen to some people who say 'It's like Goodfellas, but not as good', well, you can let them think for you.  It's as good as Goodfellas, and arguably better.  <p>And Joe Pesci has some of the most choice swearing lines...</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>&quot;Casino&quot; features much of the same cast as the excellent film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; with Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro returning as gangsters, this time in Las Vegas.  This is the story of a mob-fronted casino boss and the local Mafia enforcer in Vegas.  The film truly takes us inside the seamier side of 1960s Las Vegas, which at that time was more or less openly controlled by the Midwestern mob bosses.  The film is practically a psueudo-documentary about how the mob ran Vegas.<p>Pesci and DeNiro turn in fine performances as enforcer and casino boss respectively.  James Woods does his customary excellent job as the worthless dissolute, but controlling boyfriend of De Niro's wife, Ginger.  The standout, however, is Sharon Stone as Ginger.  She literally becomes the role, and ultimately dominates the latter portion of the film.<p>The storyline is brisk, and the explanation of the workings of the Vegas mob are very interesting.  The film shows the ultimate pointlessness and wanton violence of the mob culture, as all of the major players ultimately come to bad ends.  The film never takes itself too seriously, and there are many absolutely hilarious parts to the film.  The sub-plot dealing with De Niro's attempt to get a casino license from the local Vegas good-old-boys is really funny.<p>Minor criticisms.  First of all, the film involves 'way more swearing than is necessary.  Yes, I have no doubt that mobsters really do talk this way, using the F-word every third word, as Pesci does throughout the film.  But it probably would have been OK to clean this up anyway--I think that to have done so would have added to, rather than detracted from, the movie's impact.  The violence throughout the film is such that it is not suitable for young kids.<p>Basically an excellent adult film that retains the viewer's interest, tells an interesting story, and features very fine performances by the cast.  Recommended for what it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>Although the ending of "Casino" is not as satisfying as those earlier Scorcese films, the entire film is a wonderful exercise in film editing and directing.  <p>Of course, great attention has been paid to the soundtrack, which is occasionally jarring, but mostly fits in well with the action/dialogue.  This particular re-teaming of De Niro and Pesci is less effective than "Goodfellas", but that stems in part because we've already been there before, and that ride was a lot more fun.  De Niro seems to be walking through his part, and Pesci's aping the same part he played 6 years previously in "Goodfellas".<p>Much had been made of Sharon Stone's performance, which is the most effective of the three leads, but this is due in part to it being the most unpredictable.  <p>"Casino" runs a bit longer than it should, but it still rewards through repeat viewings.

Those who like casino and/or gangster movies will find sheer joy in this film about both. Scorcese has proved himself to be a truly remarkable director and this film shows why. He knows how to handle characters, scenes and even adds in a few of his own tricks. Many have cited this to be a copy of &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; but this isn't true at all. Sure, it has some of the qualities that made &quot;Goodfellas&quot; so cool, but &quot;Casino&quot; is its own movie doing its own thing. Acting: everyone here is excellent. Of course, DeNiro and Pesci are absolutely remarkable, but so is Sharon Stone as DeNiro's wife. While the film runs at about three hours, it feels much shorter due to a fast pace and a relentlessly thorough screenplay. This ranks as one of Martin Scorcese's best films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>Casino, while being eerily similar to Goodfellas, is a great mob movie.

Pesci plays almost an identical character to the one in Goodfellas - except for a small change in accent.  However, this little guy is still one bad man!  I still believe that this is Sharon Stone's only good movie.  Ironically, she doesn't have to disrobe to earn that status.<p>The plot, like most mob movies, is easy to predict - but I don't care.

Pileggi also wrote the book and screenplay for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J09M">GOODFELLAS</a> (1990) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGHL">CITY HALL</a> (1996).<br /><br />CASINO's main character is loosely based on Chicago-born sports handicapper Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal, a frequenter of Miami racetracks. With Florida authorities breathing down his neck for bookmaking activities, Lefty relocated to Las Vegas in 1968. In '76, it was discovered that Rosenthal was running four Vegas casinos without a license. He was consequently denied one due to organized crime &aacute;ssociations. In Nov. '82, Lefty's drug-addicted ex-wife O.D.ed on booze, Valium and coke in a motel room. A month before this, he was almost killed in a car bombing.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.1) Casino (USA/France-1995) - Robert DeNiro/Sharon Stone/Joe Pesci/James Woods/Frank Vincent/Kevin Pollak/Don Rickles/Alan King/Dick Smothers/Steve Allen/Jayne Meadows/Frankie Avalon/Jerry Vale</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>Just some thoughts...<br /><br />Throughout the years, while discussing Las Vegas with people who are knowledgeable about Las Vegas, I usually ask them this question:  "Which Las Vegas do you like better - the massive family-friendly Vegas of today with huge hotels, or the Vegas of the '70s when it was smaller, was more for adults, and run by the Mob?"  The answers I get are mixed.  When they ask me which Vegas I like better, my answer is the Vegas of the '70s when it was smaller.  Their next comment is usually, "Huh?  You're too young to know the Vegas of the '70s."  My answer is, "No I'm not.  I was there a few times in the mid to late '70s and I remember it very well.  The city was 1/3 the size it is now, the hotels were smaller, people dressed up when going to the casinos, and it was more for adults than it is now."  Even though I was a little kid the first time I visited Las Vegas, I remember these things very well.  There wasn't a whole lot for me to do there as a kid, except maybe go swimming in the hotel pool and go to Circus Circus.  But I remember being fascinated with the city.  The 100+ degree heat in August.  The Strip.  Fremont Street.  All the lights.  The nightlife.  Seeing people standing on the street corner dressed in glitzy outfits waiting to cross the street.  The casinos.  The slot machines.  The card games.  The live entertainment.  I of course wasn't allowed in casinos for extended periods of time, but I walked through a lot of them and liked what I saw.  The next time I visited Vegas was in August 1984.  It was basically the same city, but a little bigger.  Then the next time I visited Vegas was Labor Day Weekend 1995.<br /><br />What, I mean WHAT happened?  The city was now humongous, probably three times the size as it was in the mid '70s.  Giant hotels with 5,000 rooms.  Massive casinos.  Hardly anybody was dressed up.  It seemed like a family-friendly city instead of mostly for adults.  The new giant hotels dwarfed the older ones.  The Sands, Dunes, Sahara, Stardust, Aladdin, Frontier, Circus Circus, Riviera, Caesar's Palace, Hacienda...seemed so small now.  One year I got into a conversation with a limo driver and he told me that entertainers who performed in Vegas back in the '60s and '70s took a lot of pride in their performances.  He used B.B. King as an example.  He said that B.B. King would practice for hours before the show because he wanted to give a great performance and stay sharp.  He said that nowadays, an entertainer just gets out of a limo and goes right on stage.  Who knows if they even practiced.<br /><br />Now about this movie...<br /><br />I had never seen Casino (1995) until tonight.  I was hooked on this three-hour movie from the moment it started because right at the beginning there is a voiceover by Robert De Niro where he says (referring to the Vegas of today), "The town will never be the same.  Today it looks like Disneyland."  He goes on to say, "In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, and what you played.  Now, it's like checking in at the airport.  And if you want room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday."  He also says that after the Mob was rooted out, big corporations took over, mommy and daddy play the poker slots, and the old casinos are being torn down.  Hearing all this really drew me into the movie because this is EXACTLY how I personally think when it comes to Vegas, as I described earlier.<br /><br />This movie stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone.  Basically, without going into a lot of specifics, the movie shows Vegas in the days when it was run by the Mob.  It shows the dark side of Vegas - Mafia crime, drugs, alcohol, the consequences of cheating while gambling, brutality, murders, greed, how every crook is looking out for each other, and the lengths that Mob bosses will go to in order to gain more and retain what they have.  The period of time this movie covers is 1973-1980.  Ultimately, the movie shows how the Mob made some bad mistakes that resulted in the Feds getting the Mob out of Vegas and how corporations took over and made it family-friendly.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is superb.  I thought Joe Pesci's acting was especially good.  Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro were excellent in their roles.  The movie has tons of filthy language.  This really adds a sense of realism.  It also has quite a bit of violence and blood and gore.<br /><br />I noticed that the up-close shots of the casinos were done in a way so the viewer would have a hard time telling what casino was being shown and/or what casino was next door.  This movie takes place in the '70s but was made in 1995, so the goal was to hide some of the newer hotel/casinos that were around in 1995 but weren't around in the '70s, such as The Mirage, Treasure Island, MGM Grand, Luxor, Excalibur, etc.  In the far-away shots, older hotel/casinos that existed in the '70s that were still around in 1995 (the year this movie was made) were shown, such as Stardust, Frontier, Circus Circus, Sahara, Dunes, Riviera, The Sands, etc.  The filming of downtown Vegas wasn't a problem, as just about all the hotel/casinos that existed in 1995 also existed in the '70s, such as The Golden Nugget, The Horseshoe, The Plaza, Four Queens, etc.<br /><br />This DVD's extras are very good.  It has a digitally remastered picture, a feature called Casino: The Story which talks about the script and the book the movie is based on, deleted scenes, and some moments with director Martin Scorsese, Sharon Stone, screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, and more.<br /><br />I like Las Vegas, even the family-friendly Vegas of today.  I wish it was still the size it was in the '70s, but generally speaking, it's still one of the best vacation destinations in the world, and one of my favorite places.  Though it's violent and somewhat disturbing, this movie will provide a nostalgic look back to the smaller, adult-themed Vegas of yesteryear.  I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>4.6 stars<br /><br />One of Scorsese's best, Casino is a classic due not only to his tight direction and a great script from Pileggi (based on his book), but DeNiro and Pesci at their best, and the only really good performance I've ever seen from Stone.<br /><br />Based on real-life mobsters Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro, Casino gets a little ways beneath the glittering surface of Vegas to show some of what was going on with the (wise)guys who used to run the show there. DeNiro is pretty much perfect and Pesci likewise, though I'm guessing from the books I've read on Tony the Ant that he was not quite as pleasant as he's depicted here. Sharon Stone is the big surprise, though, as she's as good at being Ginger as she could possibly be. Perhaps the role is just typecasting; in any case, she nails it, and every guy she can on the way. But it's DeNiro who looms over all, not just in the story but in the talent department.<br /><br />Someone once wrote that Bob isn't a great actor, as he "just plays the same New York ahole in every movie". I don't know about that, but he certainly defines this character with much precision, and makes him rather likeable, no mean feat. While not quite up to the level of Travis Bickle or Jake LaMotta or the early Vito Corleone, this is easily one of DeNiro's best roles and Casino is worth watching just for him. James Woods is a dead-on sleazeball, Frank Vincent plays to a T the exact same role he has in almost everything he's ever done (the strong, silent wiseguy always walking a few steps behind the Boss), and it's funny to see Oscar Goodman doing in a movie what he did for decades the in real life: defending mobsters in Vegas court. Before he became the Mayor of Vegas, that is. I wonder how he got that job...<br /><br />Add in a funny, sharp script, superb camerawork with all the garish oranges and other hues that were Vegas in the 70s/80s, and good turns by almost every actor in the film, and you've got a near-perfect film. It's perhaps a little long at almost three hours, but drags very little. In some ways you're sad to see Casino end, even after five viewings. The new dvd transfer is pretty much perfect, with all the bright tones intact and nice deep blacks. No special features to speak of, but that's now standard: make the suckers buy the blu-ray, even if the old dvd had plenty of extras!<br /><br />Casino is based on a true story, but reverts to fiction when discussing how the Mob was run out of Vegas. Yes, they just picked up and left their billion-plus dollar a year cash cow when asked to, and Steve Wynn and other guys who had access to billions to build the new super-casinos moved in. Casino says it was "junk bonds" that financed the New Vegas. Don't tell that to all the reporters and authors who've linked Wynn and other new bosses to various crime families, but then again we're certainly due for a movie about the New Vegas, and who better than Scorsese to front, er, direct it?<br /><br />What say, Marty? How about a rags to riches tale of little Stevie Wynn, who can snatch a billion dollars out of thin air and build some of the most lavish buildings in the world? It's got "Jackpot!" written all over it.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Casino, check it out. It's a truly fine film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese was the man that owned That MAFIA Genre in the 90's,<br />With "GOODFELLAS" and "CASINO".<br />This Movie shows how the MAFIA fumbled the ball in Las Vegas & lost<br />all ties to the city in the Desert.<br />They go from making millions to making the biggest mistake of their<br />life!!<br />If you like MAFIA movies check this one out, I give it 5 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Anytime you see that a movie is 3 hours long, you think to yourself that you are in for a long ride. Casino is such a great movie, with a terrific cast, that it's over before you know it. Watching the film makes you realize how great De Niro, Pesci and Stone are as actors. There are just many great scenes where I sat there and thought how brilliant they were. The best scenes are with the dialogue between De and Stone. It is just intersting to watch how just about one arguement can ruin everything for people and causes everyone on top to hit rock bottom. Fanastic acting, I can't say that enough because that is what makes the movie.The movie also does a great job making itself modern even though it takes place during the 70s and 80s. If you are into great films, this one of the best.</p></br></body></html>

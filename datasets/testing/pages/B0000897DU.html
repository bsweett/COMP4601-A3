Although it's self-serving at times, this is also an impressively open and honest take on Eminem's roots and the self-imposed blockade of excuses he laid out for himself before catching so much as a whiff of stardom. The plot outside of Mr. Marshall Mathers is fairly simplistic and limited, though, with most of the cast simply orbiting the star and reacting to his angry, frustrated outbursts. I found the battle raps to be as intense and exciting as a good action scene, and the choice to limit them to a few key moments was a smart move that doubled their importance. Eminem himself is startlingly good in the lead role; it may not too much of a stretch to play yourself in the cinematic story of your own rise to fame, but I've certainly seen plenty try and fail. Authentic, street-smart inspiration that offers a fresh take on a tired old tale.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>The bargain-basement movie for last night was "8 Mile" staring Eminem. Well, I've never particularly cared for Rap music or it's Hip-Hop cousin. I don't mean to condemn the entire genre because I can enjoy a bit of it now and then and Eminem would rank as one of my favorite artists within that genre. After all, that's why I bought the DVD. But rap music just doesn't fit me. I'm more of a small town westerner than a big city ghetto dweller. Okay, okay, it has wider appeal, but there's a lot of people who just don't  care for it and I can understand their feelings.<br /><br />"8 mile"was an interesting movie in several different ways. Well, you've all heard of Detroit and several other big cities that are decaying with the demise of American manufacturing. Detroit is a particularly good example because of the dramatic changes in the automobile industry. It's lost 50% of it's population! Only a few decades ago, Detroit was one of America's great cities. Would you like to see Detroit at the ground level and on the mean streets? Well, viewing this movie is a way to do it. The urban decay is just appalling and serves as some kind of warning to all of us, if only we could read it.<br /><br />Rap music came in about in the late 70s. I expected it to be a short-term fad that would fade after a few years, but I was dead wrong. Rap is still with us 35 years later and is still going strong. Where did it come from? What is it like at the real base level? What's it like at a street level rap performance? Well, this movie provides a lot of views for these type of questions. Rap came out of the big city ghettos where most of the inhabitants were African American. It came out of the F-bomb dialect of American English and is harsh and grating on the ears. It's a brash and bombastic music that aggressively pushes itself into your face. Want to know what rap is like at the street level? "8 mile" is a fairly good depiction, I would guess. Well, who am I to say, standing on the distant sidelines?<br /><br />In any case, Eminem is a white Rapper from the Detroit area and he plays a white Rapper from the Detroit area working himself into the distant dream of gaining a recording contract. The movie documents his living conditions and rise through his associates on his way to ultimate stardom. Very interesting! Without question! Brace yourself for harsh conditions and extreme language abuse and you might even enjoy it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7NFDO3I1TA.html">A4X7NFDO3I1TA</a><br/><p>This movie is a very good movie. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Eminem. Good Movie</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 11/04, 12/11<br />Rate: 8<br /><br />12/11: Raising my rating of 8 Mile from `5' to `8', I think the film was actually well done despite the fact there had been a numerous of Horatio Alger type of music stories over the past twenty years. I think my impression at first of the overall acting to be weak, but now, I feel everybody did equally good. Probably the best parts of the film will have to be the rap battles. They are in fact well written and creatively thought out. I know that invariably I keep saying that these characters need to go back to school and retake reading remedial classes. In the same vein, rapping is a real waste of time, but it shockingly makes a lot of money for some. Finally, Eminem...he wasn't that bad at all; just liked to have seen him in more movies to see if he could create more range. Probably the best performance of the film will go to Mekhi Phifer who was pretty good as Future. All in all, 8 Mile, whether you dislike, hate, or ignore Eminem, is worth watching and makes for a good film.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this is a great movie, i did not think eminem was such a good actor. he was perfect for this movie. this movie had a lotta of good actors in it and the story was great. the music was awesome in this fuilm. this is a good movie if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>Rap, Hip Hop, rock. No matter what you like to listen to you will like this movie. I haven't read much about Marshal (Eminem) but I believe this movie is based on his life. I like the kind of person he plays in this movie, a good man just trying to get by like a lot of us these days. While watching the movie I still can't believe Brittany Murphy is dead. I thought she would be around for ever.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES RAPPER AND ACTOR IM READY FOR 8 MILES AND WALKING!!!!! GET TO MAKING IT ITS ABOUT TIME!!!! THIS MOVIE IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING! ITS A MUST HAVE</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>8)  Mekhi Phifer.  I know that this may not mean much to a lot of you, but Phifer is a ridiculously talented actor who just hasn't received the exposure he deserves.  It's hard for African American actors in this industry, because they are all too often either cast in predominantly Black films that get no exposure or they get cast as the stereotypical sidekick.  Phifer has bared his acting chops in every role he's been handed, and this is no exception.  He really sinks his teeth into the role of David `Future' Porter, giving him a life all his own, with real viewpoints, aspirations and emotions.  He is far more than just a `sidekick', he's a life force propelling his friend to greatness.<br /><br />7)  The rap.  Yeah, this is a rap movie so-to-speak, and the gritty rap battles are major highlights, especially the final ones where Rabbit grows a pair and lets it loose.  If you are a fan of Eminem as an artist, or any of his crew, then the freestyle rap-offs will have you smiling from ear-to-ear.<br /><br />6)  The gritty direction.  Curtis Hanson is a phenomenal director, and that statement is made based on his flawless transference of `L.A. Confidential' to the big screen back in 1997.  He brings an even grittier feel to this film, allowing the very essence of this man's life to burry itself in every frame.  This film feels SO LIVED IN, genuinely evoking from start to finish, and while other factors obviously are in play here, it is Hanson's direction that establishes the film's core.  He understands the tale he is telling, and he pulls so much out of this cast (I mean, he gets an Award worthy performance out of Eminem, but I'll get to that in a minute).<br /><br />5)  The sharp script.  This is a very smart film, because it could have easily fallen victim to the clich&eacute;s of the genre, but it doesn't; at all.  It really `goes there', creating real people with real issues and real situations that bleed so much honesty and truth.  Some have gripped about the relationship between Alex and Rabbit, but I find it truthful and earnest.  Even her betrayal reads with such gritty authenticity you can completely connect to it.  The dialog is realistic (yes, all those 4-letters words feel appropriate) and the progressive plot ends on a realistic note as well (that sense of accomplishment is never overshadowed by a Hollywoodized improbability).<br /><br />4)  R.I.P. Britney Murphy.  Yes, this is one of her finest roles.  I ache when I think that such a criminally underrated star (and such a breath of fresh beauty) is gone from us.  Her slick sensuality coupled with the understanding of her character (glorified groupie intent of getting a piece herself) helps create a character we love to hate, and cannot forget.<br /><br />3)  It's semi-autobiographical.  I think my friend said it best, when this film was released.  He said "I'd love to see how Eminem got his start" and while this is not a strict biography (it's loosly based on Marshall's life, pre-stardom) it really helps you appreciate who Eminem really is.  Taking bits from his shattered home-life (his relationship with his alcoholic mother takes a more tenderly frustrated turn in the film, as apposed to the volatile way he explains it now) as well as his talent, `8 Mile' gives the audience a glimpse into the trials and triumphs of one of hip-hops most notoriously controversial (and critically applauded) players.<br /><br />2)  Eminem is REALLY good here.  I'm serious.  I never would have thought that he would hold his own, and I actually thought that casting him in the lead was a bit of a mistake, but he really blew me away with this one.  I guess it is true, that once you lived it you understand it, because nothing about his performance seems forced or inappropriate.  He's so natural here, completely bringing you along as he travels the road to personal betterment.  I don't know if I can applaud the performance enough, and it's not just because he's a rapper and acting is out of his element so `for a rapper' he does a great job.  This is just a great performance, period.<br /><br />1)  Because I know what I'm talking about!  Really, I do!</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>I remember when this movie was coming out. At the time I thought it was supposed to be Eminem's life story or something. Then after seeing the movie, I knew it was definitely not. Maybe somewhat but definitely not what I thought it was going to be. Honestly I don't know much about his life other than he hates his ex Kim and he is ticked at his Mom.<br /><br />8 Mile is a pretty good movie though on its own. The dreams of a white man making it in what most consider a black mans game. Sure, some have and were basically one hit wonders like Vanilla Ice and maybe even Snow (was he white?). Some were amazing like the Beastie Boys and even Eminem himself. Sure we never really see the rapping part take off like in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OONQ94">Hustle and Flow [Blu-ray</a>], but we do see him 'battle' which is two guys facing off and free styling, which I consider harder than rapping since you basically coming up with rhymes on the spot.<br /><br />Eminem plays Rabbit/Jimmy and is a kid basically living out of a garbage bag. With a dead end job for his future, the only thing Rabbit dreams for is a better future for himself and for his sister who lives with her bad/decent mom. And the only thing he has going for him is rap... and he's really good at it. He mainly just wants to record his music, but having no money, he can't really get studio time without help. So to pass the time he goes to a place where people battle to earn respect and recognition. And really that's basically the gist of the movie.<br /><br />Eminem actually plays a good role, even it probably wasn't to tough to basically play himself. Kim Basinger plays his mom and does a really god job. One minute you like her and the next minute you want to scream at her saying 'WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?'. Brittany Murphy is also in here and really didn't need to be.  I hated her role. She just seemed like some drugged out hooker to me the whole time.<br /><br />Though I liked the movie, I also don't really care for it... but... then I did like it also. Weird I know. Right when I would start getting bored with parts or rolling my eyes at parts, they would make me laugh or just get really interested again. For instance...one scene has Rabbit and his friend working on his car and the friend is trying to get him to come battle next week. We get it already...Rabbit is good and needs to battle. And then you hear 'Sweet Home Alabama' playing from inside the trailer and Rabbit and his friend start free styling to it and it really sounded good...which made me get interested again. I don't know...kinda hard to explain I guess.<br /><br />In the end I would say rent it if anything. The last 3 battles were really good on Em's part.<br /><br />P.S. Why did the only 2 other white dudes in the movie have to be REALLY dumb or REALLY redneck white trash? I thought that was funny.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Marshall Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, gives a rather humbling performance as Jimmy "Bunny Rabbit" Smith, Jr.; a wanna-be rapper with problems bigger than what we can imagine.  He's down on his luck and has to move back home to his mom's house.  Couple that with the fact that he has a fear of rejection.  In more ways than one, his problems are our problems we face in everyday life.  This makes the movie smart and easy to manufacture.  It's not the best film, but it does entertain as well as tell an effective story about challenges and courage.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>8 Mile starring rap superstar Eminem was his feature film debut, and even though he hasn't done a movie since, his performance as struggling rapper Rabbit got my approval. I don't care for his music but his first try at acting isn't too shabby. Co-starring Kim Basinger as Rabbit's alcoholic mother and Brittany Murphy as a naughty girl that he meets also give standout performances. 8 Mile does have some awkward moments but director Curtis Hanson pulls off another almost solid film. Get this movie if you like "underdog" stories. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>Can you believe M&M was bandied about for an Oscar nod for this? That would have been COLD, Vanilla. I was almost embarrassed to hate this film because it's actually too much of a joke; a vanity piece NOT to be taken serious. My eyes rolled back every time Kim Basinger appeared on screen. What a sad choice she made taking this part, but as actresses age, well, you sometimes have to take what you can get - that's the cold, ugly truth. And what about Em's "co-stars". Did the director tell each of them: "Alright, now in every scene that you appear with B.Wabbitz you have to act a fool - that is, obsequious and fawning beyond all measure, because you know, he's M&M". I give it 2 stars for interesting cinematography and that's it.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>To be perfectly honest....Im not the biggest Eminem fan but this movie which chronicles the period in Eminems life when he was down and out is a stirring, gripping tail of a talented artist discovering his potential.  He battles homelife,  poverty and quasi gangsters and ultimately becomes the winning underdog at the freestyle rap battle.<br /><br />  So pick it up today even if you dont like Eminems music,  youll root for this underdog thats for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>This movie turned out to be a whole lot better than I thout it was going to be.

People who are about to see it are most likely carrying a heavy baggage of expectations. And to such folk, here is a spoiler: 8 Mile is an absorbing movie if you like hood flicks, even an insiring tale at times, but I wonder if it commanded the supposed accolades that critics squandered upon it. Indeed it may be the 'Purple Rain' of our decade and is similar on several levels to the famous 80's movie starring Prince who battles his way from an alcoholic family and his own childhood demons to master the villianous musicians played by Morris Day and the Time. <p>That said, 8 Mile is shot well and the performances are actually quite good in parts. Eminem bags special mention -- he is in surprisingly confident form given his first attempt on the silver screen. Kim Basinger is so good as the ... mom that it makes you wonder how she channeled that performance without a little trailer park in her blood. Brittany Murphy is an exception (as usual) who fumbles around in her role like Ray Charles strapped in a Tilt-O-Whirl.<p>Although I hate rap  with a capital C, I am glad to note that the music throughout the movie is fairly enjoyable and the "rap battles" are even funny at times. Some of the scenes that have the "good guy" Eminem "winning" are actually quite engaging. <p>All in all, not a bad nightly rental given that it could have been much, much worse (think of "Cool As Ice" starring, gulp, Vanilla Ice).</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG.html">A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG</a><br/><p>I personally have never been a fan of rap or hip-hop. I come from The Who, AC/DC, Eric Clapton and Motorhead. However as big of a music fan as I am I am also just as big of a movie fan.<br />After seeing the the trailers I must admit I rolled my eye's, like i'm sure a lot of people did, and dissmised it. After learning that Brian Grazer (A Beautiful Mind)was producing the film and Curtis Hansen (LA Confidential) was directing I knew that the movie would be watchable. Finally I swollowed my prode and went to see the film.<br />  The movie is about a young aspiring rapper from Detriot named Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) struggling to cope with life and his unclear future. The movie opens with Jimmy becoming frozen onstage during a battle. By opening the movie that was I think that you care about Jimmy right from the get go. He moves back with his mother (Kim Basinger) in a trailer park. Jimmy struggles with his mother and other rappers.<br />Solid preformances by Britt Murphy as Jimmys girl and Mekhi Phifer as Jimmys friend. Still the movie belongs to Eminem.<br />  The movie and the charactors are well devloped and the plot is simple but plauseable (The Quiet Man wasn't a big story either). The acting is very good and surprising considering that Eminem has never acted in a movie before.<br />  The movie also deals with racisim on both sides of black and white and for that alone this movie is worth commending.<br />  The music suits the movie well and even though i'm not a fan of the music on a whole I found myself humming the title song later in the day.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>You know, ... this movie really WAS like the hip-hop version of Purple Rain.  Not that that's a BAD thing per say, I liked Purple Rain; but that does explain that weird feeling of deja-vu I was getting wile watching the movie.<p>As for the movie itself, it was pretty good, I was chuckling at a couple of points though.  The movie is so close to being an autobiography that I had a hard time suspending my disbelief and realizing it was fiction.  I felt it almost turned into a parody in the moments where it was "glossed-up" (such as the scene in which Em is defending a gay co-worker).  <p>I just felt like I just kept waiting for the Slim-Shady persona to make an appearence and put an end to all the political correctness I kept seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>To some this movie may be as deep as the Atlantic Ocean, to me it's about as deep as a pot hole full of brown water. Frankly the rap battles became tiresome early on, Brittany Murphy was wasted in a boring role in which she displayed morbid facial expressions while being hunched by Eminem, also Kim Basinger's melodramatic part didn't help matters. As for rap superstar Eminem's acting, it was fine. Believe me I wouldn't have any problems bashing it if it wasn't. I was under the impression that this was sorta based on Eminem's life, it's not. Or if it's supposed to be, it's simply dishonest. So in closing.. if you like rap music with an undying passion or aspire to be a rap artist, "8 Mile" may be worth your while. Otherwise ~just say no~..</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Let me start off by saying that I am not a listener of rap or hip hop music.  It's not by type of music, never has been, and never will be.  That aside however, I am an admirer of Eminem; not so much for his music, but his attitude and the unbridaled passion that he puts into his music.  Despite all the hype built up around it when first released, I went into 8 Mile with an open mind, and came out pleasently surprised.  Yes, the storyline and plot is the typical underdog comes out on top story we've seen too much of in films of the past, but thanks to the smart direction of Curtis Hanson and a surprisingly solid cast, 8 Mile ends up being far better than it should be.  Eminem may not have all the acting talent in the world, but he brings a vulnerability to the screen that will make the viewer root for him whether they are an Eminem fan or not.  Kim Basinger gets extra kudos for her role as the alcoholic mother, and Mekhi Phifer is surprisingly good as well.  All in all, 8 Mile is a surprisingly good film that is worth checking out whether your an Eminem fan (or a fan of rap music for that matter) or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>I was tempted to give this four stars because it did not jump out at me and shake me. However, the acting is good (Eminem is surprisingly good), the plot is simple but somewhat novel, the editing is very good, the soundtrack is very good and the extras are very good (you have to check out the amateur rap fights).<p>Yes, I like Eminem and think he is one of the most creative artists of the 90s. I also like classical music and classic rock. Although he does use a lot of expletives, this is a case where the expletives are not a mask for inferior work -- his stuff is good. The movie does not have him swearing nearly as much as his music does. However, there are several sexual situations that should stay out of the reach of youngsters.<p>The ending leaves us with hope and comes as a real positive outcome -- not sure how a "dark" message could be taken from that. It seems much more mature than many "serious" films being done these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DE1IYJGU5HPW.html">A3DE1IYJGU5HPW</a><br/><p>It's been little more than a year since Mariah Carey proved "Glitter" is not gold.  A mere seven months have passed since Britney's "Crossroads" experience summed up the destruction of 40 years worth of feminist progress.  And now Eminem, rap's bad, white guy, takes a drive down "8 Mile," making a case that he's both a serious artist and a serious actor.  Critics argue he is neither; whether it's the PC crowd from the left or the "gotta be offended at something" crowd from the right, it's easy to hate someone who presents such an easy target.  But, like Elvis, a figure Eminem references several times in his songs, he continues to appeal to youth and upset the adults, all while making oodles of money and, now, films worthy of praise.<p>"8 Mile" (the name refers to the road in Detroit that separates the white suburbs from the black inner-city) showcases a week in the life of wannabe rapper Rabbit.  Like Eminem, Rabbit fights for respect in the black-dominated rap underground.  Like Eminem, Rabbit lives with his mother in a trailer park.  And like Em, Rabbit is desperate for a way to get out.  His friends encourage him to become involved with "battles," 45-second freestyle raps where two contestants try to insult each other, and the best insults win.  Although Rabbit readily lets his rhymes slip at work and at play, when it's crunch time, he chokes.  The movie opens with Rabbit blowing a contest, and then stumbling home to explain to his alcoholic mother (a perfectly cast Kim Bassinger) that he broke up with his "pregnant" girlfriend and gave her the car.<p>The movie then moves through a series of vignettes - Rabbit at work, Rabbit at play, Rabbit in love, Rabbit rapping - with the desperation of his situation tightening like choke-collar.  The "plot" is loose at best; "8 Mile" could best be described as a slice-of-life with a "Rocky"-like ending (like we didn't know that was coming).  The utter poverty and hopelessness which pervades the film is superceded by a single ray of hope: that there may be a way, through talent, to rise above the cycle of poverty that has dragged every one of Rabbit's friends and family into despair.  It finally becomes a decision between working overtime for guaranteed cash, or taking a risk and aiming for something more - a choice that any creative person will recognize.<p>"8 Mile" works because it ignores its star and stays true to the spirit of creativity.  What could easily have been a "look at me" movie for Eminem remains a "look at THIS' movie about creative people trapped in the worst of urban conditions.  The ending of the film does not have Rabbit signing a multi-million dollar record deal, or marrying the girl, or becoming a superstar.  It's a small but important victory in a person's life, and keeps the entire film in perspective.  Director Curtis Hanson did the impossible: took a musical artist and turned him into a great actor in a very good movie.  Take a walk down "8 Mile," but check your cynicism at the door.<p>Final Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>I don't know quite what to make of "8 Mile". I am admittedly not much of a fan of rap music or of the movie's star, Eminem. This is not to say I haven't enjoyed some rap songs, some of which were written and performed by Marshall Mathers, AKA Eminem. <p>The movie was directed by one of my favorite directors, Curtis Hanson. To me, it does not stand up to his best works, "LA Confidential" and "Wonder Boys". Is this because those are stronger films or because the subject matter in "8 Mile" is less appealing to me? I'm not sure, but I do know this: "8 Mile" is relentlessly dark [literally and figuratively] and grim, whereas Hanson's previous efforts, though serious, were peppered with a great deal of satire and humor. What is ironic to me is that the director fails to see the satiric, humorous nature of much of rap music itself. <p>Jimmy [Eminem] grew up on the `wrong side' of Detroit's 8 Mile Road, which is a kind of boundary between the city's mostly black inner city and its predominately white suburbs. Jimmy is an angry young man who channels his frustrations into his rap music. The problem is that he's a `trailer trash white boy' [his own description of himself] trying to make it in a rap world dominated by black artists. Adding to his woes is the fact that, after packing all his things into a garbage bag and leaving his pregnant girlfriend, he is forced to live with his drunken mother [Kim Basinger] and her...boyfriend. The few bright spots in his life are his kid sister, his small group of loyal friends and his musical talent. Can Jimmy escape his fate through his music, or will he end up being just another [also-ran] in the long history of pop music?<p>Eminem is excellent as Jimmy, but whether this is because he is a fine actor or because he is playing a version of himself remains to be seen. There are certainly many parallels between his life and character he plays. <p>As a movie about pop music culture, this one is superior to most others. If only its outlook weren't so unrelentingly bleak!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I've never been a very big fan of Eminem/Marshall Mathers/Slim Shady.  However, his performance in "8 Mile," along with the compelling plotline of growing up in a tough, primarily black neighborhood as a white kid, made me respect him a little more than I have in the past.  The story shows us the trials and tribulations of a white kid growing up in a broken home with an alcholic mother in a rundown trailer park.  He faces poverty, racism, abuse from his mother and a myriad of others, as well as the typical doubts of a young man on the edge of adulthood.  This entire film is played out like a country song in rap mode.<br /><br />This is a very fine story.  If you can look beyond the vulgar language(acceptable in this atmosphere), you'll find that there is a gritty and true story to "8 Mile."  Even though Eminem's character has so many tough breaks, you learn that it is with a strong supporting group of friends and believing in yourself that you can become successful at anything you put your heart into.<br /><br />Highly recommended, though there is a heavy amount of coarse language(as stated before, it fits this film).  Also, keep the youngsters away from this film.  It's R-rated for a good reason.  For those concerned, keep in mind that this movie is full of verbal and physical abuse and some very tense moments. It also has a little sensuality in it.  Definitely for adults only.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>Does he have skills, yes. Does that make this a good movie, no. However, while the plot falls a little flat (not to bad though) the acting more than makes up for the abrupt ending and overused plot. (Think "Glitter" but with much better results). I was also very impressed with Kim (can't go wrong with that choice) and Murphy (whom I am also fond of, without Ashton). Overall this is a "kinda" must see, just for the simply fact that the hype didn't turn out to be total bull this time. <p>Also, a well deserved Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This movie is not different from Good Will Hunting & Finding Forrester.  The main character is talented & yet, flawed at the same time.  The neighbourhood is rough & he grows up faster than he should be.  Innocence is lost & survival is the key.  Like any other feel good movies, he's blessed with genuine friends who are selfless & supportive all along.  They know that he's a diamond ready to be cut but before that, he needs to be made known that he's TRULY something.  Eventually, he finds the truth & that he's courageous enough to take the next step into manhood, to be somebody.  I don't need to say more about Eminem's acting capability.  He's in his element & it's surprising to note his charisma on-screen.  It's difficult to get our eyes off him.  The supporting cast is amazing.  Brittany Murphy is convincing as a white trash girl who would "sell" her body to get somewhere; Mekhi Phiffer (the Negro doctor in ER)& Kim Basinger are all wonderful.  What made "8 Mile" even more compelling to watch is the slum neighbourhood in Detroit which the Director uses to his advantage.  Even though the story is predictable, it's still a wonderful movie to watch.  The rap scene is quite an eye-opener for someone who's new to the alternative culture aspect of United States.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>Ok, you have to admit it. Unless you're one of his hysterical teenage girl fans, or some ... admiring punk boi, Eminem probably doesn't strike you as a likely star for a movie. And when you see the trailer, well.. it looks a titch autobiographical, and probably not your speed, right?  <p>Get over that skepticism, and some night when you have little else to do, rent this. Watch it with a somewhat open mind. Ignore all the hype, expect it to be a nice and honest little growing-up film, and you'll probably enjoy it. It's very well made, and the ending is satisfying. Yes, there are cliches. Of course there are; did you really expect it to be otherwise? This *is* still hollywood. No, it's nothing like the trailers make it out to be, but that's ok; I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was anything like as cool as the trailers want you to think it is. That's the purpose of trailers, after all; to make you want to see it, awful or not. <p>If you've seen the video but not the film, the film will be a bit different from what you expect; the video is *not* (repeat: NOT) a mini version of the film. Some clips are used, but they're used out of context. This is not Eminem's autobiography. It's a sort of fable about a boy out of place in his world.<p>There are some extremely funny bits.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I was extremely impressed with Eminem's screen debut, all the more so in that I am not at all a fan of rap.  Unlike many other musical performers who try their hand at acting, Eminem is a natural in front of the camera, never coming across like an actor wannabe, never having dreadful moments in the film like one finds in similar efforts by Mariah Carey or Madonna.  Moreover, the world in which Rabbit, the rapper Eminem portrays, lives is portrayed vividly and convincingly.  It is a bleak, unpleasant, unforgiving world that offers little in the way of a future.  <p>It is not a perfect film.  Some of the characters struck me more as caricatures, like Kim Basinger's portrayal of Rabbit's mother.  The mixture of friends wasn't completely convincing.  Brittany Murphy's character is so vague as to be indecipherable.  But despite the holes, the movie at its core is powerful and convincing.<p>The central event of the film is the &quot;battle&quot; of rappers near the end.  At this point the movie feels more like a Western than anything, with young pretender to the crown of &quot;Fastest Gun in Town&quot; taking on and vanquishing all comers.  These are among the best scenes in the film.<p>But in the end, many crucial issues are left untouched.  One of the central dilemmas and contradictions of Eminem's career is his being white but having excelled in an overwhelmingly black musical genre.  This crucial issue in Eminem's career was not addressed as explicitly in 8 MILE as I would have liked.  It is referred to, but for the most part Rabbit's presence on the rap scene is accepted more than discussed.  The central question of why a white kid would become a rapper is in the end not mentioned at all.  Why did Rabbit cross over to a black musical genre?  Interestingly, at one point in the film a movie is playing on TV.  I recognized it as Douglas Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE, a 1959 film in which a beautiful, light-skinned black girl passes for white, only to meet tragedy when the white kids discover she is black.  Clearly this is intended to hint at the danger Rabbit is encountering in crossing racial boundaries, but it still doesn't answer the question of why he wanted to cross over to begin with.  Why rap instead of punk?  Why hip hop instead of a predominantly white form of music?  None of this is dealt with, but it remains the central unresolved issue in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K5IMGDCDBCNF.html">A3K5IMGDCDBCNF</a><br/><p>8 Mile is a good movie.  I don't mean it is a good debut for a rapper-turned-actor, or it is a good movie for it's genre, I mean it is a good movie.  I'm not surprised either. I've heard all kinds of word of mouth on this film, but the bottom line is that if Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential, Wonder Boys)<br />decided to make the film he must have seen something.  Whether it was in Emeinem as an actor, or the story, whatever, it works.<p>Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks in Detroit.  He goes by the stage name Rabbit when he is trying to rap, but he has terrible stage fright.  Additionally his girlfriend dumps him and he is forced to move back into his mother's trailer.  Sounds sunny doesn't it?  His motivation is clear though.  He doesn't want to be just another loser from the 313 (the area he grew up in).  His way out is music, that's it.  This isn't Hollywood.<p>The film is "losely" based on Eminem's real life.  From listening to his CD's I can pick some of these elements out, and this is important.  Eminem is good in the film.  He has screen presence, but he did not find some glossy action flick (as say DMX did), or some cheesy fluff (as say Britany Spears did), to make his feature debut.  No, he stayed true to his roots, a smart decision.  Eminem is an angry young man.  Wanna know why?  See 8 Mile.  It may not be entirely a true story, but the point is there.  This is how Eminem, the character, was created.  His real name, like Jimmy Smith, is Marshall Mathers. There is a difference.  Is he shocking? Is he vulgar? Is he violent?  The answer to all these questions would be yes.  If this was your life I think you would be too.  After all, he's not from Commonwealth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Say what you will about him as a person, but as a performing artist Marshall Mathers (a k a Eminem) has talent to spare. And one more thing - his acting's not too bad, either.<br /><br />That will surely come as a disappointment to those who were hoping for him to fall flat in his feature-film debut, "8 Mile." But he acquits himself nicely, lending credibility to a drama that examines not only hip-hop music but impoverished urban America as well.<br /><br />Which is not to say that "8 Mile" is problem-free. Despite its edgy, raw-nerved approach, the film is somewhat clichs mother (Kim Basinger) in her trailer home.<br /><br />But he has hopes for bigger things, including a career as an MC. However, when the time comes for him to actually perform his act onstage, he chokes and is unable to utter as much as a word.<br /><br />Then a series of good things happen, including the arrival of Alex (Brittany Murphy), a would-be model who sees big things in Jimmy and encourages him. Still, that's easier said than done, especially when he faces competition from a rival hip-hop crew, and even his friends and family don't really seem to believe in him.<br /><br />It should be noted that neither Mathers nor filmmaker Curtis Hanson have said that the film is a definitive biography of the controversial hip-hop star. Rather, it takes some of his real-life events and dramatizes them.<br /><br />The results are highly watchable. In fact, there might not be a more rousing moment on film this year as the scene in which Rabbit finally turns the tables on his tormenters on the stage.<br /><br />That's at least due in part to Mathers, who's quite believable. Of course, he's also got a talented supporting cast to bolster him in weaker moments. Murphy continues her string of solid performances, while both Mekhi Pfifer and Basinger are better here than either has been in quite some time.<br /><br />"8 Mile" is rated R for frequent use of strong sex-related profanity, racial epithets and explicit sexual talk, violence (beatings and some gunplay), scenes of simulated sex and simulated drug use (marijuana), brief nudity (flashes of male and female backsides) and brief gore. Running time: 106 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>Rapper Eminem is one of the biggest names in rap...period. He's sold over 40 million albums worldwide and has garnered Grammys and other awards over his near-decade career. With so much success, it was only a matter of time before a movie would become a reality, and 8 MILE makes a big case for Eminem's acting career. Boasting impressive settings, a really good cast, and gritty drama, this movie is fantastic from front to back.<br /><br />We follow the story of Jimmy Smith (aka B Rabbit) who can flow like any rapper can, but the trouble is he is wicked shy of the crowd at the "shelter" where the rap battles happen. His friends Chedda Bob, Future (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who makes a strong presence here), and his other cohorts are his friends. He lives in a trailer with his alcoholic mother (played by Kim Basinger, who is vulnerable here), and his little sister. Eminem works at the Detroit Stamping company, where the pay ain't great but the work is hard, and there is some prejudice. Jimmy doesn't exactly have the best life, but he's trying to do the best that he can. His mother's abusive boyfriend, Greg, isn't exactly helping matters either...he doesn't really like Jimmy and takes every opportunity to put him down. Eminem starts to really take his rapping future seriously, though, and when he meets a new girl (Brittany Murphy), things begin to change a bit. But pressures ride as Leaders of the Free World claim to have the best raps, and after an altercation with one of the members, Eminem gets the crap kicked out of him. But this only makes him stronger, and he intends to beat the LOTFW at the rap battles. His mother strikes it big at bingo and things really start looking better. The night of the battle, Eminem can't choke like he did the first time at the beginning of the movie, so now he's gotta show that he is the man when it comes to stepping up to the mic. His relationship with his boss at work gets much better too, so work is piling up. I don't want to give away what happens at the rap battle, but I'm sure you can guess what happens. Even the ending of the movie is really strong, with "Lose Yourself" playing in the background as Eminem walks off into the alley, having a newly restored confidence as he strolls back to work.<br /><br />The movie benefits greatly from Eminem's convincing performance. He's not just cashing the check here, he really can act. He mixes some good emotions and strong acting with impressive raps and this was bound to happen. He's good at what he does...and he's good here. The rest of the cast is good, too, with Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Pfeiffer and Kim Basinger all taking good turns honing their acting chops. Of course the rap bouts are the talk of the town, and you should find plenty to enjoy in these moments. But the quiet, anguished moments are just as strong, and the slum-like sets of Detroit ring loud and clear in this picture. All of it makes a big difference in the power and the lesson of the movie.<br /><br />So Eminem fans, fear not. Eminem does just fine in his big film debut here. You'll find a lot to appreciate here, with some laughs, some tear-y moments, and some gritty street drama. While many never thought Eminem could carry his own as an actor, 8 MILE presents a strong case for his possible future in this business. This is one tough film you don't want to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Rapper Eminem portrays Detroit factory worker and street rapper "B. Rabbit" in this poor-boy-makes-good story based loosely on Eminem's own life. Rabbit desperately wants to make a demo tape of his music and rap his way out of the trailer park and into a better life. He must cope with his venomous alcoholic mother, manipulative friends, neighborhood thugs, and overcome his own intense stage fright in order to get respect for his work and a shot at exposure. Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's most loyal and sensible friend who pushes him to do better and has unfailing confidence in Rabbit's ability to succeed. Brittany Murphy is Rabbit's unfaithful but supportive love interest Alex. And Kim Basinger plays Rabbit's dysfunctional mother, with whom he shares a love-hate relationship.<p>The verdict is still out on whether Eminem can act. Eminem is certainly convincing in his role, but I am under the impression that B. Rabbit is too close to the rapper's own experience to be an accurate judge of acting talent. Eminem's rapping talent and charisma are not in question. Even the uninitiated will be convinced that he has plenty of both, and tremendous screen presence as well. Fans of Curtis Hanson may be surprised that the director has made such a conventional  film. That's a little surprising coming from Eminem too. But the fact is that 8 Mile is a smart public relations move on Eminem's part. This is mainstream fair, complete with a mainstream crossover soundtrack. It's good mainstream fair, as is the soundtrack. And B. Rabbit is sweet enough and politically correct enough in his attitudes towards women, homosexuals and his loser friends to assuage middle-class audiences into thinking Eminem is a decent guy. I'm not saying that he isn't. I'm only saying that 8 Mile is less a convincing portrait of inner city poverty and salvation in music as it is a trailer park fairy tale, constructed in a very cliched fashion, to promote -some would say whitewash- Eminem's image for a wider audience. -Which is fine. It's an entertaining film, and Eminem has great presence. But we haven't seen the frank, brilliant, hateful Eminem who is so loved and so loathed on the silver screen yet. And who knows if we ever will.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>These kind of movies have a formula, and "8 Mile" follows it religiously. Hose off the Detroit grit and the cliches are all there: the struggling talent; the quicksand of home life; the 'friend' with connections offering a fast track to success; the relationship subplot; and, of course, the climactic musical number that secures both moral and professional glory. So don't be surprised if you feel like you've seen this one before. But you will be surprised to find that Eminem can act. I mean really.  There isn't a single moment when you see through him, which is more than can be said for plenty of A-list Hollywood stars.  I was stunned.  Less impressive are the tortuously correct scenes where the one-time bad boy rewrites his own history by drawing a distinction between being gay and being 'a faggot'.  Yet despite such lapses, Scott Silver's screenplay forges a careful path between the irritating extremes of rap/hip-hop culture - its pseudo-intellectual ramblings on race politics, and the black fetishising of white wealth - to tell a story which is actually pro-family, pro-work and pro-individual effort. It's almost Protestant. But it still doesn't resolve rap culture's inherent contradictions. To wit: if living in 'the 313' - perfectly captured by director Hanson in all its horrific squalor - is so great, so 'real', then why is everyone, including our hero, so desperate to get out? And the villain's main crimes are to have a banal real name (Clarence), and to have gone to a private school. But where do you think little Lily will be headed the moment big bro' B Rabbit (with the no less banal real name of 'Jimmy Smith') makes his first million?  Don't try to resolve it, because you won't.  Just listen to the lyrics.  Eminem's closing track, "Lose Yourself", makes the argument in 5 minutes better than Silver's screenplay does in 110: it's all about seizing opportunities, about having enough faith to take a chance on yourself.  As a story about that kind of moment, "8 Mile" works better than most in the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>A bit of a padded feel that was only natural given the simple story that had to be stretched to two hours. The part that felt most real to me came early. I attended a black university in a ghetto of Tampa, but then I bicycled home to the Busch Gardens neighborhood. Kinda like wading in the shallow end of the pool at will while Eminem was in the deep end. That's one thing I got from the movie.<br /><br />"Sweet Home Alabama," as sent up by Eminem and Future, has to be one of the funniest and most clever things I've ever seen in a movie. I cracked up and annoyed the sleeping cat on my lap.<br /><br />Chinese viewers in China might not realize Detroit's supposed to look ugly in this film. Casting Kim Basinger was a stroke of genius, since the audience's view of the actress is about as low as Eminem's opinion of his mother.<br /><br />The later excitement felt very contrived, like maybe I was watching a movie. The inevitable battle at the end was a thing of beauty to rap fans everywhere, even this old redneck in China. Too bad it only lasted 5 minutes, but DVDs allow you to skip back as often as desired.<br /><br />Oh, and just to beat you over the head with the obvious, Eminem got out of the ghetto with his words. No gats, no hos, no drugz, and he can't even play sports. Not bad, eh? I love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A29IYGR7SNPRIV.html">A29IYGR7SNPRIV</a><br/><p>It helps to have listened to some rap music but it's not a requirement for seeing and appreciating this film. Eminem is nothing less than wonderful in his first starring role and brings surprising energy and intelligence to his role as would-be rapper Rabbit. Everything about the film feels right, feels authentic--including the rivalries and the affection shared by Rabbit and his friends. The big bonus is Kim Basinger (who owns an academy award for L.A. Confidential--for reasons not at all clear to me) who pulls out all the stops and turns in a stunningly gritty performance here as Rabbit's slow-witted, beer-swilling, man-hungry trailer park mother. This film doesn't feel artificial in any way; all the sets seem realer than real and the aura of poverty is almost tangible. While the story of a young man with a dream isn't anything new, the script, the performances and Eminem elevate it beyond the ordinary. And big points have to go to the non-Hollywood ending. Reality is winning the day and then catching a bus to go back to work.<br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Curtis Hanson delivers a purely unintelligible, plot less, slice of rap drama that quite frankly has been done much better elsewhere. The entire film is a big set piece that leads up to the last minute and a half of Rabbit (Eminem) winning a rap competition. That much is good but the competition itself is given minimal screen time and instead we find Rabbit and his friends in a Detroit backdrop that looks like something from Bosnia with the trailer trash appeal to woo us all into feeling for these "kids" (Most of them grown men living with their mothers). Contrived yes, but it get worse when Rabbit's mom (Basinger) pops out of the blue with the line "We are being evicted" and with that the film is lost to stereotypical black men pulling guns, insulting people and picking fights.<p>Very few will take this film seriously enough and although Eminem merits a nod for this performance (yes he can act) the script is like something that popped out of a twelve year old Eminem fan's computer printer, and feels like it too. Oh wait a minute - this is a vehicle for Eminem fans. A quick slice of Hollywood cash making, filmed with token characters and a story won in a packet of cornflakes. Even though I like Eminem this one is a real stinker and a waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor - Buy a Eminem CD or even one of his music DVDs. This is complete and utter $$$$$$$$$$$$-making on a shoe-string concept and a plot that will boggle your mind (What is it with that girl of his? Get a brain dude!)<p>It's bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>this Movie Reminded me of "Saturday Night Fever","Flash Dance"&"Purple Rain" all Rolled into One.Eminem has a Screen pressence but the Film is choppy in spots&takes on a bit to much but the Performances work.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I didn't expect to like this 2002 film.  After all, I'm a 64-year-old woman and I don't know or care about rap music.  I am so unacquainted with the star, &quot;Eminem&quot; that I've just learned he doesn't spell his name &quot;M&amp;M&quot;.  But because this film has gotten so much attention, I  thought it would be good for me to check out what for me is a culture stranger than that depicted in the foreign films that I watch all the time.<p>The story is supposedly a fictionalized version of Eminem's own roots.  It's set in Detroit, where &quot;8 Mile&quot; is the area that separates the black and white neighborhoods.  The character Eminem plays is named &quot;Rabbit&quot; and he grows up in a trailer park with his mother, played by Kim Bassinger, who is excellent in the role.  His little sister is exposed to his mother's numerous boyfriends and it is with this little girl that Rabbit shows the most tenderness.  Rabbit works in a car plant but his whole life is about rap music and he hangs out with a group of both African American and white friends who feel the same way.<p>There are scenes in the film which show what rap is all about.  It's not about the big money and the trashy lyrics.  Instead, it's about disadvantaged people who communicate the frustrations of their lives.  Much of it is spontaneous.  And much of it is competitive, where insults fly and there's always a battle to see who will win over the audience.  And an audience can be bystanders by a lunch wagon as well as in a club.<p>I liked the part that Eminem played.  He comes across as real.  He wears a wool cap through much of the film, making his skin look very pale and his light eyes defiant. He shows vulnerability as well as strength and I rooted for him throughout.  This was not surprising because the film has a good script and is well paced with plenty of confrontations and tension.  What surprised me is how much I enjoyed the rap music.  It's all about words and being creative.  And doing it to a rhythm.  At first it was a little hard to understand.  But by the end of the film I was completely won over to rap as an art form.<p>I loved &quot;8 Mile&quot; and highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>Im not an Eminem fan and I would never have watched this film by my own choice, but having said that - I enjoyed it. So there is obviously something in there to turn it around.<br /><br />Ok, so I had absolutely no idea what people were saying for vast amounts of the film, I just managed to keep a hold of what was being rapped during the 'battles' and I followed the story by keeping my wits and looking for advice from the other people watching.<br /><br />The story basically follows the young white rapper 'Bunny Rabbit' (How this guy got into as few fights as we saw with that name I didn't know) as he struggled, not so much to get noticed and recognised, but to pull out of himself the raw talent he and his friends knew he had.<br /><br />Until this film he was an unknown, but respected within his group as good. By the end of this film by overcoming a variety of problems, being knocked back, getting a little luck, but overall walking in the right direction and trying to keep life on track (in a very subtle unspoken way too) he becomes a man who has opened a door, expressed his talent, proven he can cut it.<br /><br />At times some of the things that happen appear almost random, without justification or motive, but then, that is not to say its wrong. That is obviously the way life works here. Its not so much a feature film as a semi fictional documentary to give you some insight, some fun and some shocks. Its certainly enjoyable whether a fan of Eminem or not, in fact the only song from the soundtrack that seems to appear in the film is the title track. Its true if you hate rap you are going to hate this film, but liking it is not so much a requirement as an added benefit.<br /><br />My only real down point was that come the end, it finished. Abruptly. Walking off 'into the sunset' goes our young Eminem with so many unanswered questions. What comes next? What happens to his friends? Where does 'the girl' go? But while I thought about this I think I concluded that its good it finished like that. You can make up your own answers as to where the story goes next and that's not a bad thing in this instance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>This is probably one of the best films to come out in 2002, and yet it was snubbed by the acadamy despite all the critics praise.  Eminem pulls out all the stops here with a strong performance as a somewhat alter version of himself, a white boy growing up in Detroit with dreams to be a rapper.  What makes this film better than the weight of the plot is, first the A list cast including Kim Bassinger and Mikhi Phifer but it's the brilliant script and excelent direction that picks this movie up and carries it further then plot alone would.  Yes, this may or may not be how Eminem got his breaks in life but regardless, this film, watched as a fictional story and not an autobiography will do well to make the difference.  Eminem shows true talent as his charactor (Rabbit) tries to rise above the life he was given, the drunk mother and the slum living conditions, the ex-girlfriend who took him for everything and the dead beat friends he's determined not to become.  Rabbit wants more for himself and for his family, and he's determined to work hard to get it.  Throw in a new love interest (Britany Murphy in a peformance to make you go GA'GA) and some rival thugs and you have a simple plot turned great movie with subplots that hold your interest and keep you in anticipation of the next scene.

He was white and lived in a trailer on 8 Mile in Detroit, the line that seperates white from black neighborhoods, with his mother. He had a little sister that he loved and cared for like the dad he never knew. He had a hard labor job in a factory. He was sick of his life. He wanted to become a rapper. His break into the rap world could happen if he wins rap battles at a local club where he is seen as a failure. His life depends on that one shot. Will he take it?<br /><br />That sums up the story of 8 Mile, a surprisingly engaging flick directed by Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys) and starring rap sensation Eminem as Jimmy in his first big budget motion picture. The supporting cast includes Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as Jimmy's helpless mother, Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's friend and coordinator of the rap battles at the club, and Brittany Murphy as Jimmy's love interest and local flirt.<br /><br />What struck me the most about 8 Mile is Eminem's performance. Usually, hip-hop and rap artists can't act if their lives depended on it, but Mr. Mathers surprises the audience with a virtual emotion, humor, and subtleness that carries the film well into the climactic scene at the end where Jimmy goes against the odds to prove to himself, his friends, family, and the world that he's not just another trailer dweller from around the corner.<br /><br />The movie features the Academy Award winning song Lose Yourself, co-written and sung by Eminem himself.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>Most people's enjoyment of a movie depends on their expectations: if you've expected a masterpiece & gotten something that doesn't meet your criteria of a good film, you'll be disappointed, even if the movie itself isn't so bad in any other way.

I mean just because Will Smith, Ice Cube, Mos Def, Queen Latifah, Heavy D, and LL Cool J......okay I digress. So some hip hop artist can actually act. His acting was actually okay. In fact if I had not known that this was his first acting role, I would have thought he had been acting for a while. He seems to be a natural. He did not over, or under act. He had me convinced each time he showed emotion. I was very impressed.<br /><br /> Jimmy &quot;Rabbit&quot; Smith Jr. is down on his luck. He has to move back to the trailer park with his mom, and his littler sister, and the unemployed man his mom is seeing. The guy hates Jimmy, and Jimmy hates the guy. Nothing deep there. Jimmy has a car that likes to break down on him, and when he attempts to battle someone, he gets cold feet. Of course that was not good, and Jimmy feels he ruined any chance of seeing his dream as a hip hop star materialize, and he will never get out of 8 Mile. He works at an auto plant trying to save enough money to be able to afford some studio time. He has a bunch of friends who are in his corner. He shows major compassion for his friend Cheddar, especially when his friend gets trigger happy and accidentally shoots himself. He never teases Cheddar, but makes sure he is okay. His other friend &quot;Future&quot; is the MC at the hip hop battles, and he sees big things in &quot;Rabbit&quot;. He keeps encouraging Jimmy to do another battle, even though Jimmy does not have the confidence. His mom (Kim Bassinger) finds it more important to hid the fact she is about to get evicted from her boyfriend, then getting a job. The only way she seems to know how to get money is playing Bingo.<br /><br /> The scene that really touched me was watching his sister Lily screaming while Jimmy is getting beat up. Her role is small, but you could just tell from that scene, she loves her brother, and does not want anything bad to happen to him. You also saw his concern for her, and it made me think that's how he talks to his daughter in real life. The scenes he did with Lily showed his tenderness. I really did not see the significance for the role that Alex (Brittany Murphey) played. Too me if she had not been in the film, it would not have made a difference.<br /><br /> The movie is what it was meant to be. It was Entertaining and the extras were fun to watch. I laughed while watching the auditions for the extras to get in the battle scenes. Some of those folks were HORRIBLE, but again, it was fun to watch. You also get the video made for &quot;superman&quot; (I love that song!!! One of my favorites by Eminem). In fact after seeing the video, I actually bought his CD.<br /><br /> One of the things I really liked, when Jimmy finally wins his battle, and gets his props, what does he do? He goes back to work at the auto plant. You don't get the &quot;sappy&quot; happy ending. Of course I was really curious if he had a job to back to. I mean he wanted to get extra shifts, and when he finally get the shift he wanted, he leaves a few hours to do his battle. I know I'm not the only one who noticed that. Xzhibt had a small cameo, battling Jimmy during a lunch break scene.<br /><br /> This movie really surprised me, and I enjoyed it. It's one I would actually watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>We knew that Marshall Mathers III (a.k.a. Eminem) was a rap superstar with a lot of creativity for lyrics and rhymes, but when we heard that he was going to make an acting debut, everybody taught that he was a musician, not an actor and he was going to sunk the whole movie. But that wasn't the case.<br /><br /> In &quot;8 Mile&quot;, not only he displays his hip-hop talents, but he also makes clear that he is a complete artist with great acting skills, even if he basically is playing himself, because it's hard to step in front of a camera and give a good performance, specially when most of the people wass waiting your for him to fail.<br /><br /> &quot;8 Mile&quot; is a semi-biographical movie located in the lower-class Detroit, Jimmy &quot;B-Rabbit&quot; and his friends are hip-hop aficionados that have a dream: someday they will be the next big thing in the hip-hop world. But Jimmy's friends know that his buddy &quot;B-Rabbit&quot; is the best rapper around; he just needs to display his talents in some way.<br /><br /> The director Curtis Hanson was able to get good performances from everybody in the cast, the pace of the story is very good also, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stellar, and the music is just great. The extras in the DVD are entertaining, specially the rap battles that doesn't appear in the movie, because we can see Eminem improvising rimes and songs.<br /><br /> This is the kind of movie that is enjoyable, not only for Eminem or hip-hop fans, but it can be enjoyed by everyone. A very recommendable movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>"8 Mile" is more or less everything the trailer promised it would be, but that's not a good thing.  In this contrived rags-to-riches story, hip hop's great white hope Eminem is Rabbit, who struggles to hold down a job while living in a trailer park with his mom (Kim Basinger) and kid sister.  But Rabbit's skills as a rapper get the attention of his peers, who try to give him enough encouragement to compete in a heated hip hop face-off which may lead to a promising record deal.  Lacking both confidence and self-esteem, Rabbit avoids the challenge until he meets his love interest, played by Brittany Murphy.  From there begins an against-all-odds story that's been done before, but better ("Purple Rain" and "Rocky").  Director Curtis Hanson ("Wonder Boys," "L.A. Confidential") takes a bizarre step backwards in this movie and fails to extract any genuine emotion from the cast or its settings.  The result is a film that's as processed as a Swanson TV dinner.  Scenes that are supposed to have emotional weight drew unintended laughs from this viewer, who was left baffled as to how this became a hit other than Eminem's bankability as a star.  Women don't get a fair shake in this movie, either, for they are portrayed as irresponsible, self-centered, and promiscuous.  And the scene where Rabbit defends a gay man seems like an all too calculated move to counter arguments that Eminem is homophobic.  Speaking of Emimen, it's hard to determine how good an actor he really is based on "8 Mile."  To his benefit, he appears natural and relaxed in front of the camera, but the story mirrors his own so closely that one could argue that he's merely playing himself.  The concept of acting is that you're stepping OUTSIDE of character when delivering a performance.  In this movie, Eminem stays well WITHIN character, so, thusly, there's no performance.  The hip hop themes, its Detroit location, and its script provide an all too secure safety net for the rapper.  Not that it will matter to 15-year-olds nationwide.  Surely, the time will come when Hollywood makes a gritty and powerful hip hop drama, but until then, we're gonna have to settle for movies like "8 Mile."</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I've never been crazy about Eminem, but he makes an auspicious debut with confidence and command. Curtis Hanson, director, has always paid great attention to detail (think &quot;L A Confidential&quot;) and, once again, uses Kim Basinger to good advantage. Eminem, indeed, had a tough role; to maintain his identity while taking care of his crazy mother, and showing genuine love for his little sister; then, to deal with a flaky girlfriend and a gang of Detroit &quot;Urbanites&quot; (for wont of a better word). His performance is complete. There's a terrific 2.35:1 Widescreen, showing all the craziness of the audiences, and the bleakness of the slums. Powerful! My only complaint is, at the beginning, the music overpowered the dialogue quite often. The Sound director got it together about half way through, but there were some important dialogues at the beginning that helped you to know what his problem was, and it required a bit of attention. Eminem's music appeals to many (he wrote ALL of the music), but I chose to buy it because some reliable friends told me how good it was as drama. Yes, it's good. It's also one of those &quot;David &amp; Goliath&quot; films, where the underdog makes good. I actually like those kinds of films. Eminem did a fine job; but can he do &quot;Hamlet&quot;? Keanu Reeves did.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Undoubtedly, the surprise film of 2002 was 8 Mile, the story about a young white rapper in Detroit who struggles with his broken family, gold-digging friends, and simply to find his identity in the nefarious world in which he lives. Starring the best-selling rap artist Eminem, 8 Mile is supposedly autobiographical in nature, portraying the true life rise of Marshall Mathers from the hardened streets of Detroit to the gold paved highways of superstardom. But the film begins and ends in the ghetto, cataloguing the time prior to the rapper's success. As a movie, it performs its duties well - virtually transporting the viewer to the crime and poverty riddled neighborhoods of one of America's most dangerous cities...<br /><br />Local youth Jimmy "B-Rabbit" Smith, Jr. harbors dreams of hitting the big-time as a rapper (along with most of his peers in Detroit), but few are supportive of his efforts, especially his mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger), a self-centered woman who neglects her five-year-old daughter, remains unemployed, and generally wastes her life away. Her verbal battles with Jimmy are the only substantive part of their relationship.<br /><br />When Jimmy gets a job working on an assembly line at a sheet metal factory, he works long hours in the dead end job making just enough money to get by. Living in a trailer with his mother so that he can save up enough money for a demo tape leads to everyday confrontations with the woman. Things begin to look up, though, when Jimmy meets Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring model who shares his dreams of leaving the ghetto and pursuing a better life. But everything goes awry when Jimmy chokes at a local late-night rap showdown.<br /><br />The bad news continues when Jimmy catches Alex cheating on him, his mother kicks him out, and a gang of thugs gives him a beating - placing a gun to his head and threatening to pull the trigger.<br /><br />When the opportunity arises to perform once more in the local rap showdown, all of Jimmy's dreams hinge on his ability to pull out all the stops. Can he verbally destroy his opponent and gain the notoriety necessary to put him on the map...?<br /><br />A surprisingly well-written screenplay wrought with symbolism, 8 Mile vividly portrays the life of an angry urban youth who aches to express his hatred for the world around him. As the dividing line between the city Detroit and the outside world, 8 Mile represents was is and what can be. The film's ability to draw the audience into a world of which they may not be a part makes this a definite must-see film. For those conservative or older viewers who may be reluctant to the see the film because of its leading star Eminem, I highly recommend giving 8 Mile a chance. If you enjoy drama and peering into unique worlds, then you might be pleasantly surprised with this one...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>As many people have already said in their positive reviews, "8 Mile" is really a surprisingly good film, both gritty and truthful.  I know and you know that the film is NOT exactly what happened to Eminem, a now celebrated rapper with strong messages.  The film is a gentler and softer version of his real life, but thanks to the sure hand of director Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential fame), the total result is more than satisfactory.  And yes, though basically 'as himself', he can act pretty good.<p>'8 Mile' is a real place in Detroit where Eminem is raised, and here stands as a symbol of the borderline where two kinds of people meet.  Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers III) plays his alter ego Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith, who struggles to make it in rap music where black people are dominant.  But at the crutial moment during the amateur contest for rappers (the battle, they call it), his tongue which should be always acid fails him.<p>Then the film follows the life of Jimmy and his friends, and how he finds the way he should live his life in spite of his messy surroundings including his girlfriend (Brittany Murphey) and his mother (Kim Basinger).  The final scenes, even for the audiences like me who don't know much about rap music, are very exciting and rousing.  In fact we come to like this guy Jimmy.<p>For his avid fans, the film may look too tame, but you have to admit that film is made for wider audience in mind.  Jimmy has a sister, but fans might instead remember his (Eminem's) own daughter when looking at her.  But forget those things outside the screen for a while.  This is a story about an angry man who doesn't know into what kind of shapes he should turn the enormous anger.<p>The film has very authentic atmosphere of Detroit, and does not fail to reflect the social background of the characters.  But as I said, we should watch this one as a story with universal appeal.  If you don't like hip-hop or rap, never mind.  You just don't have to.  Because "8 Mile" has vast power to make you understand why he is so popular among his fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Even though 8 Mile can't touch Purple Rain or Krush Groove when it comes to music it was one of my favorite movies from last year. Like I said 8 Mile was clearly without a doubt one of the best movies of the previous year when it came to crowd pleasing. Director Curtis Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver have tailor made a great first movie for Eminem. In his portrayl of Jimmy Smith Jr.,Eminem gives the charcter depth and while watching the film I didn't see Eminem, I saw Jimmy. Some of the film's best scenes invole no dialogue, scenes such as Jimmy writing and anazlying his surroundings are deep and give you a feel of what a rapper goes through trying to write hye lyrics. The supporting cast all give excellent performances Mehki Phifer who serves as Jimmy's main supporter contiunes to make star making movies. Omar Benson Miller as Sol and Evan Jones as Cheddar Bob provide a lot of comic relief. With the little screen time they are given Kim Basinger and Brittany Murphy do good as the female leads. The highlight of the film is truly the battle scenes though. I give the movie ***** stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I've been trying to expand my horizons lately, which is what caused me to check out Eminem's big silver screen venture. Despite never being a fan, and despising rap in general, I have to say that this movie is better than expected. The intangibles are quite strong. The guys in his crew and the shots of Detroit are very interesting. The idea of rap jousting is also pretty novel. As far as acting goes, Kim Bassinger is a stand-out in her portrayal of Rabbit's alcoholic, promiscuous, and broken mother. In terms of the plot itself, most of it will be familiar to those who know anything about the performers' life. I'm not sure how much of the film is autobiographical but it seems like a textbook example of "writing about what you know."<br /><br />In fact, it is Eminem's treatment of himself which really brings 8 mile down, and made it just another flick. Rabbit, as a man, just isn't realistic. He's a self-righteous martyr, and, while that might be the way Eminem views himself, such an angle makes for a really boring plot. Audiences just doesn't care much about guys who are wooden. There's nothing ambiguous about Rabbit; he's a great brother, loyal boyfriend, devoted artist, blah, blah, blah. Generally, people just aren't like that. He has a great group of friends in the movie, but frankly, I'm surprised they stay with him because he's so uptight, irritable, and melodramatic. He treats his friend David "Future" Porter terribly, although, for some reason, the guy forgives him. If he were able to detach himself more from Rabbit, I'm sure Mr. Mathers could have put together a more compelling script.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>Eminem`s first experience as an actor is a surprising one, developing an interesting character in a good urban drama. Curtis Hanson is the man behind the camera here, and his past work in acclaimed movies like "Wonder Boys" or "L.A. Confidential" gave him enough knowledge and recognition to get his hands on this project. <p>The story isn`t too original, but is well told and acted. Eminem plays Rabbit, a youngster from a Detroit neighbourhood with a messed life who`s trying to find his role in the world. His main passion is hip hop, so he looks to find his future in music, getting away from a life with low perspectives and choices. <p>Hanson captures well Rabbit`s story and the atmosphere of the community he lives in, showing the conflicts he must face to achieve his goal. The realistic direction and the gritty, dark photography add a natural, credible tone to the movie, showing how`s life in those convulted suburbs. The plot is deep enough and never gets too melodramatic or politically correct, despite the somewhat preachy and predictable ending.<p>Not a masterpiece, but given that most films with or about musicians are generally weak, "8 Mile" stands above average and succeeds delivering a tension-filled and well-written story, with characters worth caring about. It`s also one of the few mainstream movies that focuses on how`s life within the hip hop (sub)cultures that continue developing nowadays.<br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>its let down by its sense that, ok, hes a rapper trying to fit in and have a good life but thats basically what we see, rapping, but theres the reason of in the end of course he's gonna outrap the people and of course this is somewhat based on his life, but Hanson does a good job with Eminem's reason for his family and thats what really brought this to a two star movie rather then a 1 star movie. Mehki Phifer with dreadlocks dont cut it as well. Murphy is annoying as Eminem's girl and Basinger trys her best but cant cut it. all in all im sticking with what I told and im staying there. plus its let down also by that guy who shoots himself, hes so boring. it was like I was sitting there and when ever something stupid would come on id try to go but then right after a good thing would ome on and id stay and thats what is was like when I watched</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>The press were not sure whether Eminem would be good or not in his debut as an actor. But his acting is great and the fact that he wrote most of the soundtrack shows that he's one of a kind. <p>I did enjoy this film; I liked it better on my second watching. Although the insults and rapping was good during the rap battles, you could see the rappers literally spitting the words if the camera went in too close. Also, the handshake between Jimmy Rabbit (Eminem) and his friends gradually got on my nerves. The worst part of the film is when Jimmy gets beaten up, and Lily is screaming in the trailer. I cannot watch that part; it's so horrible. I was constantly turning the sound up and down during this, particularly when Rabbit and his mates are out driving in the car, you can hardly hear their lines as whatever they're playing is far too loud. Also, when they're in the Shelter, and the crowd is so noisy! And then I couldn't hear what Brittany Murphy was saying, so the volume was turned back up, and then I had to quickly turn it down in the next scene!<p>Well known for her roles in Girl Interrupted, Cherry Falls, and Drop Dead Gorgeous, this will be THE film of Brittany Murphy's career. Although she normally always has dark hair, in 8 Mile and Just Married, she attempts going blonde and it really suits her. There's chemistry between Brittany Murphy & Eminem and she definitely acts like she's enjoying herself during their sex scene! Lucky Brittany!<p>Kim Basinger plays Jimmy's mum, downtrodden and without makeup, embarrassing her son with her sex life. <p>Eminem's various and prominent tattoos are notably absent during this film, most importantly during the topless shot - the makeup artists must have had fun trying to cover up those!<p>During 8 Mile you can also see and hear the progress on the song that is the theme to the film - "Lose Yourself", which is perfect for this film. <p>The finale is the highlight of the film, worth watching just for that - and Eminem looking sexy in a vest top!<p>The DVD contains: the making of; exclusive rap battles; the music of;  "Superman" music video; theatrical trailer; production notes; cast & filmmakers; recommendations and DVD-ROM features. Definitely better value than some DVDs you can get these days, which don't have much more than the trailer - if that - on them! The "Exclusive Rap Battles" is narrated by Curtis Hanson (director), and also features Eminem talking about his first time doing a rap battle. The whole sequence wouldn't be what it is without the extras; they are definitely part of it. Curtis Hanson gave four of the extras a once in a lifetime opportunity to battle against Eminem. During this, Eminem was actually losing his voice, so he mimes his words, but some of the winners start really ribbing him during their rapping, so understandably, he raps back, making this the best out of the DVD extras. It's a very brave girl who goes up to battle against Eminem, who totally ribs her during his rapping, but he hugs her afterwards. <p>My other favourite about the DVD extras is the video to "Superman", the song which made me go out and get "The Eminem Show" album. It's one of the best songs that Eminem has done, for me, and seeing the video sheds new light on the song. The only thing I didn't like about the video was the female starring alongside him - when you see close up shots she looks a LOT older than she looks from further away. The lyrics, like most of Eminem's songs, are fantastic, and I'm constantly humming it. All the video is brilliantly shot especially the shots of Eminem with 50+ women in their underwear - you can barely see him most of the time!<p>8 Mile is a must see for all Eminem fans and recommended even for non-Eminem fans. It shows Eminem in a different light, to that of his hard man, woman hating rapper persona. You need to see this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>I have to admit I didn't even know who Eminem was until "The Marshall Mathers LP" came out in the summer of 2000.  When I first heard "The Real Slim Shady" on the radio that summer, I honestly thought it was some kind of practical joke.  Could anyone's voice really be that nasal?<p>Of course, the joke was on me.  The joke's on everyone when it comes to Eminem.  The morning that "8 Mile" came out, I heard two radio hosts in New York City (a right-wing social crusader, and a left-wing civil rights lawyer) debating Eminem.  One host decried Eminem, while the other lauded him, and it's not hard to figure out which host took which side.  Obviously, once I heard the debate phrased in those terms, I simply had to go see the film.<p>"8 Mile" is well worth owning on DVD -- if nothing else, for those of us less than fluent in hip-hop, the English subtitles make the movie remarkably easier to understand.  In the theater, the film was inspirational, without being hokey.  It stands up to repeated viewings, which is the mark of a truly good film.  Director Curtis Hanson has made increasingly solid movies throughout his career (his early "The Little Dragons" was banned to the purgatory of monthly airings on the Lifetime Network in the late '80s; now he's an Oscar winner) and in "8 Mile" he pushes all the right buttons without ever producing anything phony.<p>The magic element that makes "8 Mile" hang together is Eminem... of course.  Rabbit's an anti-hero, who picks a fight every ten minutes and loses most of them.  His film romance (with Brittany Murphy) is limited to an erotic encounter in an auto-stamping factory; the would-be couple's romantic gesture involves the middle finger.  If you're expecting "8 Mile" to conclude with a triumphant record deal and a marriage proposal, you're in the wrong theater.<p>The supporting cast in "8" mile is also notable.  Mekhi Phifer, who first came to my attention with an explosive recurring role on the penultimate season of "Homicide", is outstanding as Rabbit's hip-hop mentor and would-be sponsor.  Someone named Evan Jones is quite likeable as "Cheddar Bob", quite possibly the dumbest sidekick to appear in a movie since Steve Buscemi in "The Big Lebowski".  Sample exchange: "I need some privacy." "Can I come with you?".  The third notable character is Detroit itself.  Here's one of the bleakest movie landscapes ever, and it's all filmed "entirely on location in the 313", as the film's credits tell us.<p>The extras are a little weak.  The "making of" featurette runs just 10 minutes and doesn't seem to involve any original contribution by Eminem himself.  Well done, however, is the music soundtrack options, which all you to jump directly to the scene in the movie in which a particular song appears.  You can also watch the film's excellent freestyle battles this way.<p>The finest feature on the disc is a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of the freestyle battles.  Here we see the "American Idol"-style selection process of four extras who'll get to actually battle Eminem in the movie.  The feature is all the more  riveting for the fact that this sequence didn't make the final cut.  This feature is the closest that the "8 Mile" DVD comes to actually penetrating Eminem's barriers and getting a look at the real man himself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YHKSTVSYEYTU.html">A1YHKSTVSYEYTU</a><br/><p>So here it is, the movie &#8216;debut&#8217; of Eminem, the man once referred to by President Bush as 'the most dangerous threat to American children since polio'. Directed by Curtis Hanson (previously responsible for the excellent LA Confidential), Marshall Mathers III stars as Jimmy &#8216;B. Rabbit&#8217; Smith, a wannabe rapper struggling to break of a life of poverty on the wrong side of Detroit&#8217;s 8 Mile Road. <p>8 Mile opens with B. Rabbit about to go on stage to take part in an open mic rap contest at a rap venue called &#8216;The Shelter&#8217;. Plagued by nerves, he throws up in the bathroom and down his sweater before going on stage, where in front of a cynical and somewhat hostile back audience he completely dries up in an embarrassing case of stage fright. Homeless and car-less after splitting up with his &#8216;pregnant&#8217; girlfriend he has to return to his mother&#8217;s trailer home, whereupon he disturbs his mother (Kim Basinger) mid-coital with her younger lover Greg. As if that is not embarrassing enough his mother later confides to a horrified Rabbit that she is having problems with her sex life because Greg wont go down on her. <p>Almost everything in 8 Mile suggests that this is less than fiction and whilst perhaps not quite autobiographical it is certainly quasi-autobiographical. Much like a pre-superstardom Eminem, his character Jimmy has an absentee father, he hangs around with a multiracial crew and takes part in rapping competitions. Jimmy&#8217;s mother is a drunken fool neglecting her four-year old daughter, whilst living with a no-good loser virtually the same age as her son, in a squalid trailer. Jimmy&#8217;s crew dream of becoming rap stars and see their rhyming skills as being their best hope of getting out of the inner city deprivation and urban wasteland of America&#8217;s famous motor city. However, whilst dreaming of a way out of the urban wasteland and poverty that surrounds him Rabbit still has to work a day job in a steel pressing plant where his boss gives him a hard time for his time-keeping and attitude.<p>Eminem is not just the most famous rapper in America, he is quite simply the biggest star on the planet. In the superstardom stakes he is, if you will pardon the comparison, the new Michael Jackson (without the chimp, the plastic surgery, the dance moves and with a great deal more profanity). Of course 8 Mile isn't actually Eminem&#8217;s film debut; that was in The Wash, Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg's ill-conceived remake of the 70&#8217;s flick &#8216;Car Wash&#8217;, where he made a cameo appearance as a phone-stalker psycho. As The Wash proved, rap artists don&#8217;t necessarily make great actors or great films (remember Vanilla Ice in the cringeworthy Cold As Ice anyone?) and with the exception of Ice Cube and Tupac Shakur, very few have actually made the transition from music to movies as well as this. <p>Perhaps not an obviously heroic figure Eminem's public persona has been somewhat modified in his role as Jimmy &#8216;Rabbit&#8217; Smith. Jimmy&#8217;s actions are anti-homophobic (he comes to the defence of one of his gay colleagues), he is positively passive (rather than verbally violent) to all the women in his life regardless of how much they wrong him. Indeed the movie opens with Rabbit having given his car and home away to his ex-girlfriend who claims to be pregnant and he returns to his mom&#8217;s trailer where he raps an improvised lullaby to his little sister. For much of the movie, Rabbit is a brooding somewhat introverted character. He travels to his work on the bus, headphones on, hooded and scribbling down new ideas for lyrics. However the movie and Eminem both come alive during the rap battles, which are central to the plot, where rival rappers verbally tear each other limb from limb in front of a hostile crowd. Taunting Rabbit with cries of &#8220;Elvis&#8221; and comments about his mother and their trailer park home, this is Eminem in his equivalent of Rocky&#8217;s boxing ring or General Maximus Decimus Meridus&#8217;s coliseum. Rabbit must overcome his own fears and self-doubt in order to emerge triumphant.<p>Out-with this critics will say that Director Curtis Hanson (The Wonder Boys) has deliberately restricted Eminem to a range of acting, which does not require much flexing of thespian muscle. However, this is something of a moot point because it works. Eminem looks good. It is a credible and understated performance and 8 Mile is an entertaining and uplifting movie, which showcases his great talent. As always, Curtis Hanson&#8217;s direction is flawless and he has surrounded Slim Shady with an excellent supporting cast. In particular, Mekhi Phifer (ER) as Rabbit&#8217;s best buddy &#8216;Future&#8217;, Brittany Murphy (Don&#8217;t Say A Word) as would be trashy new girlfriend Alex, Evan Jones as the dopey Cheddar Bob and Kim Basinger are all excellent. <p>Perhaps not the most original story ever told, 8 Mile has been compared to Rocky, Saturday Night Fever and A Star Is Born. However, it is refreshing to see that 8 Mile is free of a traditional Hollywood ending and instead finishes on a more realistic note with an important message; Dreams cannot be realised if all you do is dream. Hard work and perseverance are the keys to success and the only person you can totally rely upon in this life is yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>B-rabbit is a struggling rapper desperate to make it to the big time. He takes a job at a steel plant so he can save up money for studio time. He fights off gang members and has the help of his friend future. It is loosely based on Eminem's life.<br /><br />Eminem is quite the rap star today. He has sold millions of copies of cds<br /><br />that are excellent hip hip masterpieces. He has taken the world by storm and shown that White people can rap. But, he stretches himself and his persona into this movie and the movie itself is surprisingly simple and easy to watch. It doesn't seem like a biography movie because the character's names aren't the same as the real person's name. Probably, Eminem didn't want the movie to be like a "Eminem can act" vehicle for him. He had already shown his rapping skills and enforced them through out the movie, but he does pull off a good performance as B-rabbit.<br /><br />Curtis Hanson, who I find to be a okay director, seemingly could've been out of place in the hip hop culture but his direction works well with the atmosphere and location of the movie as the film as the film moves along at a fast pace set by his direction. He gets the performances out of the characters that were needed. He doesn't oversell the characters or oversap them so that they become these cheesy characters. You feel for the characters after you are done watching the movie. Curtis Hanson defines the character by the way he is portrayed on screen. We see his actions and we ulitametely root for him in the end as the credits roll and we hear lose yourself by Eminem. The movie then either sinks in or just leaves your mind and body as fast as it entered. it is one of those movies where you have to appreciate the hip hop culture and understand it to watch the movie, or otherwise you would feel incredibly lost in the mist of the movie and you will leave scratching your head and wondering what you have just watched. A solid movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>As much as I like this movie, I don't own it. So, I see it every now and then, by borrowing it from a neighbor or something. So,<br /><br />recently I saw this movie for like the 50eth time. I still really like this movie. Eminem is one of the few singers who can seamlessly cross over from singing to acting. I do however think that we will probably never see Eminem in another movie. The only reason I saw this movie was due to the fact that I liked Eminem, but the movie holds on its own, but Eminem does real well. I've read a couple reviews where people said: "Oh, Eminem is just playing himself, it's not even a performance."  In a sense he is playing himself. But what people don't realize is that playing yourself is sometimes harder to do then playing someone else. This movie is very very loosely based on accounts in Eminems life, so people need to stop saying its a biography. It's NOT! Anyway, Eminem plays Jimmy Smith Jr, or Jimmy, or<br /><br />Rabbit, or B-Rabbit, or yet again, Bunny Rabbit. Rabbit is (obviously) a white rapper living in Detroit who heads to the Shelter, a rap club, almost every night and gets stage fright, or chokes. Whatever you want to call it. The only person who sees how talented Rabbit really is, is Future(Mekhi Phifer,<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead). Future is kind of Rabbits mentor. Like Mr.Miyagi was to Daniel in "The Karate Kid". Rabbit lives at home with his mom (Kim Basinger, The Door in the Floor) and his sister Lilly. The sister is semi-based on Eminems daughter Hailie. He works at a stamping factory and thats where he meets<br /><br />Alex (Brittany Murphy, Little Black Book). Alex is kind of a free spirited...Sl*t. To say the least ya know. So, we have:<br /><br />Rabbits Mom: Based on Ems Mom. Except the love in this movie is a lot stronger.<br /><br />Alex: Seems to be a little like Kim. Anyone?<br /><br />Lilly:Hailie?<br /><br />So, yes. In a sense its a biography. But this is a very entertaining and terrific film. You don't have to like rap, you don't have to like Eminem. But you should like this film.A+</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>A disapppointing film about the underground culture of rap battles, modern versions of doin' the dozens that many aspiring MCs dream will make them stars.  Speaking charitably, I don't think it was the fault of ultra-charismatic rapper Eminem that he was cast in the role of Ron Howard in this inner-city update of "American Graffiti," but it's still a shame that the weak script and sluggish direction didn't provide better opportunities for him to explore his acting range. While the messed-up, derelict trashiness of the blight-striken 'hoods of Detroit is shown with crisp, gritty detail, the social nuances of the hip-hop scene are reduced to a near-cartoonish simplicity, in which Eminem (as "B. Rabbit," his character's street name) and his too-goofy crew run up against the obnoxious swaggering of the Free World, a musical group that has already made it, and lords it over the rest of the scene.  Too much time is spent building up numerous plot points that show how desperate and depressing Rabbit's life is -- the movie simply bogs down, and if we could have seen about half as much of this stuff, and about three times as much actual rapping, things would have been much, much better.  While "8 Mile" probably succeeds in making underground hip-hop culture accessible to mainstream America, it probably would have been a better movie had it been played a little tougher.  Several aspects of this film rang false, particularly the overly-likeable Fat Albert gang that Rabbit hangs out with, and the gratuitously [promiscous] scenes with his new girlfriend, played by Brittany Murphy, as well as the unfortunate absence of a wall-to-wall, booming soundtrack.  The film does access a hidden culture, but it does so at the expense of subtlety and directorial finesse.  It's surprising that Chris Hanson, who made a taut thriller like "LA Confidential," could let such a juicy story like this lapse into tedium.  Plus, what a drag that Mekhi Phifer (the aptly-named Dr. Pratt, of TV's "E.R.") was cast as Em's best bud... Phifer is one of the most leaden and overly-obvious actors around; couldn't they have found *anyone* who would be more fun to watch for two hours?  Anyway, I guess that while this wasn't the dramatic breakthrough for Eminem that many reviewers said it was, that it's still an okay film.  If nothing else, in his climactic rap-battle scene, he got the opportunity to present his blueprint for how white kids who are into rap can diffuse the race-baiting of their critics: look 'em in the eye and say, "Yeah, so?  What's your point?" It would have been nice if the other 110 minutes of this film offered as much of a message, but I guess you can't ask for everything.</p></br></body></html>

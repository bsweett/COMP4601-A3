When our four heroes return to Narnia, it is actually a millenium later.  But the ensuing movie is just as exciting as the first one, with even some romance thrown in at the end.  Like any good fantasy movies, Prince Caspian has several grand battle scenes, creatures of various species interacting with each other in English, great swordfighting, and some double-crossing, both by good guys and by the bad guys.  All in all, a great 2+ hours of movie-watching experience.  Some of the movie does take part in the night, so turn of the lights while watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>I've not read the book this movie was based on. So, I don't know how much different it is from the novel.<br /><br />The scenery is poetic and attractive. The best thing about this film is the spectacular special effects, especially the water creature and the mice. They look life like. There is some good humor too. For example, when the cat was tied up by the mice. The fighting scenes are realistic and exciting. The sword fighting between Peter and King Miraz is tense and engaging.<br /><br />The big problem is it has very little dialogues. That does not help me connecting with the characters. This movie is all about action and beautiful pictures. It's still a good movie for kids.<br /><br />For this kind of genre, Lord of the Rings is still the only one on my Favorite list.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>It's rare for a sequel to outshine the original. "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian" is more focused, more exciting, more interesting, and much more entertaining than 2005's "Narnia" film, "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe." The main characters are less aimless and enigmatic. The story is far more engaging. Everything in general is smoother and more developed, which is wonderful for anyone in need of a good fantasy story. It shouldn't matter if you've never read any of C.S. Lewis' original books, because in all honesty, it makes absolutely no difference--one should judge this film on its own terms and not make pointless comparisons to the source material. The important thing is that it's a good movie, plain and simple. On the whole, it very nearly gave me everything the first film did not.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" begins in the world of Narnia when Prunaprismia (Alicia Borrachero)--queen of the Telmarines--gives birth to a son. This is good news indeed for her husband, Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), because he finally has a male heir to take the place of his nephew, Prince Caspian X (Ben Barnes), who he plans to murder. Caspian's teacher, Dr. Cornelius (Vincent Grass), has known of Miraz's dastardly plan all along, so he helps Caspian escape into the woods; there, the young Prince is attacked and taken captive by a pair of dwarves, but not before blowing a white horn shaped like a lion's head.<br /><br />This brings the story into 1950s England, where we're reintroduced to the Pevensie siblings: Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley). After breaking up a fight between Peter and a group of schoolboys, the four siblings are magically transported from a subway station back to Narnia. They quickly realize that things are not as they were when they left: ruins of once great structures are scattered all throughout; the trees no longer dance; the great lion Aslan is nowhere to be found, and neither are the other magical creatures. They then save a bitter dwarf named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), after which they learn the truth: while the siblings have aged only one year since leaving, Narnia has aged hundreds of years. 1300 years, to be precise. It isn't long before they meet Prince Caspian, who comes to and realizes his destiny is restore peace between the Narnians and the Telmarines.<br /><br />Obviously, this has turned his world upside down. Narnia began for him as nothing more than a fairy tale; until recently, he never believed that magical creatures even existed. When he realizes that such creatures do exist, he learns that his people conquered Narnia hundreds of years ago, leading to centuries of hostility and mistrust. Since Caspian was the one that called back the Pevensies with the horn, the few remaining creatures decide to form a truce with him and work towards peace. But this can only be done with the help of the four siblings, who after 1300 years remain the rightful kings and queens of Narnia. They join with Caspian knowing that difficult times lie ahead, especially since Aslan is still missing. When a raid on Miraz's castle goes horribly wrong, tensions grow between Peter and Caspian. Both selfishly try to prove themselves when they're supposed to be allies. Peter, for one, is brave and good-hearted, but he's also impulsive, believing he never needs help because he's always in control of the situation.<br /><br />On the same token, Caspian lets his hatred for Miraz overshadow his main mission, which is to help the Pevensies fight; it reaches a point when he's tempted by a dwarf named Nikabrik (Warwick Davis) to resurrect the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), whose soul is trapped in an icy netherworld. The only one who seems to have a handle on the situation is Lucy, who always hoped she would someday return to Narnia, unlike Susan, who has just begun to get used to England. Lucy clings to the hope that Aslan is somehow guiding them all towards something, even when no one else believes that she's seen him. All this eventually leads to a battle near the end of the film, one that's interwoven with a climactic swordfight between Peter and Miraz. The final part of the sequence features a creature made entirely of water, a creature so impressive I was disappointed with the filmmakers for giving it such little screen time.<br /><br />Most of the film shows the same level of creativity, with talking badgers and centaurs and marching armies of trees included at one point or another to enhance the experience for the audience. Talking creatures have often been a lot of fun in fantasy stories, especially since they usually add a little comedy relief. The funniest character in "Prince Caspian" is a talking mouse named Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard), who, despite his size, is actually quite skilled with a sword, even if it's no bigger than a pencil--"Yes, I'm a mouse," he says just before slitting the throat of a castle guard. Even if that one moment was more disturbing than it was funny, I still feel that, overall, "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian" is a wonderful fantasy adventure. I finally felt the magical spark that eluded me in "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," an ambitious and well-intentioned film with an unfocused, underdeveloped story. I can't say how well made future "Narnia" films will be, but there's reason to hope for the best if they follow the same trend as "Prince Caspian."</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie was decent. The creatures were very good. The scenery was good. For the most part, the deviations from the plot of the book were understandable. However, the whole Aslan revealing himself to the children, first to Lucy, then to Edward, then Susan and Peter was really key to the whole plot and lessons to be learned from the story. Lewis was trying to tell a good story, but he was passing on spiritual truths of Christianity as well. Edward, gets a "Well Done" from Aslan in the book because he trusted Lucy this time. The movie missed this "walk of faith" analogy almost completely. Although it did have Edward redeeming himself so to speak in a scene that isn't in the book.<br /><br />Oh well, the movie kept a lot of the good scenes of the books. I enjoyed it and I'll have to watch it again. Some of the changes were good. Even though PC was mainly about the war to free Narnia, I think they played up the battle too much. It will be interesting to see how they handle "The Horse and His Boy", which only has one battle and "Dawntreader" that has no battles.<br /><br />One other thing that ticked me off, Aslan sends Peter and Susan back, if memory serves, and tells them that they must learn to seek him there (back in England). The movie skips that part, which I thought was a key lesson from the book.<br /><br />The movie introduced a romance between Caspian and Susan. I think that was cool.<br /><br />In summary, the movie was good, but it could have been so much better. It's a children book and it feels like they are ramping up the action for adults. However, it's the adults that can take the subtlety. By the way, my friend from England thought the movie was better than the Lion, the Witch and Wardrobe.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>One year after they returned to their normal lives in England, the Pevensie children return to Narnia, this time to help Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), a Telmarine prince, defeat his usurping uncle and restore peace and order to Narnia.<br /><br />All of the newspaper reviews that I have read of this film, and of its predecessor, "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" have been very mediocre, and I don't understand why.  I thoroughly enjoyed both of these movies and consider them to be among the best of the wave of children's fantasy movies that have appeared in cinemas, following the success of the "Harry Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" films. In fact, I preferred the Narnia films to the both of these above-mentioned series. I thought they were considerably more exciting and thought the children to be far more realistically portrayed than Harry Potter and his friends.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" is essentially a war film and the film mostly comprises a series of battles. In other hands, over two hours of cinematic battles could be the sort of thing to put some audience members to sleep, from the sheer repetitiveness of what is going on, but writer/director Andrew Adamson brings enough variety to the action and also includes enough character interaction between the battles to maintain the audience's attention and to make them care about whether our heroes actually win or not.<br /><br />Be aware, in most countries this movie has a PG (or equivalent) rating, which suggests that this film is suitable for children. Although there is no swearing or sex, and no one actually bleeds in any of the battles, there are many elements to this film that could potentially disturb young children. When I saw this film, a family with young children was sitting behind me, and one of the children spent the film sitting in his mother's lap, hiding is face from the monsters and other "scary" creatures that were appearing on the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>This is a good movie, yeah, but not, like, really good. For one they just changed way too much from the book. I mean yeah, things will change in movie adaptions of books, but this one took it a bit too far. For one, that little romance with Susan and Caspian was just stupid. Peter and Caspian bickering all the time was also stupid. A few other things, too, but I won't go into them. It's a pretty good movie, but not great. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>NOTE: If you have not seen or read "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe," this review may constitute a spoiler.<br /><br />Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are called back to Narnia by a blast from the hunting horn Susan left behind when they left there a year ago. That's a year in London, but it has been over a thousand in Narnia. Why? Because Narnia is threatened by the takeover of Miraz, Prince Caspian's wicked uncle who killed Caspian the Ninth. Our prince is the Tenth, but may not live to rule at this rate. Miraz' wife has just presented him with a son and heir, and he has no need for Prince Caspian anymore. Indeed, he has plenty of reason to want him dead. And not just because he's way, way better looking than his rotten uncle, either. Although that turns out to matter a good bit to Queen Susan.<br /><br />When the children return to Narnia, they are not yet aware of what called them back. They are delighted to be there until they realize that the ruins on the top of the hill are actually of the castle where they had ruled. It's been something like 1,300 years since they left, and Narnia was conquered not long after they returned to London. They encounter dwarfs who remember that there had been The Kings and Queens of Old, as well as Aslan, whom they have not seen in a long time. The dwarfs, the talking animals, the centaurs and minotaurs, and assorted stalwart denizens of Narnia, take on the evil Miraz, who has crowned himself king, and his minions. So most of the story centers around warfare of one sort or another, but it's not blood-splashing warfare.<br /><br />To me, the highlight of the film is when King Peter, stalling for time as much as anything because Lucy has gone to find Aslan, challenges King Miraz to single combat, with the winner to accept the total surrender of the loser. We all know Miraz won't play fair, as just before the combat starts, he whispers to his minister to use his crossbow if the battle seems to be going against Miraz. I'm not going to give anything away here, because it is pivotal to the plot as well as the most dramatic part.<br /><br />And don't blame me if you get to feeling maybe Narnia and Middle Earth have a great deal in common. As Joseph Campbell would doubtless point out, both are based on classical hero myths, and so it's not surprising if they seem somewhat similar, right down to the giant elemental who . . . no, won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />It's fun. I didn't like it quite as much as I remember liking Narnia 1, but I liked it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>it's great movie .. with great transfer video dan audio from standart to high definition. with 2 disc bd and 1 digital copy it's great option to have than narnia dawn treader. a lot of bonus feature from disc 2 makes you have a lot experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is the second installment in the Narnia series and was filmed in 2008. This time the directors have taken more liberties with the plot and storyline and it is not as faithful to the novel as the first movie. Still the movie is a very nice fantasy movie that has Christian and religious elements to it. Lucy's great faith in Aslan makes her connection to him unique as the others have more doubt. The special effects are great and the music is truly magnificent. A movie to enjoyed by older children as some of the scenes might be a bit scary for wee ones. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Imagine finding a magical kingdom in another world... only to return over a thousand years later, and find it in ruins.<br /><br />That's the whole idea of "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian," a superb sequel to "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe." While it has a climax that goes on WAY too long, this movie shows us the darker side of C.S. Lewis' fantastical world -- with a heavy dose of Shakespearean villains, political intrigue, and some spectacularly epic battles.<br /><br />It's been 1,300 years in Narnia, and the human Telmarines have invaded and driven the native Narnians underground. Aslan hasn't been seen in centuries.<br /><br />And when King Miraz's (Sergio Castellitto) wife gives birth to a baby boy, his nephew -- the rightful heir -- becomes an obstacle. Young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) flees from his treacherous uncle, and is discovered by a band of Narnians. Along the way, he accidentally ends up summoning the ancient Kings and Queens of Narnia -- also known as the Pevensie children, who were waiting at a train station when they were unexpectedly sucked trough a tunnel.<br /><br />Though initially delighted to have returned to Narnia, the Pevensies are horrified when they find that their once-idyllic land has been nearly destroyed. Caspian has been organizing a ramshackle army of native Narnians, but Peter (William Moseley) finds that fighting an organized, armed force is very different from battling the White Witch. And after a disastrous attack, the Narnians are facing almost certain destruction -- but Lucy (Georgie Henley) is convinced that Aslan can somehow save them, and restore the kingdom to Prince Caspian....<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" is definitely a darker story than its predecessor -- good guys die, coups fail, evil machinations succeed, the castles are grimy, some of the good guys turn bad for real, and a bleak, hopeless feeling suffuses much of the movie's second half. Even our heroes have to deal with their doubts and anger, especially since Aslan is conspicuously absent for 95% of the entire film.<br /><br />And if the first film was a colorful fantasy adventure, then this one is a military story with all the necessary action trappings -- spectacular aerial drops, castle-wide massacres, and a spectacular finale involving a massive pit, tree roots, a river, and catapults. But Adamson also packs in as much violence as a PG-rated movie can contain -- while there's only a few drops of actual gore, there's plenty of beheadings, shootings and stabbings.<br /><br />But Narnia itself has lost none of its charm, and Adamson lingers lovingly on the sunlit forests and quiet rivers for as long as he can. And though the story is grim, he sprinkles it with plenty of humor (the bound-and-gagged cat) and fairly snappy dialogue. One of the most spectacular scenes involves a very familiar character speaking from inside a sheet of shimmering ice, as Caspian is dragged into a necromancer's ritual. It's really rather creepy.<br /><br />Problems with the movie? Well, the climactic battle drags on for a LONG time, and every time you think it'll end, it revs back up. And those masked soldiers are a wee bit too reminiscent of "300's" Persians.<br /><br />The four Pevensie actors all do solid jobs, although William Moseley is the standout -- Peter is struggling with doubt and a bit of alpha rivalry, especially since he's used to being Narnia's top dog. Barnes starts off a little stiffly -- come on, where's the fear when you see your bed turned into a pincushion? -- but soon grows into the difficult role of a Hamlet-like prince who is struggling to become both a Narnian friend and a Telmarine king.<br /><br />But there's a pretty brilliant supporting cast as well: Castellitto is simply outstanding as the ruthless, icy-cold Miraz, as are Dami&aacute;n Alc&aacute;zar and Pierfrancesco Favino as his scheming advisors. Warwick Davis does a low-key, malevolent turn as Nikabrik, while Peter Dinklage is the likably brusque, cynical Trumpkin. And Eddie Izzard is top-notch as the mousy swashbuckler Reepicheep -- this could have a silly, comic-relief character, but he does end up being both adorable and formidable.<br /><br />There are going to be two versions of the "Prince Caspian" release in either blu ray or regular versions. The more embellish DVD version basically has the film, plus an extra bonus disc with the stuff you'd expect in such a movie: bloopers, deleted scenes, and a series of featurettes about the making of the movie -- previsualization, fight choreography, sets, special effects, and the guys who play the dwarves Trumpkin and Nikabrik. As for the third disk, it's going to be a downloadable digital version of the movie.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" drops the children's fantasy feeling, in favor of a darker, more militaristic story -- especially with all that father-murder stuff. But despite its darker overtones, it never forgets the light side.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"Prince Caspian," the second installment in the "Chronicles of Narnia" series, takes place one year AND 1,300 years after "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe." The Kings and Queens of Narnia, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, have only been absent from their kingdom for one year in London time. However, when they are suddenly called back to the magical world, they discover that 1,300 years have passed since their reign. The Narnia they knew is now in ruins, and the throne rightfully belongs to the young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). Unfortunately, Caspian is on the run from his uncle Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), who is determined to kill his nephew, take the throne for himself, and secure a royal future for his newborn son. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy eventually join forces with Caspian and attempt to reclaim the throne and restore Narnia to what it once was.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, but not nearly as much as the first film in the series. Part of the reason for that is because "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" has always been my favorite book in the C.S. Lewis series, so I knew "Prince Caspian" wouldn't measure up for me. However, I still think the film itself had some shortcomings. The filmmakers took more liberties with this film than with the last one. Certain things happen out of sequence, and other parts of the film were changed slightly just for the sake of changing them, which really bothers me. Also, the whole Susan/Caspian romance is NOT in the book, and it really pisses me off that Disney felt the need to throw some cheesy love story into the mix of things. (I also hated the sappy, crappy music that played at the end of the film. It was totally out of place. Yuck.)<br /><br />Still, there are a lot of positive things about the movie as well. The battle scenes are fantastic and the special effects are outstanding. Barnes and Castellitto are the stars of this movie, and they deliver very strong performances. Eddie Izzard provided the voice for Reepicheep the mouse, which was a pleasant surprise. One of my favorite scenes in the film is the one where the White Witch returns for a few minutes, and Tilda Swinton appears in a brief cameo. Liam Neeson also returns to provide the voice of Aslan, but the lion is absent from most of the film, and I remember him being present in the book a bit more...why in the world would they cut Aslan's scenes from the film?! He's the best part of the whole story!<br /><br />All things considered, "Prince Caspian" is a good movie, but it lacks some of the magic from the first "Narnia" film. Bummer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>This is the 2nd installment of the movie adaptations of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia.  In this, much of our beloved characters have returned along with a few new faces as well.<br /><br />After being away for awhile, the Pevensie children find themselves being whisked back to Narnia and dumped on to what once was their home.  Realizing that it is hundreds of years later, they wonder why they have been brought back.  When they rescue a dwarf and learn that a Prince is trying to free the Narnians from years of oppression they know they have to help.  But Aslan isn't around to help as much this time, and their foe seems unbeatable.<br /><br />Characters:<br />William Moseley: Peter Pevensie<br />Anna Popplewell: Susan Pevensie<br />Skandar Keynes: Edmund Pevensie<br />Georgie Henley: Lucy Pevensie<br />Ben Barnes: Prince Caspian<br />Liam Neeson: Aslan<br /><br />Once again all of the characters were well cast and I was glad the original characters came back for this sequel (and subsequent ones).  The continuity always helps in a series.  Peter was kind of annoying in this movie, but I think he was supposed to have some strife so I guess that explains the motivations. Lucy was still as wonderful as ever and it was amazing to see how Georgie Henley grew up.  I liked the addition of Reepicheep as well as he is always amusing in his daring mousy ways.<br /><br />This movie mostly stuck close to the book.  There wasn't too much changed anyway.  All the main aspects of the book were included, such as the Uncle's deviousness and Prince Caspian's will to fight for the Narnians.  I do have to complain about the amount of battle scenes in this movie.  Maybe some people enjoy it, but for being an exciting clash of war, I actually got bored with it because it went on so long.  It jus seemed like more was devoted to the battle scenes than to the actual storyline itself.  So much could have been added that wasn't.<br /><br />The special effects, once again, were tremendous in this movie.  The centaurs and other creatures came to life.  The music too was wonderful as usual.  Still hauntingly beautiful and completely fitting to the tone of Narnia.<br /><br />It still wasn't a terrible movie.  Quite good when you think about book to movie's that have come before.  If you enjoyed the first, you'll surely enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I will say this - the books top the films hands-down, but that does not mean the movies are bad. Special effects are nice, and despite the differences between movie and book, this is still a good movie. Not everyone is going to love it, but I found it an enjoyable film, and the actor who played Caspian did a nice job. I also liked the scene in the beginning that explained why Miraz wanted Caspian dead, it offered a bit more depth than the one in the book.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>If you liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>, I think you'll love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPH2">The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</a>. Technically, as a piece of cinematography, the latter stands as a marked improvement over Andrew Adamson's first Narnia film. Better acting, better special effects, even better soundtrack. The plot also has more twists and turns, from the raid on the castle to the internecine fighting among the Telmarines.<br /><br />The Pevensie kids feel more comfortable with their roles, raising the level of acting up a notch. Between his accent and youthful demeanor, Ben Barnes has the right mix of prince and adventurer to fill the role of Prince Caspian. Peter Dinklage as the dwarf Trumpkin is a great addition, injecting sarcasm and cynicism into the dialogue. Even the minotaurs seem like better actors. When the rest of the army flees the enemy castle, a minotaur holds the gate open. That one act of self-sacrifice transforms the non-human Narnians into real characters, worthy of compassion, rather than mere special effects.<br /><br />For me, what makes this film much better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> is the rich villains. The Telmarines are a truly byzantine tribe of humans who invade the land of Narnia. They display a vile mix of treachery and military ethos that the White Witch, minotaur costumes, and CG wolves from the first movie just couldn't match. Their effectiveness really comes through during the raid on the castle. That battle - my favorite part of the entire film - is riveting and emotionally complex. The despair that seeps among the Narnian ranks after that defeat makes  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> a richer and more engaging movie than its predecessor.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPH2">The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</a> doesn't break much new ground, and the general plot is the same, with an epic battle at the end. However, it represents a marked improvement over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a> as a film. It's somewhat more mature and engaging, but still appropriate for kids.

Not a lot by any means, and not enough to probably give it a second thought, but certain things gave this movie a more mature feel to it. The movie itself starts off slow, and slowly progresses, but once the first major fight scene comes up it barely falls off much.<br /><br />The Lion returns in this effort which by the time half of the movie was over, I was surprised to see, and the Witch from the first one also makes a small return.<br /><br />If you are worried if this is going to be too violent for a kid, I'd say overall it's not. The 1-3 year olds won't sit and watch it that much and the older ones, say 8 and up will find it engulfing and magical as I did. Sure, there is a done-that-been-there feel to it since the movie's first incarnation but Narnia: Prince Caspian is sure to please loyal fans and new fans alike.<br /><br />The ones I'd worry about watching it is probably the more impressionable 4-6 year olds. It may be a bit too intense for them but overall, anyone can view this movie and take something from it.<br /><br />Many have said that this wasn't as good as the first, but in contrast, I must disagree. This one had a special flair to me. Both movies may be a bit on the long side, but I enjoyed them to a good degree, especially when the first introduced itself in 2006 and I went to the theatre to see it.<br /><br />3.75 stars.<br /><br />end note: No, I don't usually rate like that but this movie deserves it.

When they call for help, the four Pevensies (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, and Anna Popplewell) are magically summoned from England to resume their roles as the defenders of Narnia.<br /><br />Those who have read C.S. Lewis's gentle parables may be jarred by the shift in atmosphere.  This is a dark, grim, and scary film, which didn't bother me but may give some parents pause.  I enjoyed the scenes of court intrigue among the nobles of Telmarine, but children would probably be bored.  There are some very lengthy and violent battle scenes that were glossed over in the novel but take up the lion's share of screen time here.  These are not necessarily criticisms, just warnings to those who expect director Andrew Adamson and his co-scripters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely to remain true to the spirit of the books.  I found this film to be overlong but exciting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>While many were expecting The Chronicles of Narnia to be flops as films, no one would have expected the first instalment to be on of the highest grossers at the box office. Now with the second installment of hopefully 7 films the world of Narnia takes on a very different shape.<br /><br />The same actors who played the Pevense children are back to reprise their roles, but Narnia itself is no longer a world filled with fantastic creatures and magic. 1300 years after the defeat of the White Witch Narnia has been taken over by a ruthless leader who wants Narnia to be a...normal place. A place that will appear just as bland and ordniary everywhere else. It it now up to the Pevense children to return an rescue Narnia from this new menace and discover the true king of Narnia, Prince Caspain.<br /><br />I was very surprised by this film. Much like the first Narnia film it was not an incredible movie, but it was just as enjoyable and the atmosphere was a little more dramatic and mature. There is a lot of dramatic sword fights and meaningful moments between the characters and the new roles are played well by actors such as Eddie Izzard and Ben Barnes. Now we have to see what the next film will bring. There is new leadership for these future projects now that Disney as given the project to Fox. I am hoping that the rest of this story keeps the same elements that made the first two movies enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Sometimes a first-time big-budget feature film director achieves great things with a fresh vision and new ideas.  This is not one of those times.  The director, who has helmed big-budget animated features, has never directed a big live-action film, and it shows.  The direction is amateurish at best.  The camera work and editing are baffling in many places.  Why have an aerial shot pointing straight down for 5 seconds as our heroes go underground, when that aerial shot tracks over some grass and rocks for 5 more seconds only to go to a fade to black transition to the next pointless shot?  And parts of the movie that should be dramatic turn out to be laugh-out-loud funny (and not in a good way).  The Mexican standoff in Miraz's chambers is the prime example of this.  And the Telmarine accent - hoo boy!  Let's just say that whenever one of the Telmarines speaks, you can't help thinking of Inigo Montoya from the far-superior "Princess Bride."<br /><br />The true problem with this movie is the script.  Purists will decry any change to the source material in a motion picture; the problem is that changes necessarily have to be made to cram a novel into a 2.5 hour movie.  However, the changes here are enormous, and to no good end.  It's still unclear what's happening in half the movie, who the characters are, and why we should care.  The first Narnia movie excelled in plot and direction; "Caspian" is a letdown in both areas.  Let's hope that the experienced director heading "Dawn Treader" at Fox can do better.  Completists will have to watch this; for others, it's a pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>The first Chronicles of Narnia movie, "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe" came out around the time that many fantasy books were being bought up and while it wasn't as affecting or as memorable, it did do its job well despite some dodgy CGI and some ineffective directing during battle scenes. But it was still a success so out of the 7 books written, the next to be made was "Prince Caspian" but instead of releasing it at the time of Christmas like last time, Disney decided to play with the big boys and put it in the summer, being effectively sandwiched by "Iron Man" and the 4th "Indiana Jones" and let's not forget about that certain bat movie. So "Prince Caspian" grew less and people didn't like the tone but will it find a bigger audience at home or was it possibly too dark and not enough magic?<br /><br />The Pevensie children, Lucy, Peter, Edmund and Susan, have been living in England for a year trying to get back to normal which is tough after saving the magical kingdom of Narnia. Out of the blue, they're returned to Narnia only now it's almost abandoned with nary a creature in sight, only ruins. Seems that near a millennium has passed in the land of Narnia and thanks to Telmarines, the race of men, the citizens of Narnia have been all but extinct. Rightful heir to the throne is Prince Caspian who's been targeted by death by his uncle Miraz who wishes to take over the throne and so with the help of the Pevensies and the Narnians, Caspian hopes to defeat the incoming soldiers.<br /><br />It's usually common practice for the second film in a series to be a little bit more darker in tone or at least more adult, thinking being that since you've grown since the last book/movie, so have the characters. But then again, Narnia is a children's series of books with adult fans and an adaptation that screams for something more exciting so it's kind of like the "rock and a hard place" saying. Go too dark and you've alienated mostly everyone whereas if you keep the warm, friendly family tone then you're just lightweight fun and nothing more. And I can say that "Prince Caspian" does maintain an excitement about it and the last battle is quite awesome however the tone and even the pacing of the film feels a bit...off and whereas the previous film had many moments of otherworldlyness and fantasy moments, this film feels more like a normal adventure film with characters in it from fantasy. Maybe if they ever make the third they'll combine the 2 and make it better but this film feels less fantasy and more adult than you'd hope a film like this to have.<br /><br />That being said, many elements have been improved on from the quality to the animation (save for a dodgy late film sequence involving a river) to the character performances and even Adamson's directing skills have been a little bit more improved and despite some complaints about it being too different than last time, it's still engaging and keeps your interest though I wish Aslan had a bigger role though he is that secret weapon that when unleashed, practically owns everything in the room, his limited involvement kind of hurts it and he might as well be a cameo or at least to show you that despite the talking mice and dwarves, the lion is still in the movie. Then there's the odd brief sequence from a character from the last movie that kind of gives a "what was that for?" feeling. But the villain is just as sinister as Tilda Swinton was and Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse voiced by Eddie Izzard is memorable (though sadly not used frequently) and you have a movie that works well enough for adults and even kids might like it though might need to turn down the volume a little. Even the entrance to Narnia itself this time is rather...loud.<br /><br />The Narnia films seem to be the easiest contender to fit alongside "Harry Potter" and the "Ring" films for some of the better fantasy adaptations but there just seems to be something not getting across, something that feels bigger than the sum of its parts where it turns from a good book adaptation to a great movie, period. "Prince Caspian" is worth a look but it might not be anything more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>Prince Caspian is the second film in the Narnia franchise and definintly avoids a lot of the miss falls of sequels, becoming a very worthy addition to the franchise.<br /><br />The film continues on after the first film, with the Pevensie children returning to Narnia a year after their first adventure. But as they look around them, they realise that this is not the same Narnia of which they remembered. It turns out that over a thousand years have passed and Narnia has been invaded by the Telmarine's, who have pushed the Narnians into extiction and hold over the land with an iron grip. The children are now forced to take back their land, with the aide of the exiled Telmarine Prince Caspian, who seeks the throne from his murderous uncle Miraz.<br /><br />Like many fantasy films, this sequel is darker then the first, with a lot more action and battles then in LWW, which should appease fans who found that the action was skimping. The effects have also improved a lot as well and the addition of such characters as the mouse Reepicheep and Trumpkin the drawf adds some comic relief.<br /><br />While this is a good sequel, I still don't think it exceeds the first film and that although there is a good dose of action, the magic dosen't really feel that present. However, I still think fans of the books will love this installment and will be waiting for the next one to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>I still remember all the hype surrounding the first Chronicles of Narnia films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and for all that hype, for all that attention it received (due mainly to the success of The Lord of the Rings films) it ended up being nothing more then a kiddy version of Peter Jackson's epic masterpiece, Lord of the Rings, for kids as it were. I never understood the hype about the first Narnia movie; it really wasn't anything more than a 3 star film, hardly worth gushing over. Not Prince Caspian though, the second installment of films based on C.S. Lewis's classic books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0066238501">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>.<br /><br />1,300 years have passed since the kings and queens of Narnia, Peter the High King, Lucy, Susan and Edmund left Narnia. In the time since, a race of men called the Telmarins have invaded the peaceful nation of Narnia and driven the magical inhabitants, the talking beasts, the dwarfs, centaurs, minotaur's, griffins, everything into hiding, fearing for their lives. Prince Caspian is the rightful heir to the thrown of Telmar but his scheming uncle Miraz has just had a son, a son he hopes will someday become king. In order to make this happen, however, he must first get rid of the rightful king, which sets off a chain of events eventually leading to an uprising of the Narnian people against the savage rule of the Telmarin rulers.<br /><br />Prince Caspian is a magical film which is, in every way, the previous films' better. Beautiful landscaping is so common in epic fantasies like this that it's almost a clich&eacute; but here it doesn't seem like a mere LOTR copy like so many others.  It's landscaping is neatly done, playing up the differences between Lewis's fantasy world and Tolkien's. The ruins of Cair Paravel, the beaches, Aslan's Howl, are all wonderfully realized. The story begins when our four kings and queens of old are summoned to Narnia, when Caspian blows Susan's horn. They are transported to their former dwelling, the castle Cair Paravel, only to find it in ruins and decay. Meeting up with a dwarf they rescue from death, they make their way across the wilderness of Narnia to meet Caspian.<br /><br />The power struggle between Caspian and "High King" Peter gives this movie great tension early on. Caspian is somewhat unsure of himself, having never led men into battle, and allows his will to be overturned by strong opponents. While Peter, by contrast, seems is too sure of himself because of his former status as "High King" and often times refuses to take the advice of others, namely Lucy, whom as testified to in the previous film should always be believed. Peter also refuses to heed Caspian, who's command Peter tries to usurp out of pure spite and pride. It destroys the moral of their soldiers to see their leaders do nothing but bicker and for a while this is all that these two "wannabe" kings accomplish.<br /><br />But the show stealer for this film is not the kings, the centaurs, the giant castles or even Aslan the lion but Reepicheep, a buccaneer like mouse who refuses to let his tiny little size get in the way of glory, honor and pride. Running through the ranks of Telmar soldiers he cuts them off at the knees, asks them for their final words and when they mention the obvious, "Your a mouse" he frustratingly replies, "oh, you humans have no imagination." There are few characters in any movie that are as fun to watch as Reepicheep, his antics and overly prideful sense of himself, despite his size is, as Lucy says, "so cute," but don't say that in front of him. I cannot wait to see him back in the next film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Combine all this with some amazing choreographed fight scenes and this is one amazing film.<br /><br />The only fault I can find in Caspian, if you can call it a fault, is that it comes AFTER The Lord of the Rings. So many plot elements have already been used in LOTR, unfortunately. So although I don't want to penalize this film for that, it does come up repeatedly. Peter and Caspian reaching for power like Boromir reaching for the ring, Susan pulling off her best Legolas impression, the water figure washing away the Telmar horses as they try to cross the river. Yes, it's true to the book for the most part, but it did seem very ringish in many parts.<br /><br />Prince Caspian is not going to be the best film of the year when all is said and done, but it does stand a high chance of standing up there with the best films of 2008. Although it does hold a lot of LOTR elements, I can't really fault it for that since LOTR pretty much did everything, and did everything well. I can only hold my breath for when the much awaited film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader comes out. I will  be waiting for this, The Silver Chair, and possibly The Last Battle.<br /><br />Replay value; High.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I already expected this to be an exciting movie, but I have to tell you that the excitement got so much higher as I watched this movie with my kids. I couldn't believe just how well this movie was, I mean the first Chronicles is a fantastic movie, but this movie takes a few steps ahead. It's definitely more mature, it takes on a lot of battle scenes, like a Lord of the Rings type of battle with a ton of creatures who are fighting for their land back. We have amazing effects, with taking badgers, goats, and mice, and the mice, this is no Puss in Boots from Shrek 2, this is the blood thirsty mice that kick butt! The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is seriously one of the best films out this year.<br /><br />The movie begins where the first Chronicles left off, the kids are in England, pretty depressed and miss Narnia, it's been a year, but while in a train station, they are taken away back to Narnia where it's been 1300 years. The land is in bad shape, they have been called by Prince Caspian, the kids are these legends to the Narnians, but they need the kid's help. So everyone is in for a strong battle to get Narnia back into the beautiful land it once was. Lucy is hoping to re-connect with Aslan, but everyone does not believe as strong as she does.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a movie that will not disappoint, I cannot believe how good this movie was, I was so excited watching all these amazing battle sequences. The plot is actually pretty easy to follow, for kids that are under 10, I'm not so sure if this is a film for them, I know that The Chronicles of Narnia is a family film, but there is quite a bit of violence in the movie, like blood, cutting, and decapitations. The effects were amazing in every way, the acting was great and even the politics were surprisingly good. All I can say is that this is a superb movie, 10 times better than the first. It's truly a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>After enjoying the first movie, i was also pleased with the second movie.<br />  Many new characters are introduced and the movie feels like a fresh<br />new movie and not a retread of the first one.

Lewis' epic world. The film is a fine sequel to "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," but doesn't stand up fully with the original. While the acting, visual effects and action sequences are fantastic, the story is slow-moving during the first half, but picks up in the latter half. The villain of the piece is also a little bit week, which is either due to the actor or the writing. Also, the awe and wonder of the first film is missing for the most part in this film. Still, this is an epic film that fans of Narnia will surely enjoy.<br />Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>As a child (probably over 30 years ago now), I read the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA every couple of years.  I loved the books, and at that time, they seemed like fast moving, exciting adventures to me.  Looking at them these days...they are charming but a little slow-paced for a modern audience.  I still highly recommend them as an introduction to epics for younger children (kids too young for LORD OF THE RINGS, for example)...but I also admit that they aren't exactly barn-burners.<br /><br />This was further borne out when I saw the made-for-TV British versions a few years ago.  While very faithful to the books...they moved at a glacial pace (and the special effects were pretty awful).  My kids couldn't get through them.<br /><br />So that's the main reason I so much appreciate the latest versions of these great stories.  Part 1, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE was very faithful to the original...yet added some epic action sequences to jazz up modern audiences.  My biggest problem with that film was the sometimes poor special effects (I thought The Beavers were pretty badly done...to the point of distraction) and I thought James McAvoy was poorly cast as Mr. Tumnus...again a big distraction.  I thought the kids were very good, and Tilda Swinton was probably the perfect person for her role.  I liked the movie...but I didn't love it.<br /><br />I almost love PRINCE CASPIAN, though.  For one thing, it's nice to see another book in the series getting loving attention.  Second, the four young leads have really grown as performers.  (Although the young man playing Edmund has grown just a tiny bit too much...no fault of his.)  I particularly liked both of the young actresses.  Susan is truly a young woman you would NOT want to mess with in a fight...she's empowered but not the least bit showy about it.  And Lucy is perfect...we believe she is always the one who keeps one eye out for Aslan.<br /><br />The kids return to Narnia after one year back on our earth...and 1300 years have gone by.  Their old palace is in ruins, and they quickly discover that a race of humans called the Telmarines have driven the "magical" denizens of Narnia out of their own land.  The current leader of Narnia is so cruel, in fact, that he has driven his own nephew Caspian (and rightful heir) out of Narnia and into the woods.  There Caspian meets his destiny.<br /><br />PRINCE CASPIAN is populated with delightful creations.  The dwarves are a delight...Peter Dinklage is an actor of considerable gravity and subtlety...and gives a heartbreaking performance.  Reepicheep the Mouse appears and steals his scenes...just as he does in the book.  There are badgers, mighty Centaurs, fearsome Minotaurs, etc.  Most of them are rendered better than in the first movie, and there were only a few moments where the CGI wasn't quite up to the task.  For the most part, these creatures felt very much like physical presences.<br /><br />Naturally, the book's modest action scenes are greatly enhanced for the film.  While the ending battles are truly spectacular and actually quite exciting...I enjoyed the sneak attack on the Telmarine fortress almost as much.  Not only was it exciting...it had emotional resonance.  The great High King Peter and the up-and-comer Caspian both get taken down a peg or two...at a great cost.<br /><br />I hate to reveal any more plot...because most kids are far less familiar with this story than the first.  It isn't exactly a groundbreaking plot...but it's done very well and will engage kids and adults alike.  It is rated PG...but I almost think PG-13 would have been more appropriate...it is VERY violent, and lots of people die.<br /><br />There are some weaknesses, of course...Ben Barnes as Caspian needs some maturing.  He looks the part, and no doubt is quite a handsome young man...but his acting skills are not up to his fellow-young people.  Perhaps if he returns in a sequel...he'll add some gravitas.  Also, the movie is just a little slow going early on.  One or two scenes of voyaging or trudging through woods could easily have been eliminated.  Once the film kicks into high gear, though...it's pretty terrific.  The script itself is fairly faithful to the book and serves its purpose...but it's not transformative.<br /><br />By no means is this film the masterwork that THE LORD OF THE RINGS series was.  It has just a little childish edge to it...which is appropriate.  Nonetheless, I heartily recommend it.  If you liked the first film...you'll love this one.  If you were only so-so on the first film...I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how this one grows.<br /><br />The best sign, to me, that I liked the film was that five minutes after it was over...I was very sad knowing it would be years before VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER comes.  I EAGERLY await that film...with its epic action sequences set at sea.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / High Profile 4.1<br />Running time: 2:29:58<br />Movie size: 32,33 GB<br />Disc size: 48,70 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 19.02 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio English 4034 kbps 7.1 / 48 kHz / 4034 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1536 kbps / 24-bit)<br />Dolby Digital Audio Chinese 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio French 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio Portuguese 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio Spanish 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio Thai 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Chinese / French / Indonesian / Korean / Malay / Portuguese / Spanish / Thai<br />Number of chapters: 22<br /><br />#Audio Commentary<br />#Circle Vision Interactive: Creating the Castle Raid<br />#BD-Live<br /><br />Disc 2<br />******<br />#The Bloopers of Narnia (3m:06s)<br />#Seven Deleted Scenes with optional introduction by director Andrew Adamson (11m:15s)<br />#Inside Narniam: The Adventure Returns (34m:41s)<br />#Sets of Narniam: A Classic Comes to Life (23m:45s)<br />#Big Movie Comes to a Small Town (23m:20s)<br />#Previsualizing Narnia (10m:09s)<br />#Talking Animals and Walking Treesm: The Magical World of Narnia (4m:50s)<br />#Secrets of the Duel (6m:46s)<br />#Becoming Trumpkin (4m:47s)<br />#Warwick Davism: The Man Behind Nikabrik (11m:08s)</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / High Profile 4.1<br />Running time: 2:29:58<br />Movie size: 32,33 GB<br />Disc size: 48,70 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 19.02 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  4034 kbps  7.1 / 48 kHz / 4034 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1536 kbps / 24-bit)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Chinese  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Portuguese  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Thai  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Chinese / French / Indonesian / Korean / Malay / Portuguese / Spanish / Thai<br />Number of chapters: 22<br /><br />#Audio Commentary<br />#Circle Vision Interactive: Creating the Castle Raid<br />#BD-Live<br /><br />Disc 2<br />******<br />#The Bloopers of Narnia (3m:06s)<br />#Seven Deleted Scenes with optional introduction by director Andrew Adamson (11m:15s)<br />#Inside Narniam: The Adventure Returns (34m:41s)<br />#Sets of Narniam: A Classic Comes to Life (23m:45s)<br />#Big Movie Comes to a Small Town (23m:20s)<br />#Previsualizing Narnia (10m:09s)<br />#Talking Animals and Walking Treesm: The Magical World of Narnia (4m:50s)<br />#Secrets of the Duel (6m:46s)<br />#Becoming Trumpkin (4m:47s)<br />#Warwick Davism: The Man Behind Nikabrik (11m:08s)</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  PRINCE CASPIAN hit theaters with a lot of expectation.  The book series has been popular since they were first published nearly fifty years ago, and they've never gone out of print.  Earlier movie versions, animated and live-action, have been made of them.  But after the success of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, fans hoped for more and Hollywood banked on another success.<br /><br />I had a good time with the first movie.  Taking my son with me enhanced the experience, though.  His innocent glee stripped years away from me and eased me right back into my own childhood.  The sights and sounds of the world were amazing, as they would have to be in order to grab the audiences lying out there in wait now.  And the pacing of the movie was well done.<br /><br />However, Narnia purists are going to have a problem with this version of the novel.  Hollywood has strayed far from the path in making this sequel.  Yes, it's true, Narnia has been Hollywoodized and given the big box office treatment.  Which means that more has been left out of the book than was kept in, and even more new material was shoveled into the story.  In fact, a whole rivalry sequence between Caspian (Ben Barnes) and Peter (William Moseley) has been tossed into the mix, as well as Susan (Anna Popplewell) "crushing" on Caspian.<br /><br />Also, the battle scenes are definitely more hardcore than they are in the book.  And protracted.  The novel dealt with them in a straight-forward manner and moved into the characters and the spirituality of the book.<br /><br />But I have to give Hollywood its due.  I'd wager most of the people buying tickets haven't ever read the books, just as they hadn't read THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  They're there packing the seats because they want to see adventure, excitement, and royal battles between good and evil.<br /><br />I'd even read PRINCE CASPIAN to my son shortly after we watched THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.  We'd read that book before the movie and he knew everything that was going to happen.  He kept throwing hints to his mom during the movie.  This time he really believed we hadn't read the book because so much was different.<br /><br />Hollywood chose to change the story, and I accepted that within a few minutes and simply enjoyed what was on the screen without proprietary interest.  The special effects are awesome, the mythical beings are amazing, and the landscape is lush and incredible.  My son was bowled over as Narnia once again unfolded before us.  I have to admit, I was too.<br /><br />Despite the differences in character and motivations, and the way the final battle was staged when Peter undertook single combat against Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), I had a great time.  Susan stepped into the battles and became an amazing warrior (okay, I had to swallow hard at that one when I saw her first shooting men with her bow then using it as a staff to battle again in the thick of the fighting while wearing no armor).  Peter was even more courageous than before, and naturally stepped into a leadership role.  Edmund (Skandar Keynes) was a fierce fighter as well, and the young actor has certainly grown into the role.  There is a fantastic scene where Lucy (Georgie Henley) blocks the retreating Telmarin army that had the audience laughing and cheering at the same time.  The kids have changed.<br /><br />The assault on the castle at night was terrific.  My son and I sat on the edges of our seat and watched as the battle progressed and finally turned deadly.  And when Aslan (Liam Neeson) stepped onto the screen, we were in Narnia fighting the good fight at the sides of the Narnians.<br /><br />Maybe this isn't a faithful interpretation of the original novel, but you're not going to be able to find a much better early summer offering.  I question the rating a little, because I would have bumped it up a notch due to all the physical action, the evil intent, and the PG rating isn't warning enough.<br /><br />With all the fantasy and superhero movies hitting the screens this summer, finding one that stands out head and shoulders above the others is going to be hard.  I've decided not to stress over figuring out which one is the best, and instead concentrate on enjoying the feast!</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Disney never fails to stun me with thier awesome movies. this sequel to the narnia is awesome it is alot better than the original movie. this movie is great i can't wait to see voyage of the dawm treader and the silver chair</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  PRINCE CASPIAN continues the story of four children, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) and their return to Narnia.  They help Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) to revive the fantasy world that was once inhabited by the various talking creatures and king of the forest, Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson), after the land is invaded by the Telmarines.  And once again, there is the conflict between good and evil.<br /><br />The film focuses on Prince Caspian and his quest to recapture the thrown.  However, his leadership is in question.  In this installment of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, Caspian has to unite the creatures and people of Narnia and fight the Telmarines.  And one question comes to mind, is he able to return Narnia to its previous luster?  There is an array of themes within the film's storyline, leadership, chivalry, and camaraderie between the four children, Prince Caspian, and the beastly creatures, which gradually shows Caspian's strengths as well as challenges as a leader.  And this is displayed in one of the most powerful scenes in the film where Peter and King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) conduct a duel.<br /><br />PRINCE CASPIAN leaves the enchantment behind.  This film is a far cry from the first CHRONICLES OF NARNIA because of the intense violence.  With the haunting chants of the movie's soundtrack, epic cinematography, extravagant costumes, there is a darker element to this film; viewers may identify the massive battle scenes to THE LORD OF THE RINGS, 300, and the previous HARRY POTTER films.  And this will definitely keep people at the edge of their seats.<br /><br />Although the film has a darker tone, there are a few lighter moments.  The enchanted creatures of the forest of Narnia offer a little comic relief to the movie, such as Trumpkin the dwarf (Peter Dinklage) and Reepicheep the mouse (voice of Eddie Izzard) who almost resembles the Puss n' Boots character in the Shrek films.  Another defining moment is the touching concluding scenes where Aslan and Lucy reunite as well as when the children depart from Narnia back to England.<br /><br />Overall, the film is an amazing display of excitement and adventure.  However, due to too many disturbing scenes of violence within the film, it may not be appropriate for young children.  Otherwise, this is a movie worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Repeating the formula of the moderately-better "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" (poor CGI, lots of religious references, and uneven performances) but with a worse script and a terrible turn by Ben Barnes as a hunky European version of the film's title character, Prince Caspian not only fails as a self-contained film, but bodes very poorly for the franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>I had never read the books, but I really enjoyed the first 'Narnia' movie. Seemed like a pleasant mix of child literature and fantasy writing, and that movie was a pleasant surprise (part 'Harry Potter', part 'Lord of the Rings'). This new one isn't nearly as good though; the acting seems more stilted, the story isn't as interesting, and the religious overtones are much more prevalent. I was looking forward to this, but can't recommend it others</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>Prince Caspian is the follow-up to the the very popular Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia book series.<br /><br />Full of battle scenes, some pretty spectacular. Small children may struggle with fearful images. One scene was particularly sad involved several Narnians caught behind enemy lines awaiting death.<br /><br />As in the first movie loads of creatures make up Narnia's population. All had been living underground since shortly after the kings and queens of Narnia had returned to England. Sir Reepicheep mouse-knight is a nice addition adding humor and zest to the film. Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy are back -- called to help Narnia from the brink of extinction. Prince Caspian lands in Narnia as he runs for his life. His evil uncle has produced an heir so Caspian X needs to be exterminated. Aslan makes an appearance and the White Witch drops in for a short while.<br /><br />The story is so big and the cast so large that though the actors tried there was a feel of underdevelopment between several major relationships. I'd like to say I loved the film. And there are many reasons I liked it but several that just left me cold.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>In the centuries since we were last in Narnia, things have changed.  The Telmarines have overrun the country, sending the real Narnias (you know, the talking animals and mythological creatures) into hiding.  The country is currently under the rule of King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) until his nephew, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) is old enough.  But on the night that Miraz's son is born, Caspian flees and goes into hiding.  In great danger, he blows the ancient horn of help.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in our world, only a year has passed for Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley).  They are waiting for a train when they are suddenly called somewhere else.  At first, they don't realize where they are, but it doesn't take long for them to realize they are once again in Narnia.  Only years have past since their first visit since the castle around them in is ruins.<br /><br />When they learn of the plight of the true Narnias and Caspian, they set out to join forces and free the country.  But with Aslan (voiced again by Liam Neeson) long gone, what can four children and a prince do?<br /><br />Let's get the obvious out of the way first.  They royally changed the story here.  And as someone who has never been fond of this book in the series, I will say that many of the changes were for the better.  They cut much of the first half of the book, which is the slowest part of the story.  They made the battles (yes, they added one) more epic.<br /><br />But not all the changes were beneficial.  The movie felt more like a retread of the first, something I've never felt before.  Peter here is moody and touchy, not the leader he is.  That sub-plot and the theme of faith vs. reason and power are never fully developed but glossed over for the battle sequences.  And let's not forget the romantic sub-plot that felt forced but harmless to me.<br /><br />There is one major change I thought I wouldn't like.  It expands on a scene from the book and sends the characters further down a path of darkness.  Some will find it scary and upsetting, but I think it worked and was one of the better examples of the theme.<br /><br />For anyone disappointed by the battles in the first movie, you'll be happy to hear this one makes up for it.  The battles are epic and gorgeously choreographed.  Couple those with the wonderful special effects we have become spoiled with, and you've got a great feast for the eyes.<br /><br />But I digress.  I was discussing the book versus the movie. I reread parts of the book after I saw the movie.  Yes, they changed the story, but they also include some great lines from the book.  Ultimately, they made a good movie. Even with the changes, the movie never overcomes the fact that the story is essentially straight forward and weak.  But I like this version better than the book.  (Is an avid reader allowed to admit that?)<br /><br />Having made that confession, I will list my biggest disappointment.  Trumpkin the Dwarf (Peter Dinklage) and Reepicheep the Mouse (voiced by Eddie Izzard) are not given enough time to develop here.  What is here is wonderful.  But these two characters are one of the redeeming features of the book for me, so I wanted to see more.<br /><br />Ultimately, I really did enjoy this film.  I was drawn into the world, the characters, and their struggle.  I laughed multiple times and was moved to tears as well. It was a great escape film with some good themes to think about later.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>Disney's "Prince Caspian" is a fascinating twist on CS Lewis' original book. While the book has stories-within-stories and loads of info-dumps, the Disney version is more fast-paced and suspenseful. The Pevensie children come into their own (with the exception of Lucy,who is significantly absent for most of the film,becoming an anchoress for Aslan)<br /><br />The film opens with the birth of Caspian's (Ben Barnes) cousin to his tyrannical uncle Miraz,as well as an attempt on his life. Caspian flees into the wilderness, sounding Susan's magical horn. Barnes is convincing as the noble,yet flaky prince (with a soft center) Unfortunately,his faux Spanish accent draws parallels with Inigo Montoya. There's no Andre the Giant or Princess Buttercup.<br /><br />The Pevensie children return to Narnia, finding it a ruin millennia after their departure. Peter (William Moseley) comes into his own as a wise leader, yet he must yield his kingship to Caspian. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) stands out with moral strength and humility. Susan becomes a warrior princess,despite Lewis' distaste for women fighting. In the meantime, Lucy is dreamy,has visions of Aslan,and little else to do.<br /><br />The movie is fast-paced and exciting compared to its predecessor. The soundtrack is stirring. For purists, Disney took some risks. There's a thrilling castle siege, complete with Caspian messing it up because he confronts his aunt and uncle in their bedroom. There's also a "romance" between Caspian and Susan,sealed with a kiss. The Christian allegory is muted. Aslan exists as deus ex machina, serving only to save the plot. Disney also cut out the part where Aslan tells Caspian that the Telmarines are descended from mermaids and pirates.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" doesn't work theologically. It's not true to the book. Still,it's great fun! Let the sounding of Susan's magical horn call you into Narnia!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Prince Caspian is darker and more violent with a lot more action than the first. However, it's less magical with less character build-up and the villians are forgettable especially compared to the White Witch. Plus some scenes you won't understand unless you read the book. Like  for instance I had no idea why the water takes the form of a bearded figure. Perhaps the book explains that but the movie doesn't. While there's also a scene where two evil creatures appear out of nowhere to try and bring the White Witch back. So yeah the direction isn't involving enough on what's going on sometimes. It's like he had too much fate in that all the viewers read the book. While action is well done but there's more action than story as well.<br /><br />  The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes yet it barely takes time to tell an actual story. I mean we're supposed to care about Caspian's friendship with his dwarf tudor who taught him about Narnia. But we never see Caspian as a kid being taught by him like in the book "I only read the beginning so far". The movie starts off with the dwarf sending an older Caspian away to safety. While by looking at the guy you wouldn't even be able to tell that he's supposed to be a dwarf. They could've at least done some CGI magic to make him look shorter but instead we get a dwarf that looks more like Santa Clause. Maybe he's not even supposed to be a dwarf in the movie but in the book he was.<br /><br />  Despite having pleanty to complain about I still enjoyed this movie. The kid actors have improved acting wise and were up to the task. Georgie Henley who plays Lucy is still the best of them though. She's probably the most magical thing about any of the movies. While Peter Dinklage (Elf, Nip/Tuck season 4) as a dwarf is one of the only new characters I really cared about. A talking mouse with a sword does get some laughs though. Even if he is a mouse version of Puss N'Boots pretty much. Hopefully though they have more character build-up, better direction and more sense of wonder and magic in the 3rd movie. So far the movies are just good when they could be excellent with the right director and writers involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHV42BTJSVON.html">A2RHV42BTJSVON</a><br/><p>First, I would like to say, that having read the books, I came in a little bit narrow-minded, but I try to be very open.  Chronicles of Narnia, for me, is almost worse than watching a Harry Potter movie because I am so familiar with the story and mythology behind the movies.<br /><br />  The story begins with a birth, the birth of Prince Caspian's uncle's first son, which means he can kill off Caspian so that his son can have the throne.  Prince Caspian then runs off on horseback and goes into the forest of Narnia where he runs into a badger and two dwarfs, and blows a horn to summon the kings and queens of old.  Of course, we also see Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan as they are going about their daily lives wondering whether or not they will ever go back to Narnia.  It is, of course, just as they are wondering this that they are pulled back into to Narnia.  They soon find that quite some time has passed since they were Kings and Queens in Narnia and things are not as peaceful and pleasant as they were when they left.<br /><br />  Overall, I would give the movie a 4.5.  It is sad to say that this almost seems like a lesser version of Lord of the Rings, but it does.  This does not make it a bad film at all, it is just that the battle sequences are not bloody at all, but the film still has almost just as much violence as Lord of the Rings.  One of the major things that keeps it from really feeling like its own movie is the fact that they left out fair amounts of elements of magical creatures from the books, and brought in Aslan far too late.  Aslan comes into the books much earlier, and it never fully explained why Peter, Susan, and Edmund couldn't see Aslan at first either.<br /><br />  This movie almost could have earned a PG-13 rating because of the adult themes of power struggles within in the family and murder conspiricies.  This is not light stuff, and I would not take anyone under ten to see it, it is quite violent, but there are so many redeeming qualities that I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water.<br /><br />  These were the most frustrating points for me, but overall, the movie was well-acted, well-filmed, good script, good effects, and was fairly evenly paced.  Part of the problem of filming these books is that in general, not a whole lot goes on.  The books are very casual in tone, and not quite as engrossing as say Harry Potter.  Although, I would probably say that Chronicles of Narnia is much more original than Harry Potter.<br /><br />  I would defnitely go see it again because I believe I will enjoy it more than I did at the midnight showing I saw.  I definitely hope that they continue filming these because it would be marvelous to see all seven books filmed. I very much enjoyed seeing the children moore grown up, I do hope they come back for "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" as that is probably my favorite book. Next time Disney, cash in more on C.S. Lewis' wonderful world, and make sure to include the Dufflepods! :D<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the first film, though it was certainly aimed at children.  Prince Caspian however takes a darker turn for Narnia.  The 4 children return to the magical kingdom a year later, but in Narnia more than a thousand years has passed.  A kingdom of men has taken over Narnia and driven the magical creatures into the woods and near extinction.  I found the visuals very pleasing and if you are a fan of battles, you certainly have more than your share in this story.  They are bloodless affairs, but they do feel very Lord of the Ringish.  I enjoyed the story and the more adult natured storyline.  I will certainly purchase this and eagerly await the next installment in the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>A year after their adventures, the Pevensie children are chafing at their mundane lives in an underground train station on the Strand. The next thing they know, the wall behind them is moving.  It's magic, they know, and it takes them to Narnia.<br /><br />But, there weren't any ruins in Narnia.  Plus, the dancing trees no longer dance.  And the beasts in the woods aren't friendly anymore.  While a year has passed in their time, it's 1300 years in the future for Narnia.<br /><br />Narnia's been driven near to extinction by the Telmarines, a race of humans led by Lord Protector Miraz (Sergio Castellitto).  In the beginning, Miraz is only serving as regent for the Telmarine throne, but his wife is laboring in childbirth.  When the news comes that she's borne him a son, he sets plans in motion to kill his nephew Prince Caspian 10, the rightful heir to the throne (played by Ben Barnes).<br /><br />The Pevensale children: Peter, (William Moseley); Susan, (Anna Popplewell); Edmund, (Skandar Keynes); and Lucy, (Georgie Henley) meet Caspian and after a brief dispute between Peter and Caspian, cast their and their animal and dwarven kind friends' lots in with his. They know the Telmarines will invade quickly and choose to meet the enemy offensively.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" reminds me very much of "The Two Towers" in that there's quite a bit of fighting going on. From the minute Miraz realizes he has an heir, he's sending his men to kill his nephew and next to go after the remainder of the Narnians.<br /><br />The story is well-acted. Lucy (Henley) and Miraz (Castellitto) were two of the most interesting characters in the whole story and were at polar opposites of the good-evil continuum.  Lucy's faithful and the strongest believer in the magic of Narnia and her old friend, Aslan.  Miraz is just plain bad, he's a kinslayer, a backstabber, and the all-around-guy-you-love-to-hate. Kudos also to Eddie Izzard for Reepicheep the Mouse. His portrayal was exactly what I imagined for the brave little mouse.<br /><br />Director, Andrew Adamson did an excellent job hazing the battle scenes with grey implying the dust I'd imagine they'd stir up with the fight.  He also managed to capture the wondrous dancing trees, the mountains and the glory that is Narnia in a bright filter.<br /><br />Magical creatures, particularly the centaurs, were very well done. Effects for the one scene featuring Jadis, the Snow Queen were smooth and beautifully done.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is probably not a film for very young children.  There's a lot of violence and battle scenes.  While there's no splatter factor, I think the decapitations and other scenes might be hard on the younger kids.<br /><br />NOTE:  If you are planning on attending "Prince Caspian" for the next week, you probably will want to buy your tickets in advance or see the earliest show.  The theatre tonight was full and many of the shows for tomorrow were already selling out.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, May 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>On their way to school one day, the Pevensie kids are magically whisked out of a tube station back to the woods of Narnia.  There they meet Prince Caspian of Telmarine (next door to Narnia), who has just escaped his evil uncle's henchmen.  It seems the Telmarines thought Narnia and its inhabitants were gone forever - it has been 1300 (Narnian) years since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAFJXE">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>.  The Pevensies take up their royal mantels as Kings and Queens of Narnia and vow to help Caspian regain his rightful crown and free the Narnians.<br /><br />At least that's what I think it was about.  Honestly, there are so many Battles To The End, strange characters, and unintelligible accents that I had to content myself with understanding the basics and wishing it would end soon.  I loved the first movie; I thought the Pevensies were adorable, the creatures of Narnia were charming, and Aslan was magnificent, but all that's changed here:  The kids don't get a chance to be kids or interact on a normal level so there's not much opportunity to feel like I knew them.  A (poorly-drawn) CGI badger and a sour-puss dwarf are the main Narnians.  Neither touched me; in fact, the dwarf was off-putting.  And Aslan - ah, I wanted him to be Perfect again and bring me to tears, but, alas, he's also poorly-drawn and we see very little of him.  When we do, it's just not the same.<br /><br />The scenery is breathtakingly gorgeous, but there are just too many intense battles against villains who all look and speak alike (why couldn't they have nice British accents!?)  There's nothing cuddly-cute about Narnia or awesomely divine about Aslan and the kids are reduced to killing machines.  Action fans may love this movie, but I was disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian" is great! This is how the story goes: One year later, the Kings and Queens of Narnia find themselves back in that faraway wondrous realm, only to discover that more than 1,300 years have passed in Narnian time. During their absence, the Golden Age of Narnia has become extinct and Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines and is now under the control of the evil King Miraz, who rules the land without mercy. The four children will soon meet a curious new character: Narnia's rightful heir to the throne, the young Prince Caspian, who has been forced into hiding, as his uncle Miraz plots to kill him in order to place his own newborn son on the throne. With the help of the kindly dwarf, a courageous talking mouse named Reepicheep, a badger named Trufflehunter and a Black Dwarf, Nikabrik, the Narnians--led by the mighty knights Peter and Caspian--embark on a remarkable journey to find Aslan, rescue Narnia from Miraz's tyrannical hold, and restore magic and glory to the land. The directing by Andrew Adamson (who also directed "Shrek" (2001) & "Shrek 2" (2004, also wrote the screenplay and story), he also did the screenplay and directed "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe" (2005) is great!

A great summer movie that will keep you thinking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I've read and heard numerous complaints about "The Chronicles of Narnia:  Prince Caspian."  Two of the primary ones are that a) the magic is gone and b) the film is too violent.  For those who've actually read the stories that this film and the previous one are based on, this should come as no surprise.  "Caspian" is intentionally a darker, more violent and "magic-less" film.  It's a story where the children (except young Lucy for the most part) turn away from the aid of Aslan in an attempt to do things on their own.  Of course, things never go quite right without Aslan.<br /><br />In this tale, we find Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan literally called back to Narnia to help Prince Caspian, the rightful king of the Telmarine empire, reclaim his future throne.  It's been stolen from him by his uncle, Miraz, who plans to become king.  Two great battles, as well as one very dramatic and violent face-off take place, all in an attempt to reclaim the throne.  To tell any more would be to ruin the tale.<br /><br />The story has been edited for pacing, and although it's been a little while since I read this particular tale, I'm sure that one particular battle sequence was added.  There are also a couple of changes to characters that I don't recall in the original story.  In the end though, the key elements of the story are all there.  The Christian undertones are also present, but aren't as obvious as they were in the first film.  Those familiar with the Christian aspects of the story should pick up on them though.<br /><br />Families with especially young children may want to preview this film before taking their little ones.  My daughter, who's seven, had no problem with the story and wasn't scared at all.  Yes, it is grittier, more violent and has less magic in it, but this is a good adaptation of "Prince Caspian."  I do believe that the poetic license doesn't add much to the film, but it doesn't take anything away from the key elements of the story.  Overall, it's a highly enjoyable tale that I highly recommend to fans of fantasy, Christians, and anybody who enjoys a good story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Without going into too much detail about the movie, I think that it's an overall success.  Many can nitpick from beginning to end, but this is a fun, well-made movie that follows the book very closely.<br /><br />The four kids have grown up after a few years away from Narnia - even though the ratio of Earth years to Narnia years is roughtly 1:1300.  During that time away, the Narnians have been under siege and face the threat of extinction.  In fact, humans from that age, the Telmarines, believe the Narnians to be extinct since their ancestors have savagely attacked the Narnians for centuries.<br /><br />At the presetn Narnian time, Prince Caspian is about to be usurped as the ruler of Telmarine, because his uncle Miraz has just had a son who is the potential heir to a throne.  As medieval custome would have it, an assassination attempt is about to ensue.<br /><br />Naturally, Prince Caspian ends up summoning the Pevensies back to Narnia where they team up alongside the Narnian animals to fight against the xenophobic Telmarines.  Just as the first movie, it's still great to see the animals on the side of the humans; the fight scenes take a ton of imagination and some very believable CGI.  From gnomes to minotaurs, fawns to sphinxes, and even non-mythical animals that can speak, it's one for all and all for one.  Speaking of that philosophy, the Musketeer theme, a swashbuckling mouse stole the whole show.  From the minute he appeared, he reminded me of the cat in Shrek, with prim and proper attitude, incredible swordsmanship, and a sense of dignity as a fighter.<br /><br />The sweet innocence takes a back-seat in this sequel.  Whereas they were children before, the Pevensies are now much more mature - on screen as well as in real life.  It's similar to the Harry Potter series; the kids can't stay the same age and the story must evolve.  As a result, there is quite a bit more action in this movie, the battle scenes are harsher, and there is obviously some killing going on...some of which at the hands of the children.  Personally, I like this change.<br /><br />There are only two problems I had with the movie, both of which have been mentioned by other reviewers.  The river scene was stolen straight out of the LOTR movies, as was the tree fighting scenes.  Although, the trees didn't have faces in this version, and used their roots as strangling tools, whips, and bats.  I don't care when the books were written and who came up with the original idea first.  When someone comes out with a thunder-stealing movie before yours is supposed to be created and/or release, it should be modified for originality.  Nontheless, it's a great movie, and I'll happily devour every book-to-movie translation of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>FORM LETTER TO READERS<br />Let me clear the air very quickly so you don't waste your time deciding if you agree with me or not;  I NEVER compare films to the video games, books, short stories or TV shows they are sourced from .  I believe that as a different medium, expectations for a film should be a clean slate.  I refuse to hate or love a film because it was unfaithful or faithful to its source material.  End of speech.<br /><br />My Review; (FULL OF SPOILERS)<br /><br />-I THOUGHT THE ENTS MADE THEIR LAST MARCH?<br />In this, the 4th chapter in the LOTR "Trilogy" the Ents go on the march again.  I thought they had declared "The last march of the Ents" 3 films ago?  Oh well, the river gods wash away the bad guys again just like in the first film but this time the victims are humans and not the ring Wraiths.  I found this confusing since I thought the humans were the good guys in the LOTR series?  Hold on, someone is reading over my shoulder... ...what? Oh?  This isn't LOTR?  IS MY FACE RED!  Sorry.  Never mind.<br /><br />-LOST ON THE WAY TO HOGWARTS<br />This 6th entry in the "Harry Potter" series was a bit disappointing.  I love the Hogwarts Express but in this film the train just zooms right past Harry and friends and opens a doorway to another place that looks nothing like Hogwarts.  They certainly could not fool me into believing these were the same actors as in the first 5 Harry Potter films just by dressing them like Hogwarts students... ...what?  Not Harry Potter?  DOH!!!<br /><br />-WHY REMAKES SUCK<br />I'm not sure why the powers-that-be decided to make a remake of "The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe" since it was just done a few years ago.  Not only do they make a half hearted re-do, but they twist around the story so it's only mildly different; very annoying.  Instead of the bad guys being scary beasts lead by a snow queen, these are now the good guys.  Instead of humans being the good guys, they are the bad guys... ...and the good guys, sort of... ... never mind!  Any way, Aslan the Lion is exactly the same in this version.  He even saves the day like in the first film (so easily that I question the need for any other heroes), even though he mutters a couple times about how things can't happen the same way twice (and yet they do).  The kids are all the same actors and I liked them in both films, especially Lucy.  And then there's Prince Caspian; he's not even in the original version... ...what?  This is a different story?  This is called "Prince Caspian"?  MY BAD!!  Man, I am so confused!<br /><br />-I WAS WATCHING A FILM AND A VIDIOGAME BROKE OUT...<br />I enjoyed the first Narnia film on a whimsical sort of level.  It was fairly harmless action with fun characters and fair to excellent Visual FX.  This film is a bit more ambitious and yet not always up to the task.  With the influx of massed hoarse and humans formations, CG was used to prevent probable animal injury.  The unfortunate result is a bunch of videogame polygon figures running about.  Some of these computer models hardly looked rendered; just awful.  Those Ents and the River Spirits were also below the state-of-the-art.  When you consider that LOTR was made 6 and 7 years ago and looks much better, that's pretty shameful.  Not all of the film looked bad, but enough did to spoil it for me.<br /><br />-WHO'S THE AUDIENCE?<br />Like the first version... ...er, film, there is much violence.  Like the first film, there is little blood.  Like the first film, my 9 year old daughter was afraid of what the violence implied.  Unlike the first film, my 6 year old was bored (as were I and my wife).  The themes were dark and complex, the characters light, the casualty rate high.  The story pacing was slow, the plot full of overly convenient loopholes and the dialogue at times incoherent.  Imagine explaining the rights of royal succession to a 6 year old during a movie.  Imagine a 9 year old asking why Caspian's uncle had to wait to have a son before he could murder Caspian for the throne.  I did not have a reasonable answer (Smart girl).  This film satisfied no one while trying to satisfy everyone (at least in my family).<br /><br />-IN THE END...<br />...I felt gypped.  Source material not withstanding, this was really a retelling of the first film with a few little twists.  The visual FX were actually worse than the original and certainly much worse than the older films it so vividly reminded me of.  The final scene is played out with reverence and purpose; implying that some sort of lesson should be gleaned from the preceding events.  I'm not going to get into the obvious religious implications of the message but it was overly simplistic.  Finally, two characters are declared to have grown beyond Narnia when in actuality they grew little and showed much room for improvement.  Despite the attempt at spectacle, the theaters big screen exposed the bad visuals and was wasted on a story that seemed only half thought out, relying on one characters overwhelming magic to save the day.  My family and I were fairly disappointed in this fairly mediocre film.  If you are a big fan of the first film and can ignore poor visual FX, you might like this.  Otherwise wait for the rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I liked the first Narnia film to some extent and I kind of feel the same about Prince Caspian. These films don't have the wonder or magic that the Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings series have. In fact my favorite part of the Narnia movies are all the talking animals. I seem to care about them more than the humans. There are some good things (hence the 3 stars I gave it), such as, the outstanding CGI, a nice musical score and most of the actors are above average. I just have no desire to see more of the Narnia world in the future. It is better than The Golden Compass, so it's not all bad.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>I had a blast watching Disney's new episode of the beloved Narnia series. As in the first movie, it starts in an England torn by WWII. A mundane subway station magically becomes transport back to Narnia, which the children had left only a year earlier - but a mmillenium past, by that world's calendar. Their arrival signals a heroic myth returned to life.<br /><br />The story thinly veils C. S. Lewis's Christian allegory. Although I haven't read the books in years, I was surprised at how much of the Christ mythos came through. Secularists (like me) need not worry, though. The fantasy unfolds beautifully even if you ignore that aspect. The effect-masters bring Narnia's population of centaurs, fauns, and other beings to life very convincingly, and the battle scenes carry all the excitement, drama, and scope one could wish. Even Susan, the older girl, joins the battle - despite long skirts, light armor, and a ladylike (but deadly) longbow, she does as well in close combat as any of the others. Lucy, the little one, truly turns the battle though. You'll see for yourself. Just wait until her baby-fatted hand draws her tiny weapon against the entire invading army - the whole course the war changes at that moment.<br /><br />There's no way to know, perhaps this does carry the thrill and majesty of Lewis's vision of fiction. Either way, it gets the summer movie season off to a rousing start.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>Prince Caspian is every bit as entertaining as the first film in the adaptations of C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia. The action sequences and special effects continue to exponentially improve, but the plot remains haplessly repetitious. While Lewis may have created countless original ideas in his novels, the movies themselves have already been beat to the punch by The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Shrek and many others, causing Prince Caspian to feel like it's borrowing elements from other fantasy fare. Entertaining but predictable, this sequel is an admirable second chapter to the Narnia saga that is sure to win over fans old and new.<br /><br />Only a few years have passed in England, but thousands have drastically changed the war-torn lands of Narnia. When the heir to the throne, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), is betrayed by the scheming Lord Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), he inadvertently summons the kings and queens of old - Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley). Forming an allegiance with the scattered Narnians, Prince Caspian and the Pevensies (with the help of a little magic and a talking lion) must wage war against Miraz's Telmarine army to once again restore peace to Narnia.<br /><br />The story starts right up without pausing considerably to educate unfamiliar or forgetful audiences as to the origins of Narnia, or to the magical elements that affect the Pevensie children. While many will grow accustomed to Narnia's paradisaical qualities, the children's return, without the use of the wardrobe, is rather inexplicit. Along those lines, the mysteries surrounding Aslan's apparitions, Lucy's selective use of her healing serum, and the unharnessed powers of Mother Nature all bring questions to the film; most of which are not answered.<br /><br />As the children mature, so do the Shakespearean themes and tone of this darker follow-up. Tragically, the biggest downfall to the fascinating world of Narnia and its engrossing inhabitants is the fact that nearly every idea has already been expended by other movies. C.S. Lewis may have crafted many of his creative elements years before Shrek or 300, but those movies beat Narnia to the big screen. Whether it's Reepicheep, who is unappealingly similar to Shrek's Puss In Boots, or the Telmarine infantry, whose armored masks closely resemble 300's Immortal army, Narnia simply doesn't feel original. It's a shame that many viewer's first encounter with the thaumaturgical inventions will be through the film and not the novels.<br /><br />Despite a Lord of the Rings: Return of the King conclusion (a comparison that fantasy films should avoid), Prince Caspian indeed amps up the adventure. Better action, superior use of slow-motion and family friendly violence (such as a PG decapitation) aid in the film's smooth pace and sustained action. A more savage, war-torn Narnia doesn't necessarily make a better one, but new heroes and villains, nonstop epic battles, and a mature setting help keep the second Chronicles afloat in the heavily treaded waters of fantasy tales.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>Note To Andrew Adamson: You Screwed Up.<br /><br />First off, I really liked the first movie, it was a blend of fun, adventure and family fun with spiritual values that weren't muted by Hollywood. However, the first one was so good, it would be very hard to top it. It's possible, but not likely. And let me also say, that in this case, I don't like it when I'm right.<br /><br />The opening sequence, rather than the Blitz of the first film, we are thrown into the Prince running away for some reason, on the advice of his mentor, who strangely looks like a Hogwarts professor reject. Five minutes later, I'm already bored. Then we are introduced to the kids from the first movie, whose last name I will not even try to pronounce. Things are noticeably different for them. Susan has taken to lying in order to brush pompous boys off her shoulder, and Peter has taken to fighting with anybody that gives him the slightest bit of cause to do so. Why the personality changes? They long for Narnia, and are growing impatient, after all it has been a year. Then just like that, Narnia appears not in a wardrobe, but in a train station.<br /><br />When they get to Narnia, things are also different, there's ruins, and some creatures don't talk, and most of the rest are restless to say the least. The dwarfs for example are utterly useless and annoying, and I was actually rooting for them to be expended by the end. You know, these are the creatures who were reduced to working for the witch in the last movie? Which they say they would gladly do again.<br /><br />The children eventually join forces with the Spanish Prince, and decide to get the prince back his throne, using lots of useless violence. First they storm a castle, which doesn't end well. Mostly due to Caspian, who also becomes quickly unlikable. And his character only gets worse, climaxing in a scene where the dwarfs summon demons and other scary stuff that force Caspian use his blood to bring back the witch from the last movie. And this is a family movie?<br /><br />Note to Andrew Adamson: What in the heck were you thinking here?<br /><br />Then there's a swordfight with Peter and the evil king, who is eventually defeated, only to be quickly replaced by a worse guy, who is quickly defeated in an almost cameo by Aslan. What the deal there? The Lion doesn't appear till the end of the movie, and his part is so minor that it could have been easily rewritten for another character to save the day? Then the movie ends.<br /><br />Many words on the ending: Again, utterly pointless and forced. Why exactly are the children so willing to go back to "earth?" I mean, they were so mad at the beginning about not being there, then they get no leisure while they are there, and are confronted with nothing but trouble, and they're so willing to leave. They're basically like, 'Yeah, that's nice, ready to go back now, see you later, take care.' And then Peter and Susan aren't coming back? And I totally missed the point there. They've learned everything they can learn? If anything, Lucy and Edmund learned more, while the older ones kept screwing up.<br /><br />Note to Andrew Adamson: What the heck were you thinking?<br /><br />Then there's the kiss. What's the point of that, exactly? Did some movie exec say, 'Where's the kiss? We can't have a cute boy and girl without sexual-tension!' Again, like the rest of the movie, forced and pointless. They kiss, and they'll never see each other again, even though they didn't really care that much about each other in the first place.<br /><br />Now, don't think I didn't like the movie... well, never mind, I didn't. But there was some good points... There was Lucy! And there was the cute Badger, who had no role! And how could we forget the mouse? The cute mouse that your love for just boils over everytime you see it, except for its last scene.<br /><br />Wait, I forgot one last thing. When I really thought 'what the heck' during the actual movie, instead of thinking about it while trying to sleep after I got back home from the theatre, was when the trees came alive and started "fighting" the enemy. If that isn't the most lazy steal from The Lord of The Rings ever, I don't know what is. And that was actually one of the better parts in the whole series.<br /><br />Note To Andrew Adamson: What the heck?<br /><br />Overall, while your little children will like most of the movie, mostly thinking about the mouse, you will cringe thinking about the movie afterwards on almost every aspect. In fact, you'll think, why did I even pay to go and see the movie? But, if you take it for what it is, you'll like it better. My major problems with the movie was mostly the bad writing. Bad characters, bad scenes, bad story, and terrible ending.<br /><br />Hopefully, if there is a third one (and Disney will think twice before going any farther on the third one), it will be better, as it is being helmed by fresh eyes. It will still lack half of the main cast, but hey, at least I'll have zero expectations for it. And when you have no expectations, you can't easily be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>One of the major problems with all film series is what might be called middle filmitis. This is when films that are not first in a series rely too heavily upon an audience's memories of earlier films to inform them of the traits of characters, the chronology of prior events, and a general knowledge of the world the film series is set in. Such is the case with the latest C.S. Lewis adapted book, The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Oh, yes, there are other major flaws in this film, which I shall limn, but middle filmitis is the overarching ill that infects all others. The same was not true with the first film in the series, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. When I reviewed that film I started out by stating that that film was 1) a more literate and less Byzantine Lord Of The Rings, 2) a deeper and more realistic Harry Potter, and 3) a more mature Oz.<br />  Well, all three claims are still true, however the series has taken a sharp downward turn toward LOTR's Byzantine darkness, Potter's shallowness, and the puerility of Oz. Prince Caspian is not a bad film, merely a passable special effects film, filled with all sorts of magical beings. Yet, part of middle filmitis creeps in right at the film's outset, when a child is born and a young man flees for his life. We know nothing of the situation, yet the film's camera work and musical score intone great drama and import into a depiction the viewer is in no way invested in. Then we see the returning children from the first film: (in ascending order of age) Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Susan (Anna Popplewell), and Peter Pevensie (William Moseley). Yet, and here is a critical point, it takes a while for the first names of our heroes to be mentioned, thus leaving first time viewers at a loss, and the family surname is never mentioned in the whole second film.<br />Some critics have harped on the fact that the Telmarines are all swarthy Spanish Conquistadore types, while the kids are Anglo whitebreads, but for this criticism to have any weight there would have to be a much more nuanced approach to the characterization. All the Telmarines could have been Girl Scouts, and it would not have mattered, for they all act in such manifestly `bad guy' ways that their being swarthy Mediterraneans is an afterthought. Similarly, claims that the film relies too heavily on Christian iconography and a Colonial White Man's Burden mindset are rented by the utter shallowness of the screenplay. Christian/Schmistian- Aslan is just a magical lion, at home with any set of mythologies, not just the Christian one. Furthermore, since Adamson, as director, added story arcs the original book did not have, why did he not make some major changes to add zip to the tale? After all, Miraz is hardly a threat, and the fight scene between him and Peter is rather pathetic. meanwhile, the minute or two that the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) spends in the film, is far more intriguing. She would have been a far netter antagonist.<br />  Overall, The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian is still better fare- especially for children, than any of the three overblown and pompous LOTR films, but, compared to the far superior first entry in this series, it is a profound disappointment. One only hopes that Adamson can parallax the first two films and take the few things that work well in this film, and add them back to the excellence of the first film, so that the third entry, slated for 2010, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, is the best of the trio. Elsewise, fans of The Matrix will be happy that their trilogy is no longer considered the most disappointing sci fi/fantasy series Hollywood has produced.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>In this second movie in the Narnia series there's a lot of violence and killing. I would not recommend it for kiddies under ten because animal and mythological characters, the good guys, get killed and maimed in large numbers. The kiddos are going to be upset by some of the excessive violence in this sequel. Adults should be too. The battle scenes get repetitive, and the movie is too long. The villains are cardboard stereotypes.<br />The wife of a usurper to the throne gives birth to a baby so the usurper decides it is time to get rid of Prince Caspian, actor Ben Barnes, who was Dakin in the play/movie "The History Boys." Here he gives a rather bland performance, and it's the four English school kids who shine as they did in the first outing, but these kids are quite active in the killing and combat even though it's the bad guys they are fighting. For a movie aimed mostly at a young audience, there is an awful lot of slaughtering of human beings and creatures going on. When adults kill adults, it's bad enough, but when youngsters are doing it, I think it sends the wrong message.<br />The wicked witch makes a cameo appearance in a giant ice cube. As in the first episode, there are talking animals and mythological figures, but some viewers missed seeing more of the lion Aslan. The special effects are well-done. Moviegoers will recognize the good dwarf from other films - Peter Dinklage -especially good in "Death at a Funeral." There are a great many reaction shots of the oldest boy as he realizes they're in deep doodoo as many Narnians get wiped out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Having disliked the first movie (until pretty much the finale), and own but have never watched the BBC versions, I was kidding myself that I actually wanted to go and see them. But after getting my big book of all seven books in one back after two years (TWO YEARS) I started reading Prince Caspian again - and I read it overnight. I finished it at 9am, I saw the film at 7:30pm. (I've now started reading all the books from the beginning again, although skipping The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe/The Horse and His Boy as read the first one too many times, and the latter is the worst.)<br /><br />With the book fresh in my mind, it probably wasn't the greatest idea to go right into seeing the movie. My other big mistake was thinking that Andrew Adamson would actually stay faithful to the book. I learnt to read through these books (my dad could NOT do the voices), and have had a love of reading ever since. Quite an accomplishment in this day and age when kids are more interested in hanging about street corners than sitting quietly reading.<br /><br />The books aren't being filmed in chronological order, which I'm not too sad about, considering what comes between TLTWATW and Prince Caspian, The Horse And His Boy. In my opinion, THAHB was the worst book. As long as they film The Silver Chair, The Last Battle - OK, I like the rest of the books. As long as they film all of them, I won't complain. There's really not much need to have The Horse & His Boy inbetween, since all it really does is introduce the Telmarines.<br /><br />The film starts with introducing Caspian, but cutting out most of his back story and only giving us a hint of what is really going on. I instantly realised this film wasn't going to be the film of my childhood imagination, when they did a major bit wrong - Caspian is unconscious when he's rescued by the dwarves, not awake. Then a couple of scenes later, Caspian blows the 'magic' horn. This wasn't even 'seen' in the book, it was only mentioned afterwards.<br /><br />Then we're shot straight back to war torn London, where Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are all waiting to go back to school. Susan gets chatted up - another silly point in the movie.<br /><br />You know what happens after this - if you've actually read the book. I don't mind people who haven't actually read the books, I will quite happily lend it to them - but not if they keep it for two years. But people who talk about the Narnia books, but seem to only talk about TLTWATW - hello there's another six books!!! Grrr.<br /><br />The actors are getting slightly better now into the second movie. They're like the Harry Potter actors - they always suck in the first movie. I still don't like Anna Popplewell as Susan, and she seems to 'blossom' in this movie. From the outrageous flirting with Caspian (they don't even share a scene together in the book until chapter 15) to her figure in the outfit when they're trying to get to Aslan's How - it's rated a PG for a reason love, put them away. That's what I would call a 'wench' in that outfit. The romantic subplot between her and Caspian was really irrelevant- it did not move the storyline forward in the slightest (except to make me cringe) and the heart wrenching scene at the end??? She doesn't even appear again in any more of the books, except albeit briefly. So heart wrenching. She hasn't even had any scenes in the next book yet.<br /><br />Ben Barnes as Caspian was absolutely atrocious. He based his accent on Antonio Banderas, and it was truly awful at points. He was never my favourite character in the books, so thankfully he's only in for two books approximately.<br /><br />Andrew Adamson previously did the Shrek movies, and no doubt there was some influences - if you look at Puss In Boots, and Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard, which I didn't think would work) they're almost the same character. And funnily enough, one's a cat and one's a mouse.<br /><br />There's one big battle in the book. The director obviously thought it would be 'fun' to add in another battle scene, the night raid on the castle, which was unnecessary and to extend the other battle scenes so they not only became tiresome and bored me. Not necessary. Also, the reappearance of the White Witch was merely suggested in the book, and never actually appeared, but she's appears in this for a few minutes.<br /><br />One can only hope that they stick more closely to the books in future films. Or get shot of Andrew Adamson. Maybe I'll have forgotten my anger by the time Voyage Of The Dawn Treader comes out in 2010. Read the books in the chronological order as CS Lewis wanted them to be read.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>I now understand why so many great writers will never, or only under the rarest of circumstances, allow their stories to be turned into movies while they are still alive!<br /><br />There's no excuse for this  horrible adaptation! - "The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe"  was a masterpiece,  so having the  genius to make  a C. S. Lewis story into a great film was not an issue. Nor was money! Hollywood made a lot of  cash from it's first venture into Narnia! And finding four child & teen actors with fine acting talent to play the lead roles was a smash success. So why such a violent and unimaginative Prince Caspian?<br /><br />One can only speculate.  The screenplay, acting and passion are so lacking this time around that I truly wish this story never made it to the Big Screen! I feel this disaster of a film will even damage the Narnia "brand." Since making money seems to be Hollywood's only motivation in making this  film, they should know better!<br /><br />Prince Caspian was  all about fighting and killing, and more killing and more fighting. One scene shows the slaughtering of retreating Narnians and even the deliberate killing of one's  own soldiers in the process. If  you want to see real evil in a dumbed down fashion, you'll see plenty in this movie! NOR IS THIS FILM APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! There's certainly nothing cute or delightful about Prince Caspian!<br /><br />Even Aslem was portrayed as a capricious deity, who didn't lift a paw until a child had to risk her life in order to get his attention. Meanwhile, Narians are being crushed to death by flying boulders, while Aslem leisurely has a chat with her about old times.  This screenplay must have been written by an Atheist or someone with a very dark sense of humor!<br /><br />I frequently write reviews on films I have strong feelings about. I like to encourage people to see a good film and discourage them from seeing a bad one. Let's face it, we have so many entertainment choices. But another reason I write reviews is to congratulate Hollywood for a job well-done, or like in this case, when a film is an unmitigated disaster, I hope to affect their bottom line. Because  Hollywood is always confronted with two broad choice: To treat a story as art - with respect, passion and genius like they did in "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe;"  or do the opposite, and treat it like a commodity, which has the feeling of a product made on a factory assembly line! Memo to Hollywood: If you venture in Narnia again fire the current crew and bring in some fresh talent! I challenge you to make your next film one that will stand the test of time!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059540023X">Better Living Through Bad Movies</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452270057">Bad Movies We Love (Plume)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>As a fan of fantasy in general, if theres one franchise thats always felt artificial and fake to me, its Narnia. The wonderful books have been reduced to 'Fantasy for Dummies' here, with production values and acting befitting a late night TV Special. And not in a good way.<br /><br />From the moment the movie began, I had trouble staying awake, only because it seemed to be a really uninspired rehash of the LOTR special effects, but only with less heart or interest. All of the child actors are absolutely useless. They make Macaulay Culkin look like Peter O'Toole - I'm serious. I'm sure 'deadpan' is a cinematic style and all, but these kids have taken it to a whole new level.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the talking lion was just ridiculous. Let me see, he does a 'fancy thing' with a river here, and thats supposed to be the films' big highlight? I just don't get the positive reviews for this film. It was poorly made, badly acted, with elves, dwarves, talking mice, fairies etc all thrown in just because they appeared in the book (and sometimes not even)<br /><br />Of course, chances are you might just love this, but my own two cents was that it was an absolute waste of time and money. Not to mention I could have been at home fast asleep, or better still, watching reruns of "The Nanny"<br /><br />Two Generous Stars<br /><br />PS : I see glowing reviews here for Ben Barnes who plays the Prince.

But as someone who actually enjoyed the first one I was startled by how shockingly dull this snoozefest sequel is.<br /><br />I can sit here and spend an hour writing a review that tears the film apart bit by bit though, quite frankly, I have better things to do with my time so I will only focus on my biggest complaints.<br /><br />Yes, I know it's a film for kids and that it's rated PG but where is the blood? Hundreds of people, humans and creatures alike, are felled in battle but there is not one drop of blood in the whole movie. What is this teaching our children about violence exactly? Don't give me any nonsense about traumatizing them either. I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GVKW8">Predator [Blu-ray</a>] when I was a kid and I turned out fine. But this is Disney after all and the only people keeping them afloat as a studio are overprotective mothers who fear absolutely everything and are only too happy to spend money on movies and products that falsely suggest that the world is a magical and safe place (this is what you call being 'Disneyfied') and consider something as tame and boring as Prince Caspian to be dark and tough. "You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember," warns Aslan. Wow, does that mean that we'll be getting Rambo-level violence? Sadly, no. However, more people are killed in this film. Can you work that out? Because I can't.<br /><br />Since I haven't read the book I wasn't previously orientated as to who's who and what their motivations are, and the film doesn't make it any clearer I promise you. Far, far too often I found myself asking 'Who is he?', 'Who are they?', 'Why are all the bad guys identical to each other?', 'Why are they the bad guys again?'. 'What do they want?'. 'Why are they all Spanish?', 'Why are the kids still kids? Shouldn't they return to Narnia as adults?' And so on...and so on...<br /><br />The only thing this film is good for is a cure for insomnia. I know that's a childish and crass and far from being a clever soundbite but it was so catatonic that it simply is not inspiring an intelligent review out of me.<br /><br />Whatever charm <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAFJXE">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe [Blu-ray</a>] had is well and truly gone, all that's left is some pretty scenery and that's not enough to keep me interested for well over two hours. Please Disney, don't even bother making the rest of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>I am going to say up front that I really enjoyed this movie.  I was delighted and entertained.  Prince Caspian follows The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as the second installment of the classic Chronicles of Narnia series by C. S. Lewis.  It is a strong sequel:  the pacing is terrific, the plot moves quickly along, and the visuals are absolutely exquisite, both location and CGI.  All of the performances and characterizations are top notch.  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy ARE the characters in my head from the books.  Aslan IS Aslan; I couldn't ask for anything more.  The introduction of Reepicheep, the valiant and loyal mouse, is wonderful.  He leaps perfectly from the book to the screen, as real and alive as I have always imagined him.  Trumpkin, Prince Caspian, the Badger, Nickabrick, the Trees (oh, those amazing Trees!!!!!), Miraz, the Doctor, etc., are all that I expected, and in many cases, more.<br /><br />Now, here is where it loses the star:  this movie is much more of a departure from the book than The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was.  I can't help it, I lived in Narnia for many years.  I still visit at least once a year.  I have the chapters, the dialog, the entire series memorized.  As I watched this movie, the book was playing in parallel inside my head, so, to me, the changes and omissions were obvious.  Most of them were merely annoying, but two things really bugged me.<br /><br />1. The love interest between Caspian and Susan does not exist in the book. So why the need to turn this into a teen romance?  I agree with Edmund, I don't want to understand it.<br /><br />2. The constant sparring between Peter and Caspian is totally unnecessary, and it adds nothing, IMHO.  In the books, Peter clearly tells Caspian that he has come to put him on his throne, not to take it.  He is a very supportive friend.  So why the "my crown is bigger than yours" tension?  I found it ridiculous and distracting.<br /><br />Again, all the salient points from the book made it to the screen, and overall, I was charmed and enchanted by this movie.  Disney is doing a splendid job translating these classics to film. I hope they do all seven.  The Narnian in me just wants them to stay closer to the stories that C. S. Lewis wrote.  However, that does not prevent me from highly recommending this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>- Reepicheep, on first meeting Caspian and threatening him with his sword: "Choose your last words carefully, Telmarine!"<br />- Caspian: "You are a mouse."<br />- Reepicheep (sighing): "I was hoping for something a little more original."<br /><br />Okay, C.S. Lewis' Narnian chronicles are hallowed stuff to me, so I'm always gonna be critical of films adapting these books. Between you and me, I wasn't so enamoured with the first one, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)</a>, feeling that it lacked the wonder and heart of the book. Then came the sequel. I remember sitting in the theater, with my arms crossed and thinking, "Okaaaay. Impress me."<br /><br />(Some SPOILERS follow.)<br /><br />Thankfully, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIAN improves on the first film. And, even if it does veer away from the source material for a bit, the crux of the story remains the same. I guess it makes sense that the titular character is given more attention, although his tepid romance with Susan (which isn't in the book) unfolds almost in passing. Ben Barnes turns in a so-so performance, his Caspian relegated to going thru the familiar heroic posturings. He's really not even the main protagonist; that would be Peter. Hopefully, Barnes's acting improves, or the script does, because he'll play an even larger role in the third film VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. But PRINCE CASPIAN, the movie itself, is pretty damn entertaining.<br /><br />The movie eventually shifts its focus on the four Pevensie children, but first we get caught up with some doings in Narnia, in which many ages had elapsed and the times again are troubled. The opening passage introduces us to the young Telmarine prince, Caspian, who is very soon forced to flee from his murderous uncle and his sharp-bearded soldiers. In his meanderings in the woods, Caspian comes across the fabulous folk and Talking Beasts of Narnia, thought to have become extinct during the cruel Telmarines' reign (or was it that they were never supposed to have existed, in the first place?). Within these expatriated creatures Prince Caspian stokes the fires of rebellion. And, so, the battle is on, to reclaim the old kingdom of Narnia.<br /><br />Note that, in his frantic flight from his uncle, Caspian had blown an ancient mystical horn, rumored to summon aid in times of dire need. Rumor's true.<br /><br />Back in World War II-era England Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie have grown a year older since their unlikely adventures, and they often wonder if they'll ever set foot on Narnia again. As they await their train in the hectic railway station, they quite suddenly find themselves whisked away from the bustle of noisy old England and into desolate, unfamiliar surroundings. The Pevensies stumble onto an ancient, broken down castle, and it shockingly dawns on them that they're wandering around in the ruins of Cair Paravel, their old home when they reigned as Kings and Queens of Narnia, and when Peter was High King. They soon unearth their most cherished treasures, those gifted to them by Father Christmas: Peter's sword and shield, Susan's bow and arrows, and Lucy's tiny bottle of healing cordial (Edmund, if you recall, wasn't around when Father Christmas was doling out presents). As expected, Susan's horn is missing.<br /><br />The Pevensies, not long after, fight off two Telmarine soldiers on a boat and rescue their sullen captive dwarf from drowning. A further chain of events would have the children learning that thirteen hundred years had gone by, and that, in the meantime, Narnia had been invaded by the Telmarines. The children soon encounter Caspian and his ragtag troops, which then allows for the epic stuff to be unleashed and for Aslan's inevitable return.<br /><br />One of my gripes in the first film was that I didn't buy into the actor playing Peter. But he's better in this one. Perhaps being a few years older helped him to grow into the role. The rest of the British kids are also good, although Georgie Henley as Lucy and Skandar Keynes as Edmund had always been spot on. Edmund actually is pretty good in a swashbuckling role, and Anna Popplewell (Susan) gets to actually throw down with her bow and arrows. But, when you get right down to it, the talented Georgie Henley still provides the most heartfelt emotional punch. There's a pure simple joy, wonderful to behold, in Lucy's unbridled love for and faith in Aslan.<br /><br />Deciding to insert even more thrills, the film strays from the book and invents new sequences centering on Peter and Caspian's exiled, makeshift army attempting to take the fight to Caspian's uncle, who happens to rule this new Narnia. There's also the return of an old foe, that awkward thing between Caspian and Susan, and leader-of-the-pack friction developing between Peter and Caspian. And again veering away from the book, Peter demonstrates an angry, combative side, which manifests early on, in a schoolboy row back in wartime London. It's... interesting. And I guess it's better than being bland, which is what Peter was in the first film.<br /><br />No gripes at all about the visual effects. No gripes about the look and feel of the movie, which is remarkable and epic (although not coming near the scope of, say, LORD OF THE RINGS). New characters come in and quickly ingratiate themselves. There's the endearingly surly dwarf Trumpkin, the wise badger Trufflehunter, and the chattery squirrel Pattertwig. There's another dwarf Nikabrik, who's even surlier than Trumpkin, but he's not exactly what one would label as "endearing." The best Talking Beast, hands down, is Reepicheep, the chivalrous mouse who brooks no insults. Reepicheep is voiced by Eddie Izzard, who declares that his character is "Mad Max crossed with a Storm Trooper." One of my favorite moments in the book is of the conversation between Reepicheep and Aslan regarding the magnificent mouse's hacked-off tail. I think the movie does it justice.<br /><br />Three discs in this packaging, plenty of in-depth bonus stuff. Disc One offers the feature film, as well as a fun audio commentary by Director Andrew Adamson and young actors Ben Barnes (Caspian), Georgie Henley (Lucy), Skandar Keynes (Edmund), William Moseley (Peter), and Anna Popplewell (Susan).<br /><br />Disc Two has the making-of featurette "Inside Narnia: The Adventure Returns" (35 minutes long); "Sets of Narnia: A Classic Comes to Life" (23 minutes) is a pretty neat segment, demonstrating that the bulk of the sets aren't CG - and you do get a sense of just how huge an undertaking the set-creating process is (also features Douglas Gresham, the film's co-producer and C.S. Lewis's step-son, who here reads brief excerpts from the book); "Big Movie Comes to a Small Town" - focusing on the small, picturesque Slovenian town of Bovec and the logistics of shooting the sequence in which the water titan destroys the bridge (23 minutes).<br /><br />Also on Disc 2: "Previsualizing Narnia" - about an animated storyboarding device called pre-vis, used in prepping for this film (10 minutes); "Talking Animals and Walking Trees: The Magical World of Narnia" - the cast & crew (but mostly crew) reflect on Narnia (5 minutes, kinda dull); ten deleted scenes with director's intros (11 minutes), none of which are particularly must-see, although one deleted scene develops deeper the attraction between Caspian and Susan; some okay bloopers (3 minutes); "Secrets of the Duel" - how Peter and King Miraz's duel was brought to life (7 minutes); "Becoming Trumpkin" - focus on Peter Dinklage, who's quite terrific as Trumpkin (5 minutes); and an 11 minute look at "Warwick Davis: The Man Behind Nikabrik" as we follow him during one arduous day of shooting (remember him in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXDD">Willow (Special Edition)</a>?). And Disc Three is the digital copy.<br /><br />So, I guess I'm finally invested in this film franchise and now find myself hugely anticipating THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, which returns Caspian, Edmund, Lucy, and Reepicheep, and also debuts the sniveling Eustace. It's a good thing that there's an ample turnover of sons of Adam and daughters of Eve in the Narnia chronicles. Else, these kid actors would be sprouting stubbles before the film series is done. Yes, I'm referring to you, Harry Potter franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This film was one long battle sequence after the next. The production felt rushed, and any form of character development is thrown to the winds. Everything begins so abruptly. The setup at the start of the film is almost a joke. The dude that portrays Prince Caspian comes off as a bit of a douche. There was also an overabundace of CGI, AND the director borrows liberally from THE LORD OF THE RINGS and every other fantasy film imaginable.<br /><br />All in all, this was an extremely disappointing experience. I'd compare it with the way I felt after seeing THE GOLDEN COMPASS, which was another pointless CGI-fest - although NARNIA wasn't as stupid. There were a few things to be admired here, but not enough for me to award it anything over two stars. By the way, Peter Dinklage was excellent as always, and was the only character that I cared about. I just hope that he moves away from this sort of thing. THE STATION AGENT was amazing...<br /><br />Anyways...I loved the first one, and nearly loathed this one. They need to scrap this and start all over again. C.S. Lewis is probably rolling in his grave. Bless his heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Imagine finding a magical kingdom in another world... only to return over a thousand years later, and find it in ruins.<br /><br />That's the whole idea of "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian," a superb sequel to "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe." While it has a climax that goes on WAY too long, this movie shows us the darker side of C.S. Lewis' fantastical world -- with a heavy dose of Shakespearean villains, political intrigue, and some spectacularly epic battles.<br /><br />It's been 1,300 years in Narnia, and the human Telmarines have invaded and driven the native Narnians underground. Aslan hasn't been seen in centuries.<br /><br />And when King Miraz's (Sergio Castellitto) wife gives birth to a baby boy, his nephew -- the rightful heir -- becomes an obstacle. Young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) flees from his treacherous uncle, and is discovered by a band of Narnians. Along the way, he accidentally ends up summoning the ancient Kings and Queens of Narnia -- also known as the Pevensie children, who were waiting at a train station when they were unexpectedly sucked trough a tunnel.<br /><br />Though initially delighted to have returned to Narnia, the Pevensies are horrified when they find that their once-idyllic land has been nearly destroyed. Caspian has been organizing a ramshackle army of native Narnians, but Peter (William Moseley) finds that fighting an organized, armed force is very different from battling the White Witch. And after a disastrous attack, the Narnians are facing almost certain destruction -- but Lucy (Georgie Henley) is convinced that Aslan can somehow save them, and restore the kingdom to Prince Caspian....<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" is definitely a darker story than its predecessor -- good guys die, coups fail, evil machinations succeed, the castles are grimy, some of the good guys turn bad for real, and a bleak, hopeless feeling suffuses much of the movie's second half. Even our heroes have to deal with their doubts and anger, especially since Aslan is conspicuously absent for 95% of the entire film.<br /><br />And if the first film was a colorful fantasy adventure, then this one is a military story with all the necessary action trappings -- spectacular aerial drops, castle-wide massacres, and a spectacular finale involving a massive pit, tree roots, a river, and catapults. But Adamson also packs in as much violence as a PG-rated movie can contain -- while there's only a few drops of actual gore, there's plenty of beheadings, shootings and stabbings.<br /><br />But Narnia itself has lost none of its charm, and Adamson lingers lovingly on the sunlit forests and quiet rivers for as long as he can. And though the story is grim, he sprinkles it with plenty of humor (the bound-and-gagged cat) and fairly snappy dialogue. One of the most spectacular scenes involves a very familiar character speaking from inside a sheet of shimmering ice, as Caspian is dragged into a necromancer's ritual. It's really rather creepy.<br /><br />Problems with the movie? Well, the climactic battle drags on for a LONG time, and every time you think it'll end, it revs back up. And those masked soldiers are a wee bit too reminiscent of "300's" Persians.<br /><br />The four Pevensie actors all do solid jobs, although William Moseley is the standout -- Peter is struggling with doubt and a bit of alpha rivalry, especially since he's used to being Narnia's top dog. Barnes starts off a little stiffly -- come on, where's the fear when you see your bed turned into a pincushion? -- but soon grows into the difficult role of a Hamlet-like prince who is struggling to become both a Narnian friend and a Telmarine king.<br /><br />But there's a pretty brilliant supporting cast as well: Castellitto is simply outstanding as the ruthless, icy-cold Miraz, as are Dami&aacute;n Alc&aacute;zar and Pierfrancesco Favino as his scheming advisors. Warwick Davis does a low-key, malevolent turn as Nikabrik, while Peter Dinklage is the likably brusque, cynical Trumpkin. And Eddie Izzard is top-notch as the mousy swashbuckler Reepicheep -- this could have a silly, comic-relief character, but he does end up being both adorable and formidable.<br /><br />There are going to be two versions of the "Prince Caspian" release in either blu ray or regular versions. The more embellish DVD version basically has the film, plus an extra bonus disc with the stuff you'd expect in such a movie: bloopers, deleted scenes, and a series of featurettes about the making of the movie -- previsualization, fight choreography, sets, special effects, and the guys who play the dwarves Trumpkin and Nikabrik. As for the third disk, it's going to be a downloadable digital version of the movie.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" drops the children's fantasy feeling, in favor of a darker, more militaristic story -- especially with all that father-murder stuff. But despite its darker overtones, it never forgets the light side.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>Managed to get to see this particular film at the cinema and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />It is a year since the Pevensey children were in Narnia, all are on their way back to boarding school, when they are pulled back into a world that they think they only left a year ago.<br /><br />However over 1000 years have passed in Narnia, they as the children of Adam have long been forgotten and for the moment their is no sign of Aslan.<br /><br />Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are destined to fight for Narnia once more, but this time to put Prince Caspian on the throne, as his evil uncle wants to kill him and ensure that his son, only recently born will take over after him as regent.<br /><br />Peter at 16 years of age is an angry young man who is trying to find his place in the world, having been an adult for so long and then having to make the transition back to childhood, he is confused and resentful, he makes some misguided decisions which results in the death of many Narnians and only Lucy and Peter  seem to have a grasp of what must be done, for even their old sister Susan is struggling to deal with her won losses, which include her childhood and the fact she will never return to Narnia.<br /><br />There are fantastic special effects, amazing battle sequences and some truly great characters, Peter Dinklage as the gruff but kindly dwarf Trumpkin is especially likable, and Warick Davies shakes off his good hearted Willow image when he turns into a Narnian who wants the ice queen back on the throne and tempts Prince Caspian to bring her back in order for him to have a powerful ally in the forthcoming battle.<br /><br />All in all a great sequel, and one I will be getting the DVD for when it comes out.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>One year after the events of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe", Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find them drawn back into Narnia.  1300 years have passed there and their former castle is in ruins.  They have been summoned by Prince Caspian (Barnes), who is in hiding from his uncle, King Miraz (Castellitto), who has marked him for death.  If the Pevensie kids can help him reclaim his throne, all the creatures of the land will be able to live in peace.  If not, Miraz will rule ruthlessly.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" brings the Narnia series to the next level.  The effects are improved, the action is improved, and the actors seem more comfortable in their roles.  Ben Barnes, as the titular character, is average however.  He lacks enough personality to make us care about Caspian, but that is a small quibble in an otherwise entertaining film.  Director Andrew Adamson has learned from the first film and improved the finished product.  Although rated PG, it is more in line with {G-13 fare due to a load of violence.  That's not a bad thing, just a warning.  I recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian" is destined to become a classic, fondly remembered by many as one of the best fantasy films ever made by Hollywood. Director Andrew Adamson does a better job here than in the previous film in directing an exciting, heart-pounding rendition of the classic C. S. Lewis tale which stays true in spirit to Lewis' "Chronicles of Narnia", even if this adaptation isn't nearly as faithful as, for example, Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings". Once more Adamson relies on excellent props and other special effects made by the New Zealand-based WETA Workshop (which was the source for the "Lord of the Rings" films too.), but first, and foremost, he is blessed in excellent acting from the children portraying the Pevesnie family: Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy, (Georgie Henley). Not surprisingly, Georgie Henley once more steals almost every scene she is in as the young Lucy. So does Sergio Castellitto (Protector Miraz), who portrays the cynically evil despotic ruler of the Telmarines, while Ben Barnes is quite impressive too as his nephew, the young Prince Caspian X.<br /><br />While a year has passed in wartime World War II London for the Pevesnie children, 1300 years have elapsed in Narnia. One day they are magically transported back, and soon find themselves rescuing a cantankerous dwarf (Peter Dinklage) who fills them in on recent Narnian history. Eventually they come across Prince Caspian too, and join forces, hoping to help the young prince in taking his rightful place as the true successor to his father, not his usurper uncle Miraz. Aided once more by a large band of centaurs, dwarves, badgers, rats, and other Narnian animals, the Pevesnie children are also reunited with the heroic god-like lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), as they wage a desperate struggle to free Narnia from Telmarine rule and restore young Prince Caspian to his throne.<br /><br />Devout fans of C. S. Lewis and "The Chronicles of Narnia" will enjoy this spectacular film, which, I note again, is destined to become a cinematic classic. So will countless others who aren't familiar with Lewis' work.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>In 'Prince Caspian' we return to an altered and savage Narnia and more fantasy adventure to delight the family. You get great affects, battle scenes, talking animals and a pretty close rendition of the book. I have to say that I found this more enjoyable than 'The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' with the slightly darker elements to the story fitting the fantasy adventure theme a lot better. The children stars of this film annoy me as actors and Prince Caspians accent reminded me of Puss in Boots from Shrek at times, but overall the acting was OK and didn't detract from the story. It manages to achieve what it set out to, that is, a fun family adventure and manages to keep you interested and watching for the duration, which didn't feel overly long as the story kept pushing forward. A good film that is worth watching if you were a fan of the first installment or of fantasy films in general.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>The second installment in the Narnia franchise (the filmmakers are apparently following the chronological publication order of the books rather than their order in Narnian history) maintains the high quality of the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition)</a> and actually improves upon the book it was based on.  It's been a year since we last saw the four Pevensie children, the Battle of Britain is over, and London is safe enough for them to go back there--or at least to pass through on their way to boarding school.  But Peter (William Moseley), in particular, finds it difficult to forget that he was a High King in Narnia for 15 years or so.  Then unknown magic draws them back to the land they once ruled--only to find that centuries have passed there, their castle of Caer Paravel is a forgotten ruin, and Narnia has been conquered by the neighboring Telmarines, who have succeeded in driving the Old Narnains--dwarves, fauns, talking animals, centaurs, and the rest--into hiding.  The sole hope they have for freedom is the young prince, Caspian (Ben Barnes), whose uncle and guardian, Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), has recently ordered him killed upon fathering a son of his own and seizing the throne.  Caspian, it turns out, has summoned the Pevensies back by means of Susan's (Anna Popplewell) ivory horn--and is a bit disappointed to find out that they're only children.  But Narnia's magic is working on them already, and they may be a greater help to him than anyone knows.<br /><br />Once again, if you've read the book, you know what to expect in the way of plot.  The story might have benefited from giving us all the background on Caspian and his tutor, Dr. Cornelius (Vincent Grass), who was largely responsible for teaching him the true history of Narnia and inspiring him to want to rule it properly.  But it's definitely improved by a non-canonical attempt on the part of the Old Narnian army to seize Miraz's castle in the dark of night and make him a prisoner (watch for the gryphons being used, as they were in the first film, as a Narnian airborne auxiliary--almost certainly something Peter or Edmund (Skandar Keynes) thought of), and by a hint of attraction between Caspian and Susan.  Castellitto is a wonderful villain with a touch of the exotic, and, of course, the effects are dazzling, especially the battle scenes and the Old Narnians (Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard), the swashbuckling Talking Mouse, is an utter delight, and be sure to keep your eye open for the very young, and very proud, centaur colt who's part of the triumphal arch of swords with which they salute the four returned Kings and Queens).  Liam Neeson returns as the excellent voice of Aslan.  Though perhaps more savage and violent than the book, it's also much more exciting and faster-paced.  The third entry, "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader," is scheduled to be released around Christmastime and should be just as good.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The music was perfect. I think, if its possible, they use the surrounding scenery to an even more dramatic effect then in the first movie. The attention to detail was excellent. It was a world you could live in and believe in. The actors were superb and that included the voice actors for the animals. I found it a very good story and one that gives you plenty to talk about, and think on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>I think it's safe to say that the folks at Disney (the company that made this film) watched too much of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X9FLKM">The Lord of the Rings</a> and tried - and failed - to emulate it. Epic battles, living trees, and much more are pulled directly from what we saw only a few years ago under Peter Jackson's able hands. And although THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIAN has a few "moments" of its own, it fails to entertain anywhere near the first film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAFJXE">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>.<br /><br />This is mostly due to the fact that we are rushed into battle scene after battle scene with little time to look at (and feel for) the characters. This is painfully obvious when we get 7/8 of the way through the film and still haven't seen Aslan but have been in so many fights that they begin to meld together. The Lord of the Rings never had this problem because the focus was kept tight on the characters, particularly the Hobbits. Which brings me to a positive point about Prince Caspian: the development of the friendship between Lucy (Georgie Henley, returning from the first Chronicles film) with that of the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O2MBP0">Death at a Funeral</a>). Although lightly touched on by comparisons with, say, Samwise and Frodo, the connection between dwarf and young queen was powerful enough to make me care a bit about what happened to them.<br /><br />The downsides, however, are just too numerous. The almost bratty nature of Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZAE1I">Stardust</a>) made the main character seem petulant rather than regal. And his continued arrogance toward Peter (William Moseley) was completely out of context with C.S. Lewis' novels. The repetitive battle scenes lead nowhere, and when Narnians die, we really don't feel any remorse for them as the viewer.<br /><br />That said, there's plenty of eye-candy in terms of CGI. It's everywhere. And it's almost too pervasive. But it is used well ...albeit often.<br /><br />The big question many may be asking is: "Should I watch it?" And the answer is a definite "yes." Although it's horribly flawed, it's worth watching for Lucy and Trumpkin, as well as the funny antics of Pattertwig the Squirrel and his deadly sword. And you'll need to be up on the film for the final release due out some time in the near future: THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. Let's hope Disney gets that one right and we'll at least have two out of three in the positive corner.</p></br></body></html>

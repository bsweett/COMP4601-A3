Jamie Foxx is REAL good in this movie and in a few scenes he shows the acting ability that took him from playing comic roles to his show-stopper as Ray Charles.<br /><br />I'm going to take as a given that you've heard a thumbnail of the plot: Foxx is a taxi driver with unrealized dreams, Cruise gets into the cab in the second scene and forces Foxx to drive him around to a series of hits during the night.<br /><br />In one brilliant scene Foxx is forced to enter a den of hardened criminals and pretend to be "Vincent" the hit-man.  He is initially terrified - realistically - but as he realizes his very life depends on his ability to seem a callous assassin he undergoes a remarkable transformation in a few moments.  Foxx steals this scene: the best in the movie.<br /><br />Until the final act there is not a flaw in the movie.  The first hour and fifteen minutes are good and compel you to the ending, but once you arrive there a few formulas kick in.  When Foxx is forced to accompany the killer I was reminded of Ethan Hawke as Denzel Washington's "good cop" partner in "Training Day".  In both of these films you suspect that the ethical character is going to be brought to a situation where not only his life is threatened, but also his ability to "stand up" and "do the right thing."  If Collateral had stuck to this track and realistically resolved the conflict I'd have awarded 5 stars.  I don't want to give away the ending, but Cruise's character survives an unseatbelted tumble in a flipping high-speed taxi crash, then a shot to the head, and keeps coming as if he were "The Terminator".  "Fargo" and "Pulp Fiction" made getting a shot to the head look like a painful, bloody thing.  "Collateral" makes it look like a good boxing punch.  Still, worth seeing, and Foxx probably deserves a "Best Supporting Actor" nomination for this film as well as "Best Actor" for "Ray".</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>'Collateral' is classic Michael Mann - it resembles 'Heat' in a lot of ways.  Mann spends time on character development.  We get to know Janie Foxx's character 'Max' very well through about a 15-minute or so introduction.  It's great movie making.<br /><br />By contrast, Tom Cruise's 'Vincent' is a cipher here.  And rightfully so.  Mann's unwillingness - and Foxx's inability - to penetrate Vincent is crucial to the chill that develops whenever Vincent swings into action.  Cruise is great - never once did I think "that's Tom Cruise playing Vincent." Instead, the guy frightened me to death.  So much for the theory that Tom Cruise has to play the hero.  He's about as far from that here as you can get.<br /><br />Foxx surpasses even that praise.  He's deserves an Academy Award nomination here.  His 10-minute scene with Javier Bardem is just about the finest piece of acting you'll ever see.  This one-on-one confrontation was reminiscent of the Pacino/DeNiro ("I do scores") meet in 'Heat.'</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Within an actor's career there is generally one film, sometimes more, that is viewed as a defining moment for that actor. The point at which no matter what is going on in the person's public life, according to the media, or however many successful movies or flops they've had throughout their career, a moviegoer sees this defining moment and says "This person is actually a really solid actor, and completely sold me on their character, to the point I actually forgot who the actor was I was watching." Or at least say or think something to that effect after watching the defining movie. Anyways, it doesn't really matter how long a person's career is, this moment can happen early or late in a career, it's all a matter of the right material at the right time. For Tom Cruise, his defining moment, actually moments in his case, would be "The Last Samurai" and "Collateral"; the latter is the one I believe was his biggest moment. Both movies came later in his career, long after he had become a household name.<br /><br />"Collateral" takes place in Los Angeles over the course of one long night for a cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx), whose newest fare, an outgoing man named Vincent (Tom Cruise), is about to turn his life upside down. Unbeknownst to Max when he took this newest fare, Vincent is a contract killer who is in town to make five stops, which amounts to five kills, and then leaves L.A. as if he was never there. Now, Max must struggle with the fact that he is essentially becoming an accomplice to the murder of 5 people, while at the same time he is trying to find a way to not only survive the night, but also save a few of the people's lives in the process.<br /><br />For me, "Collateral" is the biggest defining moment in Tom Cruise's career, I know I said he's had two moments, but this movie is much more significant than "The Last Samurai", in terms of how convincing his performance truly was. In this movie Tom Cruise still plays a likeable character, to an extent, but one with a much darker side than most of his characters, and over the course of the movie Vincent loses all of his charm, becoming even colder, to the point that there is no possible redemption for him in the audiences eyes. To my knowledge, this is the first time that Cruise has ever played an all-out villain, sure he's played a few characters with questionable morals and what-not, but never one that is purely cold, calculating and in the end, evil. Another surprise for me, was the fact that Tom Cruise actually allowed his hair to be dyed gray, further evidence that he really wanted to sell this character to the audience and make them forget who it was they were watching, and know only the character on the screen. Everything about Cruise's performance was brilliant, from his charm that masked his underlying evil, to his extreme intensity and sharp focus, he never once missed a beat, and that is what allowed "Collateral" to become such a defining moment in his long career.<br /><br />The supporting cast, primarily Jamie Foxx, was very solid, engaging and thoroughly believable. Jamie Foxx delivered an excellent performance as a cabbie who is deluding himself and those around him into believing that he will one day own a limo service for the rich and powerful. The change Max endures over the course of this one difficult night with Vincent is so deep that you see everything about him change before your eyes. From his attention to detail and cleanliness to his delusions of grandeur, nothing about Max would ever be the same after this night was over, and Jamie Foxx handled the evolution of his character with such ease and believability, that it's easy to see why he's become such a big star in Hollywood.<br /><br />Directed by acclaimed director Michael Mann ("Heat"), whose great attention to detail and character development is appropriately suited to just this type of material, the fate of "Collateral" could not have been in any better hands. Mann has managed to direct such big name stars as Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, and Colin Farrell throughout his career, and he's become so powerful within the Hollywood system, that he actually had the clout to be able to reject Tom Cruise, at first, in regards to the role of Vincent. It wasn't until Tom participated in a test, where he acted as if he was a deliveryman, a test that Mann used as a gauge for whether or not Tom Cruise could be believable in the role, that he won the role and the opportunity to prove just how talented he really was.<br /><br />"Collateral" is the kind of movie that demands your attention from start to finish, as it continuously builds up an intriguing story and increases the tension as the minutes tick by, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats until the credits roll.<br /><br />"Collateral" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />What happens when a working class stiff - you know, a decent human being and a live-and-let-live Average Joe type - finds himself face to face with Evil incarnate?  Well, that's exactly what happens to a cab driver named Max in Michael Mann's allegorical thriller "Collateral," a sharply-defined morality tale that unfolds on the freeways and surface streets of after-hours Los Angeles.<br /><br />"Collateral" is that rare crime drama that is more concerned with theme and character than with the mechanics of the crime - at least until the movie shatters to pieces in its closing reel, that is.  But for starters, writer Stuart Beattie has come up with a humdinger of a premise to get the ball rolling.  Max has been driving a cab for twelve years now, but he still has dreams of owning a fancy limo company one day, then retiring to his own private little island getaway in the South Seas.  One fateful night, he picks up a fare who will end up changing his life forever.  Vincent is a paid assassin who virtually kidnaps Max, forcing him to drive him around town so he can track down and execute his assigned hits.  Max can do little but look on helplessly as he gets pulled further and further into this cat-and-mouse game of cold-blooded murder.<br /><br />"Collateral" is, above all, an actor's film, as two intriguing characters square off in a fascinating duel of wills.  As Max, Jamie Foxx beautifully captures the subtle intensity of a man, passive and humanistic by nature, who is forced to participate in what is to him an incomprehensible case of ritualized slaughter.  Tom Cruise, cast against type as an unshaven, salt-and-pepper-haired villain, is chilling as a steely-eyed killer seemingly cut off from even the most basic human emotions of empathy and concern for one's fellow man.  Together, these two fine actors draw us into their epic struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil, with the latter seemingly holding most of the cards.<br /><br />The movie is filled with moments of extraordinary suspense and tension as Vincent and Max act out their human drama against the backdrop of a beautifully filmed LA at night - with Mann showing, once again, as he did in "Heat," that no director captures that milieu with greater precision than he does.  Moreover, the moody soundtrack provides a perfect, otherworldly complement to the slightly surreal story unraveling on screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, "Collateral" falls apart long about the last half hour, as the plot mechanics take over and the characters become pawns in the hands of an out-of-control screenwriter who obviously could find no workable way to bring his tale to a satisfying conclusion.  The tension in the first three-quarters of the film derives from our knowledge that Vincent has, for all intents and purposes, caught Max in a snare from which he cannot escape.  Thus, that cab becomes a crucial factor in the human drama taking place within its restrictive confines.  But once Max and Vincent leave the cab and become separated in the closing stretches, we lose that sense of claustrophobic entrapment so essential to the tale, and most of the tension evaporates.  Thus, what starts off as a severely circumscribed tale of two men caught in their own private little hell ultimately devolves into a damsel-in-distress, knight-in-shining-armor action fantasy that undercuts the realism and seriousness of all that came before.<br /><br />Still, taken as a whole, "Collateral" is a thriller well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>About a couple of weeks ago, I went to check out "Collateral" at the theater. The film was nothing short of action-packed and intense! The direction of Michael Mann ("Heat", "The Insider") was top-notch and outstanding! With its meditative aerial views of downtown street grids and rich digital-video cinematography that unites sparkle and grime into a kind of seedy nocturnal poetry, "Collateral" is one of the best-looking modern noirs that you'll see. It could be a corollary to another modern noir and Mann's best film, the epic crime story "Heat" -- a more modest, more arty riff on L.A.'s underside and on the juxtaposition of straight and criminal leads. The performance of Tom Cruise ("The Last Samurai"), offering a change of pace for his role as a ruthless killer, was nothing short of intense! It's impossible to take your eyes off of Cruise for a second! The performance of Jamie Foxx ("Any Given Sunday") was nothing short of excellent! Joining them are Jada Pinkett Smith (The "Matrix" films), Mark Ruffalo ("13 Going on 30"), Peter Berg ("Cop Land"), and Bruce McGill ("Runaway Jury") in which they gave great performances as well.<br /><br />The film pairs a fast-talking, hired assassin named Vincent (Cruise) in town for one night with a cabbie named Max (Foxx) on the night shift. Vincent arrives in the city late with orders to knock off five people involved in a drug-trafficking trial set to start the next morning. After being impressed with Max's knowledge of L.A. shortcuts and traffic patterns en route to his first hit, Vincent hires Max to be his driver for the night, securing his services first with a handful of hundred dollar bills and later, when Max knows what Vincent is up to, through threat of violence.<br /><br />As the cabbie, Jamie Foxx continues his perhaps unlikely rise from sitcom celeb to A-list actor, though it's easy to imagine dozens of other actors inhabiting the same role just as well. Appealing supporting players Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett Smith are fine, if perhaps underused. But the real attraction here is Tom Cruise, and for a director who has worked with such high-wattage actors as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Russell Crowe, Daniel Day-Lewis, and even William Petersen (who gave an intense, moody performance in Mann's 1986 film, "Manhunter", the superior precursor to "The Silence of the Lambs"), Cruise seems a little too plain -- a little too dull -- for a Mann protagonist. But clearly, Cruise's own image is at work here, with Mann playing off Cruise's unflappable persona and trying to get dramatic mileage by having the actor play against type as a ruthless bad guy. (A scene in a jazz club is a set piece to show off the depths of Vincent's heartlessness and Cruise's bravery.) Cruise's Vincent certainly makes for a compelling visual, his silver hair and gray stubble matching his shiny, shark-colored suit to form the image of a hit man as walking handgun. Cruise is as watchable as ever, but his Vincent is too much the cipher. His line readings are so practice-perfect that Vincent could be as easily be a Cruise hero from any of the actor's other action movies.<br /><br />In conclusion, "Collateral" has the makings of a gritty, action-packed thriller with suspense at every twist and turn. Under the direction of an industry hack like Joel Schumacher or Brett Ratner, "Collateral" might have ranged from unwatchable to instantly forgettable. But luckily for us, Michael Mann gives it enough soul and visual verve to make it worth seeing, which is a not-inconsiderable feat. But ultimately, "Collateral" might be just another Hollywood star vehicle. Without a doubt, "Collateral" is a DVD must-own for your collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>I sort of thought they didn't make movies as good as this anymore. In a way, Collateral is nostalgic, recalling a time when character development meant more than giving a character a wife with a minor speaking part. In a way, though, too, it's the best kind of modern, with terrific setpieces, editing and action.<br /><br />Slightly eccentric casting pays off in the case of Cruise and Fox, one easily believable as a suave killer who could pass for a businessman, the other equally believable as an ordinary guy with an acute sense of humor. In the end, I think it's not just that they pull off these performances in spite of themselves; but that Cruise's arrogance helps him to channel Vincent, and that Fox brings out the cab driver's sense of humor as one of his defining characteristics.<br /><br />The strong performances by the two main characters and the solid, clever script are the main attractions, but also worth noticing is the beautiful photography; it works so well with its urban location, which always seems like more than a backdrop. Then there's a scene in a dance club called Fever which rivals the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Kill Bill for sheer choreography and slickness. There's something about seeing Tom Cruise effortlessly break a man's leg with a stomp kick which alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Thematically, Collateral is interesting, although Cruise's Philosophical Villain may seem overplayed to those very familiar with such devices. Still, the idea of a doubled character (central to Alfred Hitchcock's work), of moral ambiguity and of a Stockholm Syndrome-like sympathy with Cruise's character, all come off very well. Even at the end, when it seems to degenerate into a simple action picture, the themes are still subtly operating, and are strongest in the last scene.<br /><br />I'm wondering if this film is destined to become a sleeper hit. Even though critics and audiences seem to love it, it was released with little fanfare in a slow season for movies, and didn't do exceptionally well in the box offices. I would say, though, that it rivals any film like it put out in this decade, and deserves to become a classic in the line of Chinatown and A Touch of Evil.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I've seen about 78, 2004 movies. I think the best film of the year is "Kill Bill Vo.2" and this is a close second.The performances are absolutely amazing.Jamie Foxx has been getting the best reviews for this film and I think he will be nominated<br /><br />for Best Supporting Actor for this film. But it doesn't matter,<br /><br />'cause he's probably gonna win Best Actor for "Ray". Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance but I don't think Cruise is gonna score gold this year. I just have one problem with this film. The cinematography. It's filmed a little too much like,<br /><br />I-was-there-and-got-it-all-on-tape kind of stuff. It looks to be filmed with nothing but a handheld. But,the story (by "Pirates of the Caribbean" writer Stuart Beattie) is spectacular and it's masterfully directed by Michael Mann. The film is about Max (Foxx). Max is driving a cab in an attempt to get enough money to<br /><br />open his own limo business (a dream that's going nowhere). He says it's part time, but he's been driving for 12 years. One day his luck changes when he meets a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) and might score a date. But with good luck, comes bad luck and Max meets Vincent (Cruise). Vincent offers Max six hundred dollars to take him to six stops on "real estate business". Problem is at the first stop a body falls on top of Max's cab and Max discovers Vincent is a hit man. The two develop a sort of weird friendship along the way,but the movie is totally suspenceful and just plain terrific. Tom Cruise with his gunmetal gray hair kind of makes the movie what it is. It's his best performance since "Eyes Wide Shut". Jamie Foxx (who started off as a comedian, then came into drama with Oliver Stone's crappy<br /><br />"Any Given Sunday") gives his best performance until a few months later when "Ray" was released. But, yeah see this movie for sure. You won't regret it. A+.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed Collateral. Tom Cruise's character Vincent is a contract killer who uses an innocent Taxi Driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx, to drive him around town as he  kills his victims. Vincent assures Max that these are all "bad people" but as the story goes on you realize Vincent can't be trusted with anything he says.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays this evil character with alot of depth and complexity. You start to see that he is actually very warped and evil.  Jamie Foxx's character starts to wonder just how psycho this person is and you can tell he realizes this situation is getting worse and worse.<br /><br />Jada Pinkett Smith plays the Attorney who rides with max before Vincent. She and Max flirt and it creates a very interesting plot twist. Mark Ruffalo plays a detective trying to hunt down the killers of the murder victims. Ruffalo was so good in his role, that at first I didn't even realize it was him.<br /><br />I could see an Oscar nomination for Tom Cruise with this movie. His character is so complex, and Cruise portrays him with perfection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>Director Michael Mann has authored many interesting, even if not outstanding, films as "The Keep" (1983), "The Last of the Mohicans" (1992) and "Ali" (2001). "Collateral" (2004) stands on par with them.<br /><br />It is an interesting and quite fast paced action movie. It has many common points with other "disparate partners'" stories as "48 Hours" (1982), "Lethal Weapon" (1987) or "Alien Nation" (1988). What's new here, is the fact that even if the couple, after surviving many dangerous issues, come to know each other well, they are barred to empathize too much. The reason is very simple one is a taxi driver and the other is a ruthless hired killer.<br /><br />The story is as follows: a taxi driver is hired by a passenger to conduct him on a five step "business raid". The problem is that the "business" of that man is murder. An accident in the first "step" uncovers the nature of the "business" and the taxi driver is coaxed at gun point to continue the infamous raid.<br /><br />Surprisingly the best actor's performance is given by Jamie Foxx as Max the taxi driver. His face shows all the internal turmoil without overacting. He confirms what he started to show in "Ali", working under the same director.<br /><br />Tom Cruise as Vincent the killer and Jada Pinkett Smith as Anne are correct but not outstanding.<br /><br />The action scenes are very well filmed and adrenalin charged.<br /><br />All in all it is a correct action film that may be enjoyed by different viewers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>Let me start off by saying that Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise are good actors, and they both did a good job in this movie working together. This is probably the best movie I have seen Tom Cruise do in a long time. The movie is interesting enough to draw you in, and it manages to entertain. In the end though, to me it was just "ok" movie. I thought the taxi cab scenes where over done, by that I mean most of the movie is spent in the cab with Cruise talking to Foxx. To me, this got a little old. **Spoilers warning** I also thought some of the writing was poor in this movie. Starting with the beginning of the movie, You already know the girl his going to play a part in the end of the movie, and within the first 20 minutes of the movie, you will know how everything is going to go down in the final scene. To me it was predictable. Some more poor writing can be seen during the bridge sequence. No one grabs a brief case owned by a guy with a gun and throws it into traffic. You would get shot, besides this, what does Jamie Foxx do after throwing the brief case? Stands there! If you just threw a briefcase over a bridge that you stolen from a man with a gun. You would chuck it and run! Not stand their waiting for him while putting up you hands. Instead of running, he stands their and waits for cruise to catch up and draw his gun on him. I thought that was stupid. One other example of poor writing, that you see in a lot of action movies, is the ending. Here we have a whole movie with Tom Cruise shooting people with DEADLY accuracy.  He can take out select targets in a night club, hitting them sqaure on from a distance in a mob of moving people. However, when it comes to the final scene in the movie, he can't take out 2 people? What happened to Mr. dead shot? Anyway, it was a good / ok movie. It is worth a rental, but I wouldn't own it, or probably watch it again, but it wasn't bad either. I did like Cruise as a bad guy though.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Like good jazz Collateral is able to quietly move into your head before washing you away in an ocean of smooth chaos.  A tale of two men from two separate backgrounds meet one night in this dreary character-study in a night that will leave both changed forever.  The movie begins with a shady character exchanging briefcases in an airport.  Afterward we are suddenly thrown into a seemingly separate movie.  We are now transported into the life of taxi driver Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx), a gentle, soft-spoken man with big ambitions.  He meets a U.S. Justice Department prosecutor by the name of Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith) who needs a ride.  Not one to pass a pretty lady by he stops for her and shares a moving exchange of words; not Hollywood flirting, but natural conversation that shows two people connecting in a way few people are capable.<br /><br />After dropping the prosecutor off Max receives another passenger...  Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a grey haired, grey suit wearing man whose natural charm is radiant.  He requests that Max take him on five stops to visit some friends and to get him back to LAX airport by the end.  Max cites regulation, but when Vincent flashes six crisp hundred dollar bills he decides to make an exception.  But after the first drop off Vincent's profession is made clear when a corpse falls atop Max's cab.  Unable to escape Max is taken along for the ride as Vincent continues his job with professional precision.<br /><br />In this journey both men will learn from each other in this trek through the underbelly of Los Angeles.<br /><br />Director Michael Mann has created a tight thriller with equally award-worthy performances from his two leading men.  This isn't a crime movie with good guys and bad guys.  Collateral is a movie about people who do what is natural to them and actually have feelings.  Cruise is not some sort of post-Tarantino hit man who talks casually like the job is no big deal.  He operates with expert precision and knows the requirements of his job, but he doesn't do it out of pleasure, or amusement.  No, Vincent does it because killing is his job...but he never seems to enjoy his line of work.  His charisma and enthusiasm reflects that of the taxi driver played by Jamie Foxx who has been stuck in his boring job for twelve years and as such as a soft, kind speaking tone, but he lets people walk all-over him.  Both characters have something to learn from the other and that only makes their conversations more compelling to an audience.<br /><br />Mann drives a tight movie which explores the bad along with the good of each of its characters.  The violence is swift and sudden and will take an audience's breath away, but most of the film's brilliance is within its dialogue.  The final action scenes are well filmed and suspenseful, but I was left wishing for more conversations between Max and Vincent.  A film like this is a mixed bag in this aspect seeing as it seemed incapable of deciding on action, thriller, or drama.  The action and thriller aspects of it are good, but what makes this film great is entirely rested in the performances of Cruise and Foxx.<br /><br />9/10 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This movie is an expertly-made thriller. Max has lived a mundane life as a cab driver for twelve years. The faces have come and gone from his rear-view mirror: people and places he's long since forgotten--until tonight. Vincent is a contract killer. When an off-shore narco-trafficking cartel learns that they're about to be indicted by a federal grand jury, they mount an operation to identify and kill the key witnesses, and the last stage is tonight. It is on this very night that Vincent has arrived--and five bodies are supposed to fall. Circumstances cause Vincent to hijack Max' taxicab, and Max becomes collateral--an expendable person who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's a perfect hit.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>Jamie Foxx is in a mellow mood when Tom Cruise enters his taxicab at Los Angeles International Airport.  He has just performed a kind deed by providing an attractive young lawyer who has expressed frustration and doubt over the success of the federal case she is in Los Angeles to prosecute a free ride, for which she was grateful and provided him with her card.<br /><br />It turns out that this federal prosecutor, played by Jada Pinkett Smith, will be linked to Cruise, but this is something Foxx finds out later.  Initially Cruise behaves in the manner of the successful executive type he appears to be, articulate, well dressed and bemoaning the fact that Los Angeles is so spread out with people failing to connect.  He makes a comment that one can die in a Metropolitan Transit Authority vehicle without the death being discovered for hours.<br /><br />The death comment contains a connection to what Cruise's profession turns out to be, to the shock of easy going Foxx.  Cruise takes him on an all-night mission as he seeks to eliminate witnesses in a federal drug case in which a leading syndicate being operated by a Los Angeles racketeer stands to be shut down and its principals sent to prison.<br /><br />Foxx attempts to shake loose of Cruise, but to no avail.  Cruise is so cold-blooded that he politely engages in a conversation about jazz and an appearance by the great Miles Davis with the operator of a club in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles, who also plays the trumpet in the band.  After Cruise, Fox and the proprietor finish a relaxing drink the sociopathic hit man kills his cringing victim.<br /><br />At one point, so suspicion will not be drawn toward Cruise, the hit man buys flowers for Foxx's sick mother and visits the hospital with him, where he is expected that evening.  Cruise makes a positive impression on Fox's mother through his engaging conversational manner.<br /><br />It is Foxx who undergoes the character change during the nerve-wracking evening.  The formerly easygoing taxi driver toughens up significantly under the strain of the moment.  He has a strong hunch that he is intended to be Cruise's last victim.  This is borne out by police records, which reveal a recent incident in which an Oakland cab driver committed alleged "suicide" under strange circumstances while some unsolved killings were being committed in the same areas he had traversed before his demise.<br /><br />Foxx ultimately concludes that Jada Pinkett Smith is prosecuting the case in which Cruise is seeking to eliminate all federal witnesses, and that the prosecutor is the final target on the narcotics syndicate's hit list.  The story spins into high gear, along with Foxx's strategy mode, as he seeks to save her from what will otherwise be a swift and ruthless death performed by a killing automaton with no apparent conscience.<br /><br />Michael Mann directed the film from a screenplay written by Stuart Beattie.  The crafty cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron accent the rapidly paced action with bull's-eye close-ups of people battling for survival in Los Angeles as a vicious drug mob does battle with federal and local authorities.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>"Collateral" is, in it's own twisted way, a throwback to the crime/noir films of the 40's and 50's, even if modernized quite<br /><br />a bit.  The feel Mann gives the viewer of LA is chaotic, slimy<br /><br />and cheaply attractive all at once.  From the moment Vincent (hitman/sociopath) played by Tom Cruise jumps in for the ride,<br /><br />we feel the city somehow come alive.<br /><br />Never having been even a distant fan of Cruise, I can say he definitely comes into his own here.  Every second he's on screen you can feel the cold, animalistic cunning of a man who has<br /><br />completely sacrificed his conscience (if he ever had one) to<br /><br />the most evil kind of thrills imaginable--murder, aggression, death by numbers.  And, unfortunately for Maxx (Foxx's character), he is very good at the things he indulges in.<br /><br />Contrary to what a lot of other reviewers have said, I really think Jamie Foxx was the weak link here.  He just can't act too well, and in some scenes he seems so ridiculously out of place that the film threatens to turn unintentionally comical.  The one unbelievable aspect is that Vincent could keep this goofball alive.  He's a walking target.<br /><br />That notwithstanding, there are some unforgettable scenes, the foremost being "The Jazzman": Vincent decides that hey, since he's already offed a bunch of people earlier that day, he's "ahead of schedule" and Maxx should accompany him to hear some jazz.  We see the a somewhat human side of Vincent for a little while, enjoying the jazz, even buying the musician on stage a drink.  Together (along with Foxx sitting there, looking like a sore thumb) Vincent and the owner talk about Miles Davis, and how he played with him once.  At no point do we sense any real tension, just two men musing over a jazz musician they idolize.  Vincent than asks him if he ever "looked him up", or played with Davis as he was invited to. The owner replies no, and we see the existential logic flashing in Vincent's eyes, and it is developed later in the movie through Vincent's discussions with Maxx: if you don't go right after your dreams, you're a waste of flesh.  This is Vincent's poor rationale for killing; since people never really live anyway, they might as well die.<br /><br />In a chilling moment, he mentions in a sideways way to the owner precisely why he is there and who sent him.  He toys with him, and then shoots him to death.<br /><br />A few times Mann takes a break from the mayhem and goes on strange comcial notes: when Maxx's boss keeps pestering him<br /><br />on his intercom about going to see his mother, Vincent reasons<br /><br />that since anything unusual might blow his cover, they should go.<br /><br />When Maxx refuses to buy her flowers at the hospital, Vincent turns and says: "She carried you in her womb for nine months."<br /><br />The ending is an improbable turn of nail biting events which<br /><br />end in Vincent's death.  It fits with his vicious cynicism and<br /><br />general disregard for human life; he dies from a potshot taken by Maxx and lays dead on the LA subway.  This movie approaches greatness, but I think a Morgan Freeman or a more classical type actor would have been better than Jamie Foxx.  Worth owning, definitely.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>One of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year, Collateral is a thrilling movie that doesn't exhibit any thriller cliches. This is a movie that prefers building an atmosphere of dread over using shock tactics, dialogue over violence, and atmosphere over frantic chases, and it still manages to be an incredibly engaging film. Of all the movies I saw this year, I will admit this to be among my favorites, and I am a bit of a film snob.<br /><br />The thrust of the story concerns Tom Cruise's salt-and-pepper-haired hitman Vincent and Jamie Foxx's uber-professional cabbie Max. Credit where credit is due, Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett-Smith both make very strong impressions in minor roles. This movie, however, is all about Vince and Max. Mann's use of striking imagery and perpetual darkness turn Los Angeles into a dark, almost mystical locale, and the mood is perfectly set for what follows. Max, of course, picks up Vincent at the airport and ferries him around the city of angels at gunpoint in order to off witnesses in a drug case. Max, you see, is intent on moving on to better things, but although he is a staunch professional, you get the sense that he's never going to get enough traction to move out of where he is. Ironically, Vincent provides the impetus he needs to move out of his corner, if he survives the night. Both the leads turn in what could be called the best performances of their careers: the suave, frigid Vincent is the role Cruise was born to play. He really gets into it here, and like his best performances, he gets to be cruel and edgy. Foxx is very moving in the film, endowing Max with great humanity. Overall, this is a hardly conventional and very enjoyable movie that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for an intriguing character study and an invigorating film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>I hope all those who make films choose to see this movie at some time in the near future.  If they do, they will see the essence of great filmmaking.  Is this the best film ever made?  No, not by a longshot.  But it does display the things that great movies have- things that are mostly lacking from the lackluster efforts most producers subject us to these days.  Instead of giving us a bunch of special effects for no reason, this film chooses to give us characters we can sink our teeth into with an intense setting and premise we have not seen often.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver whose "part time" job behind the wheel has lasted 12 years.  After giving a ride to a beautiful lady, he gets a new fare, a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who basically hires him for the night to drive him around town for 600 dollars.  As you probably know by now, the stops are for kills, as Vincent is a contract killer.  The internal struggle for Foxx is how to deal with this situation as well as the other problems that arise.  Director Michael Mann once again chooses a great cast to carry his film.  Both Cruise and Foxx are splendid.  They are complex characters, as we learn much about each of them during the course of the film.  The storyline is really nothing special.<br /><br />But it doesn't have to be.  The mistake directors and producers make these days is to focus on the plot of the movie instead of the characters and their development.  This leads to wooden dialogue and people we can't wait to get away from.  Alfred Hitchcock always said that too many filmmakers focused on the "MacGuffin" instead of the characters (Hitchcock defined this as that part of the plot that all the characters are trying to solve, but the audience doesn't care in the least) and that is usually the case.  Great films are always great because of the characters and their development.  This is a film which understands that and is not only very intense, but truly enjoyable.  I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"Collateral" is a beautiful film: vibrating with gorgeous digital-clear shots of Los Angeles from Pico-Union and Downtown to Hollywood and Koreatown. And like director Michael Mann's previous "Heat," "Collateral" is a visual tribute to Los Angeles. But "Collateral" is also a tribute to the acting talent of Tom Cruise who doesn't seem to get all the credit he is due: for example his excellent work in "Samurai" went virtually un-noticed last year.<br /><br />As Vincent, a cold blooded hit man, Cruise shows us once again that he can not only look good on screen, he can play a role completely against type and succeed admirably: his Vincent is cold, calculating, resolutely committed and totally focused on completing his task. Cruise's Vincent is a professional assassin: he kills for money because it is his job and is probably unsuited to much else; yet at the same time he revels in the hunt and the catch: enjoying it, feeling no remorse at all.<br /><br />Along the way he enlists/coerces/forces the help of a cab driver Max (Jamie Fox) who resists but ultimately adopts some of Vincent's amoral characteristics. Max becomes Vincent's unwitting disciple and his avenging angel.<br /><br />Michael Mann has directed with a keen eye and a jaundiced view of what makes Los Angeles, Los Angeles:  the City of the Angels, the final frontier of last chances, every inch the Wild Wild West where everything is cool as long as you wear the right clothes, have the right haircut and drive the hottest car.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are outstanding! Without a doubt Tom Cruise will be nominated and most likely win the best actor Oscar (Denzel got one for a much more basic bad-guy role) for his role as the cool and dangerous hitman named Vincent. Foxx should at least get nominated for a supporting role, because he proves to everyone that he can hold his own with Cruise. Without these two casting choices the movie wouldn't be half as good. The plot is a little thin and predictable at times, but the dialogue is written very well and the direction is tight. The action scenes (mainly Tom kicking butt) aren't gory, but they are brutal and fast much as they would be in a real fight with a trained killer delivering the blows. The realism of the film adds much more depth and some of the time I completely forgot I was watching a hollywood made movie. Kudos to all involved and thanks Micheal Mann for reviving the thriller/suspense genre in such a stylish way.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>You're having a quiet, pleasant night, driving your taxi in Los Angeles.

He often focuses on minute but important aspects of both the story and the characters therein, which has earned him the reputation of being an "actor's director". This unique interaction between Mann and his cast is exemplified in the suspense film, Collateral, which features an impressive cast of actors, all of whom give naturalistic and psychologically complex performances. The story, about a cab driver who is forced to drive a hitman around the city of Los Angeles while he assassinates his targets, is quite literally driven by its vividly realized characters. These characters, who are three-dimensional and feel almost familiar, are brought to life by an all-star cast. The cast includes Tom Cruise as Vincent, Jamie Foxx as Max, Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, and Mark Ruffalo as Detective Fanning. Each member of the cast gives a great performance, especially Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo, who aren't what would be considered the main characters and yet they create memorable personas. But the real scene-stealers are the performances of Foxx and Cruise, whose characters are dynamic despite being polar opposites.<br /><br />Vincent is a slickly dressed, cold and calculating hitman, who has buried his emotions for years in order to make himself a more efficient killer. Max is an obsessive-compulsive, perfectionist of a cabdriver, who has allowed his lifelong dreams to slip by because he lacks the confidence and the initiative to make them a reality. But on one fateful night, these two strangers' lives will collide and neither will be the same.<br />When Vincent asks Max if he will drive him around the city while he makes five stops, Max is at first hesitant and unsure... until Vincent offers him $700. But during their first stop, while Vincent is inside of an apartment complex, a body falls from the balcony and comes crashing down onto the roof of Max's cab. It immediately becomes clear that Vincent has killed the man and Max knows that he has now essentially become a hostage. As Max is forced to drive Vincent to his remaining stops while Vincent assassinates his targets, the two share conversations and begin to see each other for who and what they truly are. This has an effect on the both of them, though a different effect. As Max becomes more assertive and confident, Vincent is reintroduced to his more human side. Meanwhile a narcotics detective named Fanning is tracking down Vincent because he knows that someone's responsible for the deaths of certain witnesses for the prosecution of a major drug trafficker named Felix. And it is Felix that has hired Vincent to eliminate these witnesses. It's not long before the FBI becomes involved and they believe that Max is the killer, not Vincent who they don't even know exists.<br />Soon Max is angered by Vincent's general disregard for life and he is empowered by the realization that he does have some control over what happens to him. When Max discovers that Vincent's final target is a beautiful criminal prosecutor named Annie, who Max had befriended earlier in the evening, Max is forced to race Vincent to save her. Max, the passive cabbie is pitted against Vincent, the sociopathic contract killer. Yet on this night anything can happen.<br /><br />Collateral gave Michael Mann the unique opportunity of shooting a film in Los Angeles after dark and he delighted in showing audiences a side to the city that they may not have known existed before. Using, predominantly, a Hi Def digital camera, he creates a vision of Los Angeles that is simultaneously stark, oppressive, beautiful, and colorful. Mann also exposes the economic differences and the cultural diversity of L.A., which gives the film a different flavor from other films that have shot there.<br />Though highly stylized and at times a little predictable, Collateral is one of the best suspense films of the past decade. The reason being that it's rare to have such naturalistic actors playing such believable characters while they are trapped in the most extraordinary of circumstances. This is where Mann excels as a filmmaker, telling stories that are somewhat far-fetched and yet it doesn't matter because as an audience we have a sincere emotional investment in the characters. As we watch Max and Vincent confide in each other, and as we see them both become torn by internal conflict, we can't help but empathize with their plights and wonder, "What would I do in that situation?"<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GVJEE">L&eacute;on: The Professional</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IRE6">Nick of Time</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDWKWY">Enemy of the State</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AVZCQ">Panic Room</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL5F">Changing Lanes</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLQN">Phone Booth</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALT8">Man on Fire</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHQUOE">Crash</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film is not particularly rich as for the content. A professional killer has been hired to eliminate all the witnesses and even the cops and other prosecution personnel in some criminal case. Banal. He does not want to drive his own car and he does not want to hire a car and an accomplice to drive him around. So he comes at night and just hires a taxi and its driver. That makes him difficult to trace. But that creates some problems because the taxi-driver is not really willing to do the job. And then the two are like mutual prisoners or custodians. One cannot work without the other and one cannot escape from the other. Yet the taxi-driver, after a long series of killings, finds the courage to cause an accident which means the arrival of the cops, but that also means the discovery of the first body that had been put in the trunk and the taxi driver's discovery that the next and last target is the woman he had transported just before this embarrassing and invading client. He decides to escape from the cop who is trying to arrest him, and who was alone on his car patrol, and to prevent the killing of the girl. He will even go slightly further. But that's not the main interest of the film. We could have predicted all that from the very start. Then it's only details. The interest is the rhythm and the twists in the fabric of the tale. In fact it is economical in blood and even bullets because it centers on the psychological profile of the taxi-driver and the relation he establishes with his customer. Strangely enough it is more psychological than we could have expected and that saves the film from banality.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise got a lot of favorable press at the time of this film's release for playing an unredeemed and unredeemable killer.  He is good, to be sure.  You won't quickly forget his steely, relentless hitman.  He's like demon from an icy hell.  Still, while not exactly a one-note performance, he takes a back seat to Jamie Foxx (literally AND figuratively) in this taut thriller.  Foxx, of course, has the advantage of portraying a Mensch, not a psychopath.  You feel for him every moment he is in the clutches of Cruise's madman.  And just when you think he might get out, he always gets sucked back in.  It is as nightmarish a scenario as any horror film.<br /><br />Even the predictable elements (like the fact that Jada Pinckett Smith's character will somehow wind up getting embroiled in the mayhem) are fraught with twists and turns.  Her involvement ups the ante for Foxx's taxi driver hero Max.  He has already proven himself more resourceful and resilient than viewers might have guessed at first.  By the end of the film, Max proves himself more than the killer's equal, matching him manoeuvre for manoeuvre.<br /><br />At the film's beginning, Max is revealed as a cab driver who knows Los Angeles like the proverbial back of his hand.  He can tell you exactly how long it will take to get from one point to another in that sprawling city.  Affable and modest about his talents, he nonetheless conveys quite early on that, in the contest of wills with this murderous outsider, he will prove to have home turf advantage.<br /><br />And what a home turf it is.  As many have stated, LA by night is as much a character in the film as the two principles.  It's seamy glamour has seldom been better portrayed.  Contemporary Los Angeles takes on an almost surreal, foreboding aura.  It's like BLADE RUNNER, without the sci-fi elements.  That creepy.  And that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise as the bad guy! I liked it. He did a great job and that was scary.

I still should have known better than to wait three years to check out Collateral after the glowing reviews and Jamie Foxx's Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Tom Cruise shows that he really does have the acting chops to pull off a variety of roles as his portrayal of Vincent is quite a departure from the typical Cruise hero. He's got a different voice, walk, and attitude. And with the white hair and beard he's captivating to watch as he unstoppably takes on the sociopathic hired [...] role.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is equally engaging as Max, a big-dreaming cab driver that has never has the follow through to make any of his dreams happen. Collateral follows a night in Max's cab and the character arc that Max follows because of the events that transpire.<br /><br />Jada Pinkett Smith has a smaller role, but still puts in some solid acting as a prosecuting attorney who rides in Max's cab.<br /><br />The action and dialogue throughout Collateral are brilliantly played out and hard to turn away from. You won't want to miss a minute of the movie for fear of missing a cool special effect, a great acing moment, or just a quick plot point. The helicopter panning shots over the city of LA are pretty awesome too.<br /><br />The second disc is full of special features, including a short about Tom Cruise dressing up as a FedEx worker in order to work on not being recognizable for the role of Vincent. There's also a making of featurette and a clip of rehearsals between Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx with director Michael Mann.

But if you can roll with that, you are in for an extremely entertaining ride.

Jamie Foxx gives another outstanding preformance as Max, the taxi driver along for the ride.  His character is complex but develops into a bold and straightforward individual.  I found it interesting that the Academy put Foxx performance in the supporting role rather than lead acting.  It would not have surprised me if he would have been considered for Best Actor with this performance.  I felt it was just a good as his groundbreaking performance in "Ray".

Using high definition video, he creates the most realistic vision of L. A. that I have ever seen on screen. Stylistically, everything in the film is toned down to keep it as closely grounded in reality as possible. There is no slow motion, self conscious cinematography or indulgent set pieces. Mann reigns in all of these tricks to keep the audience wrapped in the story. He continues with his recurrent themes of masculinity, professionalism and skill. Cruise and Foxx are exceptional here. Both deliver stand-out performances that are unique in their restraint. While both have ample opportunity to take their characters over the top, they don't. Instead they keep with the whole tone of the film and what you do get is much more rewarding and compelling. Like Mann's other films, he relies on the complexity of the characters to tell the story and not mindless action to fill in where the writing lacks. Mann is not afraid to show you the quiet contemplative moments because he knows they will sharply contrast with the action when it comes. There is nothing overtly exceptional about the story or even the writing, although both are good. The real reward here is in the performances and the brilliant direction of Mann, who achieves even greater success with a more minimal approach.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>This film is a classic Michael Mann signature genre hit.  You know when a serial killer always has a signature. That signature will always be there. Can you see it? Can you feel it? "Collateral" is a signature Michael Mann crime thriller film all the way.<br /><br />  "Collateral" is about a contract killer (Tom Cruise) who has ten hours to kill five people in Los Angeles. The unfortunate cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) is in the wrong place wrong time when his next fair is Vincent (Mr. Cruise) For a mere $600.00, Max is thrust into driving this hired killer around to each contract or be killed himself. Vincent must be a killing machine to take five people in ten-hour scenario. And he IS.<br /><br />  Tom Cruise absorbs Vincent's character and brings him to life. Vincent is well schooled and rehearsed in combat, tactical recovery and covert opperations. (And he utilizes them all!) The interaction between Max and Vincent is like a clash of opposite polar forces. Different views, personalities and upbringing are topics of discussion. Jamie Foxx plays Max's character superbly. Max's growth in the film is only supported by Jamie's vastly improved acting skills. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx work well together in this film.<br /><br />  The film takes on a "24" feel for time. But the length of the film is actually two hours. Jada Pinkett Smith takes on a supporting role as a prosecuting attorney. She compliments Foxx's on screen personality.<br /><br />  If you are a Michael Mann fan, you will not be disappointed with this film. Who doesn't like Tom Cruise? Jamie Foxx?

Even when Ridley faces The Alien, if we've been brought along carefully, we say 'this could happen.'<br /><br />Of course nothing we see in Hollywood really could happen, Aliens and hitmen notwithstanding, so when the well coiffed, highly intelligent, money to burn assassin Vincent has been assigned to murder 5 key witnesses to the Federal trial of a billionaire drug lord, that "this COULDN'T happen" feeling starts to rise for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />You probably think with money to burn, a Joseph Aboud suit, and a $10,000 laptop in hand, why would the intelligent hitman get into a Los Angeles cab? Well, yeah, that's a problem for me. But the real problem is  . . . .the trial is TOMORROW. Vincent is going to wait 12 hours before opening statement to kill off the evidence? Why are the witnesses not in protective custody instead of making a pizza in a two bedroom flat in Venice, making out with two hot women in a West LA penthouses, and rocking 'n rolling in a club Beverly Hills THE NIGHT BEFORE A FEDERAL TRIAL? What if Jaime Foxx didn't speak English? What if they got a flat tire, a back-up on the 405 or LA smog?<br /><br />Having said that, Cruise is brilliant as the intelligent hitman, and Foxx as the bright but procrastinating cabbie. Jada Pinkett-Smith is absolutely gorgeous and plays a nice supporting role. The photography nearly steals the show, very slick like the Miami Vice days and always present as both a scene setter and conversationalist. But the movie lacks that sinister evil of To Live and Die, Body Heat and the much earlier Bullit, and seems confused as to whether it wants to be a slick shoot 'em up mystery or a series of "My Dinner with Andre" conversations between Vincent and Max.<br /><br />Kudos to Cruise and Foxx who do a nice morphing of the other's best characteristics, Vincent showing a hint of introspection and compassion at the end and Max more decisiveness. 4 stars.

Do you know where you're gonna be in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years? Do you live in the past, present, or future? This is the focus of Michael Mann's new suspense drama. A taxi cab driver named Max tries to focus on where he's headed rather than where he is right now, which is a dead end job driving a taxi. In the blink of an eye his life becomes a toy. A contract killer chooses his cab out of the 4,000 cabs in L.A County. Now Max is involved in something he doesn't want. He immediately has gone from living in the future (thinking of how one day he's going to make it big) to living in the present (thinking of how he will survive till daylight). The film is filled with a lot of meaningful dialogue and it's meaningful because its true. Vincent (Cruise) brings up the topic of a man who died on the subway and his body was on the train all day before anybody even noticed he was dead. This brings up the point of "what can you do to make a difference". There are 6 billion people in the world, what makes you different? How can you stand out of society and not just be another cab driver, another fast food employee. Now that's that part of the movie. The other part is a well-paced intense film that will grip you and won't let go. Michael Mann knows how to make a movie but in the past his films have been rather slow-paced and even boring at times even though they have a lot of depth and meaning. Collateral is neither slow-paced nor fast-paced, it's well-paced. The last half hour will have you're heart pounding and your body snug in your seat just trying to anticipate what might happen in the next 2, 4, 6 minutes. This movie was really intense and very well made. You know that this could have been a disaster of a movie, but with so many veterans on board they turned it into something very good, very good indeed.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting here was top notch, very good. But it's really the writer you have to credit here. The dialogue is where the emotion is evoked from the audience. Every word that the characters say has meaning but the actors deliver it the way it's supposed to be. Tom Cruise was excellent, a very haunting role for the audience to watch. He's not just a killer, he's a thinker. He knows what he's doing and even though he's the bad guy, he is a smart one. I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx's work but if he does more films like this then my opinion on him will surely change. A great cast that delivered a superbly written movie.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: There are times in the movie where Jamie Foxx could have escaped and ended it all, but you can counter that by saying he became emotionally involved. The movie is a near perfect suspense drama. This is not some stupid hijacking movie with stupid dialogue and fast car chases. If you know Michael Mann's work then you know you can expect something good, and even if this is your first Michael Mann movie you will enjoy this dark themed drama. When you live in the present you gotta "roll with it".</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>It is refreshing to see Mann back in action with a refined thriller amidst this summer's goofy spectacles.<br /><br />Only a master like him could capture urban landscapes in all their naked glory (a nocturnal LA so rich in character you can see the city throb), furnish them with a stunning soundtrack that employs bits of silence just as deftly as thumping percussions, and then wrap it all up into a compelling narrative whole.<br /><br />If there's any justice in the world Foxx should have a glorious future. The guy has incredible screen presence, it shows in the many scenes where he  interacts with Cruise. Pinkett's character was developed decently for the short time in the beginning we had to see her, I see a decent competition for Beyonce and Halle Barry.<br /><br />Never mind the odd moment when the plot doesn&#8217;t compute (for instance, how does one detective suddenly come upon so much information toward the end of the film?). The pacing is so relentlessly intriguing and the visuals so inventively stylish that you'll forget your gripes with the story.<br /><br />There's even a touch of subtle humor, which rounds off this very tense yet wholesome entertainer. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Director Michael Mann does what he does best with "Collateral", a well-written (by Stuart Beattie), entertaining thriller that knows just when to be intense and when to be mellow. "Collateral" takes place overnight in Los Angeles. Max (Jamie Foxx), a veteran cab driver who dreams of owning a limousine service, picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise), a slick, talkative fare who offers him $600 for a night's work: 5 stops and get him to the airport by 6 a.m. Sounds good, but when a bloody corpse lands on his windshield, Max comes to the abrupt realization that Vincent is an assassin. He becomes an unwilling accomplice in a murder spree, as Vincent attempts to fulfill his professional obligations and Max tries to walk the line between thwarting a killer and saving himself.<br /><br />Much of "Collateral" is distinctly mellow in tone. Low-key conversations play out over the classical music in Max's cab. This makes the bursts of action more intense and surprising. No one could call "Collateral" realistic, but the attention to detail in the characters' speech makes it seem so. I have to admire Tom Cruise for embracing villain roles at this point in his career, where other stars have shunned them or insisted on watered-down scripts. Cruise has nothing to lose by playing unlikable characters, and they will among his most memorable work. Vincent's self-possession lends him great presence and charm, while his moral bankruptcy makes him revolting. Cruise is perfect for the role. Jamie Foxx plays the film's "everyman" who rises to the occasion when circumstances demand it. He's stressed, put-upon, and trapped, and he acts it. Jada Pinkett Smith does a nice job in a supporting role as a prosecutor, Annie, who takes a ride in Max's cab, as does Mark Ruffalo as Police Detective Fanning, who suspects trouble in Max's cab after one of his informants is murdered. Great cast, great dialogue, and perfect pacing make "Collateral" an engaging, character-driven thriller that almost everyone will enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.5<br /><br />I'd only seen this movie once some odd years ago when it first came out on DVD. My mother had rented it, but my attention span and train of thought were so much different than it is now and I never really got into it. Since then, I've developed a greater appreciation for film-making in the way a movie is produced, who's cast in the roles, and especially the way it's written. After sitting down a few months ago to finally watch the entirety of Heat, I discovered the gritty magic of one Michael Mann for the first time. Needless to say, he strikes another excellent effort in Collateral. Unlike Heat with its extensive run time and extremely fleshed-out characters, Collateral is surprisingly spectacular in that it manages to achieve almost the same effect, but with a shorter, more truncated time frame. From the get-go we're thrown into the "world" known as Los Angeles where disconnect and sprawl are the very fabric of this bustling, yet sad city, in which we meet Max (Jamie Foxx), who unknowingly will have his life changed forever within the next few hours. Enter Vincent (Tom Cruise), who does the changing in cold, calculated, and stylized fashion. Spoilers aside, this is a movie that illustrates many a good point about life in general. L.A. represents the void that is our lives, Max is the everyman who just can't over the hump in that void, and Vincent symbolizes aspiration, change, and adaptation to counteract it all. The script, acting, and screenplay are amazing, thanks in huge part to the chemistry and acting abilities of Cruise, Foxx, Pinkett Smith, and even Ruffalo. It's a film that shows how even the most polar opposite of personalities can somehow come together through all the crap in the world, if not for one night, and create something that will stay with them for the rest of their lives and break them out of a rut.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />With a good 85% of the film being shot in HD, Collateral looks excellent all things considered. Colors aren't too vibrant, and there's a fair amount of noise throughout. But if you take into account that pretty much the whole movie takes place either in the dark or in dimly-lit locales, it's understandable.  Black levels are still rich, detail is fine, and the contrast never wavers, even in the darkest of scenes. I was especially impressed with the techniques they used in filming the cab scenes to get all the camera angles.  As dark and dim as it really is inside a cab, the clarity is actually quite striking.  What few scenes there are with lighting have a gritty sheen to them as well.  When you actually put some light on Foxx and Cruise, colors look much better, flesh tones more natural, and details a great deal sharper, particularly in Cruise's stubble and hair texture.  Overall, the look of the film itself makes for a very nice transfer.  Aesthetically it's not something you could showcase as being reference, but it's a commendable job by Paramount, nonetheless.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 track doesn't amount to much in the beginning, as a lot of the movie is dialogue-heavy, at least until Vincent is introduced. Dialogue, by the way, is crisp and clear emanating through the center channel with no traces of dropout or distortion. However when Vincent starts doing his work, the sound field becomes much more thoroughly engaged. General sound effects like walking on the pavement, the taxi doors, radio calls, and background noise are all very buoyant. Music does an adequate job coming from the front sides as well and adds a good deal of sporadic immersion to keep you engrossed. All of these elements are fine and dandy, but it's the wallop of gunshots amongst the chaos that really give the system a workout later on. As far as I'm concerned, the audio for how it's used in the movie is a perfect transfer.  As a BD, though, I just wish the side speakers got a little more usage and that LFEs were more frequent.<br /><br />Extras - 4.0<br /><br />While the making-of featurette is interesting, the real star of the extras is the exceedingly informative commentary by director Michael Mann. Mann does a stellar job explaining technical terms of how he filmed the movie, fills in some of the information gaps of the characters and their backgrounds, and then delves into the symbolism of their actions and presence. It serves as a great compliment to the narrative of the film itself and really has the ability to raise one's appreciation for the overall work. The making-of featurette elaborates a little on what Mann mentions in the commentary, only with pictures and video. I actually liked the bit with Cruise's training sessions a lot and found it to be a testament to how good of an actor he is (personal issues aside). However, I did find some of the making-of stuff to be a little repetitious of what Mann said already, leaving a little more to be desired. The commentary, though, is a must-listen for fans of the movie.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />Collateral is an extremely well-constructed action/drama/thriller.  It's a film that offers a good dose of grit and realism through a very charismatic Tom Cruise and equally subtle Jamie Foxx. It's a story that sort of goes against modern conventions with its truncated time frame of a narrative, but regardless, manages to tell a very entertaining story about two seemingly opposite strangers in a "world" where feeling unfulfilled is the norm, and then clashing their ideals into something more worthwhile. Presented by Paramount with near-reference A/V quality and an informative set of extras, Collateral comes highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>Collateral stars Jamie Foxx as the meek dreamer cabby Max. Tom Cruise stars as a hitman named Victor. When Max gives a free cab ride to a beautiful woman, his next rider turns out to be Victor, the lovable but-oh-so-evil killer for hire. Can Max grow a spine and escape Victor or will he become just another of Victor's victims? I really enjoyed Collateral, despite some initial misgivings after seeing the trailer. Max was an endearing character and a loveable loser. Victor was funny, and despite being a killer had some spot-on advice for Victor. I particularly liked the scene where Max was forced to impersonate Victor at the club.<br /><br />There were a few minor peeves (such as the rather stupid chase scene at the end), in which the two lead characters failed to elude Victor (Yeah right), and a few scenes just showing them in the cab driving around town doing nothing which could've been edited out.<br /><br />Overall, a fast fun film sure to please action fans!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Cab driver Max (expertly played by Jamie Foxx) has been driving a cab for twelve years in Los Angeles, saving up for his dream of creating Island Limousine service.  He picks up a fare, Annie (Jada Pinkett-Smith) who is working late for the Prosecuting Attorney's office, preparing for a big trial the next day.  When Max gives Annie a speedy ride and pleasant conversation, Annie impulsively hands him her business card.<br /><br />Max then picks up his next fare, a man named Vincent, who says he is only in town for the night on real estate business.  Vincent tells Max he needs to stop at five separate addresses for paper-signings, and winds out hiring Max's cab for the entire evening.  But Vincent is not into real estate, he is an assassin.  When his first hit of the evening inadvertently falls out of a fourth story window and onto Max's waiting cab, Vincent confesses to Max his real profession and orders him to drive him to the remaining four hits.<br /><br />When Max asks Vincent what he is, Vincent replies, "I'm Indifferent."  Indifferent is a kind word for Vincent, he is a cold and ruthless sociopath, and expert in his field with a reputation for getting the job done.  Max is in over his head, stunned and shaken by the brutality that has entered his world, and desperate to find a way out of his situation without really knowing how to achieve such a feat against such a monster.<br /><br />Get ready for some truly spectacular performances in this tension filled film.  Vincent is a new type of role for Cruise, that he carries out with amazing believability and casual elegance.  Jamie Foxx outperforms himself as Max, highlighting the superior actor under the hilarious comedian.  Jada Pinkett-Smith's role as Annie was fairly small, but stands out because of her excellent performance.<br /><br />Can Max survive this hellish night?  Will Vincent achieve his merciless mission?  Is there any rhyme or reason to the selection of his victims?  How does Annie tie into Vincent's plans?  Just because the plot to this movie can be summed up in a couple of paragraphs does not mean that it is in any way boring or predictable.  `Collateral' is a tense thriller, with a tight script, great performances, rapid action bursts, and enough mental friction to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />My hat is also off to Michael Mann for his superb directing skills, bringing back memories of Manhunter and Miami Vice as he expertly melds audio to visual, creating that sensory indulgence so unique to Mann's work.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie whether you are in the mood for action, thrills, or tension.  Pick yourself up a copy, it's a buyer.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>Collateral is the kind of movie for which the term "mixed bag" was invented.  On the one hand it's an immensely entertaining watch, full of high style, expansive cinematography, and explosive action.  On the other it's at times almost insultingly unrealistic, marred by contrivances, gaps in logic and one of the more implausible endings in cinematic history.  In spite of its flaws it's still more than serviceable entertainment if you don't think about it too hard, and it's certainly about as good a crime thriller as you're going to get from Hollywood these days.  In other words, it's worth watching, but it's certainly not anywhere near the level of Reservoir Dogs, Heat, or other recent masterpieces of its genre.<br /><br />The premise is a perfect example of what's both good and bad about the movie.  The idea of a top hitman getting a cab driver to chaffeur him around on his hits is an intriguing one, even if it's not all that hard to poke holes in.  That any of this works at all is due largely to the efforts of directors Michael Mann and the movie's two leads, namely Tom Cruise as Vincent (the killer) and Jamie Foxx as Max (the cabbie).  This movie relies far more heavily on character than most of its ilk, and the success of Foxx and Cruise in their respective roles is largely responsible for pulling it through its less-than-steller parts.<br /><br />Of all the reasons to watch this movie, I can think of none more compelling than Cruise's brilliant scenery chewing in his change-of-pace bad guy role as a contract killer with a busy night ahead of him. In The Last Samurai, Cruise played a character who started in the gutter and climbed out; in Collateral, he appears to be having a great time reveling in the gutter. Cruise's Vincent is a model of amorality, the kind of character who's so delightfully malevolent that you just can't stop watching. This guy's like a more charming version of the Terminator, cutting a swath of destruction though L.A. when he's not engaging in deep conversation and dispensing nihilistic philosophy with Max. The scene where Vincent shoots, kicks, and punches his way through a crowded club to get to a hapless witness resembles something out of a John Woo movie, only with better production values.<br /><br />Mann's direction is a huge plus as well.  He's always shown a willingess to deviate from the standard and challenge his audience a bit (the recent Ali being a prime example), and Collateral is no exception.  The tense, manic plotting is accompanied by an equal number of corresponding shifts in tone, as Mann mixes unflinching violence with striking characterization. Really, it's this emphasis on letting us get to know its two central figures that makes the movie.  It's easy to miss at first, but the interactions between Max and Vincent go a lot deeper than initial appearances suggest as Vincent's personality begins to increasingly rub off on Max.  It's easy to see why: Max is a nice guy but basically a doormat, stuck in a "temporary" job driving a cab for 12 years, reduced to lying to his hospitalized mother about running a limo service.  Vincent may be a calculating, murderous sociopath, but he's also everything Max isn't: assertive, strong-willed, and most of all free from the petty moral and practical concerns that plague most of us on a daily basis.  And in an extreme situation like the one Max is faced with, it's a lot better to be like Vincent than like, well, himself.<br /><br />The first three quarters of Collateral are especially compelling, as Mann puts his two lead actors through a series of superbly executed set pieces interrupted only by the aforementioned cab scenes and a relatively gratuitous subplot that strands Mark Ruffalo (a good actor) in a rather thankless role as a cop investigating the case.  Unfortunately, after building up an hour and a half worth of goodwill, Collateral suddenly turns from an atmospheric thriller with action in it to a formulaic action movie replete with ludicrous ending and accompanying hacky twist.  Much of what happens before the final act is somewhat farfetched, but it's at least within the realm of possibility.  On the other hand, almost nothing that occurs in the last half hour of this movie is even remotely believable.  I don't want to give away too much (although others already have), but those who have seen the movie will know what I mean.  The ending notwithstanding, however, if you're into crime movies Collateral should suffice for at least one viewing.  You could certainly do a lot worse.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>"Collateral" certainly kept me entertained, even though the last 15 minutes was just an onslaught of implausibilities.<br /><br />Like all Michael Mann movies, this is mainly an exercise in style, i.e. snappy, eye-catching camera work and atmospherics.  Tom Cruise actually does some half-decent acting here for a change, and looks far less flaky than usual with a head full of salt-n-pepper (mostly salt) hair.  Of course the real show-stealer is Jamie Foxx, and it was a shame we didn't get to see more of Jada Pinkett Smith, ooh la la what a goddess!<br /><br />"Collateral" tries to dabble in "carpe diem" existentialism here and there, but by the ending Hollywood has kicked in and it degenerates into yet another predictable save-the-world-and-the-babe formula action flick.  The rest of the time it's very competent at what it does.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the hype, and found Cruise and Foxx to be both believable and talented in their  respective roles. A brief synopsis finds hard working and "nice" cab driver Max (Foxx) being unwittingly hired for the evening by ice cold mystery man Vincent (Cruise), and then dropped knee deep into an assassination spree, from which he is inextricably trapped. After a moderately slow start, the story builds nicely, with some intelligent plot work, good action sequences, and promises much in suspense, action, and the ability to hold your attention. Somewhere in the middle of the movie this gets lost, and even the most innatentive of viewers will see what's coming next from a mile away, and that's a real shame. Cruise and Foxx play off each other nicely, and there's a strange attraction to Cruises meticulous character, despite his sociopathic tendencies, and ice cold indifference to his victims. This is not a bad movie, but let's itself down with some avoidable mistakes, the main one being to revert to unlikely and implausible outcomes, just to reach the desired ending it self telegraphed earlier. Questions you may find yourself asking are: (DANGER SPOILER AHEAD)<br /><br />1. The US Attorney general building is guarded by one solitary guard, and otherwise uninhabited?<br />2. Despite numerous security features in the building, Max is able to gain entry by simply walking through a side door?<br />3. Max can run, jump and arrive to save the day from half a mile away on a parking lot roof, before Vincent can go from the 14th to the 16th floor in the same building?<br />4. Three armed FBI units, a night club security team, LAPD, and a South American Druglords hit squad ALL in the same building with weapons drawn, ALL miss the target?<br /><br />These are just a few discrepancies, in an otherwise tight and pacy thriller, but given that a multitude of better directions with the story could have been taken, the one chosen is a disappointment. Good movie, but NOT great. Enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a fast-paced, clever thriller that focuses on two men, a contract killer named Vincent, effectively played by a gray-haired and grizzled Ton Cruise, and an everyman, a cabdriver with a dream named Max,  played with appropriate resignation, intelligence, and angst by Jamie Foxx. When Vincent gets into Max's cab, neither of their lives will ever be the same.<br /><br />Max's night starts off auspiciously enough, when he drives a pretty federal prosecutor named Annie to her office, and, since they hit it off,  she gives Max her card. Unfortunately for Max, Vincent, a former special forces guy turned contract killer, is his next fare.  Vincent, claiming that he is some sort of out-of-town real estate entrepreneur, hires Max to chauffer him around for the night. Vincent explains to Max that he needs to make five quick stops, and for this he will pay Vincent six hundred dollars. Of course, unbeknownst to Max, each of those quick stops is scheduled so that Vincent can dispatch someone to the great beyond.<br /><br />By a twist of fate, the first stop goes wrong, when the contracted kill flies out the window and lands dead as a door nail on top of Max's taxi. The cat is out of the bag, as Max quickly discerns that Vincent is up to no good. Unfortunately, there is little Max can do about it other than to drive on with Vincent. Through their driving around together and their ensuing conversation, a moody character study of these two men develops. Of course, there is also a great deal of action whenever they are out of the cab.<br /><br />While some of the moments in the film are seemingly incredible, if the viewer suspends disbelief and goes with the flow, all will be well. Under Michael Mann's deft direction, the film stays taut and sharp,  with Cruise and Foxx both turning in excellent performances. Foxx can definitely run with the big boys. The supporting cast, Mark Rufalo as Fanning, a member of LAPD who suspects what is going on, and Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, the federal prosecutor, also do their bit to contribute to the tension and action throughout the film.  Overall, this is an intriguing and compelling action thriller that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>With two of my all-time favorite movies directed by Mann ("Heat" and "The Insider"), and having Cruise as one of my favorite actors, I couldn't resist the temptation to check out "Collateral". And I wasn't dissapointed.<br /><br />As Mann has us used to, he has you on the edge of your seat all through the movie, with some fantastic dialog and some great directing and photography, something that has made him legendary by now, with his unique treatment of light and shadows. Interestingly enough, the script's credit this time falls in the lap of Stuart Beattie, one of the co-writers for "Pirates of the Caribbean", a 'first time' for Mann, who normally writes or adapts the script himself.<br /><br />As for Cruise and his interaction on the screen with Foxx, it's a perfect match. Cruise: what else can you say about him that has not been said? I guess, the fact that he plays a damn good bad guy! Interesting that he'd be a fourth choice for the role after Rusell Crowe was considered for it, and both, Edward Norton and Colin Farrell, were offered the chance to play Vincent. As for Foxx ("Ali", "Any Given Sunday"), he too does a fine job, consolidating him along with Will Smith as the top talent in a solid new generation of african americans following the lead of Denzel Washington.<br /><br />All in all, one solid blend of tasteful directing, great camerawork, engaging dialogs and acting, and tying it all together in the background, an eclectic soundtrack combining the musical talent of James Newton Howard.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>I was wondering if they'd be able to pull off the cab ride of destruction as a credible thriller.

With an eye for intelligent detail, and a feeling for the darker side of life, Mann serves up a terrific and stylish cinematic experience that is, at once, thought provoking, and suspenseful, while also quite disturbing. The film centers on one night where a cabdriver and a hit man meet and end up spreading murder and mayhem throughout the city. From the glass and glitter of the Downtown skyscrapers, to the industrialized warehouses of Pico Union, from the streets of West Hollywood, to the expanse of Los Angeles International Airport, Michael Mann uses all the resources of Los Angeles to show a side of the City that is constantly bathed in dark, somber and forbidding shades. Collateral is pure twenty first century film noir.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a cold, calculating hit man who's really good at killing people and Jamie Foxx plays a cabdriver that long ago put his dreams of owning his own limousine company on the back burner. As the sun sets over the Los Angeles skyline, Foxx indulges in a friendly conversation with a very attractive attorney (Jada Pinkett Smith). After he drops her Downtown, Max's night takes a turn for the worst when he picks up the silver-haired Vincent who immediately takes him hostage. Vincent has five people to kill before the night is over, and Max is going to drive him to each destination whether he likes it or not. While both the FBI and the LAPD (led by a the smart, perceptive Mark Ruffalo) are hot on their tail, Max and Vincent's encounter soon develops into a type of unsettled relationship; a kind of shared camaraderie based on mutual need. With Cruise and Foxx are trapped in the cab together throughout much of the story, the film focuses on their disparate chemistry and the psychological warfare that steadily builds between them.<br /><br />Cruise plays the calculating, cold-blooded killer with a powerful restraint. This is an intense, strong performance that is probably a career best for him. His haggard, tired face, his sweep of silvery hair and his five-day beard growth show a man where the years of indiscriminate killing have gradually taken their toll. But Foxx steals the show - he represents the moral heart of Collateral and his portrait of an affable, sensitive, but ultimately disappointed and embittered cab driver, is almost certainly Oscar worthy. The supporting cast is terrific: Mark Ruffalo, looking almost Latino, gives an impressive, and totally realistic performance as the undercover cop who's called to the scene of Cruise's first hit, Jada Pinkett Smith makes the most of a brief, but crucial role as Foxx's first customer of the night, and Javier Bardem is also effective in a short scene as a seedy, sleazy Latino nightclub owner.<br /><br />Collateral ultimately succeeds as a beautifully shot, well-acted and thoroughly engrossing psychological drama. The mood and suspense are steadily built, the pacing is tight, and there is one mesmerizing and horribly violent scene involving a shootout in a Korean nightclub that will probably leave viewers gasping. This is an expertly crafted, dynamic film that is full of surprising plot twists and turns. Collateral is everything that we have come to expect from such a talented filmmaker as Michael Mann. Mike Leonard August 04.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Michael Mann's "Collateral" is as an intense, edge-of-your-seat action thriller as you'll find this summer, thanks to Mann's breathless yet elegant directorial style and the cat-and-mouse chemistry between stars Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Stuart Beattie's screenplay turns the screws on Max Durocher (Foxx), an amiable L.A. cabbie who suddenly finds his cab commandeered by a sociopathic hit man named Vincent (Cruise). Villainy becomes Cruise: he is gleefully charismatic in a role that is as much as possible devoid of redeeming human qualities. And Foxx really makes you feel for Max, a nice guy coasting through life who now must call on long-unused reserves of resourcefulness and cunning, simply to live through the night. There also are an unflappable L.A. cop on Vincent's trail, played by the usually very flappable Mark Ruffalo; a sexy district attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith; a malevolent drug kingpin played by Javier Bardem; and Max's disapproving mom, played by Irma P. Hall in the movie's sharpest comic relief. The photography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron makes a glittering, sprawling deathtrap of Los Angeles, adding immeasurably to the film's slick malevolence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Los Angeles, California. Present Day.<br /><br />Max (Jamie Foxx) is one of a thousand cab drivers in the city. He keeps his cab squeaky clean during his night shift, he knows his streets and his signals, and he always reaches his passengers' destinations in time. He's been driving a cab for 12 years, but he's got some big dreams. He wants to own a limo company, and is only comfortable talking about it to those who look like they would never laugh their butts off at him. One of these people is a prosecutor named Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith). She gives him her card after a drive to the Justice Department, and Max can't decide at the moment if he wants to call her later or not. What comes next is something that is completely unexpected.<br /><br />The next passenger in Max's cab is a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise). He looks to be a business man, with a clean gray suit and a luxurious-looking briefcase. Vincent makes a deal with Max: make five stops for the night and he'll give the driver 600 dollars total. Max hesitates, and slowly accepts the offer. At the first stop, the cab is parked in the alley of an apartment building where the first stop is located. Vincent enters the building, while Max takes his time eating a deli sandwich and examining photos of automobiles, which probably gives him motivation for his "big dream". With the exception of the radio, everything is silent . . . until a dead body crashes on the top of the taxi. Seeing the broken window on top of the apartment building, and Vincent returning with no look of shock on his face, Max discovers . . .<br /><br />Max: "You killed him?!"<br />Vincent: "No, I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him."<br /><br />Max has become the driver for a hitman who has been contracted to kill five people in one night.<br /><br />"Collateral" is a movie that focuses on these two men of extreme differences. Vincent is a cold-blooded killer who does what he sets out to do, and if something happens, he decides to "improvise" and "adapt" if the change is either unstoppable or too abrupt. Max, on the other hand, does not use improvisation. He plans everything from the start with no distractions, hoping to fulfill his dreams of owning his own limo company that he's puting up. Vincent never loved L.A.; Max is comfortable living in the city. Vincent loves Jazz; Max does not. And so on. These two men find themselves questioning each other's motives and beliefs, which leads to an ultimate confrontation in the end.<br /><br />The city of Los Angeles becomes an important "character" in the film. The foggy nights, the city lights, the unavoidable crime, the towering skyline, everything looks beautiful. Director Michael Mann has really captured the look and feel of L.A. in an almost perfect way. The digital cinematography makes it all worthwhile.<br /><br />Cruise, Foxx, Pinket Smith, and Ruffalo make a fine acting ensemble. Even though I'm not a big fan of Cruise, I'd say that this is a big surprise. Here he is not seen as a hero, but a villain. He is a cold-blooded contract killer who knows how to properly use a gun. But the truth is, you don't know if you should love or hate Vincent. Aside from the story of his parents, we don't know much about his past, and what drove him to this path. I could say that he does have a heart, but his job is what shatters that statement. Foxx manages to play the part of the average guy very well. He finds himself in a hazardous situation, and he doesn't know what will happen to him when it's over. He should've won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but his win for "Ray" clearly makes up for it. Pinkett Smith's role is smaller in the film, but it is influential in that she becomes part of Vincent's questioning of Max's life. She is a fine actress, and she never misses a beat here. Ruffalo may be a bit off at times, but he is still believable as the Detective who starts to see that the killings may be linked to something more serious. I never realized it was Javier Bardem who played Felix until I saw "No Country for Old Men." He looks and sounds creepy here, but not as creepy as Chigurh.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies in general. The atmosphere of Los Angeles, the acting of Cruise and Foxx, and the music (kudos to Audioslave, Paul Oakenfold, and James Newton Howard) are just few of the reasons for the admiration. This is yet another film (along with The Godfather 1 & 2, No Country for Old Men, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc.) that I'll never get tired of watching repeatedly.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Nobody's perfect, but it's hard to go wrong with a Michael Mann-directed film, especially when it's a crime movie.<br /><br />Although this isn't the quality of his 1995 "Heat," it wasn't far behind in its ability to interest and entertain the viewer while providing some slick visuals.<br /><br />Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are the stars of the film, Foxx winning an Academy Award. No offense to him, but I found Cruise better. He was just outstanding in here as the immoral hit-man. Foxx was entertaining, too, as the nerd-ish cab driver who is pulled into Cruise's murdering adventures.<br /><br />You'll appreciate both of these guys, and the great visuals, more on the second viewing after you are familiar with the story. The intense film is definitely worth more than one look. Check out the behind-the-scenes documentary, too. You'll be glad you are not an actor in one of Mann's films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is a film that actually works even though the premise is outrageous. This is probably Cruise's best performance ever! Who knew he could play such a seedy character. Foxx was nominated for best supporting actor, he is pretty good in this even though he is not my cup of tea. The only thing wrong with this film is the casting of Jada Pinkett Smith, jeez that woman cannot act worth a dime! This film isn't perfect but it's pretty close thanks to director Michael Mann.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I was skeptical about this movie, I mean Tom Cruise as a grey headed assassin and I thought of Jamie Fox as a comedian, but when I saw  this movie last year I was really taken aback.  The movie is well paced and Cruise is in rare form, Fox does a nice job, but this is Cruise's movie and he is very good, expecially when things start to go wrong, his character is riviting.  My only qualms are the movie is a bit long and I really did not buy Jada Pincket being into Jamie Fox, that really is a stretch, uh in real live or film quite frankly.  Having said that I would still recommend this movie, when it good, it's really good and that's  worth the price of the DVD, plus the extra's are nice.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This sure is one hell of a great thriller with action and great humor. Jamie Foxx gives an outstanding performance as Max, a cab driver living a normal life, until the wrong guy steps into his cab. When Vincent (played by Cruise)goes into his cab, Max doesn't realize that this guy's a nutcase and a hitman. He then forces Max to drive him to all of his targets but Max refuses to go down without a fight.. The movie is excellent with a highly original and awesome plot, loads of great action and suspense scenes, one awesome shootout at a nightclub, lots of great humor, and one scene where Vincent completely destroys some punks that steal his briefcase. Beleive me, write this one down on your must see list. It's got the perfect cast, and everything else I already said. I recommend buying it though as you'll definitely want to rewatch it and own this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Michael Mann is one of my favorite directors. He creates films filled with interesting characters, involving stories and production design all of which really help to create the world his films inhabit. When "Collateral" was released in theaters, I heard and read more than one review that stated "Michael Mann returns to the Los Angeles streets in `Collateral'" or something similar. It seems as though he is being typecast. In a good way, this is understandable. He is the director of "Heat", one of the best crime dramas ever made, an epic starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, a sprawling film showing characters on both sides of the law as they make the streets of Los Angeles their personal battle ground. And he is the director of "Collateral", another film set in Los Angeles, this time during the course of one evening, as a hit man travels throughout the city, fulfilling his latest contract. In a bad way, this severely limits the breadth and scope of this director. He has also directed "Last of The Mohicans", starring Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe, one of the most romantic films ever made. "The Insider" and "Ali" are also on his resume, two very different dramas of mixed result. Perhaps we should simply typecast him as a great director and move on with it.<br /><br />"Collateral" follows Vincent Vega (Tom Cruise, sporting graying hair) as he travels throughout Los Angeles one night, fulfilling his contract. Presumably, because he is just visiting, he doesn't rent a car. Maybe he can't drive. Maybe he's from the East Coast and doesn't have a car. This part of his character is vague. For whatever reason, Vincent uses cabs to get around while in LA. At a downtown office building, he jumps into the cab of Max (Jamie Foxx), a man with a dream, who tries to make the best of his days. Max has just dropped off a woman that he is extremely interested in, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) and still daydreaming. He quietly takes Vincent to his first stop, stating that it will take 7 minutes. It does take seven minutes and this impresses Vincent. He asks Max to take him to all of his stops for the rest of the evening; he'll double his usual take. Max eyes the money and agrees. Waiting for his Fare, Max starts eating his dinner, daydreaming, until a body crashes into the top of his cab.<br /><br />Much like "Heat"'s blue landscape and sun-drenched backdrops, "Collateral" goes the opposite direction with equally stunning results. Mann and his crew used a DV Camera for the film. Using a digital camera is a gutsy move and provides a unique look for the film, enhancing the atmosphere. The story actually begins in the late afternoon and every image is crystal clear, much like watching a HD TV. As the light wanes, the images become darker and grainier. When the characters move to a brightly lit area, their faces pop out in sharp relief, but the backgrounds are still grainy. This makes the characters appear as though they are walking among two-dimensional backdrops. When they enter a brightly lit building, everything becomes crystal clear again. Mann is using this as another way of indicating what the characters are feeling and experiencing during these scenes.<br /><br />The story is about as simple as they come. Vega has received his contract and has a fancy tablet-like computer with pictures, addresses, schedules, etc. of each of the victims. He announces to Max that he has five stops, so the viewer has a timeline of sorts, very clearly on. Basically, a two-character set piece, the film is about Max and Vincent. How they interact, how they change each other, what they learn from each other and more. At one point, Vincent learns that Max has a mom in the hospital and he drags Max to the hospital for a visit. They become a sort of guardian angel to each other. As they make their way to the various stops, Max, the good guy, continues to look for a way to stop Vincent. They stop at a Jazz club, a Latino nightclub, a nightclub in Koreatown. Each of these stops introduces a new, interesting character into the mix, however briefly.<br /><br />Less successful, and necessary, are the action scenes. Because the film is essentially a character piece about two people interacting over a single night, big action scenes don't really fit. At the Koreatown club, in particular, the action seems excessive, over the top and unnecessary. Cruise's acting in this scene rivals Pacino's ham-fisted dialogue delivery in "Heat". I'm not knocking Pacino in "Heat", but he is ham-fisted. With the exception of the Koreatown club and the finale, the action scenes are smaller and lower key, which fits perfectly into the story. I am more willing to accept the action of the finale, but it also seems a bit obtrusive. Because it is the finale, and it is foreshadowed at the beginning of the film, it seems to fit more generically.<br /><br />During the 2004 Academy Awards, there was a lot of talk about how Jamie Foxx "almost stole the film" from Tom Cruise. What this means is that people felt Foxx did a better job in this film than his more famous co-star. This is incredibly subjective, but each of them portrayed characters that were different for them. Foxx, who began his rise to fame on TV's "In Living Color", was more well-known for his comedic work. In "Collateral", and later "Ray", he shows remarkable skill at drama. In "Collateral", his character is quiet, observant and a bit of a loser. He comments that the job driving a cab is just temporary; he's working on things, trying to get a business started. When Vincent asks him how long he's been driving a cab, Max answers 12 years. There's nothing temporary about it. We then realize that he is a dreamer who has never, and will never realize his dreams. Max becomes all the more real because of this. Cruise has become one of the world's biggest stars playing heroes. So it was a risk for him to take the role of Vincent, a cold- blooded killer. Like most of Cruise's films, he brings an intensity to the role that fits the character. Cruise's role is the more showy, and noticeable, but it was probably less of a stretch for him to pull off than Foxx's performance. Because of this, Foxx is receiving the lion's share of attention. Both performances are very good. Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Javier Barden and Barry Shabake Henley (a very recognizable character actor) pop up during Max and Vincent's travels. Ruffalo has the most extended supporting role, and is the most successful with it.<br /><br />"Collateral" was released in theaters during the summer of 2004, and it, and "The Bourne Supremacy" signaled that perhaps the studios have realized that there is a market out there for adult action films. "Collateral" is a very good film that will take you along for the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>I doubt I would want to watch "Collateral" more than once.<br /><br />Max (Jamie Foxx) is an LA cabdriver who dreams of owning a top-flight limo service.  He's just driving a cab til he can get the cash to do it right.  He drives at night:  the traffic's better, the tips are higher.<br /><br />He picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise), who offers him double his shift pay if he'll break the rules and take him to visit five 'friends.'  First stop, when a body lands on the cab, he realizes his passenger is a sociopathic killer performing hits for a drug dealer.<br /><br />This begins a surreal ride down the dark side of men's souls.  Max tries to get away, to stop what's happening, and is foiled at every point.<br /><br />Until the last hit.  It's Max's previous fare, a lovely US Attorney.  Will he be able to save her?  Himself?<br /><br />While the movie's premise was interesting and the action for the most part flowed well, there were long gaps of dialogue that took away from the action going on.  Further, one character who I had thought was going to be on Max's side got killed quickly.  What was the point of developing a character to that point and blowing him away?<br /><br />Overall, I think that was my major question about the movie.  What was the point?  My opinion, this film is not worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Beautifully shot and directed, this tour de force features stellar performances by both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (should have gotten a "Best Actor" nom...there's nothing "supporting" about his role...it's 50/50 with Cruise, who also does some of his best work to date).<br /><br />Novel concept, smartly adapted and interpreted.  Fantastic supporting cast led by Pinkett Smith and Ruffalo.  So much care and attention went into the detail of this film that it is a pleasure to watch and gripping from beginning to end.<br /><br />The DVD contains many interesting special features, particularly rehearsal footage and Director's Commentary.  Kudoes to Cruise, Foxx, Mann and Beattie on a wonderful work.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>Hollywood is about Fantasy. If you want "reality" go shopping at Publix. Yet, the real secret to a great film is that something essential about it must be anchored to an aspect of reality. In terms of supplying "reality" the filmaker has to toss the viewer a bone, after which the viewer eagerly fills in the gaps. Well, Michael Mann tosses us no such bones here. The very essential premise; i.e. a high-tech, highly paid hit man decides to kill a series of eye-witnesses by enlisted the aid of a cabbie, is so fundamentally stupid the remainder of the film spins away into nothing.<br /><br />It really isn't necessary to enumerate the problems with this concept. Anyone that has ever flagged down a taxi, anytime or anywhere in the world, can immediately see the long list of obviouis problems.<br /><br />Secondly, all the key witnesses to this hugely important trial are simply available for the killing. Not a one of them is under police protection. Christ, who needs an overpaid hitman for this job?<br /><br />All in all, a very sad outing for Michael Mann, who normally delivers a tremendous film. Is this really the director that brought us that crime masterpiece, "Heat"? --Mykal Banta</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Michael Mann has filmed a good nail biter with Collateral.  It has all the earmarks of post-Hitchcock thrillers. The plot is preposterous, but it is executed with 21st Century technical expertise.  Therefore, the viewer is so engaged with the visual extravaganza, he does not care that Tom Cruise essentially is impersonating Arnold's Terminator.  Cruise is a short man. The idea that he's a cool killer for some reason made me notice his eternal adolescent size.  In Easy Money he became the Cool Tom we see in Rain Man, Mission Impossible etc, but with gray hair, he resembles Tom with gray hair.  The kid doesn't have a lot of range, but Clark Gable didn't either.<br /><br />The big surprise in Collateral is Jamie Foxx.  I have no idea how these comedians turned sitcom boobs can suddenly out act Tom Cruise.  Again, I'm not sure this is a big deal, but Jamie does steal the show.  He's a nice guy stuck in a bad job with a talkie mother. His dreams are not realized because of his own inertia. The Cruise killer prods Jamie to aggressive actions he would have never taken without the threat of death.  Therefore his personality morphs, which is more than I can say for Cruise's character.<br /><br />LA at night is a strange alien city in Mann's vision.  Wandering the streets are the good and the bad in total isolation from each other.  Humans are but grains of sand on a universal beach according to Cruise.  Their elimination is meaningless.  From the rooftops LA is beautiful but meaningless.  Our lives are absurd in an Existential Philosophy without redemption.  I protest, but that's the post-Hitchcock vision of so many films today.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>This is just great movie, maybe best of the year, which is interesting, since the plot, when I heard about it, didn't strike me as particulary original (boy was I wrong).  It's also Mann's best since "Heat," and to some extent even better than that also-great movie. In "Collateral" Mann shrinks the scope considerably, stripping it down to the bare essentials. Oh, there's a wider cast, a plot, and those wonderful camera shots of the city, but what's happening, always, is in the cab, with killer and cabbie. Cruise is a killing machine, but unlike Arnold, he actually acts. The little tics, those eyes, the clipped delivery of lines, Mann burns the reality of the killer right into you. You believe, without doubt, that Cruise -- so often a hero in other flicks -- is a very bad man. Fox is also a good, understated, foil, with his dreams and hopes, colliding with a nightmare (and noirish) journey into the American night. What chance does he have? Watch and see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>Every now and then,an actor who typically gets type cast into "very Hollywood" formulaic films engineered basically just for that actor takes a dive off the deep end.Well,the worm has certainly turned in this one,and I was pleasently surprise by this film.Tom Cruise who typically is "the maveric" character who battles predictable demons in many of his action based films takes on a very interesting character.<br /><br /> On the outside he is easy to decipher...he's an assasin/hitman plain and simple,and you can see how much Cruise enjoyed playing such a different character as opposed to the dull ones he normally gets suckered into.He is a real bad guy in this film.He's intelligent,intriguing,entertaining,but don't forget cold,calculating,precise&he will snuff you out before you can blink,or have a sigh of relief.No changes of heart,no straying from the path,and he takes Jamie Fox along for the ride.<br /><br /> I thoroughly enjoyed his enlighting conversations with jamie Fox&outlook on life as he precieves it&puts into perspective to people who are on auto pilot.I don't want to give up really anything about this movie,as it really is one of Cruise's best thus far.It just goes to show that he is an individual that takes his acting seriously,and will go all out for the right script/part.Not many actors will take a risk...too few do it.As soon as they get their Oscar nomination,they just go for the paycheck and do S*&$!?*^@!ty films afterward.Cruise hits a good one now and then,and I think he's due for an Oscar...it's about bloody time.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Michael Mann's slick, ultra violent thriller "Collateral" serves as a worthy coming out party for the non comedic talents of Jamie Foxx.  Foxx playing ambitious L.A. cabbie Max Durocher becomes an unwitting accomplice, at gunpoint, to smooth and unruffled hitman Vincent played by a grey coiffed Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Cruise has been employed by a drug kingpin known as Felix who is about to be indicted by federal prosecutors.  Cruise's task is to assassinate five witnesses that have been hidden by both the FBI and L.A.P.D.  He is using Foxx and his cab to chauffeur him his various assignments.  When his first victim falls through a 4th floor window onto the roof of Foxx's cab the reality of the frightful adventure commences.<br /><br />Prior to Foxx's initial brush with Cruise he had picked up federal attorney the beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith.  Their innocent but somewhat hard to believe conversation and encounter,<br /><br />will have major relevance to the later developement of the plot.<br /><br />Mann's direction keeps the flick moving at a crisp pace. The camera work is effective in accomplishing this especially in the frenetic gun battle in the night club.  The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is superb and heightens the character developement to make them both believable and sympathetic.  The musical score is quite good as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>I admire several of director Michael Mann's earlier works, notably Thief (1981), Heat (1995), Manhunter (1986), The Last of the Mohicans (1992), and Ali (2001). What we have in this film is perhaps the best example of Mann's style: Multiple camera angles, leisurely conversations juxtaposed with high-speed action, ethically and/or morally ambiguous lead (usually male) characters, and music which is seamlessly integrated within an unhurried plot. It is twilight in Los Angeles as Max (Jamie Foxx) carefully prepares his cab for another evening. Two fares of note: a prosecuting attorney named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) with whom Max almost immediately develops a mutual attraction and then an-assassin-for-hire named Vincent (Tom Cruise) who retains Max for the entire evening. For the next several hours, Max provides the transportation which Vincent needs to complete a series of five hits for his client, a major drug organization which needs to have four witnesses eliminated. As for the fifth person on the hit list....<br /><br />As I observed the development of the story line, certain elements in it reminded me of the earlier Mann films but also of Chinatown (1974) , Pulp Fiction (1994), and L.A. Confidential (1997). For example, its noir elements; also its engagement of the viewer to feel like an eavesdropper, if not a voyeur. Almost all of Collateral was shot at night and much of the city revealed may be unfamiliar to those who actually live there. Killing people is what Vincent does. I would rank his skills somewhere between those of Edward Fox's "Jackal" and John Travolta's Vincent Vega. It is Foxx (not Cruise), however, who is the film's emotional center of gravity. Mann brilliantly establishes this during Max's conversation with Annie, a cab scene I consider to be at least the equal of Brando and Steiger's in On the Waterfront.<br /><br />Given all that, why not a higher rating? Good question. In fairness to Mann and his associates as well as to those who read this brief commentary, I want to be very careful when answering that question. I don't reveal too much when suggesting that several situations in this film are distractingly implausible. Mann is a master of portraying gritty realism. In this film, he sometimes wanders across the line into areas more appropriate to, for example, The Matrix (1999) or an earlier Cruise film, Minority Report (2002). Also, I found the film's ending unsatisfying. It gave me the impression that Mann really didn't know quite what to do. (I had exactly the same reaction to the ending of Mike Nichols' The Graduate.) Some films conclude with a clear indication that a sequel is probable. In this instance, that would also be implausible.<br /><br />Overall, Collateral provides solid entertainment. Although I enjoyed The Bourne Supremacy somewhat more, that's just one man's opinion.  See both and judge for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"Hey Max..., A guy gets on the MTA here in L.A. and dies. Think anyone will notice?"  - Vincent's time runs out in "Collateral"<br /><br />From Michael Mann, the director of "Heat" and the creator of "Miami Vice" (when the hell is that series coming to DVD?!), comes "Collateral", a taut, suspenseful crime drama that is one of the best films of the summer of 2004, and has outstanding performances from both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (this isn't your mom's Tom Cruise!).<br /><br />Tom Cruise is Vincent, a cold-blooded hitman who has just arrived in L.A., with 10 hrs. to kill.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is Max, an L.A. cabdriver who works the night shift for the past 12 years in hopes of one day fulfilling his dream of owning his own island cab company.<br /><br />After Max hooks up with an attractive D.A. (potrayed Jada Pinkett Smith) & getting her phone number, he meets his next customer, Vincent, and Max's hellish nightmare begins.<br /><br />Vincent offers six hundred bucks to Max, in return for taking him around the Los Angeles area to meet some friends that Vincent has to see. Max soon finds out, the hard way, that Vincent is a hired assasin, & not only in town with time to kill, but, the friends he mentioned are federal witnesses, to a high profile case, that Vincent must, one-by-one like the Grim Reaper, assasinate. The plot thickens when Max finds out the D.A., he met earlier in the evening, is on Vincent's list.<br /><br />With the police and the F.B.I. hot on the trail, & the clock ticking down to the early morning dawn, Max is forced to find a way to stop Vincent, save the girl, and not become public enemy number one in the eyes of the cops & the feds. Time is not on Max's side.<br /><br />What makes the film tick is the great performances from the two principles.<br /><br />Cruise gives one of his best performances of late and I have a feeling that if the Academy remembers "Collateral", Cruise might garner another Oscar nomination. Cruise's Vincent is one mean mother f**k in this film and comes across cool, calculative, cynical, and cocky. All the elements found in a great villian. The problem for me was, that he isn't one of those villians you love to hate. I actually liked Vincent!<br /><br />Foxx gives his best performance to date as Max. Foxx's Max is the typical everyman who passes the hero test by facing a great fear and rising above it all.<br /><br />The third character in the film is Los Angeles itself. Michael Mann directing the film using digital filmaking technology gives the city an errie sheen that regular film can't quite capture (in one scene while Vincent is walking to one of his destination's in the background the city nightline generates an errie twinkling, while in another Max driving on the freeway toward the nightclub, one can't help but watch the nightsky as the streetlights zoom by). Mann does a great job at generating, and keeping the flow of the action going thruout "Collateral" (I didn't find that the film had any real drag to it).<br /><br />"Collateral", like Los Angeles, is cold, hard, & full of action. Definitely not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, and Jada Pinkett-Smith all give top-notch performances.  All of them are highly likeable characters, even Cruise who plays a hitman who appears unfeeling to his "victims," while being "caring" to others, especially Foxx.  What I liked about this is that it is different from most thrillers.  It doesn't use the same tired tricks that other thrillers seem to use.  (when someone appears dead, he is dead).<br /><br />The movie never gets boring from beginning to end.  This movie looks like a springboard for more roles for Foxx and Pinkett-Smith!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>COLLATERAL is simply excellent entertainment.  The direction by Michael Mann is tense, highly nuanced, and achieves superb performances from of his excellent cast.  The plot line is fairly straight forward: hired assassin (Tom Cruise in a role that comes close to his fine acting turn in A FEW GOOD MEN, which is praise indeed) engages a good guy cabbie (Jamie Foxx in an outstanding performance! - watch the nominations....) to privately transport him around Los Angeles for six night hours while he murders witnesses to a trial.  More than that you need not know: the movie is basically a duet for these two actors with excellent support form incidental players the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Jada Pinkett Smith, and the always fascinatingly gifted Javier Bardem, etc.  The camera work takes us places Los Angeles hides under smog during the day, skylines at night so magnificent you'd think they were New York.  But then there is also the grit, the smarmy side of all sectors of LA, and Mann and his cinematographer capture it all with relish.  The accompanying musical score is apropos and builds tension.  But in the end it is the tour de force of the interaction between Foxx and Cruise that makes this movie more than just another summer action flick.  It deserves repeated watching!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>So, listen---a guy dies on the Metrorail, right? And he does loop-de-loops around L.A. for six hours, and nobody notices, you know?<br /><br />So the real question is this: if a hitman gets gunned down on the LA metro-rail, and nobody hears him die, does the movie really stink up the joint?<br /><br />The answer is: definitely yes. The fact that Michael Mann produced this dog, which has made-for-TeeVee written all over it, is astounding, perplexing, and more than a little sad.<br /><br />If you haven't been hiding in a cave above Kabul for the last three years, then you probably know the preposterous premise behind Collateral's wafer-thin plot: hitman (Tom Cruise, with ugly grey flannel suit and ugly silver hair) blows into town with list of victims, hires cabbie (Jamie Foxx, who tries manfully to fake a working man) to take him to Points A, B, C, D and E.<br /><br />Never mind the stupidity of the premise: what professional hitman, ferried in by Colombian druglords to slaughter the witnesses in a major federal sting, is gonna trust his precious, deadly mission to the hands of some random schmo he picks up at LAX? Let's go by the numbers, alright?<br /><br />1) Every professional hitman works hard to blend in to the scenery by frosting his hair silver, wearing Agent Smith-style refracting wrap-arounds, and donning a dress-to-impress grey suit---especially in LA, where business-formal is defined by the length of your Bermuda shorts;<br /><br />2)Every professional hitman in LA with a high priority job to do hires a cab to ferry him to his destination. Because, you know, cabs are the---ummmm---most efficient way to go if you're carrying off a major hit and want no witnesses. Right.<br /><br />3) In a major federal drug trial, none of the witnesses, let alone the prosecutor, are provided with even the most rudimentary police protection, even when it's evident someone is bumping them off one by one.<br /><br />4) LA Federal buildings have just one crummy security guard, even on the eve of a major trial involving a Colombian drug cartel.<br /><br />5) If you're a high-profile international assassin, it's a great idea to leave all your critical assassin files locked up in a big obvious black briefcase that you dangle around in front of your hijacked cabbie and anyone else he thinks of tossing the thing to.<br /><br />6)If you're director Michael Mann, you're obviously too successful to worry about choreagraphing a coherent, visually compelling action sequence in the dance-club "Fever". Far better to just let things go, in random chaotic fashion, for about 10 minutes, and then call it a rap. Oh yeah, and did I mention? If you're a federal witness on the eve of a major Drug trial and you hear gunshots and the screams of the dying in a club you're chowing down in, it's better just to ignore it and keep eating sushi. Maybe it will go away.<br /><br />7) If Jada Pinkett Smith gets hired to do what would amount to a three-second throwaway role at the start of a flick, it must mean she's coming back for seconds. Or that she's tied into the plot in a big way. Right? Right?<br /><br />8)An expert shot will always miss the hero in a totally unpopulated LA subway terminal, but the hero will always be able to bring down the baddie with one lucky shot.<br /><br />9) When you run out of interesting dialogue/expositions, following a cab using an aerial shot of LA always helps.

Tom Cruise gets the showy role of contract killer Vincent and proves himself more than worthy, but the great Jamie Foxx, in many ways, steals the movie out from under him as Max, the hostage cab driver. It's a gritty film. The digital camerawork, which can weaken the impact of some films for me, is one of COLLATERAL's strengths, adding to its mood and keeping things uneasy and weird.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>Cruise here is seen on 'cruise control' as the hitman from hell and Jamie Foxx shows a bit more of his dramatic acting chops (ie, none of his patented Jamie Foxx smartassness) as the taxi driver who's *really* not having a good day. It ain't an Oscar calibre performance (ala Denzil Washington's corrupt cop turn in the great Training Day) that we find Cruise giving to his lead man in the movies status. But you will find Tom's performance interesting and you get the feel that if he does another bad guy, it will become an Oscar conten-dah. Do you wanna know what I thought was pretty hilarious? Sister (Jada P.) is in a hi-rise office building alone and gets a frantic, frantic, frantic 'hey-hey-hey-there's-a-murderer-two-doors-down-from-you' call from the cabbie she just gave a card to and the first thing on her mind is 'why should I believe you and why should I trust you?'<br /><br />My humor however is weird.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>I'm not sure why Jaime Foxx is receiving such great accolades for Collateral, when in fact Tom Cruise is the scene stealer in this film. Cruise plays his most vicious character to date as a hitman with absolutely no conscience. The best scene of Collateral has to be when Vincent's briefcase is jacked from Max's (Foxx) cab by a couple of street punks. Vincent just strolls out in time to see the kids walking off with his possession. He approaches them and has a gun put to his head, but in a split second the two young men are dead and Vincent has his briefcase back. Michael Mann tries way too hard to delve deep into character development for Max and Vincent when in fact all the audience really wants is to get an inside glimpse of Vincent's facinating lifestyle. The movie is about a half hour too long and the ending seems as if it was rewritten at least a half dozen times. The ultimate payoff in this film is certainly not worth the ride. Overall, Collateral is a marked step back for Michael Mann but a great expansion of range for Cruise. Recommended only to hardcore Cruise fans only.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>Max (Jamie Foxx) has been a "temporary" taxi driver for the past 12 years, just waiting for things to "get in to shape" as he tries to save enough money to start his own limo-business. He's lonely, he's afraid to commit and he has a sick mother in the hospital. Suddenly, Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters his cab and Max has no option but to drive through the LA night as Vincent, a contract-killer, starts to murder the five witnesses to a narcotics process.<br /><br />"Collateral" has its weakest points in the script, with some major holes that can't be overlooked, and in the development of "the bad guy", played by Tom Cruise. I mean, Vincent must be the dumbest, worst (yet luckiest) contract killer alive in the world. Not that Cruise isn't good in the movie, he is - at least he shows some effort at trying to be good in a role that is different from everything he has done until today. The movie's strongest points are the excepcional direction by Michael Mann, and Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />Michael Mann wanted to do a thriller. And he did it, with a capital T. "Collateral" has some very strong moments, leaving the viewer tense for most of the time. The script doesn't have logic or continnuity problems (as could have been expected, because the plot spans only twelve hours or so of the same night), but some parts treat the viewer's intelligence with disrespect. Jamie Foxx, strong in comedies, proves to be a very resourceful and convincing actor, carrying most of the weight of the movie on his back. The final 15 or 20 minutes contain a plot-twist that is not unexpected (but not too obvious either) and provide the best moments of the movie. Jada Pinkett also rises above the expected supporting role she's supposed to play.<br /><br />"Collateral" is one more above-average movie by Michael Mann, one of the (few) trully innovative directors in today's Hollywood.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>Maybe this film will be good in the future for those of us who need a chaser for the unearthly greatness that is HEAT. The action is first-rate, and Cruise's character is very, very interesting. But then again, so is DeNiro's. My main gripe with this film is that it had a *brilliant* premise and failed to take the characters where they needed to go, winding up in a generic shootout that could have been the end to a dozen other Hollywood films. And no, the swelling music at the end seemed almost like a mockery of Heat's epic ending. Heat = one of my favorite films. This one is ranking somewher around #300. I've got to say also, I'm just not as interested in Jamie Foxx's character. I just want to watch Cruise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>not to say tom's performance isnt good, but he was better in last samurai, why do people love him in this, and not Samurai, that was an oscar caliber performance, this is a golden globe.  Foxx was good too, but i dont think he'll get a oscar nod either, the rest of the cast does well too.  The story is interesting and has many meanings, its well shot and realistic, its intense on the mind and heart (not heartwrenchingly dramatic like Passion of the christ, but still sad), the action is realistic but nothing new, its more of a charater movie (not a bad thing when you make them correctly like this, but the performances could have been just a smidge better),  the music is also very good esspecially the audioslave song and the one techno song during the club scene, and the score.  Overall a well crafted entertaining film, i recommend heat if you like this, its manns only other good film, ali was dissapointing excepts for wills performance, i hope mann stays with crime dramas that is what he is good at.  9 out of a 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Jamie Foxx is astonishing as a taxi driver who seems to have it all together at first and who, after a difficult evening out with hired killer Tom Cruise, discovers that he hasn't been as well adjusted as he's thought.  He's delayed opening his own business with the excuse that he needs more time to conceptualize it until it's "perfect."  And he's lonely too, and hasn't had a date in quite a while because he lives in his mind.  Under the most horrifying of circumstances, Foxx's character, Max Durocher, has his whole world collapse around him, and he finds out to his surprise, that it isn't 100% negative thing.  I kept thinking maybe the writers called him "Durocher" to remind us of the old time ballplayer Leo Durocher and his famous saying that "Nice guys finish last."<br /><br />Cruise is very good, although he isn't asked to give the acting workout that Jamie Foxx undergoes.  And Jada Pinkett Smith, short as she is, makes interesting acting choices in what could have been a nothing role as the US attorney, Annie, who becomes Max's love interest.  And there are other great actors let loose in this wildly entertaining film, everyone from Irma Hall to Javier Bardem to Mark Ruffalo, who seems to make every other film that's released nowadays but who won't find another one soon with as much topnotch quality and mass appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ.html">AQ8DU6XVA3USJ</a><br/><p>Though large chunks of the "Collateral" plot are preposterous, taken with a pinch of salt and tongue in cheek, it's a highly entertaining thrill ride through the streets of Los Angeles, while cab driver Jamie Foxx is taken hostage by sociopath hit man Tom Cruise. Foxx spends the night from hell as Cruise uses his cab for "work," and tries to find a way out of his predicament.<br />The film looks great, with lots of dazzling overhead shots of a bright lights and glitter LA, and it sounds good too, with a score by James Newton Howard, and some pleasant non-original music. There are many moments of humor with some witty lines between the two leads, who have a marvelous "anti-chemistry" between them, and director Michael Mann keeps the pace so fast, that as we zip from scene to scene, we don't fully realize how absurd the story is.<br /><br />The cast is excellent; Cruise with gray hair and beard is in one of his best recent roles, and portrays the sadistic Vincent with a cool and cutting edge, and Foxx is terrific as the beleaguered cabbie Max. Both are in peak athletic shape, and do their share of some fast running. Jada Pinkett Smith is beautiful as a prosecuting attorney, but it is a thankless role, and she is not much more than a plot device. Others in the cast include Spanish actor (and new international star) Javier Bardem in a small part as Felix, Mark Ruffalo as Fanning, and Peter Berg as Weidner.<br />Put reasoning on hold, and you'll enjoy this splashy thriller, and what is ultimately a bizarre "buddy film."<br />Total running time is 120 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT.html">A2WSI8HOWHFDOT</a><br/><p>What separates Michael Mann's "Collateral" from most other crime thrillers is that you actually have characters that you enjoy and, more importantly, understand. To see Tom Cruise as an ice-in-his-blood hitman, which is way more than casting against type, is something to behold. And Jamie Foxx as an unwilling accomplice is superb. And Los Angeles, as an unwilling third character, is hypnotic. (The scene where three coyotes cross a main L.A. drag is almost artsy, but extremely effective, as it questions the distinction [or lack thereof] between civilization and wilderness.)<br /><br />I agree with most reviewers that some of coincidences are farfetched, and that the ending is a little too much like other thrillers, especially "Speed". Still, the movie held my attention thanks to the peppery dialogue between Cruise and Foxx. What disappointed me, besides the logistical leaps in the plot, were the "gimmes". Michael Mann's commentary was surprisingly uninteresting and the "special" features weren't so special. However, this is movie is a high-water mark in thrillers and an exceptional character study worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise (Vincent) has complete control of his handguns in this movie. He blows away all his "targets" with style and panache. Well, he should. He's an extremely well-trained assassin, on a "night on the town" picking his victims from his notebook computer; going from place to place with Jamie Foxx as his unsolicited cab driver(?), Max.  Ahhh...Vincent shoots people and then, shoots more people. I really loved the way he put down the scumbag punks in the alley. HK USP, Glock, HK MP4, Beretta, Sig-Sauer, Uzi? Just some of the guns used in this mayhem-for-hire movie. Jada Pinkett-Smith is one of his "targets."</p></br><a href="../users/AQI2CW6UKF1ES.html">AQI2CW6UKF1ES</a><br/><p>Well Tom Cruise as a hitman?  Well that's interesting to see him break away from the everyday action hero sanerio he's usally in.  Jamie Foxx not in a comedy?  Oh boy, now this is a risk.  Either it's good ot it's awful.<br /><br />Max(Jamie Foxx) is your everyday cab driver, a honest one for the past 12 years of his services to people.  After his cab drive with Annie(Jada Pickett Smith)  Then comes a guy who's hair is the same color as his suit, Vincint(Tom Cruise).  He gives off some nice loot for a couple of stops that usally cost a lot less, but when a huge puzzle peice as to who Vincint really is lands right in front of Max's face, it's all a rollarcoaster of thrills as to what happens next.<br /><br />This movie does a real good job of keeping the susspence in the movie until the end.  And the fact that Jamie and Tom have proved loyal to their roles dispite typical good guy, and comedy senerios in the past.  Also during the action seenes, they are well directed, and the live style sound effects of the fighting and the gunfights really gets your adreniline rushing during the sceenes.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the end.  A whole bunch a bullets, a whole bunch of misses, only 3 feet apart(Even if it was dark, you could get the jist of where the person was.)<br /><br />Collateral definitly was a huge breakthrough for Jamie Foxx's carrer which got him a oscar nomination.  And after that he got a well deserved best actor award for his extrodinary performance as Ray Charles.  As for Tom, hey, he can finally be the bad guy once in a while which is good to know.  This movie has great suspenction in it, and it also has great action sceenes in it.  Just what to expect from the Director of Heat(Michael Mann).  If you love suspence movies or movies that kick up a good heartracer once in a while, you should definitly check this out. If you have nothing but negative opinions of Ton and Jamie, This might change your mind about these 2 actors who, to me, did good in a excellent movie., or you might be saying what is Michael Mann's pproblem choosing these 2 guys to play lead roles in a movie.  But it should be checked out.<br /><br />Peace</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>This well-crafted thriller by director Michael Mann offers not only edge-of-the-seat suspense but also solid characterization and cinematic mood.  Jamie Foxx, in an exceptional performance, plays taxi driver Max who still dreams of starting his own business while trapped in his night job of driving fares around LA.  When he inadvertently picks up hit man Vincent (Tom Cruise), everything comes down to survival as his life depends on Vincent's slaughter of others.  Detective Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) is the only one who sees the connectivity of the murders and who may be Max's only chance of rescue.<br /><br />The surprise of this movie is the acting and chemistry between the two stars, Foxx and Cruise.  Both give their characters depth - and the viewer perversely understands both Vincent's affection for Max and his willingness to kill him.  But Foxx is the man we identify with, not only because his life is in jeopardy, but because of his dreams, his principals, and his mix of fear and astounding bravery.  The viewer is with him every step of the harrowing way.<br /><br />The soundtrack is good, and the mood created by Mann of a late-night, underbelly LA is exceptional.  The movie has a classiness that many thrillers do not.  Its major flaw is the relative predictability of its final scenes.  While Jada Pinkett Smith turns in a fine supporting performance, she stands in for the typical Hollywood gotta-have woman who motivates the male protagonist.  Her role is all too clear early in the film; however, Mann adeptly diverts the viewer by his suspenseful handling of plot and character.<br /><br />Recommended viewing for thriller fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>Collateral offers a gripping storyline, excellent acting and direction and a lot of edge-of-your-seat excitement that doesn't falter in the least bit (although it's nearly a 2 hour movie which isn't common anymore.) Just from the moment Collateral started I was glued to the screen. This film's taut atmoshpere, great dialogue, and great acting from Foxx and Cruise makes this an extremely watchable thriller.<br />Jamie Foxx plays Max, an LA cab driver who inadvertently gets involved with the murders of 5 people from a hitlist being carried out by a contract killer named "Vincent" played by Tom Cruise. I won't go into details, but this storyline is executed very well and doesn't get confusing or complicated at all like what happens with a lot of films of this nature.<br />And there can't be enough said about the performances from Foxx and Cruise in this one. Playing almost parallel-like characters (Max a hard working man trying to make ends meet who values people and their company, Vincent a contract killer who values no one's life) made watching Foxx and Cruise on the screen a very interesting thing to watch. Plus to see Cruise playing a character such as this was a breath of fresh air in his career in my opinion.<br />Great thrills, a lot of excitement and some really great acting makes Collateral a film I would recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>The acting was great by all actors involved. You felt that the actors were really the characters they were playing as supposed to "Hey look, it's Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx." The story was well written and well executed. The best thing was that it was believable, there was no matrix moves, no superhero antics, no special effects to make up for poor acting. The only draw back is that the ending was predictable. I agree with the critics however, they dont make movies like this anymore.<br /><br />There were some 'laugh out loud' scenes that brought some comic relief throughout the movie, my favorite being the cab radio dialogue between Max, Max's boss, and Vincent, after Max's taxi sustained some windshield damage. Also enjoyed the soundtrack. This is a definite must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>This was a very good movie. It is stylish, which is a trademark of Michael Mann's, and has good performances by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. Foxx proves he can really act and Cruise makes a believable sociopath. Cruise is a hired killer in L.A. for one night to kill 5 people and he hires Foxx's taxi to take him from place to place. An unfortunate event at the first murder makes Foxx an unwilling accomplice. There is a lot of psychological warfare going on from Cruise's character and eventually Foxx begins to fight back. This is a good thriller with an intelligent script and good actors creating good characters. My only problem would be a little bit of a contrived ending but then again maybe I'm thinking too much and I should just shut up and enjoy the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Michael Mann returns with this edgy masterwork of a movie about an ordinary taxi driver who gets caught into the world of a contract killer. It was like any other day and night for taxi driver Max, a superb Jamie Foxx (RAY, Held Up) Foxx picks up a grey haired mysterious man named Vincent, played with ferocious intensity by Tom Cruise (the upcoming War Of The Worlds, The Last Samurai), and after he picks him up things start to turn a little weird. Cruise is a hitman, who needs to kill 5 people he was hired to kill, so Cruise takes Foxx hostage. A nicely done character study with the two stars giving one of their best and believe me Foxx gives it all his best and when is Cruise ever dull as a villain?. Lots of action and excitment especially the scenes when Cruise shoots someone. Mark Ruffalo (In The Cut, 13 Going On 30) and Peter Berg (The Last Seduction, Aspen Extreme) play cops on the case. Ruffalo looks in good form and Berg looks tired. Also starring along for the ride is Jada Pinkett Smith (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) who is the 5th mark on Cruise's list, Bruce Mc Gill (Animal House, Rosewood), Debi Mazar (Space Truckers, Nowhere), Bodhi Pine Elfman (Mercury Rising, Enemy Of The State), Javier Bardem (The Dancer Upstairs) and a quick and unbilled cameo by Jason Statham (The Transporter, Cellular) at the beginning. A fast ride worth taking. One of the best movies of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Michael Mann<br /><br />Cast:  Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill.<br /><br />Rated R for lots of violence and language.<br /><br />Running Time:  120 minutes.<br /><br />Michael Mann, director of great films such as "Heat" and "The Insider", distributes another fine, tense thriller with "Collateral".  Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx star in extremely original roles for both:  Cruise as a bounty-hunter-like hit man who appears more like a cyborg terminator than a regular human being and Foxx as a timid cab driver who is continuously in search of his dreams.<br /><br />While Max (Jamie Foxx) is on his routine Los Angeles cabbie job, he unfortunately picks up the fast-talking, intense Vincent (Cruise).  Vincent coerces Max to drive for him throughout the night for an extra profit, not knowing what horrific events are to unfold.  When the body of one of Vincent's victims lands on the top of car, Max realizes that this night is going to be like no other in the big city.  The strange duo drives from hit to hit, each creating more and more tension between them.  "Collateral" breezes along with crafty fashion to the electrifying climax in which Max must save a prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) from the wraith of the merciless contract killer.<br /><br />Cruise is spectacular in his role, bringing incredible wit and savvy to his character.  Just as in "Jerry Maguire" and "Top Gun", his performance as Vincent is one that he was born to play.  Foxx delivers his second best performance of the year (behind his Oscar-worthy work in "Ray") as the John Doe bus driver who just wants a better life for himself.  As the night escalates from a regular and peaceful to tormenting and fanatical, Foxx shows the audience the transformation of this ordinary man into a hero.  Director Michael Mann does a proficient job using the city of Los Angeles throughout the film, creating beautiful pans of the eloquent buildings and roadways that add to the angst of the picture.  A splendid rogue of a film, splicing elements of "Taxi Driver", "The Terminator", and the formula for the 80's slasher flicks.  The only downfall of the film is that writer Stuart Beattie's screenplay attempts to add a layer of philosophical inquiry throughout the film (particularly one taxi scene involving both Max and Vincent), but it does not seem to quite fit.  An excellent effort of terror and suspense.  One of the most unique of its kind.  All fans of Cruise will thoroughly enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>Lately, Tom Cruise has been getting on everyone's nerves, and it is easy to see why. He's been a little kooky for the past few years and it has been very annoying...however, I have to say that none of that has tarnished the fact that he is a fantastic actor, and this film is proof of that statement...well, this and "Magnolia" of course.<br /><br />I recently revisited "Collateral" over the weekend, and I have to say that Tom Cruise delivers what I think is an Oscar-worthy performance as a contract killer named Vincent, who gives a New York taxi driver - a superb Jamie Foxx - the ride of his life. You all know the plot by now, so there is no point getting into it here. All that you need to know is that the film boasts some excellent scenery, dialogue, and a pretty cool film score. Michael Mann is at the top of his game here. He manages to inject that "Miami Vice" feel into all of his work, and it just comes off as incredilbly awesome.<br /><br />The thing that I love about this film is that it doesn't succomb to the conventional "lets blow crap up" attitude of it's genre. It's an intelligent thriller with a considerable amount of character development, and of course, there are times where suspension of disbelief is required, but not to the point where you are rolling your eyes. I usually avoid action films like the plague, but this is the exception as it does more than offer you boom booms and bang bangs.<br /><br />SEE IT, if you have not already.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>The predictable plot symmetry of "Collateral" might be straight out of Screenwriting 101, but it matters little.  Ultimately, this isn't a plot-driven thriller - it's the story of a man who is given the chance to take a stand and thereby prove to himself that he has what it takes to change his life.  For that kind of story, plot runs a distant second to character - and there's absolutely nothing formulaic about Stuart Beattie's wonderfully original characters, nor the ways in which Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx bring them so vividly to life.  The strength of characterization in the writing and performances is phenomenal (check out how much we learn about Max in the cab depot before he says even a single word).  Tom Cruise might be all over the posters for this movie - and there is a lot of pleasure to be had in seeing him play a mesmerizingly ruthless bad guy - but Jamie Foxx is the real star.  He walks the line between strength and vulnerability so expertly you never know which side of it he's likely to fall.  The situations Beattie's script puts them in are wonderfully unsettling, the dialogue is crisp and intelligent, and the music and editing conspire perfectly to create an experience which is horribly unnerving but never less than totally compelling.  Mann's visual style is typically excellent, giving L.A. both its dreamlike expansiveness and gritty immediacy.  It's an utterly unromantic vision of the city, yet it makes you want to go there right now.  That's the touch of a great director.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Collateral" is one of the best films of 2004, a visually sumptuous masterpiece that may eclipse "Heat" as the definitive modern Los Angeles crime picture. Michael Mann directed both, and, using digital technology here, photographs the city so initimately LA seems almost foreign: Gone is the balmy, commercial gleam of Beemers and cell phones; in its wake, a spare, working metropolis pocked with desert wilderness. It recalls the Raymond Chandler days: Men live and work here. The white noise has been dialed all the way down. The plot to "Collateral," from Stuart Beattie's screenplay, is mere potboiler, but Mann's style so informs the story that it acheives a kind of elegance, a fuzzy sheen not unlike the halos surrounding the street lights in the movie.<br /><br />The same can be said of the comfortable subtle performances from two noted extroverts, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise is Vincent, nihilist first, hitman second, more brutally than silently efficient, who hires cab driver Max (Foxx) to usher him around to six targets throughout the city. The first hit is a failure: Vincent's target falls out the window and onto Max's cab.<br /><br />"Plan B," Vincent says.<br /><br />A conflict emerges: The Foxx character is smart, angry and moral enough to size up his captor's plan - Max might as well be on the ferry going across the river. It becomes a question of impulse, and the cautious, plodding Max is not initially up to it until Vincent rigs a daunting, if unlikely, scenario inside a night club. Other preordained complications - foreseen, frankly, as these movies exist to have curveballs - emerge; Vincent is fond of jazz, and likens the rest of the evening to improvisation, "between the notes."<br /><br />Visually the movie is precisely imperfectly so, as Mann mixes his patented jam-in-your-face close-up with overhead shots, staged medium compositions, documentary snippets, as when a coyote gallops across the street in the dead of night. The epic cool of "Heat" is gone, replaced by blue-collar sweat and that dense grain of Mann's "Ali" - it seemed cinematically ambivalent at the time, but it's making more sense now.<br /><br />The look of "Collateral" is disturbing and beautiful, distancing and timeless. The apex comes when Cruise is framed by a subway window, outside which the sun has begun to rise, the curved palms beginning to get distinguish themselves against the sky. It is a Mann Moment, one that escaped him in "Ali," and was simply too contrived and arch in "Heat" when Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro clutched hands.  Here it is exotic and lush, both contained within the car and infinite out the window, with a view stretching for miles toward the desert or ocean. It is a shot the city, and cinema, deserves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>One of the major problems I have with many action movies is that they seemingly attempt to suspend your logic to the point of insulting your intelligence-it really gets to be like a proverbial slap in the face after awhile. This movie, like many of its predecessors, follows some of the action film clich&eacute;'s: ordinary guy getting involved in an event over his head, somehow protagonist must save girl from danger, big car chases where many red lights are run and luckily no innocent citizens are run over, explosions, sharpshooters that somehow miss easy targets but hit difficult ones, the over-drawn chase and fight scenes, etc. For what it is worth, this is an entertaining film. It certainly held my interest for the most part, but it began to wane as the movie progressed. I found the first half of the movie was far more enjoyable than the latter half, and, as the second half unfolded, and with each new chase and each new murder by Cruise, I found myself rolling my eyes more and more at the preposterousness of it all.<br /><br />For instance, are we actually to believe that sharpshooters from the LAPD and FBI units, as well as security guards are all going to fail to hit Vincent (Cruise's character) in the nightclub?  Equally implausible is the dancing that continues to go on as weapons are drawn, shots are fired, and commands such as "Put your hands in the air" and "This is the FBI" are being screamed at the club. Some liken Tom Cruise to a human, malevolent Terminator in this movie, and in this segment he plays out this machine-like quality to perfection, as he stoically and unemotionally beats down innocent by-standers and, well, calmly shoots innocent by-standers that happen to be anywhere near Max (Jamie Foxx).<br /><br />Perhaps a bigger illusion is the ridiculously implausible ending. I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say it involves a car crash, a woman alone in a building, a chase, and two injured people with guns aboard a subway. It really is a let down when a movie tries to go so far over-the-top at the climax and conclusion, and Mann (director) does so at the point after the taxi crash to the extent where many of the "positives" of the movie are easily forgotten.<br /><br />Still, on a lighter note, an aspect of the movie that is rewarding is the acting in itself. Tom Cruise plays his rare role as a bad guy, a hit man, to perfection, and Jamie Foxx does an equally commendable job playing the easy-going cab driver with bigger goals in life. They seem to know their characters well, and it is Max, Foxx's character that shifts from the early part of the movie to the latter part. However, one problem about Foxx's character that was slightly an annoyance was the occasional muttering and mumbling that made his lines indiscernible.<br /><br />Overall, it was a decent film, but nothing meriting the 5 stars. It is a fun movie and it will be better if you can stretch your imagination and not be bothered by the usual clich&eacute;s in action films.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>In an opening scene worthy of its own film, "Collateral" introduces its audience to a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) who would rather be doing anything else in the world than driving cabs.  Max sees driving a cab as beneath him; he dreams of a life of importance and seems to feel the need to apologize to his passengers for doing what he does to make a living.<br /><br />Max then picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) and promises to chauffeur the well-dressed businessman around for the remainder of the evening.  When Vincent begins killing people at each stop, the film becomes a struggle between the two individuals: a contract killer and the cabbie driving him to each murder.  In a narrative similar to what could be expected of a low budget play, much of the action takes place in the cab, as the two men bicker and debate while an unbelievable set of circumstances unfolds around them.<br /><br />The film's strength is found in the performances of its two leads and in the unequaled craftsmanship of its director (Michael Mann).  Foxx and Cruise -each cast against type- give performances that rival anything in their pasts.  Foxx shows he can tone down his persona, nailing the cerebral Max, while Cruise continues his recent trend of trying to "muddy up" his good boy image.<br /><br />Mann's direction is nothing short of spectacular.  Working with material that could have resulted in a corny, tired formula film in the hands of a lesser director, Mann is able to create a film that expands the potential for a crime drama.  He opens up the genre with ambiguous questions on the nature of killing and decorates the scenes with haunting, dark images.<br /><br />"Collateral" is not the best film of 2004.  In fact, the material leaves a lot to be desired.  But this film shows how talented individuals can turn a less-than-desirable script into a wholly enjoyable film.  Without Mann, Foxx and Cruise, this film could have been a disaster; but with them in charge, the end product is a film that will satisfy most viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Michael Mann proves again, with this film, that he comprehends the minds and machinations of criminals better than just about anyone else.  He gives these characters depth, complexity, and crackling dialogue as he takes us deep into their world and their way of thinking and behaving.<br />Tom Cruise is so good in the role of the criminal Vincent that after a few minutes, you will forget who it is you're watching.  Jamie Foxx is also expertly cast as the unlucky cab driver, Max, who is forced to go along on a dangerous, all-night ride through the streets of L.A. as Vincent forces him to drive him from one "hit" to another.<br />Jada Pinkett Smith also performs well as an earlier fare who ends up embroiled in the mess and nearly loses her life.<br />Mann lovingly photographs the city and adds the usual perfectly chosen songs to fill out the story.<br />Highly recommended and probably underrated.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise has gotten a bad rap when it comes to dramatic roles. I for one think he is underrated. If this role doesn't convince you of his great skills, I don't know what will. He plays a hired killer named Vincent, with 6 hits to carry out. When he first hires a cab driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx we think he seems like an average man. As the story unfolds and Foxx and us realize what he is capable of doing, we are in shock and awe. Foxx is excellent in this role. Typically he has been type cast in comedies, but he shows he is quite capable of dramatic roles as well. He does a great job of playing an average man that is caught up in something he can't escape without taking drastic measures.<br /><br />I am a fan of Michael Mann and I am glad to see him direct another great movie. Scenes such as Max stopping for a Coyote, show how he is humane. While Vincent shows us how cold blooded he can be killing a Jazz club owner after talking to him about jazz. Any fan of movies like "Manhunter", "Heat", or Tarantino movies will definitely want to buy it. The style that Mann uses to show the dark side of the city and human nature is excellent. The quality of the DVD is first class and the extras include documentary, deleted scenes, cast, filmakers, and production notes, and more. Well worth getting for yourself or a friend that like crime dramas.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Forget the contrived ending in an empty city; revel in the performances of two fine actors and the work of one of the most consistently entertaining and rewarding directors working. (As usual plenty of glass, tho not much water.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>In COLLATERAL, Tom Cruise, TOP GUN hunk and LAST SAMURAI swashbuckling hero, has his first Bad Guy role that I can recall as he plays a vicious, cold-blooded assassin-for-hire. Say it ain't so, Tom! Did ex-wife Nicole Kidman suspect his darker side, you think?<br /><br />Here, Jamie Foxx plays Max, a low-achieving Los Angeles cabbie with dreams flogging the PM shift, who picks up Vincent (Cruise), who's just arrived in the city. Ostensibly, as Vincent explains, he's in town to gather overnight five signatures on a real estate deal before flying out the next morning. Vincent offers Max $700 to be his chauffeur for the wee hours before delivering him back to the airport on time. It isn't until Max's first stop, during which a body falls on the windshield of his ride from a fourth story window, that he realizes that perhaps his tip for the gig isn't big enough. Unfortunately, Vincent, with inexorable persuasion, says "drive on", after loading the body into the trunk. As the corpses begin to accumulate at various locales around the city, a street smart cop begins to connect the dots, and the chase is on.<br /><br />During the first two-thirds of the film, Vincent philosophizes about the inescapable presence of politically incorrect Death in the world, and his unremarkable and necessary role as a Grim Reaper. At times, the two men almost seem on the verge of bonding, as when Vincent bails Max out during an over-the-radio dispute with the latter's overbearing boss-dispatcher. And when Max apparently takes Vincent's advice to take the carpe diem thing more seriously than procrastinating his dreams as is his wont. But Max's overriding horror at the night's killing spree wins out.<br /><br />The last third of COLLATERAL degenerates into a typically Tinseltownish Babe-in-Peril-Saved-in-the Nick-of-Time scenario - something that should be suspected during the first 15 minutes, when Max emotionally connects with a fare,  a smart yet engagingly vulnerable Federal prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) who needs to work late at the office prepping for tomorrow's opening of a big case. Now, while there's nothing wrong with that, and it is a nail-biter, it's not consistent with the refreshingly intelligent scripting of what came before. Thus, I can only award 4 stars for a failure to follow through. I must say, however, that the acting by both Cruise and Foxx is superb, and it's difficult to tell which is the Lead and which the Supporting role.<br /><br />Finally, I can unequivocally answer "no" to the last of Vincent's questions posed to Max. I've sometimes looked pretty dead on the Metro ride to work in the morning, and nobody's noticed.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>It started out like any other night. Cab driver Max (Foxx) picks up Vincent (Cruise) who tells him that he has a few stops to make, and offers him $600 to get him to agree. When a body falls out of the first stop and lands on his cab, Max realizes he is in for more than he bargained for. As it turns out, Vincent is a killer for hire who has arrived in Los Angeles to wipe out five people that are causing some trouble for his employer. Max has just become his personal chauffeur for the evening. Vincent's domineering, confident attitude is enough for the most part to keep Max in line. Gradually dragging Max into the "action" also serves to make Max an accomplice of sorts. Vincent also serves as a mentor of sorts, telling him that he needs to get off his butt and take action in his life. In the end, this could be Vincent's downfall, if Max can get it together and make a stand.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by "Collateral". While not action-heavy, the action scenes are very effective. The more pervasive interactions between Max and Vincent are gripping at times, as a strange relationship forms between the two. Cruise's Vincent is a bit of a departure for him, but he fills Vincent's shoes convincingly. Foxx as Max is equally effective as his character gradually develops some strength of character.<br /><br />This is not your typical action movie, but if you like a some thought in your movies, you will not be disappointed. This is a gem in the doldrums of the August box office. Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Michael Mann<br /><br />Max (Jamie Foxx) is a Las Angeles cab driver with dreams of something grander for his life.  His dream, as he tells various fares, is to own his own luxury limo company: Island Limos.  This job of driving a taxi is only temporary, but it is a temporary job that has lasted ten years.  Max is a man who does not step out and take risks in his life.  Into this mundane existence comes yet another fare, Vincent (Tom Cruise).  Vincent offers Max $600 if Max would drive him to five different locations so Vincent can do some business and catch a flight out of town at the end of the day.  While this is against his company's regulations, Max accepts.  $600 is a lot of money for one night's worth of work.<br /><br />When Max brings Vincent to his first stop and a few minutes later a dead body lands on top of Max's taxi, followed by Vincent looking not at all upset or surprised, we know that this evening is taking a turn that Max never anticipated.  Max accuses Vincent of killing the dead guy, but Vincent coldly replies that "the bullets and the fall killed him."  Vincent is a hit man, a paid assassin, and despite Max's protests that this isn't his job, Max will drive Vincent around the city as Vincent kills person after person.  He doesn't have a choice, really.  Vincent has a gun.<br /><br />What is fascinating about this movie is how the relationship between Vincent and Max works.  Despite his chosen profession, Vincent is civil and cultured.  As a character, Vincent comes off as somewhat likeable even though we know he is a bad guy and we have seen him coldly murder.  Yet, there is a certain charm to Vincent, and he treats Max well so long as Max goes along with what Vincent wants.  Vincent suggests that Max will never improve his lot in life until Max himself takes responsibility and does something about it.  There is not a friendship here, but throughout the movie a grudging respect between the two characters build.<br /><br />This respect does not change the fact that Max is being held hostage while Vincent is committing murder.  The viewer can guess in what direction the film is going by the way director Michael Mann ties things together early on in the movie.  He makes a couple of connections (which would give away part of the ending if mentioned directly) which are obviously not coincidence.  We even learn Vincent's unspoken intent by dialogue said by a detective (Mark Ruffalo) investigating that first murder.  Nothing is truly random in this movie, and this goes double for the ending.  "Collateral" is building to this ending, which I felt was fully appropriate, the entire movie and with the exception of a single scene where Vincent becomes the second coming of the T-1000 from "Terminator 2", everything in "Collateral" works for me.  The city itself is a character, giving setting and tone and depth and a sense of place to the film.  While the story could have taken place anywhere, the movie would have had a different feel to it.<br /><br />"Collateral" can be dark and violent, but it is also intelligent and stylish.  This sense of style is not to be confused with the typical Hollywood "slickness", but rather it is Michael Mann giving the film its own feel and look that simply "works".  The whole film does (excluding that one scene I mentioned), and when put together it is better than its parts, and this includes the fantastic performances by Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Michael Mann has proved to be a consistently impressive source of film-making over the last quarter century. Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat and The Insider show him at his most versatile and entertaining and are modern classics in their own right. Despite his efforts, he has not enjoyed the amount of box-office success and recognition he deserves. Collateral, his latest project, made great strides in finally brining Mann to the forefront of modern cinematic directors. Not only is it his most accessible film to date, it strongly showcases his greatest strength of creating an engaging storyline with engaging characters. The two leads are perfectly cast, with Cruise going drastically against type as the remorseless Vincent and Foxx matching him stride for stride as the helpless Max.<br /><br />The two share a unique, strained bond that makes their final showdown both inevitable and gripping. Above it all, Mann's unmistakable flair for his craft shines through. In the hands of a less experienced director, Collateral would have been another run-of-the-mill clich&eacute;d action vehicle. Thanks to the careful hand of Mann and the pitch perfect performances from Cruise and Foxx, it rises above the normal expectations of the genre and comes through as a fresh and original thrill ride. It's truly one of the year's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>Alright, I'm sure you've read other reviews by now...<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays a contract killer out to kill 5 people in<br /><br />one night and uses a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to drive him<br /><br />around.<br /><br />This movie had the potential to be really good... I mean, Cruise<br /><br />and Foxx in a action flick? The problem is that Cruise is abit<br /><br />robotic in his behavior... Perhaps that's part of the point that<br /><br />he is a cold hearted killer..<br /><br />However, he simply wasn't ever fully able to make me believe that<br /><br />he is realistic. His behavior is not consistant... Sometimes he<br /><br />does well, but other times he makes sloppy mistakes that you<br /><br />really wouldn't expect a professional to do.<br /><br />Also, the movie works it's hardest to be completely realistic and<br /><br />that's a blessing in some ways, but in other ways it's a ledown.<br /><br />I do like realistic movies, but not to the point to where it does<br /><br />hurt the action... Until the end, there simply isn't enough action.<br /><br />It's a well acted movie other than Cruise... Jamie does well and<br /><br />the some of the wise cracks and a few scenes were good. It's<br /><br />very close to being a B movie.. And honestly, this movie was a<br /><br />big sign that Cruise is losing his star power because he simply<br /><br />can't hold this movie up.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>Contrary to Amazon's review, there IS a full-length, scene-specific commentary track. Strangely, it is listed nowhere on the packaging. The only way I found out about it was by clicking Audio Options on disc 1, and there you will see the available commentary by Michael Mann, which is dry but informative. Very strange not to promote it - what, are these now going to be like "easter eggs"?? I admit I was pleasantly surprised to find it. The cinematography is sublime, with terrific blues and greens. I've usually disliked any attempt to shoot features on video, but it is employed to perfection here capturing the cab interior and nighttime cityscape of LA beautifully. It is the best example of the format I've ever seen, so it makes me hopeful that future productions (and technology) will get ever closer to the quality of film stock. It is great to see Cruise play evil, maybe his best performace since TJ Mackey in Magnolia. Foxx of course is a total pro. Jada looks utterly gorgeous. I had some problems with the story as it strains plausibility in MANY scenes, but it's a trade-off made acceptable by superb production values.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I just read a long review on Amazon by a reviewer who said some pretty intelligent things about Michael Mann's direction.It made for an interestin read really.Sadly,I havent followed his films but he does manage to raise an important point. The Audioslave track does indeed not match the pace of the film and the time it was played.There was substantial few precious seconds devouted to it though.<br /><br />To deny this film from what it deserves would be criminal.I can safely say Tom Cruise proves himself time and again as one of the best actors time has seen.He will be remembered by someone in the 22nd century as a man of great devoution to what he was good at.Jamie Foxx's character on the other hand was what be a mixture of morality and individuality.There wasnt much of a proportion between the two but he turned into a righteous individualist in the film when it mattered.<br /><br />I must add it's not easy to make such precise paced flicks.There's nothing predictable to me.I quite liked the discussion of reality checks between Foxx and Cruise which made one of them go crazy.Also the discussion of Miles Davis in a jazz bar was more interesting than what I can possibly try and comprehend.<br /><br />All in all,this film would go down in my memory lane as one of the best directed action/thriller films I have seen in a long time.It's not easy to make a film about just one night and spread out in a chain of events leading to one another and making it all look terrificly well done.<br /><br />What I disliked about the film was its limited outlook.No,dont get me wrong because even if I try I couldnt find a flaw in the film that would make me stomp my foot hard.It's just that it perfectly fits the four star grade.<br /><br />And oh yes,Tom Cruise's suit fits him like silver skin.He's a bit of a Terminator 2 villain in this film and I'm sure a lot of people would love to watch this side of the man.<br /><br />Jesus,he even buys flowers...</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>It's diffinately one of the best tom cruise performances I've ever seen. also not forget about jamie foxx as a cab driver. and the atmosphere of the movie, city at night. It was wonderful and it's one of the movies that I can occasionally watch several times without getting bored. let's forget about some scenario problems, but yes, I'm agree with that there were some problems! falling the first victim on the roof of the cab was not a possitive point for a professional assasin. also leaving that imoprtant bag in the cab and getting it back by killing the thievs was rather qustionable! and several same problems... but I can close my eyese to them and say that it was a brilliant movie.<br /><br />Let's have some words about DVD release too. I think they could release it as a single disc special edition DVD cause it has not that much special features for a two disc edition. but release it as a two disc special edition and with a good price & DTS audio track, tantalizing every person not only collector's to buy it! everybody knows that a two disc special edition is more exciting than a single disc even if there is not much on disc 2. thanks to the studio for a good DVD release!</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This was a really good movie and it was all thanks to Jamie Foxx, he stole this show 100% and left Tom Cruise looking confused and gray haired in the background.

Saying to the box, "Why don't you just kill the man?" (refering to max when he throws vincets brief case of evidence including his hit list down upon a busy street from an overpass. The entire film is full of them, the climactic end not sparing either! After being shot in the face he manages to leap frog onto the back of a speeding subtrain. But it's just one of those films. I wouldn't go as far as saying low brow, not with the sometimes engaging conversations, and hilarious dark humor. The cinematography focuses, at its most creative moments, on the lonely nature that lives on the peripheral of the city limits. Showing how close indeed L.A is to the desert. Along the way in following Max (the taxi driver) you cross landmark streets (such as le brea-named after the le brea tar pits), and some of the most notable superstructures in the los angeles area. You can follow the timetable in which the night flows from Max's fare reader and other places in the movie. (such as a subway sign that read "today is january 25,2004. The time 540AM.) The time is referred/displayed 5 times in the movie. See if you can catch them all.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This was a very entertaining thriller.  Tom Cruise is a very fine villain and Jamie Foxx does an even better job as the fish out of water hero.  I don't want to say anything about the plot because it is the movement of that plot from what you are set up to expect to what happens that is the real payoff of the movie.  Jada Pinkett Smith plays the super competent (but anxiety filled) and beautiful prosecuting attorney with a good balance of strength and vulnerability.<br /><br />I have to say that Mark Ruffalo and Peter Berg playing the undercover cops and Bruce McGill as the fed do very good work in unfolding the story in a certain direction.  Javier Bardem has a brief but memorable appearance as the drug king pin Felix.  Well, he is more of a mid-level manager of a drug dealing operation, but you will understand all this after you have seen the flick.<br /><br />Cruise's character, Vincent, is usually a pretty cold - force of nature kind of murderer, but he has his own flaws and manages his progress through the plot without perfection.  Foxx's embodiment of Max is actually quite good.  Max has to undergo not only a transformation, but some self-realization that he has been avoiding for quite awhile.<br /><br />I don't want to say anything about the final act, but I didn't find it as fresh as the middle acts, although it still works in its own way.<br /><br />The extras on the second disk are pretty good and provide good background on the movie including how it was made.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise and especially Jamie Foxx both shine in this hard edged crime thriller, masterfully helmed by Michael Mann (Heat, Manhunter).  For most of it's two hour running time, Collateral combines both an intricate character study and some intense action set pieces that make it a joy to watch, beginning with cool, calm, and calculated hitman Vincent (Cruise) hitching a ride with taxi driver Max (Foxx).  Max has big dreams and grand ideas and little to show for it, something Vincent uses to his advantage as he takes Max hostage to make his rounds of the night which include the executions of five people.  The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is undoubtadly Collateral's strong point, with Foxx giving a knockout performance and Cruise's surprising performance as one of the best screen villains in the past few years.  However, Collateral loses steam as it approaches it's climax when the tables are turned and a cat & mouse game ensues that ends on an MTA train.  Other than that, everything else about Collateral is nearly flawless, and it is definitely one of the best films to be released this year.  The cast also features Jada Pinkett-Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, and look for a cameo in the opening scene from Jason Statham (The Transporter, Cellular, Snatch).</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>One of the best films of the year, and a certain bold move by Tom Cruise, the real star of this vehicle is Jamie Foxx.  It was a good transition film for him going from those silly "Booty Call" type of movies to serious work.  Tom Cruise is great as a villain, an assassin who has an agenda and is relentless in his pursuits.  This film has it all.  Great direction from Micheal Mann, and a moving score.  Star making performance for Foxx.  Great action and some comedy too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>Well worth seeing, more than the usual twists and turns, although I do have to say the ending may be hotly debated by viewers - good or bad? Even so, go see this one to see Tom Cruise departs from his usual &quot;good guy saves the world&quot; persona, playing a hit man who encounters an unwitting cabdriver and makes him part of his game plan.<br /><br /> A solid and riveting movie, with a bit of philosophy thrown in, just enough to keep things from being formulaic, as Cruise and the cabbie debate ethics. Try to see it in a theatre without too many people or distractions so you can give it your full concentrations - and don't buy too much soda. You're not going to want to miss a moment of this one, let alone for a restroom break.<br /><br /> Won't say more, this is one plot that doesn't deserve any spoilers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>In the past few years, I have fallen away from movies with Tom Cruise in them, feeling that he just hasn't been hitting the mark lately.  But under the direction of Michael Mann, Tom Cruise finds his pacing and delivers one of the best performances of his career.  Combine his character with the recent explosion of Jamie Foxx and you have the makings of a great movie.  Both Cruise and Foxx guide COLLATERAL to its explosive conclusion, all the while managing to shed light on their characters and explore real emotion.  I just could not find something not to like about this film while watching it.  The opening sequences are great, the dialogue is superb, and the imagery is extraordinary.  Los Angeles comes alive in COLLATERAL and Mann's picture seems to be a tribute to its scenic locations and nightlife.  I even noticed the quality of the soundtrack, not normally something to which I pay an inordinate amount of attention.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found COLLATERAL interesting because of the depth of its two main characters.  Take Cruise's character, for instance.  I was expecting a typical "hitman" character: no sense of morality, quick-decision maker, etc.  But what we get is someone who brings complexity to his position, someone who seems to develop a friendship & care for the cabdriver who has been ushering him around all night, someone who behind all of the grime has a personal code of ethics.  Of course, at the end of the day he is what he is.  But Cruise manages to squeeze a lot more life into the character than I had expected, particularly in the scenes where we learn about his childhood experiences.  Opposite Cruise stands Foxx, a simple cabdriver who has been putting off his dreams for twelve years, afraid of the commitment and the responsibility.  But he is also a man capable of great heroism and courage, witnessed several times throughout the film in short bursts.<br /><br />What I really loved about COLLATERAL, however, is how it manages to communicate the haphazard nature of life.  The opening sequence is particularly illustrative as Cruise only ends up in Foxx's cab as an accident.  Small decisions in this film have ripple effects that change the course of each characters' life.  This is not a film of fate.  It is a film of personal free will and the chaos of our decisions.  It is a film that preaches agency over the chains of predetermined outcomes.  And it transforms the audience as it transforms its characters.  COLLATERAL is one of Michael Mann's best films to date and an absolute must-see for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Collateral may well be the single most ridiculous and utterly absurd screenplay ever put into production by a major studio in this century. While the inexplicable critical praise for the film might be expected to result in some failure to live up to expectations, this fails on even the most basic levels of construction for the very dumbest of action movies - and this certainly is the dumbest piece of hokum I've seen in the past ten years. I'm simply at a loss as to how anyone could think this thrill-free thriller even a competent piece of drama, let alone a masterpiece.<br /><br />One of the problems with people who make more than one good movie is that we very unreasonably expect them to keep on making good movies instead of just being grateful for what they've given us in the past. So I'll go on being grateful to Mann for Manhunter, Heat, The Insider, The Jericho Mile and Last of the Mohicans (even if he is determined to re-edit the heart out of them if left unchecked) and mark this one down as a paycheck. It's just a shame that, unlike Terrence Malick, nobody set up a trust fund for him so that he wouldn't have to make movies this bad just to pay the bills.<br /><br />The film starts off with a disadvantage - the high concept setup is a hard premise to sell, and the film singularly fails to do so. But instead of going off in the `we know this is stupid, but let's have fun with it' route, instead it tries to play it as serious psychodrama and character piece while offering some of the most ridiculous plotting imaginable.<br /><br />Cruise is supposedly a top of his game hitman, but is the most spectacularly inept killer the screen has ever seen, revealing himself to dozens of witnesses, beating up and shooting people in crowded nightclubs (the film's utter lowpoint) and even accompanying his reluctant chauffeur on a visit to his mother in hospital. Short of taking over a Presidential press conference at gunpoint, it's hard to imagine him drawing more attention to himself in almost every single scene. By the final reel when he turns into an indestructible relentless Tominator stalking the pair, you suddenly start to appreciate the finely crafted plots and elegant dialogue found in the works of Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Olivier Gruner, none of whom have ever descended to such preposterous lows. It's notable that Jason Statham kept his name off the credits in this one, and he had no such qualms over Revolver.<br /><br />By the time the unbelievable coincidence of the passenger Foxx falls for being - shock, horror - the last name on the list is wheeled on, we've sat through so many much more unbelievable coincidences and idiotic lapses in logic and credibility that it almost seems rational. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this is just taking the piss.<br /><br />Not that faulty suspension is the only thing wrong with this vehicle. None of the individual scenes ever convince or work on their own terms, with every development or line of dialog not just horribly telegraphed but practically written in the sky. Characterization is equally facile and predictable, with only vague moments hinting at possibilities glossed over en route to the next botched setpiece. The performances are variable: Cruise, Foxx, Javier Bardem and, most surprisingly, Jada Pinkett Smith are fine but not outstanding, but Mark Ruffalo becomes increasingly laughable as it becomes ever clearer that the depth of his characterization extends to doing a not very good John Travolta/Chilli Palmer impersonation.<br /><br />I take no pleasure in writing off this utter trainwreck of a movie. There could have been a good little straight-to-video movie in this, but the end result is a completely unacceptable piece of junk that goes straight into my All-time Ten Worst list. Garbage.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>I toyed with several titles, based on the overall quality of the film, as well as the subject matter: "Driving Mr. Crazy" because of Vincent's sociopathic nature, "Cabbies, Beware! The Next Fare May Be Your Last," or "Blonds DO HAVE more fun," in reference to Cruise's hair in the film.<br /><br />However, when I think about the total package, I could only see a film of which Sir Alfred would give his seal of approval. Like "Strangers on a Train," "Collateral" bonds two men from different worlds together, one unaware that he is about to be the "accomplice" in the other's night of murder for hire. Hitchcock in "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and "North by Northwest" did the aspect of the innocent man drawn into a world of intrigue and crime. Mann casts Foxx as the innocent and the director draws brilliant performances from both actors as they "play" off each other like old friends.<br /><br />Also, Mann, like Alfred, understands how the look is essential to the success of the film. The movie's setting, Los Angeles, takes on a part of its own, simultaneously looking both menacing and captivating. Only San Francisco in Hitchcock's "Vertigo" looked more alluring.<br /><br />The score by James Newton Howard, as well as the use of popular songs, is another fine element that Mann incorporates in this engaging thriller. Hitchcock, too, relied on music to tell his stories.<br /><br />The second disc features a fascinating "Making of..." documentary wherein the viewer gets an in-depth look at the very meticulous Mr. Mann.<br /><br />I would love to see Cruise, Foxx, and Pinkett-Smith in another film together, helmed by Michael Mann. Maybe, they can do a remake of "North by Northwest", with Cruise in the James Mason role, Foxx as Cary Grant's character, and Pinkett-Smith as the cool "blonde" played by Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />Hey, it's just a thought!</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Two men are about to cross paths unknowing of what consequences they will have upon each other.  Max (Jamie Foxx) is dreamer that has worked as a cab driver for 12 years while awaiting the moment when he has enough capital to invest in a Limousine company that will offer the ultimate ride for its passengers.  When fares begin to converse with Max he often brings up his vision of the Limo company, and one evening at the airport he meets a stunningly beautiful lawyer, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith).  On their way to Annie's destination they begin to chat about music, her job, and his dreams, which eventually leads to Annie offering him her card as a token that she wants to see him again.<br /><br />Bewildered in his thoughts Max remains seated in the cab after Annie has left when a new fare asks if the cab is taken, which breaks the spell on him.  The passenger in due time reveals his name as Vincent (Tom Cruise) while he probes Max of who he is, and then he tells Max that he has five stops to make and he can make $600 if he stays with him.  Hesitant Max considers the offer, however, Vincent appears as a tough negotiator as he pushes the money into his hand while telling that these offers do not happen often.  Max takes the money and parks in the alley where he begins to eat his supper while thumbing a Mercedes brochure.  However, this is the peaceful moment before the storm that is about to enter Max's life and turn it upside down.<br /><br />Vincent has a cynical outlook on life that is heavily influenced by Darwinistic thinking and possibly Nietzsche as he believes that man has to seize the day, or the man might perish.  The moment of existence is now, not later, if one waits one misses an opportunity to make the most of the current situation.  This is what Vincent's life philosophy boils down to as he brings Max on an existential journey.  The two venture to a jazz club where Vincent and Max sit down and listen to the spontaneous jamming by the band on the stage.  Vincent wonders if Max can hear the sudden surprise that lays within the music, but Max is too preoccupied with his internal fear to give the music any thought.  At the end of the evening at the jazz club the cab driver and the passenger talk with Daniel, the owner and a musician, who recollects the moment when Miles Davis entered the club and how he missed his opportunity as a musician.<br /><br />When Max and Vincent are between destinations Max receives a message over the radio that his mother is anxiously wondering about his whereabouts, as she is hospitalized and he visits her every evening.  Slightly amused over the situation Vincent looks at his watch and says that they have time for a quick stop.  When they enter the hospital Vincent reminds Max that his mother carried him in her uterus for nine months, and he must bring her flowers for which Vincent pays.  When they arrive to the room where Max's mother rests she continuously criticizes him while speaking softly and kindly to Vincent, which appears to be very difficult for Max.  It is evident to Vincent that Max never attempts to take the step from dream to reality, as Max seems to be preoccupied by insecurities and fears of failure, which seems rooted in Max's relationship to his mother.<br /><br />In Seventh Seal (1957) Ingmar Bergman offers some insights to our existence as Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) plays a prolonged chess match with the Grim Reaper.  Collateral works in a similar manner as Seventh Seal.  Max is the guide to the destinations, as Block did in Seventh Seal, while Vincent is the person that follows much like the Grim Reaper.  Maybe it is far fetched to say that Collateral compares to the masterpiece Seventh Seal, however, the similarities are there in regards to existentialism.  The question is whether Max will learn anything from Vincent while visiting the five different destinations.<br /><br />Michael Mann's Collateral is a solid cinematic experience that depicts serious philosophy through an action packed thriller.  The cast's performances provide genuine feel for who characters are, maybe the scene when Max pretends to be Vincent as he talks to Felix (Javier Bardem) is a little over the top, but it turns out to be one of those cool scenes where no one can get hurt.  The long opening before Max meets Vincent displays Mann's cunningness in direction as this provides a strong foundation that develops strong characters, which is needed for this story.  However, Mann does not reach the same level with Collateral as he did with Heat (1995) and The Insider (1999), yet he touches something deeper with this film as he dwells on existentialism and carpe diem.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise was very interesting to watch in a real bad guy role, but the movie just didn't keep up with him.  The chance occurrence regarding two random fares in a taxi winding up having very much to do with each other is ridiculous.  Having the taxi driver pretend to be a hit man and getting away with it was another incident that left credibility behind, as well as the insertion of the mother into the film.  This film was an excuse to portray Tom Cruise in a particularly nasty role, but that was just not enough of a reason to sit through it, at least not for me . .</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>This is a real sleeper. Literally. One of the worst "hitman" type flicks ever created. One of the worst movies of the year, and probably the worst flick Kidman's ex ever made.<br /><br />It's no wonder it came and went in a week in the local cinemas. Pick up "The Replacement Killers" or "The Big Hit" - even "Grosse Point Blank" (or all three!), but don't get this bomb. Save the money.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>From the outside, this movie doesn't seem like it would have very much "meat" to it.  Tom Cruise gets his chance to play a bad guy, and he puts in one of his better performances.  He plays a hitman who needs a ride.  As I suppose most hitmen would be, he's tempermental and invokes his own brand of ethics in order to justify his actions.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx portrays a run-of-the-mill Joe Nobody cab driver who gets caught picking up the "wrong" passenger.  Kind of wrong place / wrong time - squared.  As viewers, we end up putting ourselves in his place, and the result is quite a psychological thriller.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed Michael Mann movies & would not mind his making more films.  His works always bring an "intensity" to the table not normally found too often in most other films.  If you feel like being taken for a ride tonight, you can do a lot worse than COLLATERAL!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>I'm still surprised how much I enjoyed Collateral.  Generally I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, and my previous Jamie Foxx film experience was only Booty Call(I've since seen Ray).  The only reason I watched this movie was that Michael Mann directed it.<br /><br />I'll have to admit that the premise was intriguing to say the least, but ultimately the back and forth banter between Cruise & Fox is what elevated this film into a nerve wracking, white knuckle suspense ride; halfway through you're not sure if you're strapped in properly, but you don't care, because what's going down on screen is so damn cool.  I actually found myself wishing I'd seen this in theaters.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the viewing experience.<br /><br />The level of cruelty and violence Cruise's assassin displays was altogether unexpected.  It's absurd and flinch worthy, almost cartoony at times, but it always is presented with flair and style.  In fact the whole movie comes off as something you might see in a graphic novel.  Pretty cool stuff to see get Hollywood backing.<br /><br />Also, as a very nice added bonus feature you get the incredibly beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith (that Fresh Prince is one heckuva lucky guy) as the damsel in distress.<br /><br />When all is said and done what you get is a witty action/drama that never seems to let up.  I imagine any taxi driver after seeing this film became very wary of picking up white haired Caucasians.  That alone is hilarious enough to make me recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>This movie has a cool vibe to it and is so much fun when you watch it because it's so simple and not confusing.Tom Cruise is a hitman {You should see how he kills in this movie} and Jamie Foxx has a really bad night for picking him up in the first place.

His 80s' MTV style resonates even in this new millenium, and he manages to combine his trademark action elements with satisfying performances from his two leads.  First of all, though, I have to comment on Jamie Foxx's performance.  In his Oscar winning portrayal of Ray Charles, Foxx WAS Ray Charles, and one had a hard time believing he was acting.  In COLLATERAL, he is obviously acting; his nuances and mannerisms are trademark acting---good and solid, but his nomination for supporting actor leaves me wondering if this performance deserved that accolade, particularly in light of his shooin for Best Actor.  Certainly there were other actors out there (Liev Schrieber in Manchurian Candidate; Alfred Molina in Spiderman 2, for example) who should have had Foxx's spot in the supporting category.  Anyway, while Jamie does well in this role, I found myself more mesmerized with Tom Cruise.  As a legitimate superstar, Cruise has not taken the comfortable route by doing roles that appeal to his audience or do not challenge him.  In COLLATERAL, he takes the risk of being an extremely cold, unlikeable killer, with no redeeming qualities.  His hair sleek and silver, behind those Raybans, Cruise oozes menace and is one of his most interesting performances.  His physical dexterity, his cold steely glare intensify his performance, and it's to his credit that he shares so much of the movie with Foxx.  COLLATERAL ultimately is a twisted "buddy movie," although the bonding is definitely not one of choice but of necessity.  I had a hard time believing a cabbie could change so quickly and outsmart a suave professional hit man, but cinematic rules dictated this heroic twist.  Jada Pinkett Smith is cool in a small but pivotal role; Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg and Bruce McGill offer solid support in standard roles; and catch the cameos of Javier Bardem as Felix and Jason Stratharn as the man Cruise bumps into in the opening scene.<br /><br />COLLATERAL works on many levels and I enjoyed it, although its rather despondent ending only reinforces Cruise's assertation that death is so common in LA that one might not even notice someone is dead.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>This was an extremely cliche movie about a killer (Tom Cruise) who forced his cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to become his designated driver for the evening so he could kill people. The movie was so terribly cliche that for about twenty minutes of it, I got up and dusted and vacuumed with the movie still going. I added a new vacuum bag, came back, and the movie was still as boring as it had been for the past 45 minutes.  The only interesting parts were when Jada Pinkett came in.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>There are some great things about COLLATERAL.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is phenominal in his performance. His techniques. The work he has done to look like a trained killer is fantastic. You believe he is who he says he is and you forget about the fact that he is Tom Cruise very quickly.<br /><br />The production value is fantastic. Throughout the movie, the camera lets the action do the talking. Fight scenes and shootings are done with MINIMAL to NO EDITING. You see the action go down as you would if you were standing on the streets of Los Angeles along with them.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are a lot of problems with Collateral. Plotting problems. Realism problems. Acting problems.<br /><br />This movie IS BASED in REALITY. This is supposed to be REAL. This isn't a Schwarzenegger movie where otherworldly things happen, and Jamie Foxx is certainly no JOHN McCLANE (Die Hard) or JOHN RIGGS (Lethal Weapon).  So, when Jamie Foxx turns the tables on a L.A. street cop when he's about to be cuffed? Whoa. This guy is a cabbie.<br /><br />Not to mention when he goes into a den of thugs upon Vincent's (Cruise) orders and is told what to say... he manages to come up with his own words??  GOOD ONES. Even threatening to kill one of the thugs. As if... maybe... he were no stranger to the crime game. As if he maybe had a little psychotic hitman in him... it was pretty unrealistic for a guy who was inspiring to be a CHAUFFER driver for celebrities.<br /><br />At one point, there is a HIT going down in a nightclub. A Chinese mafia-type is being guarded by numerous bodyguards. So when the stuff starts going down... FIVE MINUTES LATER, this Chinese mafia-type guy is still sitting in the same place!!  Seemingly frozen in his seat. Only when the gun is finally trained on his head do his guards attempt to get him to a safe location.<br /><br />Actually, this could have been a decent movie, but honestly, about midway things really started getting hard to believe, hard to accept and DID I FORGET TO MENTION THE COINCIDENCES that lead up to the ending... that was again... disappointing and unrealistic.<br /><br />Finally, I know that Jamie Foxx is a very good actor. He proved that in RAY.  But in Collateral, I didn't like his performance. For a guy who is being held against his will, at gun point, forced to participate in murders, forced to watch murders, forced to carry bodies... he never sold me. His emotions never went far enough.<br /><br />It seemed to me... that maybe murders, dead guys in trunks and people getting shot wasn't anything new to an L.A. cab driver. If that's what they were trying to get across, then maybe the objective was achieved.<br /><br />I personally, would have liked to have seen more emotion and more desperation out of him.  Foxx was sorta bland.<br /><br />Collateral is an okay movie that could have been much better had the writers figured a better way to keep things realistic and not so cliche.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>What a year for Jamie Foxx! Not only he delivered an unbelievable performance in "Ray", but also, in a completely different genre, he shines in the role of Max, a cab driver in a less than agreeable situation. Besides having Foxx, this movie counts with the always-dependable Tom Cruise, an action packed and intense script and interesting cinematography.<br /><br />Max is a grinder who drives a cab for a living and dreams with having his own limo business and spending his holidays in his perfect island. He is a nice guy, likes to talk with his customers and generates a sense of trust in everyone he meets. After driving a glamorous prosecutor to her offices, Max gets Vincent (Cruise) as his ride, a guy that offers a considerable amount of money to rent the cab for the night. Even though it is illegal to do this, Max is too tempted to refuse, and thus his torment begins.<br /><br />Things get interesting after the first stop, when a body falls from the sky on top of the cab and Max realizes that Vincent is a killer for hire. As expected, Max tries to get away, offering Vincent the car and promising not to say anything, but that does not fly. From that moment on we embark on a thrilling ride, but one that is surprisingly different from the typical action movie, because we get to take a real look into the psyche of the two main characters. This makes the movie really interesting and the good vs. bad guy line gets a little blurry.<br /><br />This intense psychological thriller delivers what it promises, a fair amount of entertainment, and more. The fact that towards the end, the action turns a little bit over the top is not a huge drawback. Another positive feature this film has in addition to Foxx and Cruise is the presence of Javier Bardem, the Spaniard actor, who shows that he can grant proof of his talent in just a couple of scenes. This is definitely one of the best action movies of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Nominated for two Academy Awards, Collateral is an electrifying, high-energy drama about a paid assassin who kidnaps a cab driver in order to carry out his work. With a high quality performance by Jamie Foxx, Collateral is a movie that draws viewer interest with relative ease. Tom Cruise turns in an outstanding performance as the noted hit man, and Jada Pinkett Smith enjoys one of her most notable performances as a high profile lawyer. One of the most action-packed movies of 2004, Collateral is an unforgettable glimpse into the world of professional assassins. You won't want to miss it...<br /><br />Los Angeles taxicab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) is an easy to get along with guy, a guy with big dreams of owning his own company and vacationing on a beautiful Caribbean island. When he picks up an unusually beautiful fare, an attorney named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), the two hit it off real well. Before Annie leaves, she hands Max her card and the two agree to go out on a date later. However, Max's next fare has other ideas in mind...<br /><br />When Max picks up the silver-haired, well-dressed Vincent, he thinks he's got himself just another paying customer. But Max is actually a highly trained professional hit man, and he wants to utilize Max's services for the entirety of the night - as he takes out each of his allotted victims. Regardless of the money flashed in his face, Max doesn't want anything to do with the killings, but Vincent threatens to kill Max if he doesn't comply.<br /><br />The result is a night in which Vincent methodically carries out his hits, while Max becomes human collateral, used by Vincent in a war between the drug cartel going before a grand jury in federal court and the only witnesses who can take the cartel down. As Vincent commits each of his killings, the police follow up with an investigation of their own. Slowly, they put the pieces together. Past killings similar in nature occurred in LA in years past and were always topped off by a dead cab driver at the end of the evening. As the cops chase after them, the fate of both Vincent and Max become intertwined. By means of Vincent's manipulations, Max becomes a tool who's enlisted to act in other capacities besides driving.<br /><br />As the night wears on, and Vincent approaches the conclusion of his killing spree, the identity of his last victim becomes glaringly clear... Annie, a federal prosecutor working diligently on the drug cartel's indictment, is the final hit on Vincent's list. Now separated from each other, Max must hunt down Vincent and put an end to his killing before he takes out Annie...<br /><br />Wrought with suspense and a number of high-energy action sequences, Collateral is an enjoyable film. The blood and gore is not excessive, and the violence is tempered with comic relief and the interesting banter and evolving relationship between Vincent and Max. And the onscreen relationship between the two characters makes for a great movie. With some the best performances of Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise's respective careers, Collateral is a definite must-see film...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>A take-off on the movie - THE JACKAL - with Bruce Willis -<br /><br />Tom Cruise as a hit man just does not pull it off.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx was decent as the troubled cab-driver.<br /><br />Plenty of action - fairly fast paced --- but what ever happened to the police?

Coming off three grandiose epics in a row, the veteran filmmaker shifts gears with this lean, no-nonsense movie that harkens back to early films in his career like, Thief. Like the late Stanley Kubrick (of whom Mann is sometimes compared to), Mann has tried repeatedly to breakthrough to a mainstream audience. It would make sense then that he would cast Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise as one of the main protagonists. If there were any actor on the planet that could guarantee a sure-fire hit at the box office it would be Cruise. However, Mann throws a potential spanner in the works by casting the actor as an amoral hit man. Would this scare off a mainstream audience?<br /><br />The first disc features an informative audio commentary track by director Michael Mann. The veteran filmmaker really did his homework as he talks about the realistic details used in the background of scenes and with various characters. He also talks at length about the characters' backstories and motivations.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with "City of Night: The Making of Collateral," a 41-minute look at how this film came together and was made. There is also footage of Tom Cruise training with a weapons expert so that he could credibly portray a professional assassin on screen. This is a step up above the usual electronic press kit material.<br /><br />"Special Delivery" takes a look at some of the research Cruise did for this role. In order to get into character, Mann disguised the actor as FedEx delivery man and had him deliver a package to a business in a crowded place and not get recognized. Included is actual footage of Cruise in action.<br /><br />There is one deleted scene with commentary by Mann. It shows Vincent and Max going into LAX to lose the police and federal surveillance that is tracking them.<br /><br />"Shooting on Location: Annie's Office" examines the use of high-definition digital video used to capture Vincent stalking Annie in her darkened office at night. It is a scene that would have been impossible to render on traditional film.<br /><br />"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx Rehearse" gives a glimpse into the creative process as we see footage of the two actors reading through a scene in Mann's office, juxtaposed with the final scene in the movie.<br /><br />"Visual FX: MTA Train" shows how Mann used a green screen effect on the climatic sequence on the train so that he could customize the backgrounds to suit his vision.<br /><br />Finally, there are cast and crew biographies and extensive production notes.<br /><br />Collateral is a fitting addition to Michael Mann's distinctive filmography. It continues his thematic pre-occupations of isolated protagonists who have little time for personal relationships. It is also deals with another Mann obsession: transformation. In order to have any chance of surviving the night with Vincent, Max must change from being a passive character to one that takes an active role in determining his own fate. It is the exploration of such weighty themes, coupled with Mann's distinctive style that elevates Collateral from its generic conventions.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>Can it be?  OK--he was pretty good in Risky Business and I don't remember seeing him in Eyes Wide Shut but otherwise, Tom Cruise doesn't move me.  The phony smile, the clenched hands...I dunno.<br /><br />But everyone is good in Collateral.  (The hispanic guy who plays the drug lord is fabulous).  The plot has just enough originality, some realistic dialog and even a clever and almost plausible twist at the end.<br /><br />Although not very insightful the exchanges in the cab make it play like a play but with a movie ending.  Certainly not 5 stars but you could do far worse.  Maybe this is our reward for suffering through Vanilla Sky and Magnolia.<br /><br />Next Summer, I hope to see Jamie Foxx driving a bulletproof limo in Collateral II.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>"O' Oscar, Where Art Thou?" is a phrase that Hollywood super-star Tom Cruise has become all too familiar with, especially as of late. Ever since his break out in Risky Business, a film, as good as it may be, is hardly Oscar material, Cruise has made numerous attempts to take home the golden statuette by taking on roles in such high-profile dramas as Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky, and Magnolia, only to come up nearly empty handed (he received Best Actor nominations for his roles in Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia). But his last two films (Minority Report and The Last Samurai), quite possibly the best chances at an Oscar nod in years based on critical as well as public acceptance, failed to produce even a nomination. Does this affect his career, let alone his own self-esteem for his craft? Hardly! Cruise continues to take risks as an actor, which includes performing in a role that doesn't suite his personality: the villain.<br /><br />The story centers on an ordinary man living in the big city just trying to make a decent living as a cab driver until one day he picks up the wrong guy at the wrong time and becomes embroiled in a situation he never could have imagined. For twelve years Max has been a cab driver in the city of Los Angles, a position that he envisioned would only be temporary until he saved up enough money to start his own limo service, one that would be like a "club experience", but some things in life don't always work out the way we envision them. Take for instance, one night Max picks up a man named Vincent, a person who one would describe as well put together, who "hires" him to drive him around to five locations that night for double the amount of money he would normally make in a single night. Max, believing him to be a decent hardworking guy, agrees to the deal only to shockingly discover that his occupant is actually a contract killer sent by a narco-trafficking cartel to eliminate five individuals, both witnesses and prosecutors, involved in a federal grand jury trial set to take place the next day. Though Max tries everything in his capacity, which, at times, can be quite limited, to escape, Vincent forces him at gun-point to drive him around to each location. As the increasingly distressing night drags on, Vincent and Max become more dependent on each other and begin to reveal within themselves aspects of life they never once considered before - aspects that will change the course of their own lives forever. The story for Collateral is not all that complex and, in a sense, remains fairly predictable from beginning to end but the way Michael Mann successfully blends an intoxicating atmosphere with sympathetic characters and brilliantly choreographed action sequences, that feel neither drawn-out nor short-lived, that make it the most fascinating storylines this season.<br /><br />One of the most striking aspects about the film is the way the filmmakers allow a small group of performers to carry the entire feature without missing a beat. Though several background characters are brought in and out throughout the film's two hour time length, they are, in essence, meaningless to the audience as many of the main actions occurring on screen primarily affect the relationship between Vincent and Max, played brilliantly by Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Tom Cruise, who is better known on the big screen for playing the hero rather then the villain, could have been disastrous had he ended up like most actors who break their usual mold, but he demonstrates that he's just as good, or even better, being bad. The grey-haired, clean-cut Vincent may seem intelligent and even debonairish in certain respects, which makes the character all the more enticing, much in the same way Anthony Hopkins portrayed Hannibal Lecter ... a person so interesting and majestic that you can't help but root for him at times, though in your heart you know should be hating his guts. The other reason the character works so well is the way his acts and reacts with the character of Max the cab driver, played by Jamie Foxx. The film starts off with Max as the weak-willed, cautious pawn in the grand master-plan that he can't control, but as time goes on and their conversations become more and more profound, his personality changes in such dramatic fashion that it snaps the audience's moral compass back in line by having them root for the man they should be interested in from the beginning.<br /><br />Overall, Collateral started like any other film and could have ended up the disaster it should have been (based on the clear-cut final sequence it finished with) but its impressive cast, tense atmosphere, brutal violence, and, more importantly, its austere message make this film the sleeper hit of the summer. The ending is not disappointing in the sense that is flat or uninteresting but rather that if one figures out early on that Jada Pinkett-Smith's appearance in the film is more then just a mere cameo (if you caught the appearances on the late-night talk shows, this should be a given to you), the way the film wraps-up isn't all that surprising. But this hardly deters the audience from having an enjoyable experience none the less. The aspect, one that literary wizards will adore, that sets Collateral apart from other thrillers is the Richard III-ish affect it has on the reactions of the audience. Early on, we should be hating Vincent, a man who viciously kills people without any second thought, but the character is ten times more interesting then Max, who comes off as a cautious neat-freak rather then a hero, that we are easily attracted to him and, dare it be said, root for him even though we know deep inside that we should be loathing his actions. Only when the real hero emerges in Max and he finally begins to escape the precarious shell he has kept himself in do we begin to shift our attention to the person that deserves it the most. Collateral's message, one that is hammered further and further into the minds of movie-goers as the story unfolds, that life should be lived to its fullest and one should take advantage of every minute of every day. This may sound simple and even clich&eacute;d but once you've seen this film, it's easier to understand and therefore take to heart once you've exit the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Collateral" is brilliant! This is Tom Cruise's best movie and performance of his career, and is also Jamie Foxx's best movie and performance of his career. Michael Mann's direction is brilliant and this is his best movie ever since "Heat" (1995). Tom Cruise plays Vincent and Jamie Foxx plays Max, whose lives are changed in just one night. Vincent is an assassin hired to kill 5 witnesses in one night and he pays Max $600 to drive him around to the places he needs to go to and an extra $100 to bring him to the airport. Tom Cruise has never done a character like this, until now, and I still like him, because he is a likable guy and has played likable characters. It was a challenge for me to decide, whether or not, that I liked Vincent, but I did, though, even if, he is a bad guy, in some senses of the word "bad". Rounding out the cast is Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, one of the 5 witnesses that Vincent has been hired to kill, Mark Ruffalo as Fanning & Peter Berg as Richard Weidner, two cops who are involved in the case. Bruce McGill as Pedrosa, An FBI agent who is also involved in the case. Irma P. Hall as Ida, Max's mother, & Barry Shabaka Henley as Daniel, another one of the 5 witnesses that Vincent has been hired to kill. They are excellent and well motivated. Stuart Beattie's story and screenplay is brilliant and well written and also well crafted. The music by James Newton Howard is excellent and well synthesized. There is also additional music by Antonio Pinto, Tom Rothrock & Zachary Koretz, which is also excellent and well synthesized. The cinematography by Dion Beebe & Paul Cameron is brilliant and well shot. 80% of the film was shot on digital video, which makes it looks better. The film editing by Jim Miller & Paul Rubell is excellent. The casting by Francine Maisler is excellent. The production design by David Wasco (who production designed "Kill Bill Volume 1" (2003) & "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) is brilliant and well designed. The art direction by Daniel T. Dorrance is brilliant and well crafted. The set decoration by Sandy Reynolds-Wasco (who decorated the sets for "Kill Bill Volume 1" (2003) & "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) is brilliant and well decorated. The costume design by Jeffrey Kurland (who designed the costumes recently this year for "Hidalgo" (2004) is excellent. The hair and make-up on Tom Cruise's Vincent is brilliant and at times, you can't hardly recognize that it is Tom Cruise. This is a well crafted and well made movie with Oscar written all over it. Tom Cruise (Best Actor), Jamie Foxx (Best Supporting Actor), Michael Mann (Best Director), Stuart Beattie (Best Original Screenplay), James Newton Howard (Best Original Score), Dion Beebe & Paul Cameron (Best Cinematography), & David Wasco (Sandy Reynolds-Wasco & Daniel T. Dorrance) (Best Art Direction - Set Decoration), are potential Oscar nominees for next year's Oscars. This is an mesmerizing masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>When a normal taxi cab driver winds up with a hired assassin you would think it would be non-stop action for the whole film.  Yet it is not, and that is one of the great aspects of this movie.  Jamie Foxx plays the average guy, a taxi cab driver with hopes and dreams that he understands will never be his.  Cruise plays the calm yet calculating killer who is just trying to get a job done.  We can relate to Fox's character the most, but, like Reservoir Dogs, redemption is the theme here. Redemption in the sense that both characters try to explain to each other, and themselves, why they do what they do only to get a better understanding of their mediocre life.  Both are given the power to change their life, but the story is really whether one will.<br /><br />The director, Michael Mann, adds to the story with offbeat camerawork, including a lot of hand held shots used with a lesser quality camera.  This gives the movie a more distinctive feel, while the great music overtones Cruise's and Foxx's characters life with mellow serenity.  Actually my favorite part is not the action, yet instead it is the three or so minutes where Michael Mann just does some beautiful shots, all while an Audioslave song, Shadow of the Sun, plays over.  Michael Mann repeats that same kind of filming later too.<br /><br />In summary, Collateral, is not too quick action wise, has very little "gore", and has no twists in it.  That is because this is a more intelligently done action film, with great characters, cinematography, and a beautiful score.  I feel that Collateral is definitely deserved of some Oscars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Jaime Foxx, you are the man!  What a performance. First, he comes across as the articulate, smooth -operator taxi driver.  Knows the routes into, around and out of LA, and can guesstimate the amount of time it will take for the drive. It doesn't appear he is wrong at all. Then, he loves his momma. And, as a man driven literally by a madman he is able to fulfill the role of a hero.<br /><br />Tom Cruise first appears as a sophisticated older man with grey hair and an air of a man on the make. It doesn't take long before we forget the color of his hair. It is the action of his gun and his stance and his body movements, all together, that make this man look deadly and menacing.<br /><br />Jada Pinckett Smith has a small role, but she is able in this amount of time to let us know she is a beautiful, intelligent woman who understands who she is and what she wants.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo plays a local LA Detective. He knows and understands "something" isn't right about the 3-4 deaths coming into the morgue on this night- all the bullets from the same gun. And, then the taxi- the same type of scene heard before with 4 unanswered deaths and now this taxi man.  Wait, wait, Max the taxi driver isn't the man!<br /><br />"Collateral" directed by Michael Mann is an action movie, beautifully photographed by hand-held cameras. Always moving, always studied and superb.  The story is that of a hired gun, a hitman, and in this instance hired to kill all involved in some sort of trial. The high tech communicatopn of the "hits" is amazing. As the movie proceeds, Tom Cruise, as Vincent, first hires Max, Jamie Foxx, to drive him to his five destinations, then Demands he drive. Max begins to understand his role after the first murder and tries valiantly to stop this madness and get away. Vincent is cruel- he knows his job and he will stop at nothing.<br /><br />The action is fast, the soundtrack is brilliant, and I was so disappointed to learn the sound tract was not recorded.  All in all, this is the movie that .I will remember as Jamie Foxx becomes his character. There is "Ray", of course, but this role as Max, the taximan is Jamie as I will remember him.<br />Highly recommended. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx show off their acting talents in a movie with an unlikely premise and an even more unlikely conclusion.  Foxx is a N.Y. cabdriver whose customer just happens to be a beautiful female attorney who just happens to give him her phone number, a move which happens to figure prominently in the plot later on.  Cruise is a hired killer who decides that Foxx will drive him from hit to hit, much against Jamie's will.  Murder and mayhem may keep the viewer's attention but when the dust clears it's obvious that the basic premise is so unlikely that it spoils the overall effect of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>This movie is a total guy movie, and that is not a slam or anything but the truth.  If your man loved movies such as "Bad Boys 1 &2," "Enemy of the State," "Mission Impossible," or any other high action movies, then "Collatoral" will be for them.  I watched this film with my husband.  I admit the film was good, but awefully predictable at times.  He was very disapointed when before the movie even got started good I revealed plot twists.  It could be that because I am a writer I had a keen insight of how the story would unfold.  Anyway, it was a good movie and Tom Cruise played a really good bad guy and it was interesting to see Jamie Foxx not being cool or a tough guy, he was fantastic as a humble cab driver.  I enjoyed this film.  There was a lot of action, it was high paced, and exciting at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>COLLATERAL, director Michael Mann's most recent film, is not only a nail-bitingly tense thriller (especially in its final half hour), but also a fascinating study of two characters, contract killer Vincent (Tom Cruise) and cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx), who, as screenwriter Stuart Beattie subtly and slyly reveals, had grander ambitions as younger men but have had to settle for something much less. Max, especially, has dreams of eventually owning his own limo service and striking it rich---but he's been dreaming about that for the twelve years he's been driving a cab.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film a lot, but I will concede that I probably liked it more for its ambition than for its execution. To be hypercritical, for example, I suppose that in the end this human angle to the characters---the conversations Vincent and Max have while the latter is taken hostage by the former take on existentialist, "what-is-our-purpose-in-life" tones, though never as pretentious or preachy as it may sound---doesn't really lead anywhere, that they're all just little details to add spice to what is otherwise a rather standard thriller. The moody final shots of the film, for me, don't sum up any of the character themes Mann throws into the picture, as fraught with meaning as they outwardly seem.<br /><br />Still, better to have involving human characters that spout convincing dialogue rather than just another high-tech thriller with loud shootouts and bombastic chase scenes to cover for a neglect for the human factor. And it helps that the performances are, for the most part, quite effective. In the case of Jamie Foxx, it is much more than that. His touching performance as Max truly brings sympathy to his character, who is not only Vincent's victim but perhaps a victim of his own delusions of grandeur. (In a few small ways, I think Foxx's quiet, unassuming turn here might be slightly more memorable than his more outwardly impressive portrayal of Ray Charles in the recent RAY.) As for Tom Cruise, I was generally able to accept him as the steely bad guy Vincent, but a better actor might have brought more convincing menace and gravitas to the role. Still, Cruise pulls off this casting-against-type reasonably well...and besides, now that I think about it, perhaps COLLATERAL is more about Max than it is about Vincent. Who doesn't dream big against all reason once in a while? Max is who we relate to in this film, who we root for, who really involves us emotionally.<br /><br />In short, COLLATERAL may not be a truly great film, but it is a good one that works as an effective suspense thriller and as a character study. These two sides may not totally mesh together to produce a convincing whole vision, but I would take this kind of ambitious, intelligent movie over a soulless Hollywood thriller "product" any day. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>If I could, I would probably give this movie 3 and a half stars.  It was good, but I'm not sure if it merits 4 whole stars, but it does deserve more than 3.<br /><br />So, Jamie Foxx is Max, an L.A. "part-time" (if 12 years can be considered part-time) cabbie who dreams of starting a limo service.  Tom Cruise is Vincent, a creepy contract killer who recruits Max to be his chauffeur for the night.  Vincent gives Max $600 and tells him that he has five stops to make, and then LAX.  If Max is a good driver, he'll give him an extra $100 in tips.  Vincent tells Max that he is in real estate and needs to get some signatures and visit some friends.  However, after the body of the first target falls onto Max's cab, Vincent kidnaps him and forces him to help him out or die defying him.<br /><br />The actors were both very good at portraying their characters, but it was the movie's score and camerawork that made it truly effective.  The music playing in the background was very good at either complimenting a certain scene, or providing a good contrary to the situation.  For example, while we are waiting for Vincent to kill his first victim, Max is listening to classical music, and it continues all the way until the body lands on the cab.  Also, the movie was shot in a "home movie" style, meaning that it was very unsteady and moved with the action.<br /><br />Sadly, the only major twist is easily guessed five minutes into the film, but the movie is still enjoyable.  While not the greatest movie I've ever seen, this is definitely the best I've seen in a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Michael Mann's latest is one of the best films I've seen this year, so far. From start to finish, Mann's direction doesn't miss a beat and for a two-hour long film, his pacing remains consistent. I never looked at my watch to see how long I've been in the theater from the moment the film began. Even in The Return of the King I glanced down at my watch once or twice.<br /><br />When it was first announced that Tom Cruise will be starring in Collateral many thought right away that he will be the good guy character. It was quite a surprise to most once they heard that he was going to be the villain instead. Even the announcement that Jamie Foxx was cast in the good guy role instead didn't do much to lessen the impact of Cruise being cast as the heavy. Whatever reservations people might have had about Tom Cruise pulling off being a villain in a film should stop worrying.<br /><br />Tom Cruise pulls it off and I must say that this has to be the best work he's done since Magnolia. That's how good Cruise was in Collateral. His portrayal of the assassin Vincent is excellent. I always thought that just beneath the veneer of Cruise's million-dollar megawatt smile existed a darker side. Cruise lets this darker side of his personality come out and shine from beginning to end. His Vincent was calm, collected, charismatic and most of all sociopathic. His character was indifferent as to whether what he was committing was good or bad. Or whether the reasoning behind it was right or wrong. Vincent was indifference personafied. To him it all boils down to the job he had to perform. It was just something he was well-adept and well-versed in performing. Like how Jamie Foxx's character Max was good in how he drove a taxicab.<br /><br />Speaking of Jamie Foxx, he held his own in every scene that he had with Cruise. His Max character represented the Everyman and his work in this film shows just how underrated and underappreciated a dramatic actor he's become. His reactions to the events that unfolded once he took Vincent's fare seems genuine. He reacted like how most people would probably react when they find out that an assassin has now become their bosom buddy for the night. There's real chemistry between Cruise and Foxx. It is this chemistry that holds the film together from start to finish.<br /><br />Collateral was not so much an excellent crime-thriller, but a study of the missed oppurtunities people have in their lives. OF people not living up to their dreams. Always putting off their dreams until the right time came along. Until one day they've realized that their dream has passed them by and that they've become just one of the millions who end up going through life anonymous and forgotten. Vincent lives every day as if it might be his last, but at the same time he's still fears of becoming one of those anonymous millions. His fear is ironic for the reason that his chosen profession he has chosen to remain anonymous if he is to survive. Max on the other hand spends the entire film going through a forced self-discovery of what he's done with his life and dreams. As an audience we're there to see Max go through this journey of self-discovery from beginning to end.<br /><br />For filmgoers who'll be going in to see Collateral hoping to see some action and violence won't be disappointed. There's violence in this film. When it arrives its sudden, quick and brutal. The violence in this film was very similar to the way the swordfighting in Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman was handled. There's no slow-motion gimmicks or overextended shoot outs. When a gun was pulled out and used there was a reasoning to it. This film had no extraneous scenes of violence for the sake of having it onscreen.<br /><br />Overall, Michael Mann's film was an great example of how a thriller can be made intelligently and without using tricks, gimmicks and misdirection. Collateral could've been just about two guys talking inside a cab and it probably still have succeeded. Its refreshing to know that great direction, great acting, and a flawless script could still be found in Hollywood to create an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise stars as Vincent, a hitman who has a Taxi driver named Max (Jamie Foxx) drive himto his hits. Tom Cruise is actually at his best when playing a villain just like in Interview with the Vampire. Vincent is a ruthless and heartless killer and no one could play him better than Cruise. Although people are just saying now, "look at Jamie Foxx he can act". I knew for awhile that he could. Infact he should've been nominated for Ali. He's great in this too as this nice guy who hates this violent situation he's caught up in. He's funny but is also really good at being a sensitive and soft spoken actor as well.<br /><br />  Also good in supporting roles are Mark Ruffalo (13 Going on 30) as a cop who stumbles on to one of Vincent's crime scenes. Jada Pinkett Smith has good chemestry with Foxx eventhough they only have small scenes together. She plays a lawyer that Max picks up one day and they get along so well that she gives him her business card so he can call her. Collateral is suspenseful and has lots of violence but just like in Mann's Heat these 2 totally opposite guys interact and talk and get to know each other. In Heat the cop and robber sit down and talk over a cup of coffee. Here the nice taxi driver and ruthless killer talk in-between hits.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Collateral" isn't just one of the best thrillers of the year, it's one of the best American movies of the year. Admittedly, 2004 has been a fairly weak one for exceptional films, but "Collateral' could hold it's own in any recent year. It becomes more than a little implausible towards the end, but, as in a lot of great movies, you don't really think about this until after long after the final credits have rolled.<br /><br />"Collateral" reaffirms my belief that a great action film isn't just about great action, it's also about great characters, which comes from great screenwriting and great acting. "Collateral" takes the time to define the main characters, Vincent [Tom Cruise] and Max [Jamie Foxx], and allows the actors to actually act.<br /><br />Max is a Los Angeles cab driver. He has conned himself into believing that, even though he's been a taxi driver for twelve years, some day soon he'll realize his dream of operating a limo service in some island paradise. One night he picks up a fare, Vincent, who offers him $600 to drive him to five stops over the course of the night. What Max doesn't know is that Vincent is a contract killer. The five stops are to eliminate five witness from a gang-related Federal trial. In a perfect world, Max might have been none the wiser. Vincent would have gotten out of the cab and quietly done his business. As luck would have it, though, the first victim falls out of a third story window and lands right on the unsuspecting Max's waiting cab. The rest of the night turns into chaos.<br /><br />Between each `hit'. Vincent and Max get to know each other a little better, and the audience gets to know the characters better, thus allowing a greater involvement in this deadly cat and mouse game.<br /><br />In a way, "Collateral" is an `homage' to the great Alfred Hitchcock, whose persistent theme was that of an innocent man's being caught up in a web woven by a villain. Director Michael Mann, though, takes the genre and creates something uniquely his own - a masterful thriller in its own right.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I originally rated this movie 3 stars, but after reading some of the other bad reviews, it reminded me of how this movie downward spiraled, so I now want to lower my rating to 2 stars.  The ONLY reason I am now giving it 2 stars is because of the song being played during the coyote scene.  Cool song, dumb movie.  Thanks reviewers for inspiring me to tell the REAL truth!</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>This movie is "Kitten With a Whip" meets "Terminator" and "Miami Vice" - but without any of the excitement, fun, plot or interest you would expect from jamming those things together.<br /><br />Tom Cruise's performance is at the center of this movie, and even though he may be a bizarre couch-bouncing Brooke Shields-berating spazz, he's still a great actor.  He and Jamie Foxx are the only two things saving this moving from direct-to-video land.<br /><br />The pacing of this movie is atrocious.  The Exposition is clunky and ponderous, and even then barely gets out amidst all of the extraneous junk in the first 15 minutes of this movie.  By the way, after the first 15 minutes,  you know exactly what is going to happen in this predictable dog.  Rather than being suspenseful or even languid, the film dithered.  Hey, it's not every movie that takes you on a detour to a jazz club.  And this movie is polite enough to stop to let coyotes cross the street.  However, even chopping out 30 minutes of tedium wouldn't help this movie, due to the plethora of other flaws.<br /><br />We see many of the most annoying movie cliches here.  Man Wrongly Accused - my wife's favorite.  Educated Successful Professional Woman Isn't Fulfilled Until Meeting Working Class Man with Heart of Gold - check.  Colombians Dealing Drugs - got that.  Captive Blows Obvious Chances to Escape - check.  Woman Needs Man to Rescue Her - yep.  We even have the Incredible Unkillable Villain, and to top it off, the Hero's Death Battle Exemption.  You can play this at home.  Blend all these together into a script over the course of a tipsy evening and you can do better than "Collateral" did.  The problem here is not just that the cliches are tedious in and of themselves; rather, they form the entire plot, such as it is.<br /><br />Before "Collateral," the movie "Point Break" was the poster child for cheesy pure-coincidence police "work," because one lucky break led Keanu right to the bank robbers with no need for that pesky logical analysis stuff.  But "Collateral" really takes the cake, with 4-count-em-4 unlikely-beyond-your-wildest-dreams coincidences assisting the cops in their attempt to figure out what's going on.  Because that's what makes a good crime movie - stupid cops and random coincidence.<br /><br />Michael Mann's contempt for Los Angeles drips from every frame, from the dialogue to the choice of shots and locations.  I happen to love LA (just like Randy Newman), and that was one more reason I didn't care for this movie.<br /><br />And one last thing - what the heck does the word "collateral" have to do with this movie?<br /><br />Avoid, avoid, avoid.  If you insist on seeing a Michael Mann film, rent or buy "Manhunter" instead, from a time before the director started making flabby, self-indulgent films like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Jaime Foxx and Tom Cruise do it again in this movie!

I was expecting a lot of violence, over the top characters, and not to much of a story. What I got instead was possibly the best movie of 2004.<br /><br />Max(Foxx) drives a cab in Los Angeles for a living. He says it's his side job and his plan is to one day run his own limo service. He takes pride in his work in being the best cabbie in LA. He picks up Annie(Smith)who bets him her way to getting to downtown is faster. He wins the bet and charms over the girl. He's to shy though to ask for her number when she leaves. She comes back and gives it to him, and we see that Max really is a nice guy whose plans are taking him longer than expected.<br /><br />A man quickly enters the cab. He asks Max to take him to his destination and Max give him an ETA. After he makes the ETA the gentleman give him a proposition. He'll give him $600 to drive him around the whole night. Max reluctantly agrees to the man. He introduces himself as Vincent(Cruise) and says he looks forward to a great quick evening.<br /><br />Things quickly turn bad when a body falls from the second floor onto the cab. Max realizes Vincent just killed the man though Vincent just says "I shoot him, the bullets and the fall killed him." Vincent takes Max hostage and tells him he will drive him around town or he will kill him. Now Max is stuck with Vincent as he takes him to murder people. The ultimate target though is the DA Annie who Vincent just met and likes. Now he must stop Vincent and save innocent people before they die.<br /><br />The acting in Collateral is terrific. Jamie Foxx is great as Max. This is a different role for him. He's known more for his comedy and cocky characters like in Any Given Sunday. Max is an Average Joe kind of guy we can all relate to. His plans aren't coming as fast as he wants them to. Foxx plays the role to perfection and he has me really looking forward to seeing him play Ray in The Ray Charles movie later this year.<br /><br />Tom Cruise steals the show as the killer Vincent. It's a much different role for Cruise because he's the bad guy. He takes the bad guy and runs with it. Vincent is a cold killer who does it for a living. He has no remorse for the people he kills. He's confident in his abilities but not cocky. He'll do anything to achieve his round as he shows to Max in brute force. Cruise brings an intensity to the character. He's charming when he needs to be and we see that Tom Cruise we love. He becomes Vincent and is flawless. This is one of his best performance of his storied carear and is as good or if not better than some of his Oscar nominated performances. At this point he has to be the favorite for what should be a "Best Supporting Actor" nomination.<br /><br />Michael Mann directs this film to perfection. A lot takes place in a cab and he utalizes a a lot of different camera shots so you don't get bored during all the dialogue. He allows the characters to develop in the movie and thats what makes the movie drive. He shots the fight scenes to perfection especially the big one in the club.<br /><br />Steven Beattie wrote the movie and he has himself an Oscar caliber screenplay here. His only other big time writing was with Pirates of the Carribean and he exceeds that here. The script is beautiful. It's comical when it needs to be. The dialogue never drags and it isn't boring. He doesn't waste lines in the movie and it's why the characters develop so well.<br /><br />Collateral is a great movie. The critics nationwide have loved it. It's not some cheap action thriller. Michael Mann doesn't let us out that easy but puts together a great action thriller with character and substance. The movie is flawless. There isn't anything not to like. Bring on the Oscars because this movie deserves some and maybe Tom Cruise can finally get one because he sure does deserve it. You don't want to miss Collateral.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It's so far-fetched and illogical that it's ridiculous.

Cruise said to Jamie "I was just trying to make a living!" before trying to kill Jamie. But it turned out Cruise was killed by Jamie! On top of that, there's no suspense at all.<br /><br />No wonder it's a big flop at the box office. This is one of the worst movies starring Tom Cruise.

In the Jan.-Feb. 2005 issue of 'Scholastic Instructor,' a bit of trivia about this movie is the amount paid ($7,827) to the Harrison School in L.A. just for using the exterior in this movie.  Seems to me that is public domain, if they did not go inside.  And to beat all, it was filmed at night.  What was there to see to earn this type of money?  Perhaps the director or producer had been a student there at one time or another.  You can see why there were no 'extras' and Tom had only one outfit. I did like Tom Cruise's white hair and spiffy gray suit. Nice for a change.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx was funny as the unwilling accomplice/cab driver.

Jason Statham ("The Transporter", "The Italian Job") has a cameo at the beginning of the film.  Cruise takes his performance to another level with this one. He's not a TOTAL villain, like Richard III (in the play named for him) or Iago (in Othello), but he either "Scares you or thrills you." Thrilled me all the way through. The ending SUCKED, however, but overall, it was an excellent thrill ride. This movie IS NOT for kids. Rated PG-13 for some violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>its only saving grace was the almost always brilliant tom c.as for j foxx,well he played a black cab driver well.half his act came naturally(and why he got such praise for playing a blind black guy-ray charles-is beyond me...just bobble your head from side to side and walk funny....how impressive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)anyway,back to this nonsense.tom is a contract killer who needs to off some saps in 1 night.and his only means of accomplishing this is by way of taxi cab.dont you just love gimmicks?!?!?!?!?ok,after witnessing the 1st murder,its obvious that j foxx charactor has but 2 options.....walk away and hand cab over to tom OR risk sticking around and hoping tom doesnt kill witnesses.and wasnt that a touching scene in the hospital?!?!?!?awww.....this movie is silly and j foxx,as funny as he kinda is,is just the flavor of the moment.silly,silly movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Even though we havent seen this type of taxi-adventure-ride before, we sure have seen films failing despite a cool setting because of a very weak plot. Lots of them too.<br /><br />  "Collateral" has a solid premise to take off from, but the scriptwriter does a lousy job executing (pun intended) his job.<br /><br />  As a "too-bad-not-to-wear-shades" contract killer hires a cab in his route to deliver 5 very important hits in one long night weird twists start tangling up as the cab-driver and the killer find themselves all caught up in a fate game.<br /><br />  Sounds good? I thought so too which is why i ended up in the movie theater seeing this. But then, just as the problems begin for the hostage taken cab-driver so do those for the viewers.<br /><br />  Tom Cruise (playing the hitman) is not a bad cast for this per ce, he's even given some above average dialogue to work with, but he's also made into a walking cliche. Slick suit outfit, obligatory shades, able to use slang as well as namedrop I Ching and Buddhism all in a night's work, hi-tech gadgets, bad-a** walking style, it all looks like he was ripped out of a manga strip and inserted into this movie.<br /><br />  The cab-driver, hmm, well, there we have an attempt to work away from the cliches which fails because it's too rare a picture (and too awkward) to be believed: clean, punctual, orderly, a genius for the fastest route available (timed to the minute), philosophical, charming, among a variety of other virtues. Sounds like your average big-city cabbie to you? Didn't think so. Far from even? Right on.<br /><br />  All this could've worked despite its clumsiness. As said above, the dialogue is not bad, there's a couple of brilliant punchlines, the subtle humor is well mixed-in. Following par is the cinematography, the photography, and the direction. L.A is given a pretty smooth nocturnal look and the characters flow through the city streets in their cab effortlessly. There's a maze but they are not hindered. It's all charming really and this is quite undeniable. The setting is achieved in convincing manner.<br /><br />  But.<br /><br />  Yes, there is a a but, and perhaps predictably it's the plot. Stretched so much you'll think it's about to snap any given moment and shatters will jump out of the screen, it undermines all and whatever good things "Collateral" has to offer. Stretched so much in fact, that at times i thought whether the scriptwriter was actually intending a very dark comedy but failed spectacularly to bring it across as such.<br /><br />  Giving away all the plot failures would obviously spoil it for those that havent seen the film (which might be a good thing actually) so I'll sum it all up saying that when the supposedly big twist arrives towards the end of the film it's so cheesy the screen almost turns yellow with holes. For the viewer who's long past the impressionable stage, the plot cracks will become apparent within the very first half hour and will only increase dramatically as the film progresses. They are that obvious.<br /><br />  Which is a pity of course, because "Collateral" does have great potential written all over it especially because the idea behind it is very intriguing.<br /><br />  As has been proven though in the past, it becomes for once more apparent that no matter how good the rest of the components of a film are, if the script is not solid the whole construction starts crumbling right before your eyes. We've seen far too many such crumblings before to tolerate one more, havent we?</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Collateral is a movie directed by Michael Mann (Ali, Heat) and starring Tom Cruise (Rain Man) and Jamie Foxx (Any Given Sunday). Looking at both actors' resumes, I've realized that Tom Cruise hasn't played a role of a villain for as long as one can remember. And Jamie Foxx hasn't been recognized before for being a good actor, not even in a supporting role.<br /><br />I understand that Cruise would want to play the role of a merciless cold blooded killer to expand his acting abilities. But honestly, the role of Vincent does not fit Tom Cruise's character. The role would have been great for someone like Brad Pitt or, for an older generation, Al Pacino. Jamie Foxx does not fit in the entire picture, let alone the role of cab driver Max, a role that would have been perfect for somebody like Samuel Jackson. He delivers his lines like somebody reading off of a cue card. The scenes that are meant to be intense, like the scene when Vincent's first victim comes falling out of the window and onto Max's cab, become vague and dull with Foxx's overacting and the loose dialogue.<br /><br />Collateral could have been a very good movie if only the director and casting crew would have decided to hire different lead actors.<br /><br />C-</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Surprisingly Good Movie,Tom Cruise is impeccable in the movie, Jamie Foxx even better. it's a good high paced thriller movie. the circumstances of the two characters and how everything intertwines is good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I saw this film a few years ago and decided to give it another look. While the film is contrived at times, it is helped greatly by a wonderfully cold performance by Tom Cruise. The film is well paced and builds slowly to an intense climax. Fox and Pickett should also be commended for turning in believable performances under crazy situations. The film probably rated a little over 4 stars, but the two discs DVD set is stellar and brings this super charged action film up to a top rating!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p>If you are looking for action, Suspense and Tom Cruise as a bad guy! Than you have found the perfect 120 min movie to watch. While not as good As Heat, this smart action thriller presents a different kind of movie; one that actually feels a bit different. Michael Mann this time brings a unique camera work that mixes documentary style with digital...it's kind of hard to describe, but it works, it gives the film a sort of "independent" filmmaking look. Unfortunately Mann would use this exact same technique on "Miami Vice" in which it looks atrocious.<br /><br />Collateral begins with Max (Jaime Foxx) a Taxi Driver who is working on changing his usual routine and perhaps one day establishes his own "Limo" company. Max's daily routine changes when he picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) a hit man that kidnaps Max. Vincent needs Max to drive him around, take him where his victims are. I will not spoil more, but I must say that this flick will leave you plugged until the last minute. The best scene is a shootout in a club; it's so amazingly well shot. Not to mention also the music that plays in the background, superb<br /><br />The only real reason I don't give this movie a "5" is because of the ending. The ending kind of kills it, and exaggerates Vincent's ability, making him look like a Terminator. I am not gona go into details as to what it is that makes it exaggerating, but you will see what I mean. Another thing I would like to add is Tom Cruise's acting; it is by far his best in any of his movies. I have seen almost all of Tom's movies and I have to mention that this is the first time he has played a villain, and very well I might add...he should have won or at least been nominated for an award. Anyway, this is a must have by all movie aficionados.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>And some fine acting by Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise.<br /><br />This stylish, atmospheric thriller is yet another Hollywood ode to the hit man.  I mean, what is with this sub-genre?  Consider these engaging hit man movies from the 90s:<br /><br />2 Days in the Valley (1996)  Danny Aiello as an over the hill hit man turned pizza baker.<br /><br />Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)  John Cusack as a cute whimsical amoral murder artist with Dan Aykroyd giving some comedic support in an over-the-top portrayal of a rival hit man always making with the jokes.<br /><br />The Professional (1994) Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read (but has a heart).<br /><br />La Femme Nikita (1990) Anne Parillaud plays a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who becomes a highly skilled hit woman.<br /><br />Point of No Return (1993) starring Bridget Fonda, is a kind of Americanized La Femme Nikita.<br /><br />And there are more I'm sure that I've missed.<br /><br />I think this sub-genre came about when film makers got desperate to do something besides "on the lam" movies and mafia glorifications.  I also think this sub-genre has something in common with "the whore with the heart of gold" flick.  It would appear that these days an actress doesn't really feel fulfilled and accomplished unless she has played a prostitute.  Can it be that actors in general will feel unfulfilled until they have played a hit man/woman?<br /><br />Surprisingly enough Collateral is also a buddy movie of sorts, or at least Tom Cruise's Vincent thinks he is making a friend, in as much as he is capable of making a friend.  Jamie Foxx doesn't think so since he clearly divines that Vincent is one very sick psychopath.<br /><br />But what makes this movie stand out, aside from Foxx and Cruise doing such a great job, is how stylish is the development, how worldly wise the dialogue, and how crisp the direction.  The fact that Jamie Foxx could have and should have gotten away from Cruise half a dozen times is really the only flaw in the movie.<br /><br />Another good film directed by Michael Mann is The Insider (1999) starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I watched this movie last night and I have to say that it rose far above my expectations.  I expected a lot because of all the hype, but I didn't expect this much.  First off I want to say that Jamie Foxx is somewhat of a hidden trick, I mean, this guy has been around for almost ever and he all of a sudden comanded your attention.  It's almost like he woke up last year and said "dang, I really need to do something great" and so he did, with this movie.  My favorite part for Foxx is when his charactor meets with some thugs.  You can see this is the point in the movie when he really BECOMES his charactor.  Anyways, I wanted to say that, and then again I feel I need to point out that Tom Cruise was brilliant.  I really don't like him much at all, I mean, I was saying this the other day to my wife, but Tom Cruise is annoying in person and he's really not that great of an actor but he always picks the BEST movies...My attitude has changed after seeing this movie.  He may still be annoying, but he can act.  So heres the 411...Max (Foxx)is an LA taxi-cab driver who, as you will see, never reaches hard enough for his dreams.  He's living the same routine he live's everyday, scared of change, scared of anything that may be different.  He picks up a woman (Jada), a lawyer working on a big case and he gives her his philosiphy, that you need to take mini breaks, mini vacations throughout the day and he does this by looking at a postcard of an island.  This is important, because the heart of this movie is so much more than a hitman and a cabbie.  Anyways, he says she needs the break more than he does and he gives her the photo.  In return she gives him her number...so now he keeps that in the spot saved for his photo.  SO out gets the girl and in gets the killer.  Vincent (Cruise) has 5 stops to make and offers Max $700 to take him for the night.  He reluctantly agrees (although it would break routine) and he ends up in for the ride of his life.  There are plot twists and turns, especially come the last thirty minutes or so, and the last ten minutes will have your heart beating through your chest.  Heres what I love so much about this movie, because without the underlining moral of this story it would just be a movie, but it's so much more than that.  Max lives life with no purpose, no excitment because he so afraid of anything different.  Vincent is the exact opposite.  He lives for the moment.  Theres a scene in the movie when Vincent is telling Max that one day he will wake up and realive that his dream never happened.  Case in point, Max's dream is to own his own Limo company 'Island Limos' and he tells everyone that taxi-driving is only temp. that he's saving up for his dream, getting things in order...the reality of it all is he been driving for twelve years...that's Vincent's point...he's had this dream for so long it's almost passed, almost gone and soon it will be too late.  There's a balance between two completly different life-styles or attitudes that needs to be met.  Your life should have some order, but not so much that you rule out the unexpected, you rule out the best parts of life because your not ready for them.  The fact of the mater is Vincent was the best thing that ever happened to Max!</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Everyonce in a while there comes along a movie that just seems to capture someone's attention with the suspense, the action, the acting, and the drama so well that they don't know what's going to happen next nor do they want someone to spoil it who's already seen it.<br /><br />Collateral is the perfect example of that type of movie. Both Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise share chemistry together so well you'd might think they have been doing dozens of movies together.<br /><br />I haven't seen too many Cruise movies; just Top Gun and the Mission Impossble series, and I thought Jamie Fox couldn't get on the same level as he did in Ray, but this movie was awesome to watch and see what both men could do.<br /><br />Jamie Fox stars as a cab driver named Max; a man who has the cleanest cab in Los Angeles. The first few minutes show how Fox can carry a regular cab scene with ease, and proves it when he shows his character's background who wants to open a limo driving business. [Don't worry, he actually is serious in the movie]<br /><br />Max picks up a man named Vincent; played by Cruise, who gives him three hundred dollars up front to make five stops, "To visit some friends" It basically is a typical scene, till Max gets a rather nasty shock on his first stop [I wont give what it was away, but it is rather surprising]<br /><br />To make a long story short, Cruise is a hit man on his way to five different people. His protrayal of Vincent is astonishingly cold, cool, and cruel. He will kill anyone who gets in his way and he informs Max that in order to save those people, "Don't attract anyone who doesn't need to die's attention." Seems easier said than done with what Max has to go through.<br /><br />The camera angles are unique and styllized but the lighting is probably the only thing that I have a problem with. The whole plot takes place at night save a few minutes at the beginning and the end, showing when the plot begins and end.<br /><br />And there is a scene near the end when vincent is chasing another victim where it is really hard to see. But besides those small minor details this is one pretty good movie with great camera angles.<br /><br />To sum everything up I would definately reccomend this movie to those who want to see a styllized action flick with the most regular good vs. evil plot you might see. The action is great, the suspense is nail biting, the acting is off the charts, and the ending is powerful to say the least.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>Both actors certainly outdo themselves in portraiting ... I wonder how that word is spelled anyway .... two completely disparate charcters that have depth and sympathy to the audience .....<br /><br />Tom Cruise as the contract killer manages to get the viewer to feel some level of empathy because of the way in which he treats Max (Jaime Fxx) the taxi driver who is hijacked into driving him around the city while he carefully, and very violently, kills all the witnesses in a drug/gang trial..<br /><br />The story is interesting enough to keep your interest and the charaters a multi dimentional ... Great movie .. I loved it ...</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I'm sorry I missed this film in theaters.  To use a clich&eacute;, I found myself on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I thought I had it pegged from the commercials - that Tom Cruise is a hit man, and that Jamie Foxx finally outsmarts him.  Not quite.  Nothing that predictable happens in the movie.  Tom Cruise gives a terrific performance in his first, all-out villain role (not counting the anti-hero, Lestat), with a head of prematurely gray hair.  He attacks the part with his trademark enthusiasm, and is truly breathtaking when he is called upon to use violence.  Jamie Foxx is proving that he is quite an actor in development.  Michael Mann, one of our best directors, wisely avoids the stereotype of making the race-card a factor between these two opponents: Cruise likes and respects Foxx, and thinks he is helping him out.<br /><br />Michael Mann's masterpiece is Heat - another film about Los Angeles by night.  This one is not as epic in scope - in fact, it all takes place in one night - but it still inhabits the same world of shadow-people.  One thing that nobody seems to be talking about - this movie LOOKS LIKE IT WAS SHOT ON DIGITAL.  Video has a different look than film, and I'm surprised to see Michael Mann go for it.  It still looks impressive, but it has a different feel to it.</p></br><a href="../users/A39VJRIW7HC5C0.html">A39VJRIW7HC5C0</a><br/><p>Although the phrase "I don't see what all the fuss is about" will no doubt earn me scores of non-helpful votes from fans of the film, I must say that I was surprised at the reception received by this film.  Beyond the solid direction, there's very little original territory here.<br /><br />I must say that I knew nothing about this movie when I walked in.  I did not know that Tom Cruise was the villain, something that people have payed way too much attention to.  If they cast Michael Jackson as a missionary it doesn't make it neccesarily a good film.  Similarly, casting Jamie Foxx as a non-comedian is no bolder than casting rap stars on Law and Order Special Victims Unit.  Casting two actors agaisnt type won't overcome a hackneyed script.<br /><br />Is there any doubt that Jamie Foxx will survive this movie?  Is there ever a question that he will be reunited with Jada Pinkett Smith by the climax of the film?  Is there any reason to have the cop-who-knows-there's-more-to-the-story-but-his-fellow-cops-won't-beleive-him?  There is nothing original here, and solid performances and superb direction by Mann don't elevate this beyond a standard thriller.  5/10</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Michael Mann is at the top of his game.  This riveting thriller combines nicely etched characters, sharp and pointed dialogue, explosive action and violence, delivered with the intelligence, wit and intensity Mann brilliantly brings to the genre.  Like Tarantino, Michael Mann knows when the extreme closeup of his actors faces is all that is required to reveal character and mood and that cross-cutting this intimacy with superbly choreographed violence creates atmosphere and tension lacking from the films of their less-gifted bretheren.<br /><br />The film just plain looks great.  Michael Mann captures the nighttime streets of LA in as mesmerizing a way as his daytime shootout on those same streets in Heat was simply un-toppable.  Beyond the look, the choices of locales, and the mood and pace of the film are spot-on.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is terrific in this role and is matched all the way by Jamie Foxx.  It is basically a two character drama, so the two leads had to carry their weight and they did so admirably.  I had no trouble accepting "pretty-boy" Cruise as a ruthless, coldly calculating, remorseless and relentless contract killer.  It is a very nice piece of work.  Jamie Foxx has the more difficult "straight-man" role, and he acquits himself well.<br /><br />The production is meticulous.  The supporting cast, down to the smallest role, is perfect, with Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo carrying the largest support, but also fine cameos by Javier Bardham and others.<br /><br />This is class work by a fine director, cast and crew.  The 5 stars are, of course, for fans of thrillers.  The story may be a stretch with a bit of a hole here and there, the climax almost Terminator-like in relentlessness, but you will be hard pressed to find a more intense or better thriller anywhere.  This is the movies folks, done by people who know how to make em!</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>I recently played the game Hitman 2: Silent Assassin on my Gamecube. The title really says it all: SILENT Assassin. Yes? However I didn't particularly find it much fun with all that stealth and creeping around. I just went in guns blazing. I was crap. But I wasn't as bad as Vincent in this movie.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays Vincent (ooh ahh, Tom is playing a bad guy, hype, hype, hype) a thoroughly conspicuous looking character who is in LA for a spot of contract killing. He hires unhappy cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) for the whole night. Five stops, five kills, yadda yadda yadda...you've seen the trailer.<br /><br />This arrangement might have worked if Vincent were competent in the least. But he's just terrible. He leaves evidence everywhere, makes moronic mistakes, walks in front of every CCTV camera in LA and blabs far too much to Max, who any half-competent assassin would off at the end of the night anyway. Whatever the bad guys are paying him, the paycheck far exceeds the skill.<br /><br />Michael Mann directs the film with amazing skill, brilliantly capturing the multiple looks and feelings of night-time LA. There are many scenes of tangible atmosphere in Collateral, so much so that the film is eerily calming. A very slickly crafted film, but not as memorable as previous films in Mann's career.<br /><br />Cruise and Foxx have great chemistry together though it must be said that Foxx comes off as the better performer/character. Neither of them overact and keep their cool but there's a true realistic edge to his lonely cabbie than Cruise's idiot assassin who leaves incriminating exhibits A-Z all over LA.<br /><br />The DVD is in gorgeous looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with colors so vivid and lifelike you'll forget your watching a movie and not real life. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is also stunning, fully complimenting the movie's dynamic sound design. Gunshots are very loud and pack a heavy punch, if you have a home theatre you'll love it. James Newton Howard's atmospheric score is also seamlessly woven into the film's sound design and it's surely Howard at the top of his game, miraculously blending his own score with non-original tracks. Once again, if you have a home theatre you'll LOVE the Fever Club scene.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Michael Mann's new thriller cannot boast the ingenious script -- it's full of holes -- but it is still a taut, stylish one with good acting from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.  It's not long and self-important saga of 'Ali'; it's more like 'Heat' where tension rises as characters are driven to the edges.<br /><br />It's Los Angels Airport, where the story starts.  Tom Cruise's guy Vincent receives a bag from another guy (slyly cast cameo of the British star of 'Transporter').  Vincent, apparently a cool businessman on trip, has to do some jobs within a day, as you see later.<br /><br />And Jamie Foxx is a taxi driver Max, hard-working, honest, and believing that he can do his own business one of these days, and has spent more than 10 years doing the same thing.  Now, Vincent hires Max, offering a lucrative ride, which turns out a very unusual one, for at the first place the taxi are headed for, a dead body falls down from the fourth floor.<br /><br />Right, this is a change of pace for Tom Cruise, Mr. Nice Guy whose CV includes 'Top Gun' and 'Mission Impossible.'  This time, however, he plays a calculating, chilly man from underworld, who knows how to kill without mercy, but has his own philosophy of life.  It's contradicatory, but Tom Cruise manages to be the merciless killer with great skills.<br /><br />Besides Jamie Foxx who is very convincing as Mr. Everyman  easily intimidated at first, but gradually changing to somebody else, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, and Bruce McGill appear, plus Irma P Hall ('The Ladykiller') who adds a precious tone of comic relief to the noir.<br /><br />But the film is without doubt Mann's, or I should say, Mann's images of LA at night.  He not only lives in the city, but knows the city, and the 'sprawling' city ('Vincent's word) with many faces plays the most important role in the film.<br /><br />The most regrettable thing is the story of Stuart Beattie which is full of plot-holls.  Think about it.  A real  professional killer would drive his own car, instead of taking a cab, for instance, and the such items as the silly FBI or ineffective witness protection belong to the B movie cliche.<br /><br />Still, Mann succeeds in making the film quite gripping  thriller, with the great use of LA landscapes.  Don't think too much when watching it.  Just prepare to be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>I don't like Tom Cruise. I don't like him, his Scientology `religion,' his strutting style of acting, or the horse he rode in on. BUT. He's really good in Collateral. He plays a ruthless hit man out to eliminate 5-6 people who might potentially testify in an upcoming high-profile trial. He hops into a cab driven by Max, superbly played (I mean, SUPERBLY) by Jamie Foxx, and sets off on an all-night shooting spree.<br /><br />Cruise doesn't change one whit throughout the film: he's a killing machine, period.<br /><br />But Foxx. Omigod, Jamie Foxx begins as a taxi hack in a nowhere life and slowly becomes the reluctant hero of the film as he valiantly (and very improbably, but hey, this is an action movie, so sit back and just take it on faith) tries to save the life of Cruise's last and ultimate victim: the pretty DA in charge of the case.<br /><br />It's exciting and edge-of-your seat tense throughout, and only 3 things really bothered me: 1) It's not believable that a car would overturn and crash to smithereens without either of the occupants getting more than a bruise, and Cruise's clothes don't even get mussed up, 2) It's not possible for women to run that desperately fast in 3-inch heels, and 3) The very last scene of them outside at dawn overlooking a freeway and parking lot was just...empty. Anticlimactic.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a terrific shoot-`em-up film, if you like this sort of thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith star in Michael<br />Mann's 2004 crime thriller.

I recommend this good flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>And it probably would have if he had done this one back in the early to mid 90's when people were falling all over themselves with his "Jerry MaGuire" this one is by far one of Cruise's best, if not the best performance of his whole career, In this he is Vincent, an aging hitman who has five hits he has to make in one night in Los Angeles, but it is clear he is not familiar with the city & enlists the services of a cab with Jamie Foxx as the unsuspecting cab driver who shuttles him around as he makes his hits, the first one goes horribly wrong as the victim falls out of a window & lands on the top of the cab no less, it is here that Foxx realizes what is going on &  Vincent has no choice but to involve him in his hits, as they load the body into the trunk, the next hit is successful, but when Vincent leaves Foxx handcuffed to the stirring wheel, some punks try to rob him & steal Vincent's breifcase containing his hitlist, this is cool moment as Vincent intervines & immediately takes out the punks so fast that you have to see it to beleive it in a rather satisfying moment, the third hit is a bit more sad, all this action draws the attention of the local police as we learn that Vincent's hits are those of people slated to testify at a criminal trial, Mark Ruffulo(13 Going on 30) is on hand as a cop following Vincent's mayhem with Peter Berg as his reluctant partner who it seems just doesn't care about these victims, the fourth hit is a bit more tense as Vincent sets his sights on the victim in a nightclub full of patrons & this victim's security force, with Ruffalo & many Swat team members attempting to save the guy, all hell breaks loose in a scene that is a bit diffucult to describe, you just have to watch it, Vincent of course makes his kill & quietly leaves amid frantic people running in all directions, his last kill is a lawyer leading the case, Jade Pinkett Smith is the attourney who is the last target, who Foxx had met early on in the film's opening moments, Foxx soon realizes this & attempts to stop Vincent in which a cat & mouse game ensues between the three of them with a rather satisfying ending, again, this one should have gotten Tom Cruise an Oscar, his Vincent is so cool & reserved that you actually forget that this is Cruise playing the part, Cruise embodies this character in a way that you  just forget that it is him in the role, this was definately a step away from the roles that Cruise usually plays, & like him or hate him, you have to give him credit for taking on an unconventional role, somthing that most actors are afraid to do, if the Media & Hollywood hadn't turned on him as they have now turned on Mel Gibson, I believe he would have been nominated by the Academy.... don't be put off by your dislike for Cruise, this is one great film, & director Michael Mann once again makes Los Angeles come alive, just like in his other film "Heat" Los Angeles becomes a charater here too, the city never looked better at night.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>This is Cruise's best performance in years, and Foxx was better in this film than in the slightly, syrupy RAY. The screenplay by Stuart Beattie is full of great dialogue, and director Michael Mann hits another one out of the park with breathless ease. COLLATERAL is one helluva' sweet ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Michael Mann's feature Collateral is a big, star driven production that shines with a great storyline as well.  His very own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006J28KU">Heat (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> was another star driven story with a wonderful plot.<br /><br />This time, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx star as the hapless individuals on one fateful night in LA.  Foxx stars as Max, a dream inspiring cab driver, and Cruise stars as Vincent, a smooth and calculated hitman.<br /><br />The two disc set features a commentary from director Michael Mann, around four or so featurettes detailing the visual FXs, acting, and others behind the film, and a deleted scene with commentary.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>To begin with, the movie had a pretty good story:  A Los Angeles, cab driver Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx) picks up a gray-suited man named Vincent (Tom Cruise). Vincent offers Max a large sum of money to drive him to five locations around LA before the night is up. Max accepts, but realizes that Vincent is a hitman who has been hired to kill five people that night.<br /><br />'Collateral' features the career best performances of two seemingly different actors: Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise is a heavy-hitter; every one of his movies usually makes good dough, and a lot are good. Foxx, up until now, has been reduced to your typical funny black guy roles in nearly every one of his movies. When you hear their names mentioned for the same movie, you don't think it's stupid or impossible, just that the product movie will be some sort of run of the mill, action/comedy buddy picture.  The movie is directed perfectly, with silences and cinematography that capture the emptiness of the night. Michael Mann manages to make the streets and skyscrapers of L.A. beautiful, both his direction and the grainy cinematography is worthy of an Oscar.<br /><br />Another magnificent aspect is the ending. I wont spoil it, I'll just say that Vincent finds out the answer to the question, 'Who notices?'</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>Question: what do you do if your normal routine is interrupted by an opportunity do something that promises a bigger than usual reward?  Most people would take the opportunity.  Next question:  what happens if that opportunity turns out to be more than you bargained for?  That situation is the one that Max, played by Jaime Foxx, found himself in the movie 'Collateral.'  Max's whole world gets turned around after he agrees to drive Vincent, played by Tom Cruise, around all night as he takes care of some business deals.<br /><br />Max is a cab driver.  He tells everyone that this job is just part time and temporary.  Its something to do while he makes other arrangements.  Those other arrangements are his plans to start his own limo company.  Problem is, those plans have been developing for twelve years.  Max also has a gift for getting his customers to their destination on time, and in the amount of time he predicted.<br /><br />Then one night, Vincent shows up.  Vincent appears to be a business man in town to close a few deals.  Max intrigues Vincent, so he offers Max the opportunity to make some extra money and a bonues if he'll drive him to all of his appointments and get him back to the airport in time to catch his 6 a.m. flight.  Things are going well until Max learns that Vincent is a hitman, and he has no way of getting rid of him.<br /><br />'Collateral' is a good movie.  It explores quite a few aspects of human behavior.  Amongst its themes are the stories we tell ourselves that get us from one day to the next, even though everyone else sees right through them.  This theme is at the heart of the relationship between Max and Vincent.  Its subtle in points, but it clubs you over the head in others.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the acting.  Cruise and Foxx were ideal for their roles.  For Foxx, this film continues his entry into dramatic roles and away from comedy.  For Cruise, this is a dark turn away from his good guy leading man roles.  Both of them do a superb job.<br /><br />The drawbacks to the movie is that it can be a bit preachy at times, the end sequence wasn't overly spectacular, and a few of the earlier scenes tended to drag a little.  However, most of these flaws are relatively insignificant in the face of the acting and the theme of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this film to fans of Cruise and Foxx and those that like dark gritty movies.  Kids will probably be bored with this one, and its not appropriate for them anyway.  The DVD has several features for those than look for those types of things.  Overall:  4.25 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A51IK68MWKV5R.html">A51IK68MWKV5R</a><br/><p>Hollywood needs to stop creating movies with villains that are more interesting than the so-called "good guys" becasue what inevitably happens is the audience -- perhaps without even being completely aware of it -- gets behind the antagonist (in this case, Tom Cruise's Vincent) and roots for his to win in the end.<br /><br />Of course, since the Rules of Cinema -- still strangely moralistic in these continually darkening times -- will not allow that to happen, it means setting ourselves up for disappointment. Judgment Night was the first film to drive this point home, with the ineffectual Emilio Estevez and Jeremy Piven somehow coming out on top over the ultracool Denis Leary and Erik Shrody (aka Everlast). But that movie was all about the soundtrack anyway, with its prescient teaming of alternative rock and rap groups.<br /><br />Now Michael Mann has done it again with Collateral. Only this time he's included the necessary protagonist identification in Jamie Foxx's Max the cabbie. After all, what better way to engender sympathy for a character than to have him be potentially lucky in love (especially with the surprisingly lovely Jada Pinkett-Smith).<br /><br />But don't get me wrong, even though Foxx provides the foundation, it is Cruise who carries Collateral. A lot of people saw this as a stretch (similar to Tom Hanks playing a killer in Road to Perdition), but it's really just Cruise doing what he does best: looking and acting really cool. I have yet to see him do anything to make me think he's reaching really deep; he's too physical an actor for that, merely taking on different mannerisms (and hairstyles) with each new character.<br /><br />With Michael Mann at the helm, you can expect intensity (see Manhunter, The Insider, Heat), what I didn't expect were the number of surprises that Collateral holds in store. Just when I thought I knew what was going to happen, the movie would throw a narrative curve ball, catching me completely off my guard.<br /><br />This kept me interested when the story would flag (as stories always do when they're trying to get on with the business of actually telling the story) and they are mostly what I remember about Collateral -- except for the lame ending -- making it a more engaging experience than anyone had a right to expect from a Tom Cruise movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Sunday, January 16, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Mann's more personal offering.<br /><br />I've enjoyed Michael Mann's work for a while going back to Miami Vice.  Manhunter was a nice step leading to his magnum opus, Heat.  Collateral, while lacking the epic scope of Heat provides a more personal one on one feel.  It's as if Mann has expanded the conversation held between DeNiro and Pacino in Heat at the diner and fleshed it out more fully in this film.  Jamie Foxx plays a cab driver who has the unfortunate pleasure of picking of Tom Cruise, a paid assassin doing the rounds for the evening.  Cruise almost makes it work for me, dressed in gray with prematurely grayed facial hair.  He's as gray as his soul.  However, too many times I almost cracked under disbelief thinking back to his numerous other `good guy' roles.  Still, Foxx made good progress throughout the movie on his journey of empowerment until the finale where of course, he must take on Cruise to save his sweetie.  A bit of a stretch to be sure, still the interplay between them and the dark streets and night of LaLa Land as a setting made the movie gripping, and ultimately memorable I think. Not Heat, but what could be.  Still, recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This recent film is a thriller.  But there is something slightly different about this one.  There's a good attempt at character development.<br /><br />Jamie Fox is cast as an ordinary cabdriver.  But very quickly we see he is highly intelligent as he develops a relationship with Jada Pinkett Smith, a hard-working prosecutor who just happens to get in his cab.  It's obvious that she's a person who he'd like to see again and is delighted when she leaves him her card.<br /><br />All seems very sweet and normal and then things suddenly change.  That's when Tom Cruise, cast as a sophisticated hit man, gets into the cab.  In a very short time the cabbie is exposed to murder and violence.  Tom Cruise keeps him a virtual prisoner.  He forces the cabdriver to drive him around when he commits murders.  But every time that Jamie Fox tries to flee, there is another twist to the story.<br /><br />O.K. - the plot was silly.  I even dozed off a couple of times and it didn't matter that I missed a few details.  But I did keep watching to the inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />This is not a great film but it is entertaining.  And I was impressed by the quality of Jamie Fox's performance.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>I knew what to expect when I rented this movie.  The synopsis on the back of the box spelled out most of the story, even the parts one had to read-into.  But what I found pleasant about this film is the unexpected turns and twist, such as Tom Cruise's character's first HIT falling four stories onto the cab he was using.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx plays cabbie Max, a man with big dreams and a lot of common sense.  He finds himself in quite a bind after Tom Cruise's character, hitman Vincent, forces him to drive him to all of his scheduled assassinations.<br /><br />Yes, some of this movie is predictable, but a there are also a few twist and turns that make the movie more enjoyable.  The actual activities and routes the charaters perform are believable, parts of the dialogue are NOT.  When Jamie Foxx calls to warn a woman that Vincent is on the way to kill her, the woman keeps saying, "I don't understand.  What are you saying." That was totally unbelievable.  I think there should have been a little more thought put into the dialogue of this film.  Too much hype and spice was thrown into the mix.  The action was good enough that Mann could have relied on more believable dialogue to keep the film flow seem more even.<br /><br />All and all, this is a good movie.  I think most people will enjoy the entertainmnet.  Warning to those with children (and us adults that are sick of hearing the F-word all the time), there is a lot of cussing in this movie...ummm...and...violence. :-)<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>For the most part, this is one sharp crime thriller that doubles as a character study of two lonely men. If that premise does not appeal to you, then you probably can't appreciate director Michael Mann's unique filmmaking style, which is an intoxicating mix of nocturnal urban sleekness and characters that peel off layers of their psyche to drive the plot. This is not a standard action film, not by a long shot, as it is really about the relationship between a hit man named Vincent and a cab driver named Max, thrown together by chance and becoming more inextricably connected as the convoluted story unfolds. Vincent is as mono-maniacally cold-blooded as one can expect in this type of film, but Stuart Beattie's script reveals a well-educated, rather erudite man who may have been triggered by an abusive childhood to follow this line of work. In salt-and-pepper hair and without his trademark smile, Tom Cruise is relatively good as Vincent, though as with most of his films, there is an air of posturing about his performance that negates the malice of his character. At the same time, when it comes to his character's profession, he is convincing as an expert at his craft, who has mastered a clear method of killing that absolves him of blame and conscience.<br /><br />The focal point of this 2004 film, however, is Max, who represents the story's moral conscience. He is also a complex figure, a man who has deluded himself with dreams of running his own limousine service. Max makes it sound convincing at first, but then his credibility starts to unravel under Vincent's astute microscope and as the immediate situation becomes more desperate. Consequently, he is forced not only to drive Vincent around LA but also to look at himself for what he is. Were it not for his uncanny impersonation of Ray Charles, this is the performance that would have pushed Jamie Foxx to the front ranks. As Max, he captures all the inner conflict showing surprising pockets of courage when he realizes he has nothing to lose. The interplay between Vincent and Max is what makes this film uniquely intriguing, as it is just not about a villain holding a reluctant victim hostage but about two men who leverage each other's blind spots and weaknesses to fulfill their immediate goals.<br /><br />Too infrequent on the screen recently, Jada Pinkett-Smith is sharp and memorable in a small but pivotal role as Annie, a federal prosecutor who gets drawn to Max at the beginning. Mark Ruffalo, taking a break from indies, is effective as the slicked-back LA detective who is not sure who his suspect is. Irma P. Hall has a briefly comic scene as Max's bedridden mother. Special mention needs to be given to the wondrous Javier Bardem, who takes a 180-degree turn from his recent saintly roles to play a single scene as the drug kingpin Felix, coolly menacing as he talks facetiously about Humpty Dumpty, Santa Claus and Black Peter. The scene between Foxx and Bardem is superbly played out as Max gradually steels himself into Vincent's identity. Mann's set pieces - in a scary Latin bar, in a frenzied Koreatown dance club - show the director at the height of his stylized creativity, and nighttime in LA has never looked more terrifyingly hypnotic than in the excellent camerawork by cinematographers Paul Cameron and Dion Beebe.<br /><br />It's a shame that the film gets more predictable toward the end when Vincent becomes his most nihilistic and Terminator-like and Max unconditionally heroic. In a fit of derivativeness, the story suddenly borrows heavily from "Rear Window" and "Speed" with a touch of "The French Connection". Although the cumulative effect is still suspenseful, the familiarity of the climax left me feeling a little empty especially after the plot was unfolding in such an audaciously creative manner. But I still recommend this movie for its overall originality. The two-disc set has plenty of extras - Mann's informative commentary, a feature-length making-of documentary, an interesting prep reel of Cruise and Foxx getting into their roles and just one deleted scene. Well worthwhile even if you are not a fan of this genre.</p></br></body></html>

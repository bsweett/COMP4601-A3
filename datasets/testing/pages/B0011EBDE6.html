Motivated to bond with his brothers after a near-fatal accident, Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) arranges a trip to India for himself and brothers Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). The idea is make a "spiritual journey" of a cross-country train trip aboard The Darjeeling Limited, following a careful, laminated itinerary. But the brothers don't trust one another, for good reason, and Francis has kept their destination a secret.<br /><br />The Darjeeling Limited is a functional train created for this movie, which was filmed aboard the moving train. There couldn't be a better advertisement for Indian tourism. The train is absolutely charming, with handpainted artwork adorning the corridors, colorful, tasseled chandeliers in the dining car, and a profusion of lovely cobalt blue everywhere. I have no idea if this remotely resembles a real Indian train. It seems like an exotic, whimsical version of a European train from the pre-World War II era. But the production design by Mark Friedberg is a true gem, not to be missed.<br /><br />"The Darjeeling Limited" has a low-key, slightly bemused, wryly comic, but good-natured tone, to which I attribute its success. It's familiar, but I have never seen a film able to sustain this tone for the duration. It doesn't slip even as the characters' situation vacillates from comic to tragic, or when they get off the train. Even the humor doesn't interrupt the flow, which is aided by a great soundtrack. I found it all pleasantly hypnotic. The visuals are beautiful. The odd characters seem utterly natural in this environment. This is the best role for Adrien Brody since "The Pianist". Wes Anderson's films are hit-or-miss for me, but this one is a hit.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2008): You have the option of viewing the film with a prelude entitled "Hotel Chevalier" (12 min). It concerns an encounter between Jack and his girlfriend in a Paris hotel room. It's superfluous and would create a hiccough in the film's pacing. I strongly recommend viewing the film without it. You can always watch it afterward. There is also a making-of featurette called "The Darjeeling Limited Walking Tour" (21 min). Production designer Mark Friedberg shows us around the train, and there is behind-the-scenes footage of filming. And there is a theatrical trailer (2 min). Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Wes Anderson films are an acquired taste. From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767821408">Bottle Rocket</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428239">Rushmore</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067DHK">The Royal Tenenbaums</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007UC8Y4">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a>, and finally this film, THE DARJEELING LIMITED, quirkiness is a theme that runs throughout writer/director Anderson's repertoire. He also loves working with the Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen) as well as Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray. So -- not surprisingly -- Owen, Anjelica and Bill all show up at some point in this one. They are, in fact, becoming what I like to call "the quirky cadre."<br /><br />Anderson isn't one of those "in-your-face" kind of directors. He doesn't spoonfeed you anything, and this is both fun and frustrating. The fun comes from personal discoveries related to the scenes and situations he puts his characters in. The frustration is that sometimes the disconnects are too extreme.<br /><br />This time we have the three Whitman brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNS0">Cars</a>), Peter (Adrien Brody, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KWZ7JC">Hollywoodland</a>), and Jack (Jason Schwarztman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M06KJ8">Marie Antoinette</a>). Their father has recently passed away and the brothers take on a trip to India to find their absent mother. In the meantime, we get to witness the bizarreness of this family unit. Francis (Wilson) is a control freak who has to have every minute detail pinned down. Peter (Brody) is somewhat of a kleptomaniac. And Jack (Schwartzman) is a damaged guy stuck on a damaged gal (played by Natalie Portman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OCG4W">Closer</a>). The three boys try to rediscover their brotherly bonds by taking The Darjeeling Limited (a train) across India in search of their father's hopes for them and their mother's reasons for not attending her husband's funeral. There are some absolutely hysterical, funny, and poignant moments, sometimes all wrapped up in one scene. The one that comes to mind the most is when the brothers witness a raft trapped in some rapids with three boys clinging on for dear life. They put aside all of their differences and go into savior mode without thinking, and it is a defining moment within the brothers' lives. What comes after is funny and sad. They finally break free of their bonds to their parents and leave all of their luggage behind (literally and metaphorically), thanks to the families they meet outside their own.<br /><br />The main frustration most viewers might have with the movie is the music. There really is no connection between what is happening and the tunes (Anderson, I believe, just enjoyed the Indian music and decided to incorporate it into the film, and be damned what anyone might think). The extreme disconnect was very bothersome for this viewer.<br /><br />Even so, this is a good quirky Anderson film with great color shots (the train and the surrounding terrain), an uplifting story (in the end), and some fine acting by all (especially by Owen Wilson).</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I am happy to say that the new Wes Anderson film "The Darjeeling Limited" is much better than his last film "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou". But that is almost like damning the film with faint praise. It would be difficult for this film to be as bad as the director's last.<br /><br />That said, "Darjeeling" has some winning performances, some great humorous moments and seems to reintroduce us to the wacky sensibility that made us love the director in the first place. "Darjeeling" is not without it's problems, but it is a very funny and amusing film.<br /><br />Peter (Adrian Brody) runs to catch the Darjeeling Limited which is pulling out of a train station in a major Indian city. He soon joins his two brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). Francis planned this trip, with the help of his beleaguered assistant, Brendan (Wallace Wolodarsky, a former producer on "The Simpsons"), because they have not spoken in over a year. He misses their conversation, their sibling rivalry and their companionship. Francis has the entire trip planned, down to the religious ceremonies they will perform at various holy sights. But when the brothers start to act up, due to a variety of circumstances, including divergent personalities, over the counter medicines and a poisonous snake, the Chief Steward (Waris Ahluwalia) kicks them off the train in the middle of the dessert. Francis soon reveals his hidden agenda and they pull together to get through the trip and become brothers again.<br /><br />Each of Wes Anderson's films has a style unique to the filmmaker. Each of his films is populated by a collection of off-center people who live eccentric lives in an eccentric environment. Generally, his characters have money, either as a new circumstance or their bank accounts are dwindling, but they are still used to living a certain way. "The Darjeeling Limited" is no exception. From the moment we meet Francis, we begin to learn he has a company of his own, and feels the need to show this off by bringing his assistant along on the trip. Brenda will drop off their schedule every morning, under the door of their compartment, before they even wake up. They brought along a computer and laminating machine to aid in this task. As Jack runs to catch the train, he is carrying a couple of pieces of odd luggage, luggage that would probably be more comfortable in the hands of a child, each piece appears to have dinosaur stickers plastered over it. As he enters the compartment he will share with his brothers, we see many other pieces of the same luggage, all of it an exact match down to the monogram. Anderson goes to a lot of trouble to design every aspect of the universe his characters will inhabit. From what I understand, he designed every aspect of the train cars we see in the film. This attention to detail shows, giving the main setting for a significant portion of the film a character; these train compartments are interesting and unique, they appear like something we would expect to find in India, but are so gaudy and over decorated, like a British Lord initially commissioned them. Now independent, the Indians seem determined to uphold the tradition of the train cars while injecting their own indigenous traditions to the interior.<br /><br />Each of the three leads is good and adds significantly to the overall quirky nature of the film. Owen Wilson, who has been the focus of a number of tabloid stories lately, plays Francis, the more domineering brother. At dinner, he orders food for his brothers. And he is also the force behind the trip and their itinerary. He set-up the trip because he realized the three brothers were not communicating anymore and needed some bonding time.<br /><br />As the more domineering, fussy member of the family, Wilson's Francis is the least funny of the three. It doesn't help that Wilson's slow drawl sort of lends a whiny quality to his character. But he is still good. When the brothers get together, they slowly start to devolve into the children they once were and Francis finds his role, mother hen.<br /><br />Adrian Brody's Peter is an interesting guy. He agrees to go on the trip because he is having some trouble with his girlfriend back home and wants to escape for a while. A grown man, he is unable to hide his former self when he gets together with his brothers; Francis decides Peter should have the top bunk, his long legs dangling over the side and the gangly brother is chugging some over the counter Indian pain medicine, which his siblings begin to share. But Peter seems to recognize the need for the bonding time and goes along with his brother's overbearing plans.<br /><br />I have never been a huge fan of Jason Schwartzman, but he is also good as Jack, clearly the youngest brother. There are some references to his life as a successful writer, living in Paris, trying to get over his ex-girlfriend. Jack carries around a short story he just competed and eagerly seeks the approval of his other brothers.<br /><br />From the moment they board the train, Jack is smitten with Rita (Amara Karan), an employee on the train, a sort of stewardess who makes sure the guests have enough refreshments. She recognizes the look in Jack's eyes as he continues to pursue her.<br /><br />Anjelica Huston pops up in a small role as Patricia, a nun living in a small monastery at the foot of the Himalayas. Patricia once played a role in the lives of the three men and their visit with her is cathartic.<br /><br />As much as there is to love about "Darjeeling", it makes a similar mistake to "The Life Aquatic", a mistake that derails the Bill Murray film. Thankfully, the events in "Darjeeling" only prove to provide an odd side trip in their journey. A confusing side trip at that; the events really seem to have no connection to the brothers or their journey. I think the key difference here is "Life Aquatic" ends with this event, leaving us with this as our final memory. In "Darjeeling", the similar event happens earlier, giving us some story to help us forget the problematic part of the story.<br /><br />"The Darjeeling Limited" is a quirky, fun, funny look at three brothers on a road trip. There are also a few surprised sure to delight many in the audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I am happy to say that the new Wes Anderson film "The Darjeeling Limited" is much better than his last film "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou".

It's precious, but you'll enjoy this, if not savor it.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"The Darjeeling Limited" is a flop, a retread, a bore, and another sign that writer/director Wes Anderson can't press every character and story into his rigid template of cool detachment and visual irony. It's not even disappointing, really; you could see in Anderson's previous feature, "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou," this ambition to make just about any subject funnel into his bug jar of wondrous twigs, leaves and such. Never mind if it leaves the audience stuck in first gear, perpetually sizing up leery archetypes that seem stolen from that creepy brother Dan Futterman played in the TV show "Judging Amy."  The characters in this India-by-train travel narrative are so flat and inert they become models in Anderson's moving diorama. What in the world are you supposed to do with them?<br /><br />Yeah, "The Royal Tenenbaums" is a masterpiece. Was then, still is, gets better with age, one of the seminal works of the era, yessir, all that. (Spare us the anointing oil on "Rushmore" and "Bottle Rocket.") And for that, to Wes, we say thanks. "Tenenbaums" is also six years old, a perfect marriage of subject and tone, and somewhere in Anderson's wheelhouse. The guy got a bit self-satisfied with "The Life Aquatic" - not a terrible movie (endearing, even colorful) but more or less something you'd dream up in your backyard sandbox - but "Darjeeling" smacks of a half-baked idea cut squarely off at the knees (Anderson can't even be troubled to keep the titular train around for the second and third acts) crossed with the director's trademark muted sentiment and one of those hairpin turns into tragedy he likes so much.<br /><br />Does "The Darjeeling Limited" have a point? Oh, sure. It's same one Anderson's been making for years: Familial reconciliation, tinged with the complexity and bittersweetness of human nature. This time it's three brothers, one of whom is recovering from a severe car accident, on a bonding trip through the land that stopped Alexander The Great cold. The train is appropriately quirky, although Anderson's camera never lingers for too long, and there is no cuter-than-thou introduction to it. Francis (Owen Wilson) has arranged the trip for Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and Peter (Adrien Brody); he runs it on a supposedly tight itinerary he has printed out by his assistant, who stays in a different part of the train.<br /><br />Jack's the cad, and a writer. Peter's the softy, and Francis is the control freak, an annoying trait that is no less so when we discover its roots.  The elephant in the room is their father's death; we can only guess at the trauma, because all three brothers hail from the "Oh. Wow." factory of emotional output. This is, in fact, the Tenenbaum family poured into these fellows - like Richie crafted picture after picture of Margot, they glumly cling to their father's possessions, such as a 12-piece set of Louis Vuitton luggage.<br /><br />The Anderson formula also includes some exotic, vaguely creepy foreign woman, smoking, the previously mentioned jarring transition, a dash of postmodern, story-within-a-story meta, Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray, and some music from The Kinks. Standard Wes fare.<br /><br />In "Darjeeling," none of it works. The random sex is crass, and the depiction of India, while not phony, is not terrible complete, either, seeing that the brothers spend most of their trip in the utter wilderness, where virtually no one lives. Anderson would have us believe Schwartzman has the looks and charm to attract women while the director buries Brody's natural electricity so he can play the "precious" brother. The roles should have been switched. Wilson's performance is supposed to be affecting because it came around the time of his suicide attempt; I guess I'm not so easily moved. His Francis is a particular irritant, both boorish and completely full of crap, easing off the gas pedal only after he's been lured into a fistfight. The brothers only seem that way in Jack's story-within-a-story, and, even then, we're not sure if it's an accurate evocation of their feelings, or just the middle brother's wishful thinking. Either way - who cares? "Anderson loses any non-conditioned member of the audience quickly in the first reel, tries a stab at pathos around halftime, and simply fritters about after that.<br /><br />Note: "The Darjeeling Limited" comes with a short film entitled "Hotel Chevalier," a prologue featuring Jack and his ex-girlfriend, played by Natalie Portman. Esoteric and bewildering, it's kind of 13-minute scene a college student might write, enthusiastically graded by a fiction professor. It lacks any humor whatsoever and any noticeable warmth, but Portman quickly becomes naked and says a naughty word. For some reason, it still turns some weirdos on when a smart, bright kid like Portman shows how much she can't act against her essential nature by dragging her fingernails in dirt.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies you either love or you hate.  I like it, but I am not suprised that it has drawn some very negative reviews.  It's not for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>So how many Wes Anderson films have you seen?  If Darjeeling is your first, you may well give more than three stars to this story of three brothers more or less trying to reconnect as they more or less search for their mother on a slow train through a lot of India.  If, as with me, it is your fifth you may find that the characters' quirkiness has become just a bit too pat, that the meandering plot twists feel arbitrary not right and that the film might have been better titled Wes and the Gang Go to India. That's not to say that Darjeeling fails to entertain.  It is splendidly shot, very well-acted, funny, and sometimes moving.  For one fifteen or twenty minute segment that begins with an attempted rescue in a flooded river, it achieves grace and wisdom, and is as good as anything Anderson has directed.  It also has a priceless opening sequence with Bill Murray and, as often in Anderson's films, Anjelica Huston bringing both common sense and majesty to the mix.  But even with those assets, Darjeeling feels more canned than true.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>The Darjeeling Limited is not a bad film, and nowhere near one of the all time worst films. But, in no way, shape, nor form, can anyone who understands and appreciates the art of cinema call this a good, much less great film, and those who have praised it or claimed it was one of the best films of its year are idiots, pure and simple. It is, in a sense, the sine qua non of mediocrity, and Anderson is the same thing in the realm of directors, which only begs the question as to what The Criterion Collection finds so valuable about his cinematic canon. More than that, I get the real sense, given Anderson's comments on the audio commentary track, and in the extra features, that he is not even trying to grow and make films of substance and quality any longer. And this is a shame, because Rushmore, the first film of his to break big, was a good film, and one which showed potential for Anderson to become a valuable asset for American cinema. In fact, only David Gordon Green's debut film, George Washington, showed more potential for a young American filmmaker, in the last dozen years, yet he too has stagnated, although his problem is more based in mere selling out to Hollywood and its conventions, whereas Anderson seems to be just creatively dead. Given his working and personal relationship with Roman Coppola- who's proven he's a good screenwriter, it would seem that Coppola would be the person to turn to for his next film's screenplay; to get outside of Andersonworld. If not, he may be doomed to becoming his generation's Tim Burton; a thought even scarier than any of that perpetual juvenile's own films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A film that could have been a real discovery of India and Hinduism. Alas we are very far from that because of the absolutely egocentric and self-centered psychologically claustrophobic closing up of each one of the three brothers onto each one of themselves. They hate themselves and one another with the greatest amount of love and yet they can't stand one another. They are looking for their mother who disappeared before their father's funeral they had to bury alone. She took refuge in some kind of Christian nunnery in India and she just does not hear the voices from her sons or from the world or from even herself. She is entirely locked up in an supposedly altruistic dedication to the poor of India and does not see she is selfishly rejecting her own responsibilities towards her own children and family. The spiritual pilgrimage of these three brothers becomes a nightmare when they have to travel together in a deluxe first class sleeper compartment on an Indian train and can't stand their mutual guts. They will eventually get themselves kicked off the train. But we miss all the spirituality of this country, this subcontinent, not to speak of the Hindu religion that is reduced to a poor series of worn-out clich&eacute;s. So what's left when the Darjeeling tea has been brewed, poured and drunk except some water to be passed in a few hours? It does not even appeal us to go there and experience such situations. They definitely have it too easy, climbing to the top of some sacred rock. It should be hard and there should be several stages to be respected. The path to enlightenment is in eight stages, at least in my Buddhist line. Here we have one single race and some foolish clown faces and antics on the top. Could have been a lot better with a little bit of an effort.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman are the headliners of "The Darjeeling Limited," Wes Anderson`s comedy in which three brothers, who have drifted apart since the death of their father, embark on a spiritual quest through India in the hope that the journey will somehow bring them closer together.  As he did in his previous (though better) films, "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore," Anderson creates a slightly off-kilter world populated by benignly eccentric characters - only, in the case of "Darjeeling," the comedy is muted and the vision bland (making it more on a par with "The Life Aquatic" and "The Royal Tenenbaums," two of Anderson's lesser films).<br /><br />The price of Anderson's subtlety is that not a whole lot really seems to happen in the movie and the characters never get much of a chance to differentiate themselves from one another.  Each of the brothers is assigned a peculiarly defining quirk or eccentricity, but neither the actors nor the filmmakers (the movie was co-written by Schwartzman and Roman Coppola) seem to know quite what to do with them.  The result is that the comic bits fall flat, while the "meaningful" moments seem tacked on almost as an afterthought.<br /><br />Wilson (sporting a full head bandage throughout), Brody and Schwartzman do what they can with their roles but the monotonously deadpan tone of the comedy keeps them from breaking out on their own and engaging the viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I liked The Royal Tenenbaums quite a bit, but The Darjeeling Limited wasn't that good.

And being Wes Anderson, we can expect the movie to be amusing, warm, clever, heavy on the protagonists struggling to learn life's lessons...and lightweight. The Darjeeling Limited, a story of three brothers traveling in India who are trying, sometimes reluctantly, to resolve family issues, has a number of fine qualities. Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman work very well together as the edgy brothers. All the actors are fun to watch. Bill Murray has an amusing and wordless bit as a man racing to catch a train. The settings throughout India are intriguing. There are one or two delayed jokes that can create a smile. But in my opinion there's just not much weight behind the hip, gentle humor. Anderson's fascination with relationships is nothing new. And with Anderson's need at the conclusion to underline the movie's message -- we need to discard all that old baggage we keep hauling around -- by making the message literal, we wind up not with a gentle moral message but with ponderous movie making.<br /><br />I have a feeling that if Anderson is unable or unwilling stop making movies without the comfortable cocoon of like-minded film friends around him, he's going to fade into repetitive irrelevance. Even cleverness is no substitute for a well-constructed story. For instance, The Darjeeling Limited comes with a 13-minute seemingly separate film short which takes place enigmatically in a suite in a Paris hotel. The two unnamed characters are played by Schwartzman and Natalie Portman. There are silent expectations and silent moments, some sad and smart dialogue, and we get the idea that the woman left the man, may be coming back into his life...but maybe not for long. A bed plays a prominent part, with Schwartzman staying clothed and Portman nude. What's the point? None, except as a little slice of accomplished film-making. We wind up, during those 13 minutes, getting involved with these two people and their attempt, especially by the Schwartzman character, to hope for the best. Ah, but then in The Darjeeling Limited, we find that the short was just a set-up, and an unnecessary one, for another amusing delayed bit of character humor. Was it needed? No. Was it clever? Yes. Is it an example of the kind of flabby storytelling and insider cuteness that can happened among film friends who are making a movie? I think so.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about The Darjeeling Limited was life aboard the Indian train as it chugged through the countryside for half of the movie...what the old, elegant sleeper compartments and the fringed dining car looked like...how the tea and snacks were delivered...what the system of ticket taking was on board...how the train attendants worked...what the train stations looked like. But then I like trains. But I'm not so sure I'll be eager again to get on board another Wes Anderson movie unless he sets off in a new direction.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>The Whitman brothers haven't seen each other in over a year. Francis (Owen Wilson) invites his brother Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schartzman) on a cross-country train trip through the heartland of India in order to reconnect, bond and find themselves on a spiritual level. That's their internal arc. The external arc is to reunite with their mother who is now working as a nun in a convent at the "foot of the Himalayas".<br /><br />The Darjeeling Limited is actually a run-down train, the kind you would find in just about any third world landscape. The Darjeeling Limited (the Movie) attempts to mix farce with scenes of dramatic pathos unsuccessfully. For most of the movie, the three brothers are depicted as losers with a ton of emotional baggage, unable to resolve grudges they hold from an unfulfilled childhood. Unlike the Three Stooges (who mainly depended on quirky physical routines), there's little to distinguish the three witless Whitmans. Francis is the goofy businessman who spends most of the movie with his head wrapped in bandages after getting into a motorcycle accident prior to hooking up with his brothers; Peter is ostensibly running away from the responsibilities of adulthood as his wife is now 7 ? months pregnant back home; and Jack is a struggling writer with a propensity for casual sex (he easily beds a stewardess on the train). Note there is a 13 minute short film on the DVD entitled "Hotel Chevalier" which illustrates the ending of Jack's pretentious novel.<br /><br />Act I concerns the brothers' unfunny vignettes aboard the Darjeeling Limited. The main bit concerns their smuggling a poisonous snake aboard the train which almost gets them thrown off by the conductor. Eventually, Peter accuses Francis of being an "Indian giver" after he takes back an expensive belt he had given him earlier. They get into a physical altercation which spills out into the passenger section. This finally gets the hapless siblings thrown off the train in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />Act II switches to a rural Indian area where the brothers witness the capsizing of a raft manned by a group of boys. The brothers jump into the river, save two of the children but are unable to save a third. The brothers are about to take a bus but are suddenly invited by the villagers to attend the boy's funeral. Obviously, this is the scene where the brothers are supposed to 'grow up' and the audience is supposed to sympathize with them. In better screenplays, moments of sympathy for the protagonists come much earlier (usually at the beginning of the story). Here, the rescue of the children occurs at the midpoint of the film and it seems out of place with Act One's slapstick tone.<br /><br />Act III reunites the brothers with their mother, the nun in the convent played by Anjelica Huston. There's a lame joke about an escaped tiger eating one of the nun's brothers followed by the mother making breakfast for the brothers and then disappearing. Unperturbed, the brothers go up to the mountain and bond with one another. The final scene reprises the first: the brothers just miss the departing Darjeeling Limited and must jump on board just as the train pulls out of the station.<br /><br />The performances here are uniformly forgettable. The usually grim Adrien Brody should be singled out for proving that he's unfit for comedy. The leering Jason Schwartzman does his Ron Jeremy imitation and Owen Wilson takes a pratfall or two. Finally, there's the director, Wes Anderson, who must be castigated not only for his self-indulgence but for having a sense of humor that is thoroughly juvenile in tone and scope. Let's hope that some of the film's bloated budget went to helping some of the indigent local population who assisted the crew while working on this film. The true star of this misguided production was the Indian countryside and its people whose earnestness is contrasted with the shallowness of the film's creators.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>I intentionally delayed viewing this film for awhile as Wes Anderson's previous films failed to impress or satisfy me, more notably with The Royal Tenebaums and The Life Aquatic. Unfortunately, this film also fails miserably to redeem Wes Anderon's filmography; moreover, it only reinforces how out of touch Wes Anderson's writing has been with regard to his innate ability for crafting likable characters.<br /><br />Personally, my two favorite Wes Anderson films (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore) which I am sure are also popular beloved favorites among Wes Anderson fans like myself excelled in bringing fictional characters to life; characters that were incredibly distinct, unique and special; characters that were so flawed but nonetheless had many qualities that was so likable; characters that you could easily relate to but not entirely understand. Wes Anderson was truly an artist in bringing these types of characters to life because he knew exactly how to render them likable and so interesting. Personally, I felt that any writer who can craft someone purely fictional but leave an audience with an intense desire to follow that character through more interactions is a highly talented one. Wes Anderson fully succeeded with this task in his first two installments. I mean is it really necessary to express how much replay value Bottle Rocket or Rushmore possess within each viewing ?<br /><br />  In this little mishap, Wes Anderson takes us to India where the Whitman Brothers rendezvous on a train, "The darjeeling Limited" , to embark on a spiritual journey since it has been a year seeing each other after their father's funeral. This journey was planned by Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) and even goes as far as to the trouble of creating an organized itinerary. The two other brothers, Peter Whitman (Adrian Brody) and Jack Whitman, (Jason Schrwatzman) do not seem as enthusiastic but comply with Francis's wishes nonetheless. Francis, who appears in the entire film covered with overwhelming but comically placed bandages is recovering from a serious motorcycle accident, meanwhile, Peter has left his 7 1/2 month pregnant wife back at home without telling her where he has gone. Finally, Jack, a novelist, who incessantly attempts to reconnect with an ex-girlfriend (Natalie Portman) but cannot seem to tone down his propensities for non-attached flings seems to struggle with many emotional dilemmas. Along this spiritual journey, Francis reveals to his two brothers another motive for this journey to which they express utter disappointment at first when Francis discloses to them that he wants to reunite with their estranged mother (Angelica Houston) in the Himalayas. She is apparently running a convent there.<br /><br />This film came across as a lazy, watered down, imposter Wes Anderson without all the bells and whistles. Nothing seemed genuine at all in the film. All of the positive and stand out qualities that were so prevalent in previous Wes Anderson films were just downright diluted in this one or carelessly non-existent. The Indian setting that may seem appropriate for the mournful spiritual journey was not at all interesting nor inviting. The characters were incredibly dull, wooden and just plain boring, nor did any of the characters have any particular uniqueness that was worth noting either. The chemistry among the characters was essentially non-existent and that is probably because all of them were exactly the same. Like another reviewer on here who also expressed his discontent with the film in its entirety by asking the same question I asked too at the end of the film, "Who Cares" ? I found myself caring less and less about the characters as the film dragged on it's slow, empty and very unfulfilling journey. Quite frankly, there was not one ounce of spirit in this film except maybe in the soundtrack/score which was also not one of Wes Anderson's finest choice. Looking back at this film in particular as well as Wes Anderson's other previous disappointments, I can't help but to feel a sort of arrogance spawning out of the once rejuvenating director of indie films. According to Wes Anderson, an unusual setting, dull characters with zero depth but a dash of quirkiness is just enough to attract new fans and retain the old ones. Wrong.  It appears Bottle Rocket and Rushmore will remain at the pinnacle of Mr. Anderson catalog until he finds his true self again or finds a new career.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`The Darjeeling Limited,' should be evaluated by how much mirth and wisdom it provides.  The film comes across like a train wreck, giving us a fresh take on the familiar culture clash between East and West.  While watching this film, I kept thinking of The Beatles and their films.  One reason is that the three brothers presented run (madcap) through the titled Indian train; the other is that they journey through the heart of India searching for wisdom.<br /><br />At the start of the movie Jack (Jason Schwartzman) is in France.  He is a successful novelist renting a Paris hotel room for weeks on end.  His lover calls, saying she has found him and asks him if she can arrive within a half hour.  He says alright, but when she does arrive, it is established that he is there to get away from her.  Even so, they feel so passionate about each other, they find it hard to part ways.  He had to flee to Paris, but he doesn't resist her advances.<br /><br />In the next frame of the movie, Jack catches up to his brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson) and Peter (Adrien Brody).  All agree to an enlightening adventure to get away from it all, while their parents have been in India for some time.  It is quickly established that their father passed away there, and their mother has entered a convent and become a nun.  Francis is the eldest, and although he is the most vocal about letting go and absorbing the lessons they can gain from the East, he is also the most grasping and controlling of the other two.<br /><br />He sets their purpose with three agreements:  A.) Seek the unknown B.) with an open mind..., and C.) even if it`s shocking and painful.  Funny, but without knowing it, we learn without preaching that all of them have brought plenty of baggage (literally as well as figuratively) along their journey.<br /><br />In one telling scene, they are running for the Darjeeling Limited, and they all make it aboard while another man (Bill Murray) is left behind.  Later on, because of mishaps that shouldn't be mentioned, they catch up to another train, and we find this character is on the same train.  Just be still and don't run for trains, I can hear Wes Anderson, showing us in many frames.  You'll catch another one.  The journey within is supreme.  "Arrive without traveling," as George Harrison wrote and sang for The Beatles' "The Inner Light".  There is a more substantial development that occurs, but I'll leave you to unearth that for yourselves.<br /><br />`The Darjeeling Limited' is more than a travel adventure.  While I don't think mirth and wisdom were necessarily brought in aces, they certainly were highly present.  Being a person who loves a visual feast, I couldn't help but be partial to Anderson's shifting 90-degree angle camera changes and how he captures the color and light.  Besides the yellow lettering framing a vivid blue train, we have nearly neon colors contrasting with bright saris and white turbans.  All in all, the film is not entirely a substantial journey, but an arresting one at that.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Another Wes Anderson movie, unfortunately they get worse one by one.<br />This movie is basically Royal Tennenbaums II, except set in India.<br />Owen Wilson is the same pretentious, faux-humility character as always.<br />The scenes sputter along, with a lot of dead air, and dialogue about nothing imparticular.  There is a vague gloom and sense of failure, again,<br />and a screenplay that could be written over a bottle of $6 chenin blanc.<br />Also, the intro "short film" was utterly dreadful and pointless.  I'm sorry, but this is vapid garbage.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Ugh, this movie was painfully sloooow to watch! There was some mildly funny humor here and there, but over all the movie was atrocious!!<br /><br />Take three estranged & dysfunctional brothers that don't trust each other. Then place them together on a 1st class train compartment to travel across India in search of "Enlightenment". All the while each one of them goes about undermining each others trust for most of the movie. Sounds like they each have a lot of unresolved issues/baggage and an odd upbringing to boot.<br /><br />Somehow or another through finally meeting up with their mother, who is a nun in India, and has abandoned them all every opportunity she can find to do so and over coming their father's death, do the finally find peace in an odd sort of way or so it seems. The movie doesn't make it clear.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>Technique #01:<br /><br />Edward Hopper lighting and mood meets Winslow Homer film paintings -- some times in slow motion, sometimes weaving through the frame with a small amount of tracking. Wow, Wes Anderson is bloody genius, man!<br /><br />I guess Wes Anderson believes in his heart of hearts that repeating different aspects of the same tale about a family of dysfunctional self-absorbed, trust-funding Manhattan-ite Billionaires is remotely interesting at least to some people. He's bold for believing so, but foolish for not fleshing out his work a little better and trying to draw us in closer.<br /><br />Maybe the story started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428239">Rushmore</a>, then went to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640VJ">The Royal Tenenbaums</a> and then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNLQ">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a> and now (hopefully) ending full-circle now with The Darjeeling Limited. I say ending, because any more of this might begin to reflect on the previous films and detract from them over time by association. Like when Star Wars geeks say stuff like: "I like the even numbered films but not the odd numbered ones." No, they all suck, buddy. You see how five other films dragged down <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAJG">The Empire Strikes Back</a> into forgettable obscurity?<br /><br />Technique #02:<br /><br />I love Film Noir, depression as a main theme and even suicide, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305882592">Harold and Maude</a> being one of my favourite films, but this film just misses the mark on all counts. I really got the feeling that Jason Schwartzman and Wes Anderson were sitting on a bag of cocaine the size of Kirsten Dunst and came up with the bulk of the ideas and dialogue for this project. Even the opening segment, which was optional viewing came across as nothing more than self-indulgent film-making at its worst.<br /><br />Jason Schwartzman is a dynamic actor who basically just hangs around in this film giving it the only energy that's visible and seems to move it along all by himself and his own force of will. My will to continue watching continually faded, without a doubt, but I did stick with it.<br /><br />"He's a genius! You need your art spoonfed to ya!" ... the fanboys scream in the background.<br /><br />Yeah, well, we've seen this all before though haven't we? I find it interesting that no one seems to hold Wes Anderson to any type of benchmark or standard and then just knee-jerk reacts every time he makes a film. While the Life Aquatic was the highpoint of his career thus far, this might serve as a forgettable low-point that the fan boys will all worship, as they hold aloft their boutique made blown-glass mutli-coloured bongs in unison and cry out:<br /><br />"Wes Anderson is a Golden God!!"<br /><br />I think the same people that worship at the alter of Wes Anderson are also the same group of film hypocrites that expect every movie M. Knight makes to be "better" and more surprising at the end than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense</a>.<br /><br />"O happy masses ... this is thy cliff!"</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I like to keep up on films.  I don't like the lame corporate product junk regularly pinched off on our movie screens every weekend.  CGI video games for little boys.  Romantic-comedies that are so bland that they all look the same (there are about nine between Jennifer Aniston entries, by my count).  Raunchy comedies that aren't funny (two words: Seth Rogen).  I can't even remember the last time I thought, "I've got to see that."<br /><br />However, Wes Anderson is killing my enthusiasm for all art-house or independent films.<br /><br />He knows that people go to movies...to be entertained, right?<br /><br />Number one: I hate these characters.  I've been on international trips and have been exposed to some truly awful people, fellow tourists without any tact or even a clue...I'll take any one of them for a week over these hang-dog idiots for an hour and a half (even the fat, old lady I had to listen to across the Med and into the Holy Land, whose constant griping reached a hilarious crescendo in St. Mark's Square in Venice).<br /><br />Number two: I still hate these characters.  By the end, I thought, "Who cares?"  This family is a mess.  Nothing is resolved.  They grin.  Finally, some emotion.  Over what?  Who cares?<br /><br />Here's how to make a Wes Anderson film: get talented actors and tell them to stare into a camera lens, devoid of expression.  Give them inscrutable dialogue that passes as funny when explained later, but it has to come across as empty line readings--HAS to be completely emotionless and deadpan.<br /><br />Take the exotic location away and you have THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, which I thought was horrible too.  I've suffered through all of his films now...and it's now genuine suffering.  Between Wes Anderson and the Broken Lizard losers, I don't know whose new film I'd be most nauseated by.  The Broken Lizard guys don't know how to entertain.  Wes Anderson acts like he knows...but he refuses to.  Which is worse?</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Wes Anderson became famous to me when he did a credit card commercial with a car blowing up.  It played endlessly and was interesting.  "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" was really very boring and awful for me.  It didn't spark.  It wasn't funny.  "Darjeeling Limited" is much like that film.  Anderson was nominated for an Oscar along with Owen Wilson for "The Royal Tenenbaums."  He won a "Best Original Screenplay" award for this film with Jason Schwartzman from New York Film Critics Online.  I enjoyed having much of the film set in India.  It gave it a mystical quality.  The featurette on the DVD was interesting to watch how they used Indian artists to paint the train and all of the symbolic meaning to the pictures that one doesn't focus upon within the context of the film.<br /><br />The reason this film didn't work for me was that while it seemed to be trying to go in different directions at the same time, one of those was comedy.  Owen Wilson's Francis had no serious level to his characterization; neither was he funny.  He had energy and was interesting, but seemed mostly odd.  Jason Schwartzman who is the son of Talia Shire from the Rocky movies was most interesting in the short "The Hotel Chevalier."  However, while Natalie Portman's lack of dress was interesting, the short prologue film was open-ended with no sense of climax.  Schwartzman's Jack was a self-centered rich kid with hormones.  It seemed like he was playing a sad sack brand of comedy, but it wasn't funny.  Adrien Brody was simply in the wrong movie at the wrong time.  He spent much of his time as Peter wandering around in boxer shorts, abandoning his pregnant wife over issues of commitment.  Perhaps the most interesting thing in the film is when he admits that he got married with the idea that they'd get divorced.  Amara Karan does a nice job as the train's hostess Rita who balances a relationship with the Chief Steward played by Waris Ahluwalia.  These characters brought a sense of story to the film as we seemed to drop in on their relationship at a critical point.  Angelica Huston won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "Prizzi's Honor" in 1985.  She was inexplicable in this film, abandoning her kids to help a remote village, not going to her husband's funeral, and then disappearing before anything was resolved.  While the other actors seemed to be trying to be funny, Huston was decidedly dramatic, adding to the completely disjointed feel of the film.  Wallace Wolodarsky who was in "Life Aquatic" and played Brandon seemed very ordinary.  I did enjoy the two busybody German ladies played by Trudy Mathis & Margot Godros.  They were funny.  Overall, this film didn't work for me on most levels.

Technically it's an Indian road trip movie, and it's full of his quirky charm... but at heart it's just about three unhapppy brothers with a lot of baggage. Both literally and psychologically.<br /><br />The forlorn Peter (Adrien Brody) and his luggage barely make it to an Indian train in time to join his brothers, woman-chasing writer Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and  bandaged control freak Francis (Owen Wilson). They haven't spoken for a year, and now they're planning to awkwardly bond as they travel to their estranged mother's convent.<br /><br />But after disasters involving a snake, painkillers and pepper spray, the three brothers find themselves (and their monogrammed suitcases) thrown off the train. As they trek back to civilization, the three men set out on a quest to explore the spiritual, deal with  life, death, feathers, man-eating tigers, funerals and their own painful memories... and possibly find their mom.<br /><br />Nobody in their right mind would expect Wes Anderson to spin up an ordinary good-ol'-boys road trip movie. At least, not the way most directors would. Instead, Anderson crafts this as the baby brother to "The Royal Tenenbaums," exploring a fractured, mildly dysfunctional family with an absent parent.<br /><br />And the cinematic flavour of "Darjeeling Limited" is much the same as in "Royal Tenenbaums" -- bittersweetly funny and arch, with a tinge of poetic melancholy underlying the plot. It would be an endearing movie in any setting, but somehow putting it in the mellow glow of India's dusty roads, bright fields and cluttered shrines makes it even better. The bright, visual richness gives it a sense of whimsy.<br /><br />For the record, Roman Coppola and Schwartzman helped Anderson out with the script, but there isn't much change. As always, lots of  wry, amusingly contemplative dialogue ("I wonder if the three of us would've been friends in real life. Not as brothers, but as people"), though there is some hilarious comedic scenes of sibling infighting. It even gets slapsticky.<br /><br />Fortunately, Anderson never puts artificial twists into the story, for any extra drama, comedy or thrills; the closest thing would be a brief detour into a child's funeral. The story simply flows by, because it's all about the brothers -- and focusing on anything but their self-imposed journey would just be extra baggage.<br /><br />And the three men playing Jack, Francis and Peter are nothing short of brilliant. Brody is vaguely lost and forlorn, while Schwartzman is a quirky rake who is still haunted by his last girlfriend (played by Natalie Portman in the short intro, "Hotel Chevalier"). But there's something almost painfully wounded about Wilson's reckless control freak, which has nothing to do with his bandages.<br /><br />"The Darjeeling Limited" is a visually astounding, contemplative little comedy, all about three men who have to deal with the past before they can move on. Put it on the shelf next to "Royal Tenenbaums."</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Synopsis: An ornate and psychedelically colored train known as the Darjeeling Limited transports three estranged brothers; Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) to destinations unknown (actually Francis is attempting to arrange a rendezvous with their constantly disappearing Mother (Anjelica Huston) now living as a nun in Tibet). It has only been a year since their Father's tragic death and each brother carries their own personal heartache over his passing and their Mother's disturbing absence from the funeral.<br /><br />As one comes to expect when traveling with others, close proximity, annoying behaviors and old wounds eventually surface which must be dealt with as they arise. Add to the mix unforeseen events both aboard the train and at intermittent stopovers along the way and you have the makings of a transformational experience unlike anything the brothers could have anticipated.<br /><br />Critique: The '07 film `The Darjeeling Limited' begins painfully slow and incomprehensibly weird but if you have the fortitude to survive the first 40 minutes you will eventually find yourself on a delightfully oddball, unpredictable trek across the Indian subcontinent on a spiritual journey in search of physical, emotional and relational healing. Serving as a metaphor for life's journey, one might say that we are all aboard the Darjeeling Limited headed in the same direction to parts unknown. In the final analysis one learns that it's not where you're headed but how much baggage you drag along with you.<br /><br />There's a lot of food for thought hidden away in this film for those who are willing to put in the effort and watch until the very end.

The three of them start off discussing their writing process and how one's subconscious plays a role. They touch upon various aspects of the production, including production design, cinematography, and so on. Interestingly, the three of them were responsible for their own Whitman brother to write for. A lot of the commentary is spent recounting all kinds of filming anecdotes.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with a "Conversation with James Ivory." He and Anderson talk about the Indian music used in the film. Anderson was influenced by and used several musical cues from Ivory's films. The veteran filmmaker talks about some of his early Indian films with clips illustrating some of the music from it that Anderson used.<br /><br />There is a visual essay by Matt Zoller Seitz about the film and how it best sums up everything about Anderson's films. Seitz provides fascinating analysis over clips from the film and the short film as well.<br /><br />Also included is a 40 minute making of documentary by Barry Braverman. It takes a fly-on-the-wall approach to the production with plenty of footage of Anderson and his crew filming on location. The documentary provides some fascinating insight into what it must be like to make a film there and how Anderson adapted his methods there.<br /><br />"Sriharsh's Audition" features footage of a child Indian actor trying out for the film.<br /><br />There is a deleted scene and two alternate takes that run just over three minutes.

If Francis (Owen Wilson) hadn't kept looking for a power cord, I would have been flashing back to the time when the Kinks' music from the soundtrack was original.<br /><br />The story's about three brothers: Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody), and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). Francis originally tells his two younger sibs they're going on a spiritual journey after their father's death. His real motive is to find their mother (Anjelica Huston), who's gone off to an Indian convent instead of attending their father's funeral.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the brothers are not only not bonding--they're driving the conductor crazy til they get kicked off.  They do manage to pull things together to help some locals and in so doing, experience the revival they'd needed.  From there, they travel to see their Mom.<br /><br />Even if the brothers are occasionally depressing, the scenery, music, and train are well worth watching "Darjeeling Limited" for.  This is definitely a spiritual journey even for those of us watching in the audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>Just so you don't think I write only negative film reviews, here is one that I liked. I can't say, honestly, what it is about, really, but it hits the right wave length most of the time. It is a part time screw ball comedy, but every now and then gets pulled into a serious situation.<br />As I don't quite understand it, I will give it only four stars, sort of a defensive measure.<br />What is it about? If you summarize that, it comes out as total nonsense. Three brothers go to India to look for their mother who has become a nun there, and they are mad with her because she didn't come to Dad's funeral a year ago. Well, I told you, it does sound like nonsense. One of the brothers has his face smashed up from a motorcycle accident, the other one just got ditched by his girl friend, while the third is looking to become a father in six weeks, though he expected to get a divorce, rather.<br />The ditched one is getting used by lovely Rita, who needs to ditch her own boyfriend.<br />But it is funny. Most of the time. Think of Lost in Translation in another country. Which is appropriate, as the Coppola family is somehow involved.

Not perfect, but better than 98% of what's getting made.<br /><br />The Criterion Blu-Ray is really gorgeous, but I gotta say the regular DVD, non-Criterion release still has quite a nice image.

We meet three brothers who have not seen each other for a year, since the funeral for their father who died in a car accident.  Their mother never comes to the funeral and for all of the brothers this event seems to be a culmination of the prolonged family disfunction.  They are almost like boy-men who cope with their inadequacy in their own way:  eldest one (Francis - Owen) almost kills himself in motorcycle accident, middle one (Peter - Brody) collects material things: his deceased father's glasses, keys, belt; while the youngest one, a pretentious writer who speakes poor French in spite of living in Paris (Jack - Schwartsman) sleeps with anything that is female and still moving.  I like the metaphor that director Wes Anderson uses for the brothers.  They travel across beautiful Indian landscape with so much luggage that they require three porters and a car to carry it.  The luggage itself is no less but Louis Vuitton designed by Mark Jacobs.  As the film progresses and comes to its closure, all three manage to release themselves from the baggage and their dysfunctions turn into sincere brotherly love for each other.  They no longer need to medicate themselves with cigarettes, Indian caugh drops and pain killers.  They have each other and they finally trust each other.  Wonderful cast, music and scenery.  Film moves slowly and has fragments that connect past with the character's present.  Heartwarming movie with support cast of Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>The Whitman brothers haven't seen each other in years. After their father dies, Francis (Owen Wilson) organizes a trip for them to reconnect on a spiritual tour of India. So Jack (Jason Schwartzman, also acting as co-writer with director Wes Anderson) leaves behind the hotel room he's been living at for months in France and his neurotic girlfriend (Natalie Portman), and Peter (Adrien Brody) leaves his pregnant wife behind for the spiritual "retreat." Traveling around India on The Darjeeling Limited the three brothers try to find themselves, each other, and possibly their long lost mother (Anjelica Huston).<br /><br />Wes Anderson is the king of quirky indie style comedies. Before the indie movie scene was "cool", Anderson was making movies like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. Often copied but never duplicated (the closest being Anderson protege Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale), one of the things that makes Anderson's movies so great is his ability to walk that fine line between depressing and funny, and pathetic and sweet. Writing satirical stories about dysfunctional relationships, neurotic individuals, and upperclass families unhinged from reality, Anderson has definitely carved himself a unique niche with the film world. So how does this film stand up against Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tennenbaums, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou?<br /><br />In all honesty, and this might be hard to believe, I think this is Anderson's best movie to date (I should say the best Anderson movie I've seen since I still have yet to see Fantastic Mr. Fox). By shooting this film in India, he gives this film a unique flavor from the rest of his films, while still seeming familiar at the same time. Of course, that familiarity can be attributed to Anderson's use of many of the same actors as he's used in his other films (of the American actors in the film, only Adrien Brody hasn't appeared in a Wes Anderson film), not to mention the familiar subject material from his previous movies. The smaller sets, and closer proximity of the characters, as well as the smaller cast also make this movie feel more personal and allowing you to get closer to the characters. One thing that I've noticed in a lot of indie films these days is giving characters quirks that don't really define the characters but are there just to set the movie apart from the mainstream. Here, Anderson's characters have quirks, but the quirks are defined by the characters relationships and who they are rather than the other way around. Throughout the movie we see Wilson's character with bandages covering a large portion of his head and face, it seems like it's just a quirk the writers threw in to make the character seem more interesting, but when you find out the truth, it makes complete since in the scheme of who the character is.<br /><br />As with any Anderson movie the acting is impeccable, and adding Oscar winner Adrien Brody to his film making "family" was an inspired choice. Each of the actors playing the brother is completely believable in his spot in the pecking order. Wilson as the oldest, and as the one who practically raised the other brothers, is authoritative to a fault and tries to hide a more emotional interior from his "frailer" brothers. Brody plays the middle brother who sometimes feels like he's fading stuck between the other two and tries to break out of the mold by taking things important to others to find an identity and at times rebels against his older brother. Schwartzman, as the younger brother, is the impressionable one but just kind of wants to go with the flow of what the other brothers are doing. Each actor exemplifies these roles to a tee, but the real standout is Wilson. Unfortunately, as we found out later, his character may have been a little closer to his reality then we'd like to have thought.<br /><br />If I had one problem with this movie it's that I don't get the use of Bill Murray as The Businessman with just one line. I guess had it been a no name actor I probably wouldn't have even thought about this point, and Anderson might have chosen to put Murray into this role because Murray's become something of a talisman to him since he has appeared in all of Anderson's movies except for Bottle Rocket. Still, because of Murray's involvement I kept thinking there was going to be something more to the movie that never came about. Due to this distraction from the rest of the movie, I find the role actually to be somewhat detrimental to the movie as it really serves no purpose in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you give this movie a try, especially if you like Anderson's previously efforts or other independent film. As with all of his movies this is kind of a love it or hate it affair, but there's a lot to like about this movie from the look at a different culture, to the acting, to an interesting and engrossing story. Also if you check out the DVD make sure you watch the short film before The Darjeeling Limited called Hotel Chevalier.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I'll never understand why people think Wes Anderson writes/directs "comedies". He certainly likes to make fun of the human condition, as well as foibles and short-comings which are, let's face it, amusing. I disagree with most of the other reviews, but all I can say is that I think Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson presented very individual agendas. Wilson as the control freak annoyed me for a while, until a bigger picture developed. I was entertained and amused, and "The Darjeeling Limited" was everything I would expect from a Wes Anderson film. The appearance of Anjelica Huston toward the end was accompanied by a Rolling Stones tune, which made you believe that these guys had found what they were looking for.Wes Anderson is not simplistic; indeed, I was moved and never bored by this episodic adventure. I love his choice of music. The DVD extras were few, but included "Hotel Chevalier", a sort of preface to Jack's character (Schwartzman), with Natalie Portman (not in the actual film). The "making-of" segment was actually about the making-of; no interviews with cast or director. Bummer.  Sorry, but I enjoyed it a whole lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>In the five years or so following the heaps of acclaim bestowed upon Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, and the commercial success of The Royal Tenenbaums, those who consider Wes Anderson a genius and an innovator seem to have lost some ground to those who consider him the worst thing to happen to cinema since someone decided it would be a good idea to start making movies out of video games.  Still, there's no denying that Anderson remains a premier visual stylist, and over the course of his last two movies the ambition of his storytelling has started to catch up with his artistic vision and his well-documented influences.  His most recent work, the Darjeeling Limited, continues in the globetrotting vein of its classic predecessor The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, while indulging pretty much all of the fetishes (alienated characters, meticulous wardrobe and set design, British Invasion and world music, Owen Wilson) that make Anderson's movies so quickly recognizable.  Like all of his movies, it at least looks good, which makes it a step up from the sitcom-style direction that marks a lot of Hollywood comedies these days, and as usual Anderson avoids the overreliance on contrived quirks that indie movies so often give in to.<br /><br />If you belong to the faction who say (not without reason) that Anderson's movies dwell excessively on familial dysfunction and father issues, The Darjeeling Limited definitely won't do much to answer your criticisms.  Following three estranged American brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Schwartzman) who reunite a year after their father's death for a train trip across India, the movie explores the lingering divide between its relationship-impaired characters with Anderson's usual sympathy even as he pokes fun at their failings.  In a device only Anderson could get away with, Wilson's alpha-brother Francis lays out the parameters early on--a spiritual journey open to anything, no matter how shocking or painful--complete with an itinerary provided by Francis's alapecea-stricken assistant.  Of course, this being an Anderson movie, the trip quickly descends into a morass of resentment, backbiting, and fractured relationships, all conveyed with his usual deadpan humor and a bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />While I have to admit I was a little bummed about the near-total absence of Bill Murray this time around, if nothing else The Darjeeling Limited does mark another chapter in the fruitful collaboration of Anderson and Owen Wilson.  While their long-time connection hasn't quite reached the level of Scorsese-DeNiro or Kurosawa-Mifune,  the quality of their directing/acting/sometimes writing partnership does at least put them in the company of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg.  Of late Wilson seems to have been in a contest with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn to see who can appear in the most mediocre Hollywood comedies, but he's always done good work with Anderson whether he co-wrote or not, and his performance here is a nice variation on the wide-eyed optimist persona that he first developed in Bottle Rocket.  As Francis's brothers and travel partners, Brody manages to at least add a layer of reflectiveness to his usual bland competence, while Schwartzman (sporting a classic adult-film mustache) skillfully projects the same mix of innocence and smarm that he brought to his Rushmore breakthrough.<br /><br />While Anderson's movies have never precisely taken place in the real world, The Darjeeling Limited does see him bringing his whimsical style to an exploration of cultural convergence as its wealthy, entitled protagonists find themselves adrift in a more traditional (and, the movie shows, in some ways backward) society.  Fittingly, it's not until the brothers are forced to deviate from their pre-planned itinerary that the trip really gets going, with their reconciliation mirroring their engagement with India and its more out-of-the-way locales.  Much like on The Life Aquatic, Anderson clearly made a playground of his exotic locations, and it all shows up in the film.  From some great, Scorsese-esque tracking shots inside the train to claustrophobic cityscapes to expansive cinematography of the Indian countryside, the setting figures as extensively in this movie as Anderson's old high school in Rushmore or the high seas in The Life Aquatic, adding another layer of the personality that's always set Anderson movies apart.<br /><br />Overall, aside from Anderson's usual visual flair, The Darjeeling Limited contains more than enough characterization and humor to be another sytlish and entertaining entry in the Wes Anderson filmography.  Not quite as essential as some of his other films, but if you like his prior work you should find a lot to enjoy in this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>The film explores sense of adventure above retapping brotherhood. There is something exceedingly self confident about The Darjeeling Limited. The first scene features a chase to catch a train and the first of the three actors to appear is Adrien Brody. Adrien Brody is the apparently the most comfortable,yet clumsy of the three stars in this film. Brody's demeanour as Peter is remarakble and the prescription sunglasses were humored.<br /><br />Owen Wilson. Well, I won't lie. After the controversy that surrounded the man in recent times and his personal struggles, I wanted to see this film even more. It is his most memorable performance and he truly is a star in this film, a bit like a big brother figure what have you. Overall, it felt good to see him back on his feet chasing trains and electric plugs (you'll know)<br /><br />Jascon Schwartzman. He surprises me with how well an underplayer of an actor he is. Whether it's frantically chasing an Indian woman or running down a hill or even masterfully causing fire, his character wins. I loved how he carried his music around and had not a word to speak.<br /><br />Combine these three, some sweet coffees, temples cigarettes, band aids, pills, eyedrops, cough medicines, liquor, electric plugs, Indian villagers, coolies (the guys who lift your baggage at trainstations across India), shrines, BILL MURRAY, canals, cricket with tennis balls, funerals, young Indian boys and big hearts,  , taxis, fellow Sikhs, peacock feathers, phoney spiritualism, poisonous snakes, a Laurel and Hardy'ish willingness to fight...and much more - the movie prevails as one of quality and comradery in adventure.<br /><br />Overall, a heatening effort, must watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>The Darjeeling Limited is an extremely odd and quirky little film.  The cinematography is beautiful in both location and detail. The Darjeeling Limited itself is quite exotic and colorful, and provides us a unique look at train travel in India.  Additionally, native citizens of India are used throughout the film, which adds weight to the authentic feel. However lovely, though, the plot and character development are things left to be desired.<br /><br />The plot is a rambling stream of consciousness that barely held my interest at the time, and, in retrospect, wasn't that interesting after all.  The character development is thin at best, leaving the audience scratching their proverbial heads as to who these people are, how they are related, and why we should care. (Eventually you get it, but it takes far too long.)  The acting is passable but predictable:  Owen Wilson is a jerk and drives his family nuts, Adrien Brody just looks depressed and brow beaten, and Jason Schwartzman has no depth whatsoever as the youngest, skirt chasing brother.<br /><br />I didn't love it and I didn't hate it.  But nothing about this film made me CARE about it, so I really cannot recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>If you haven't cared for Wes Anderson movies in the past, THE DARJEELING LIMITED will probably not help you get over that hurdle. In my opinion, his flat-out funniest film is still THE ROYAL TENNANBAUMS...but if you don't like that, it's hard to imagine you would like DARJEELING.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're a fan of the quirky, dead-pan, drier than dust humor, coupled with unorthodox camera work (a motionless camera, or a camera that moves side to side but seldom in and out) and fanciful art direction, DARJEELING should be your cup of tea (pun intended).<br /><br />Three estranged brothers, each carrying a load of psychic baggage, come together on a ramshackle train in India to go our a "journey of spiritual growth." This journey has been arranged by the oldest brother, Owen Wilson. He tells them that he wants them to bond and grow close again. And in a way, this is true...but it also appears he wants them to help each other come to terms with the grief over their father's death (although he may not even realize this is a goal) and he has one other destination in mind that is a big secret (which I'll try not to spoil here.)<br /><br />Middle brother is Adrien Brody, who is expecting to become a father any day now, but hasn't even bothered to tell his wife that he's going on this trip. His grief over the loss of his father is mostly obviously displayed, because he is wearing this father's glasses, even though the prescription probably isn't right for him.<br /><br />The youngest brother is Jason Schwartzman, who is grappling with a prolong breakup with his girlfriend (played by Natalie Portman in a little movie called HOTEL CHEVALIER which is now thankfully being played as part of this film's theatrical release. I can't imagine enjoying DARJEELING properly without having seen it). Schwartzman is also a writer, and he has brought with him a handwritten draft of a new short story which obviously has resonance for his brothers.<br /><br />These three are oddballs, to say the least. They really don't belong in India, and really struggle to get along with each other. They are classic Anderson characters, removed from their emotions, full of verbal and physical quirks and tics, supremely intelligent and hugely sad.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film, Bill Murray makes a brief cameo appearance. Is there any actor better at being funny with so much sadness working today? In LOST IN TRANSLATION, his character, while witty, was burdened with sadness. In Anderson's much maligned THE LIFE AQUATIC, Murray is nearly crippled with his sadness. Murray has brought this to an art form not really seen since perhaps the time of Chaplin. So his early appearance in DARJEELING almost helps to set that mood of sadness that permeates virtually every moment of the film. But this does not make it oppressive. The beautiful country of India, the colorful settings (the train itself is a marvel of design) and the off-the-wall incidents that occur keep the audience happily engaged.<br /><br />What I like about Anderson's characters is that they generally do not carry anger. So often in films, characters who are grieving or holding in some other emotion will frequently burst out in anger or violence. It's become an easy clich&eacute;. However, Anderson's characters are sad. They tamp down on that sadness, and when it does bubble up, it's seldom a physical explosion, but more of a collapse. They are touchingly simple moments, usually. Because the characters have spent most of the movie squashing their feelings, when they DO come up, it is all the more effective for the viewer. There are moments in DARJEELING of simple, touching sadness...and they are very effective.<br /><br />So yes, this is not a happy movie. I think in many ways, people are turned off by the films because they are expecting a quirky but harmless comedy. However, in ROYAL TENNANBAUMS, Ben Stiller has a scene of such startling sadness and pain that it is almost too much for the viewer. In LIFE ACQUATIC, Murray's character suffers a very painful loss near the end of the film, taking the viewer into an area that they probably didn't want to go. And DARJEELING has a couple of moments that are totally unexpected, including a scene when the brothers are kicked off the train for bad behavior and wander into a rural village just in time to plunge into some earth-shattering events. I know some viewers and some critics find the change in tone shocking and unwelcome. For me, it was a powerful moment...and a poignant one. Also, a vivid reminder that just because a movie (or life) appears to be going in one direction...don't be surprised if it takes a different turn.<br /><br />All three leads are terrific. It's particularly nice to see Wilson back in form...reminding us that he is capable of something other than the complete goofball he can play in his sleep. Angelica Huston has a small, but critical role and she is very good too.<br /><br />Also, I have to mention the terrific soundtrack. The three obscure songs from The Kinks are highlights for me, and turned the album into a must have! I never dreamed that "Powerman" would ever be used in a film...but it's brilliant.<br /><br />As I wrote this review, I realized that I was going to have to see the movie again this weekend. I can't wait for the DVD release. To me, it was that good. But again, if you don't like Anderson films, you probably won't like this one either (although, I can keep my fingers crossed that you may try anyway...and end up impressed.)</p></br><a href="../users/A29IPLCBZ3LIGX.html">A29IPLCBZ3LIGX</a><br/><p>As a huge fan of the film, I was blown away with the Criterion release.

The relationship between the brothers is very believable and the dialogue and their familiarity add real appeal to the overall story. There are many wonderful scenes and I found Brody's dry delivery of some lines only heightened the humour in them. The storyline is charming, about reconnecting with family and resolving past issues, and it meanders along at a gentle pace, but manages to hold you attention for the whole duration. There is also a short film at the start involving Schwartzman and Natalie Portman which is both touching and a serendipitous addition.

As a whole Anderson's collective works meld into an interesting observation on the quirks of men.  Marketed as a comedy, "The Darjeeling Limited" tackles heavy themes though Anderson's askewed humor is also present.  Topics like life, death, and the fragility of family bonds are present here.  There's a certain poignancy on display here.  This is a demanding film that I think would reward the most ambitious viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>This movie feels no different than any other Wes Anderson film - it has Owen Wilson and Bill Murray and Anjelica Huston in it - and yet, there's something different.  What is it that is not quite the same?  Is it the fact that the film is set in India, that his cast of characters now includes Adrian Brody, or that it's finally been made clear that all the films are intended to run together?  There's nothing in the films any more that can be separated from one another, and maybe that's a good thing - aren't Nobel prizes granted for a cohesive body of work, rather than a single masterpiece?  Non sequitar dialogue, non sequitar scenery, the trademark drift around the location, and the subtle (but hilarious) sight gags - in this one, our protagonists inexplicably buy a cobra at market.  This one has the heavily mustachioed Jason Schwartzman, an actor I don't know but have enjoyed in this film; he also helped to write the screenplay, indicating that he's entered the troupe (maybe he's been in it for a while and I'm only noticing now...).  Flashback scenes where he is clean shaven are interesting for contrast, as is the "play before the movie" sequence with him and Nathalie Portman, playing a slutty something-or-other. The film strikes me as one of the more enjoyable Wes Anderson movies.  I like it.  Bill Murray's small, subtle role is great (some may consider it a mere sight gag), as is the Indian setting, as are the train staff, as are the villagers, as is the tiger.  Go, tiger, go.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>The latest from Wes Anderson, using a lot of the same troupe as usual (Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, etc.) Light but fun movie about three estranged brothers who are called together by the oldest after he has a bike accident (and the an epiphany).

Like all of Anderson's films, some may instantly fall in love with it while others will be rendered perplexed by what the hype is about. I fall somewhere in the middle of those, despite the fact that I consider myself a fan of Wes Anderson having liked all of his movies and having a certain fondness for his quirky, minimalist style. With that said, I'm polarized by The Darjeeling Limited as there's so much to like about it and little that I actually do.<br /><br />The film follows Francis (Owen Wilson), Paul (Adrien Brody), and Jack (Jason Schwartzman, also a co-writer), three brothers who haven't spoken in the year following their father's death. They meet each other on the Darjeeling Limited, a train traveling through India.<br /><br />There is a plot, but not much actually happens in the film. It progresses with the character's, who ride atop Anderson's style like a wave. The plot isn't the film's focal point; it's about character, tone, and style. Anderson has been criticized for valuing style over substance in the past, but this is one of the only films I've seen by the man where I felt compelled to use that criticism. While this is all perception as there are established relationships and/or scenes that may connect with someone on an emotional level, for me, The Darjeeling Limited never transcends something that's dryly humorous and pretty to look at.<br /><br />It's a colorful film that's vibrant, alive, and fun to look at. It uses India as the landscape, but it isn't India so much as it is Anderson's India. The art direction is splendid and transforms India into a world of whimsical fantasy. It's also blessed with brilliant cinematography by Robert Yeoman, who seems to treat each scene like a separate photograph. There is no original score and the film consists mostly of Indian music (some of it lifted from the films of Satyajit Ray) and, as I've come to expect from Anderson, the occasional Rolling Stones song. The score of Anderson's films tend to blend perfectly with his filmmaking style, but his choice of songs throughout the film complement his style just as perfectly as well as capturing the time and place more effectively.<br /><br />The three principal actors give perfectly low-key performances, as well as capturing the chemistry necessary to actually convey that they're brothers. Brody, Wilson, and Schwartzman have a nice rapport with each other that is very convincing. Famed director Barbet Schroeder has a small role as does Anjelica Huston, although her role is much larger in the schemes of things just not in actual screen-time. In addition, Anderson regular Bill Murray makes a cameo rushing as a businessman rushing to catch his train in the opening scene. Anderson's unique, wry sense of humor is present throughout and it works as a result of being perfectly in tune with his actors. There are some scenes and lines of dialogue that may make you think Anderson invented the art of subtlety, as they sneak in so quietly they may go completely over your head.<br /><br />Some of Anderson's films are less accessible than others and The Darjeeling Limited may be one of those films. Those familiar with his style will be pleased, if not completely thrilled...But those new to Anderson may be perplexed and confused by it. I'm not new to Anderson and I was even a bit perplexed by it. It's not a great film, but besides my gripe with its preference of style over substance, there are no obvious flaws; it just never reveals itself as a great film. Perhaps, like many Criterion titles, it takes time to absorb it and multiple viewings to appreciate it; but The Darjeeling Limited lacks a certain sincerity and coherency for me, which seems essential for a film dealing with such complex human emotions.<br /><br />The 13-minute short film that precedes the film is Hotel Chevalier, starring Schwartzman and Natalie Portman, which is simply about Jack's former lover unexpectedly arriving at his hotel in Paris. I haven't read too much acclaim for this short and few mention it except to say that it fills in some information left unexplained in the film, but I found this poignant, minimalistic short superb. Hotel Chevalier has style and substance in perfect harmony, with Anderson managing to express so much with so little. Relying on very short, vague dialogue and the two actor's facial expressions; Anderson succeeds at conveying some pretty complex emotions in a very artistic, poetic, and lovely way. Even as a stand-alone short, Hotel Chevalier is something special and highly overlooked.<br /><br />The new 2-disc Criterion DVD is a lovely addition to the Criterion catalogue and there's not a complaint to be had about it. It has exactly what you'd expect from a Criterion release including the film, the short film, and enough bonus features to keep the most ardent lover of this film happy for several hours. And, of course the artwork by Eric Chase Anderson looks terrific as usual. If you like this movie and you own the previous edition, you may find this Criterion version worth picking up.<br /><br />THE DARJEELING LIMITED: B-<br />HOTEL CHEVALIER: A-<br />CRITERION RELEASE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>I watched this movie with my two Indian, yoga-teacher neighbors. I kind of feared the worst with Hollywood actors doing their thing - in India. But I was pleasantly surprised. I've been to India twice and felt that except for the 'inside the train' scenes themselves, India was more or less realistically conveyed, and the actors (or story) didn't have them making total fools of themselves.  Well, except for when they bought that poisonous snake, maybe.. but basically they were likeable.<br /><br />Much of the story seemed to be taking place in Rajasthan, or along the lines of the middle north west (you won't see Darjeeling). It was beautifully shot, though truth be told, it's not hard to get beautiful shots in India. Still, I've seen movies shot in other countries (which I've been to) that completely do not capture the feeling of the place and people. This one rather does (minus the 'on-the-train' scenes), though focus is on the actors of course. It's not bad riding along with them on a journey through India. If you ever wondered what it might be like looking out the window while riding through, say Rajasthan, here's your chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Probably one of the better questions asked on this journey.  Wes Anderson takes the audience on yet another humorous voyage of discovery aboard the Darjeeling Limited, but not without a little misdirection first.  Just when you think this is going to be another movie with Bill Murray, Adrien Brody overtakes the "businessman" on the railway platform and leaps aboard the departing train, joining his brothers in a first class cabin where they are treated to sweet limes by the lovely Rita.<br /><br />Anderson returns to an early format, Bottle Rocket, in setting up this spiritual journey led by the intrepid Owen Wilson.  Jason Schwartzman, who gets writing credits this time around, fills out the trio.  The movie drifts along at the pace you would expect from Anderson, less a travelogue of India than it is a clever study on fraternal relations.  We do get a spicy taste of India, replete with a splendid array of colors and a very touching sequence of events in an Indian village, not to mention another fun soundtrack drawing on the Kinks, Stones and even Joe Dassin.  The brothers finally do seem to reforge their bond, with an ironic wink.<br /><br />The DVD includes the all important "Hotel Chevalier," cast in warm yellow tones, that is referred to throughout the film, underscored by Peter Sarstedt's wonderful "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)".  It provides important clues to Schwartzman's character and features a fetching Natalie Portman as Jack's girlfriend.  See it first.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I've seen one too many "let's look at India but not the REAL India" movies lately.  Fortunately, this isn't one of them.  Instead, it's a movie where India is a backdrop to be ignored, aside from one totally unnecessary subplot about sex that could not happen.<br /><br />Rather, this is an observant and very watchable film about three brothers who set out on a "spiritual journey" in which they never get out of themselves long enough to notice anything else.  Good chemistry, great acting, sharp writing, and a fine movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Wes Anderson intended this small comedy as a tribute to the great Indian film director Satyajit Ray, and it's as if he entirely missed the point of Ray's stately and subtle examinations of Indian life. Ray made everything small seem greatly more important by his careful attention to detail; Anderson here reduces just about everything into insignificance, including the entire nation of India itself, which is photographed stunningly but is treated in his screenplay as little more than merely a wacky backdrop for the screenplay's three annoying brothers, as if it were the Marx Brothers' Freedonia.<br /><br />The brotherly tensions don't seem much of an advance over the family depicted in THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (again, the central family is rooted firmly in the leisured classes). But Anderson makes this even more tedious through his absolutely ghastly idea of making the eldest and dominant brother, Francis, an obsessive control freak, whose endless petty bullying we're supposed to find charming and adorable. (Even worse, he cast Owen Wilson in the part.) The film has a horrible case of the cutes, and it depends far too much upon images of the three brothers peering surreptitiously at one another and others through train windows. There are a few stunningly photographed sequences, but the whole thing feels far too much like hearing an annoyingly privileged and self-involved twentysomething hipster tell you at endless length about his awesome recent trip to find himself in India.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>If you haven't cared for Wes Anderson movies in the past, THE DARJEELING LIMITED will probably not help you get over that hurdle.  In my opinion, his flat-out funniest film is still THE ROYAL TENNANBAUMS...but if you don't like that, it's hard to imagine you would like DARJEELING.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're a fan of the quirky, dead-pan, drier than dust humor, coupled with unorthodox camera work (a motionless camera, or a camera that moves side to side but seldom in and out) and fanciful art direction, DARJEELING should be your cup of tea (pun intended).<br /><br />Three estranged brothers, each carrying a load of psychic baggage, come together on a ramshackle train in India to go our a "journey of spiritual growth."  This journey has been arranged by the oldest brother, Owen Wilson.  He tells them that he wants them to bond and grow close again.  And in a way, this is true...but it also appears he wants them to help each other come to terms with the grief over their father's death (although he may not even realize this is a goal) and he has one other destination in mind that is a big secret (which I'll try not to spoil here.)<br /><br />Middle brother is Adrien Brody, who is expecting to become a father any day now, but hasn't even bothered to tell his wife that he's going on this trip.  His grief over the loss of his father is mostly obviously displayed, because he is wearing this father's glasses, even though the prescription probably isn't right for him.<br /><br />The youngest brother is Jason Schwartzman, who is grappling with a prolong breakup with his girlfriend (played by Natalie Portman in a little movie called HOTEL CHEVALIER which is now thankfully being played as part of this film's theatrical release.  I can't imagine enjoying DARJEELING properly without having seen it).  Schwartzman is also a writer, and he has brought with him a handwritten draft of a new short story which obviously has resonance for his brothers.<br /><br />These three are oddballs, to say the least.  They really don't belong in India, and really struggle to get along with each other.  They are classic Anderson characters, removed from their emotions, full of verbal and physical quirks and tics, supremely intelligent and hugely sad.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film, Bill Murray makes a brief cameo appearance.  Is there any actor better at being funny with so much sadness working today?  In LOST IN TRANSLATION, his character, while witty, was burdened with sadness.  In Anderson's  much maligned THE LIFE AQUATIC, Murray is nearly crippled with his sadness.  Murray has brought this to an art form not really seen since perhaps the time of Chaplin.  So his early appearance in DARJEELING almost helps to set that mood of sadness that permeates virtually every moment of the film.  But this does not make it oppressive.  The beautiful country of India, the colorful settings (the train itself is a marvel of design) and the off-the-wall incidents that occur keep the audience happily engaged.<br /><br />What I like about Anderson's characters is that they generally do not carry anger.  So often in films, characters who are grieving or holding in some other emotion will frequently burst out in anger or violence.  It's become an easy clich&eacute;.  However, Anderson's characters are sad.  They tamp down on that sadness, and when it does bubble up, it's seldom a physical explosion, but more of a collapse.  They are touchingly simple moments, usually.  Because the characters have spent most of the movie squashing their feelings, when they DO come up, it is all the more effective for the viewer.  There are moments in DARJEELING of simple, touching sadness...and they are very effective.<br /><br />So yes, this is not a happy movie.  I think in many ways, people are turned off by the films because they are expecting a quirky but harmless comedy.  However, in ROYAL TENNANBAUMS, Ben Stiller has a scene of such startling sadness and pain that it is almost too much for the viewer.  In LIFE ACQUATIC, Murray's character suffers a very painful loss near the end of the film, taking the viewer into an area that they probably didn't want to go.  And DARJEELING has a couple of moments that are totally unexpected, including a scene when the brothers are kicked off the train for bad behavior and wander into a rural village just in time to plunge into some earth-shattering events.  I know some viewers and some critics find the change in tone shocking and unwelcome.  For me, it was a powerful moment...and a poignant one.  Also, a vivid reminder that just because a movie (or life) appears to be going in one direction...don't be surprised if it takes a different turn.<br /><br />All three leads are terrific.  It's particularly nice to see Wilson back in form...reminding us that he is capable of something other than the complete goofball he can play in his sleep.  Angelica Huston has a small, but critical role and she is very good too.<br /><br />Also, I have to mention the terrific soundtrack.  The three obscure songs from The Kinks are highlights for me, and turned the album into a must have!  I never dreamed that "Powerman" would ever be used in a film...but it's brilliant.<br /><br />As I wrote this review, I realized that I was going to have to see the movie again this weekend.  I can't wait for the DVD release.  To me, it was that good.  But again, if you don't like Anderson films, you probably won't like this one either (although, I can keep my fingers crossed that you may try anyway...and end up impressed.)</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Three brother on a vision quest to see their mother<br />who has become a nun in India learn something about life and death and friendship.<br />Wisdom is probably not included in their rewards for the road trip.<br />But becoming brothers again has a value.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>Three American brothers (Brody, Wilson and Schwartzman) meet in India to take a train trip aboard the Darjeeling Limited.  Their ostensible purpose is to re-bond after the death of their father, to seek enlightenment and pursue a spiritual journey.  Later, it develops that the ulterior motive for one of the brothers (Owen Wilson) organizing the trip is to connect with their mother (Angelica Huston), who currently lives as a nun in an isolated Indian monastery.<br /><br />They encounter their mother, who was reluctant to receive them.  Yet, they do not find the closure that they were seeking and that they hoped for.  At the movie's end, they sprint with their luggage to catch their departing train, eventually jumping aboard after tossing their baggage.  Maybe they had baggage they were carrying around about the death of their father and their relationship with their mother.<br /><br />The movie is flagged as a comedy.  I'm not sure I laughed once in 90 minutes.  It is on the verge of being funny, on the verge of being profound.<br /><br />Instead, I give it two stars and three NO-DOZ, to help you stay awake while watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>The Darjeeling Limited packs a punch! There's lots of action, drama, comedy and suspense in this film--it grabbed my attention and it never let go until the very end. The cinematography and the choreography were brilliantly done; and the acting was very convincing. The plot moves along at a good pace although I suppose they could have cut a couple of minutes here or there; but that is a minor issue.<br /><br />When the action starts, three estranged brothers who haven't even spoken for a year get together in India for what one of them, Francis L. Whitman (Owen Wilson), says is a spiritual journey so that they can connect again. Francis and his two brothers Peter L. Whitman (Adrian Brody) and Jack L. Whitman (Jason Schwartzman) all have unresolved issues. Nevertheless, they all meet just as Francis tells them to and they begin their journey across India on a train called The Darjeeling Limited.<br /><br />The character quirks make them so human, too. Francis is the control freak who even hires an assistant, Brendan (Wallace Wolodarsky) to make laminated daily "itineraries" so that every moment is structured. Peter is having a baby with his wife Alice from whom he simply "expects" to divorce someday; and Jack is estranged from his former girlfriend. Jack can't get her off his mind; we see that in the introduction to the movie when Jack and his ex (Natalie Portman) are alone together and later on in the actual film when he keeps checking her answering machine to monitor her incoming messages.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the brothers pick up a snake and when the snake gets loose the train conductor isn't exactly happy about having a snake onboard the train. The brothers alienate themselves even further from the train conductor when one of them accidentally breaks a glass window--the brothers go from being confined to their cabins to getting kicked off the train! Then the REAL adventure begins--they continue their journey. On their way, they find three boys drowning; and sadly they can only save two of the three young boys. The funeral for the dead youth immediately brings back memories of their father's funeral one year earlier.<br /><br />But there's still more. Their mother, Patricia Whitman (Anjelica Huston), has run off to be a nun. When Francis finally tells his brothers that the real reason they're in India is to find their mother and ask her why she wasn't at their father's funeral Peter and Jack feel very uncertain about things.<br /><br />Do they get to see their mother--and, if they do, how will that go? She might not want to see them. There's also a man-eating tiger about; will that cause these three men any danger? And what about their own issues of sibling rivalry--how will those feelings be dealt with when the brothers are together on this long journey? Will there be a problem when Jack has some romantic time alone with Rita (Amara Karan), the stewardess on The Darjeeling Limited? Watch and find out!<br /><br />The DVD has a featurette on the making of the film entitled The Darjeeling Limited: Walking Tour; and the music is very pretty.<br /><br />The Darjeeling Limited is an outstanding film that hits home with spot on performances by great actors. The people in this film could be taking this type of trip just about anywhere and at just about any point in time; it's truly about emotions, sibling relationships, relationships between adult children and their parents and the realities of life and death. I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Precious, in any case, is a word with two meanings, which both might apply to "The Darjeeling Limited." This shaggy-dog road trip, in which three semi-estranged brothers travel by rail across India, is unstintingly fussy, vain and self-regarding. But it is also a treasure: an odd, flawed, but nonetheless beautifully handmade object as apt to win affection as to provoke annoyance. You might say that it has sentimental value." AO Scott<br /><br />Surrounded by the vision of India, we find two brothers joining the third on a voyage across India. Frank, played by Owen Wilson, has convened the group to bond, as they once did. Frank has his head and face swathed in bandages, after he tried to "off" himself by running his motorcycle into a tree. Their father died a year ago, their mother left then to join a convent,  and we are left to wonder 'what is this all about'?  Adrian Brody plays Peter, and he wears his father's sunglasses, and tells his brothers that their father loved him best. Jason Schwartman plays Jack, the youngest and the one who loves the  sweet lime and the sweet women.<br /><br />So, here they are, each of them with several pairs of Louis Vuitton baggage left by their father, traipsing across India trying to loosen and leave their virtual baggage behind. They travel by train until they so annoy the Indian conductor he throws them off. Then by foot and taxi, off they go. We learn a little bit about each of them. They meet up with their mother who has become a nun in a monastery, and there they try to unload their emotions. She listens but apparently it doesn' take. Frank tries to let go of his scars. Peter tells them his girlfriend is about to deliver a son, and he is confused about it all. Jack breaks into his ex-girlfriends voice mail and relishes what he learns.  All in all a melancholy trip, a humorous trip and a compelling trip. I found the films a little on the weird side, but I could not stop watching. What was going to occur next? We never  know what is around the corner- it keeps us off-guard.  Did the brothers achieve their goal? The layers of emotion come undone in a way when they confront their mother, the nun, played by Angelica Houston, in a role like none other.<br /><br />"The movie meanders. It will therefore inspire reviews complaining that it doesn't fly straight as an arrow at its target. But it doesn't have a target, either. Why do we have to be the cops and enforce a narrow range of movie requirements? Anderson is like Dave Brubeck, who I'm listening to right now. He knows every note of the original song, but the fun and genius come in the way he noodles around. And in his movie's cast, especially with Owen Wilson, Anderson takes advantage of champion noodlers." Roger Ebert<br /><br />Jack, the youngest listens on his IPod to a song that will stay with you throughout the movie and swirl around your head. The song by Peter Sarstedt 'Where Do You Go To My Lovely?" It is a lilting, catchy song that resonates with me.<br /><br />'But where do you go to my lovely<br />When you're alone in your bed<br />Tell me the thoughts that surround you<br />I want to look inside your head'<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 05-13-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024JC30">The Big Bounce (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLT5">The Pianist</a></p></br></body></html>

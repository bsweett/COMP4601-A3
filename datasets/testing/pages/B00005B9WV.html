As a Johnny come lately to the world of DVD, and a rare theatergoer, my excuse is that I am simply slow on the uptake.  In addition, I am a bit of a rebel which means that I usually thing that 10 million viewers cant possible be right.  It is also difficult to have something interesting to say when you are the thousandth reviewer.<p>Like just about everyone else, I agree that this is an exceptional film, especially in its genre as a Hong Kong fight film, but also as a piece of filmic art.  Certainly, the cinematography is immaculate.  I felt transported to a magical China.  Whether the scenes are panoramic vistas, visions of life in Chinese towns, or close settings in homes or caves, Ang Lee has spared no effort as being breathtaking and realistic.  While the story is not unique, it is well presented, and the actors quite believable.  It has several layers, the most important being the difficult role of strong women in Chinese culture.  Perhaps the least important being the retrieval of the sword Green Destiny, stolen by young Jen who desperately does not want to become a noble Chinese homemaker, although that is the source of the plot.<p>What makes the film special in its genre is the focus on emotions and personal feelings, rather than fight scenes and bravado.  I'm going to be honest though, this is still a Hong Kong fight film, one where the players pause from the spectacular fight sequences to do some pretty professional emoting.  Good stuff, but don't fall for the hype that makes the film sound like the next Doctor Zhivago.  It is a very strong fight film with surprising depths, but it is not a dramatic masterpiece<p>The thing I liked least was the wirework.  It simply goes too far.  The actors dance across the rooftops like Peter Pan and Wendy, with nary a thump, bonk or rustle.  They never quite touch down and it is rare that someone actually is hit.  Even in anime, where characters float about all the time, a hit is a hit and things bend when you land on them.  It is very hard to take a fight seen seriously when the actors float about like leaves.  One the other hand, the choreography is amazing, and it is surprising that no one ever accidentally does major damage to themselves or someone else.<p>I'm only giving the film a four simply because I disagree with critics like Joe Siegel who declared this 'One of the greatest movies ever made.'  This is hype, and distorts the real values of the film.  It demonstrated that a genre that is rarely treated seriously is capable of being much more than it has been until now.  Hopefully, this trend will continue.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>I really hate it when people hype movies up for me. I'm not talking about public hype, or critics reviews or things of that sort; what I'm referring to is the people that tell you that a certain movie is the best movie ever made, and then divulge into the elements of it, drawing you into a conversation about everything that the movie is and what it stands for, and everything that they felt watching the movie, so that after they finally shut up, all you can think about is going to see that movie. <p>This, believe it or not, happened to be the case with &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; a movie that everyone and his brother kept telling me about. Now, before everyone starts hounding me for not liking this movie, let me clarify to all of you that I did like it. I found it to be a very good movie, one of the better martial arts films ever. Instead of providing a lame story for the purpose of using the martial arts formula, the backbone is one of passion, adventure, all of which has an overall fantasy-like appearance that draws us in and keeps us in its clutches. But I did expect a little more out of it. <p>Set in 19th century China, the movie begins with Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), a well-known warrior, giving his legendary sword, known as the Green Destiny, to his longtime friend, Sir Te. Just as quickly as it arrives, it is stolen from Sir Te, and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who delivered the gift, suspects that the new arrivals residing in Governor Yu's home are responsible. Mu Bai has his own suspicions, which are confirmed when he realizes that the thief is Jade Fox, the powerful female warrior responsible for the death of his master long ago.<p>With her, Fox carries a disciple, Jen (Zhang Ziyi), who possesses great fighting capabilities. The movie ventures into a long continuous memory through her eyes, recalling her past love affair with a bandit named Lo (Chang Chen), who returns to rekindle their love. Meanwhile, as the battle for the sword and justice swells, Shu Lien and Mu Bai also recognize their mutual feelings for one another, all mounting to a very emotionally powerful climax where the unexpected suddenly becomes a reality. <p>The movie certainly does prove a point that American-made martial arts films pale sorely in comparison to the grandeur of the stunts and action sequences performed here. Choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, best known for his work on the stunts in &quot;The Matrix,&quot; brings a highly-stylized visual flare to the stunts performed by the actors themselves in this film. While the action and fight sequences are meant to be stunning, they are never totally suspenseful, however, nor do they need to be. <p>This is not a film that's all about swordplay and running across rooftops, even if most people will remember it for such scenes. It's also about the intense passion between the characters and the love they share for one another. Lo and Jen's encounter and budding romance is better than anything I've ever seen in a movie in a very long time; Lo's one line, &quot;I am a man, and I've found the brightest star of all,&quot; sells us on their romance and it's believability. While the romance between Shu Lien and Mu Bai takes a backseat to the heated passion of the aforementioned couple, it is still no less captivating once the final third of the movie plays out. <p>The setting itself is worth the price of admission. China, or nature for that matter, never looked so beautiful and exquisite. The night skies cast blue hues on everything they touch, adding to that dreamy look and feel that the movie gives off. Scenic shots and panoramic views add to the beauty and texture of the setting, while also giving off that fantastical feeling. <p>The movie also portrays a very dignified Chinese society. Their use of common etiquette, even in some fight scenes, is quite intriguing, while their calmness and sense of peace is also portrayed through the characters. Actors Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Chang Chen and Zhang Ziyi portray their characters with all of these emotions and traits, exuding a peaceful demeanor even in some of the more physically charged scenes. And director Ang Lee made an excellent choice of keeping the movie from ever getting too fast-paced or over-the-top; he knows his pacing, and it's right on the money. <p>So what is it about this movie I didn't like? Nothing, really. Everything about it is epic in nature, the performances are stellar, the martial arts impressive and well-done, the setting lush and breathtaking, and the overall effect tear-jerking at certain moments. What ruined this film experience for me was not the movie itself, but people making it out to be something more than it is, which is no fault of the filmmakers at all. Still, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is an impressive and beautiful achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a TRUE WORK OF ART. I rented this DVD last night and at first I was skeptical because I have never cared much for martial arts movies, but due to the buzz and and my own yearning to see it I did and man was I surprised. This movie is AMAZING the landscapes are beautiful and the fight scenes are just down right the BEST choreagraphed I have ever seen on screen. I like how the main characters come across as these spiritual yet very smart and respected people who respect the power that the sword gives it's user. The cast MICHELLE YEOH and YUN-FAT CHOW give this movie a quality that no martial arts movie has ever had, TRULY GREAT ACTING! I loved the way the characters would seem to amaze me as they jumped and glided through the air. The movie is based upon this amazing sword that is stolen by someone in the village. After Michelle Yeoh's character almost catches the culprit, the theif soon gets away with the sword and gives the them a run for there money when fighting in battle as she was taught a gifted form of martial arts by one of the greats in China. The movie does have a sad ending that i will not give away but I will say it is flying high! Check this movie out it is so AWESOME! I will be buying this DVD soon! Great Cast and Great MOVIE!</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>Call it what you will--archetypal fable with a feminist twist, exquisitely choreographed martial arts movie, balletic spectacle balancing image, action, poetry and music--&quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; is a distinctive variation on familiar genres.  The words &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;choreography,&quot; &quot;Eastern&quot; exotic myth don't quite do justice in describing the film.  For one, the action sequences are lightning swift--reminiscent of American silent comedies and more suggestive of music than of formal dance.  And certainly the tempo of this music and the pace of the film seem more Western than Eastern (as does the throbbing romantic cello of YoYo Ma).  Some will single out the three female leads in this rite-of-passage archetypal story as the film's most distinctive twist.  But even more novel is the way the form foregrounds allegory and approaches the theme of teaching and learning.  Film is a medium that is normally &quot;relentless&quot; in his  representation of the physical world, satisfying viewers' expectations of actions that are at least humanly plausible.  But by making his characters fly all over the frame, director Lee keeps reminding the spectator that if you try to respond this film as another action movie you will not only miss the point entirely but be thoroughly disappointed.  Sword play, flying, and fighting are metaphors for living, learning and loving.  All of the 5 principals in the story are learners--and all are failures to greater and lesser degrees.  In fact, the alleged villain, Jade Fox, is in some respects the most sympathetic of all the characters.  She had access to the most masterful swordsman of all but not to his teaching because of her status as a woman.  At one point sword play is compared with word play, or writing (through the picture-grams of Mandarese script).  Whether the instrument is a sword, a pen, or a brush, the viewer of this enchanting parable is finally enjoined to fashion a personal narrative that rejects pride and selfishness in favor of a life sufficiently disciplined to give itself over to love.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>It's been a decade since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXR4">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a> first came out, and there have been dozens of copycat and other Chinese epic movies in the meantime, but this one is still the best. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXR4">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a> is chock full of strong characters, beautiful music, and exciting fight scenes. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh make an excellent pair as warriors who try to suppress their feelings. Moreover, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXR4">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a> has a lot of heart. The movie doesn't have a lot of violence or special effects, but rather really focuses on the four main characters and their development. I'd go so far as to say that this is he best Chinese-language film so far.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Legendary martial artist Li Mu Bai is tracking the murderer of his master. The poised and self-assured Li can handle anything -- except his feelings for lithe, pantherish Yu Shu Lien. Jen Yu, the tremulous and spoiled daughter of the Province's governor, is also fascinated by Shu Lien's glamorous life: that a woman can have so many adventures and such freedom is marvelous to her. Though the refined Jen is soon to be married off into respectability, she harbors a sinister plan. By night she transforms into a masked and cunning thief, out to steal the Green Destiny, an invincible blade once wielded by Li. At the same time, Li embarks on his own quest to recover the missing sword, possibly the key to his master's murder. This movie is a bona fide masterpiece, as beautiful as it is dangerous.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>I never expected to fall in love with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  The fact it happened to be foreign (insert "I have to read it?" now) didn't help my eagerness to see it during its initial release--but I did and, man, what a ride!  The fight scenes are brilliant and the poetic music only adds to its mass appeal; the acting, even in Mandarin-language, is brilliant and believable.  The story is solid and the filming is amazing as well.  Crouching Tiger is one of those movies that possess something magical.  The ending is one of the biggest heartache-inducing finales of any dramatic film in history in my opinion.  Crouching is poetic and beautiful, stellar and amazing.  This is THE foreign film to own!</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>With 10 Oscar nominations, that would certainly be enough to intrigue the average viewer, but it could be argued that this should have been the first film in history to win both Best Foreign Film and Best Picture.  Everyone I know who has seen this sparkling film and the film "Gladiator," which took home the Best Picture award, give a unanimous gasp at how that could have possibly happened.  The cinematography in this film is lush and just plain gorgeous!  The costumes are intricate and beautiful!  While the story is great fantasy laced with fantastic fight-choreography with many different weapons, not to mention hand-to-hand combat, and has an emotional depth not seen in most foreign films.  This is simply a great film!  Many are turned off by the "Peter Pan" fantasy elements of this extraodinary folk-tale, but I loved every moment, feeling like "if that's going to be possible in this movie, then anything could be."  What a delightful idea!</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Shot entirely in mainland China, and using the most modern technical effects, this video has the best martial arts action scenes I have ever seen.  Subtitled in Chinese, the story is simple to follow.  Yun-Fat Chow of &quot;Anna and the King&quot; is cast as the hero who is searching for the killer of his master.  But the film belongs entirely to the women.  Michelle Yeoh is cast as the woman warrior who has not married him because of family complications; not only is she an accomplished martial artist, but this role calls for some serious acting. There's an older woman Pei-pei Cheng, another fantastic martial artist who plays the villain.  But the most memorable performance of all is by the young Ziyi Zhang in the role of the young teenager who steals a sacred sword and flees from her arranged marriage.<p>The fight scenes are absolutely spectacular!  Choreographed with exquisite artistry, they mostly feature the women.  You have to suspend a bit of belief in the real world though, because these sword fighters have the ability to walk up walls,  leap a dozen stories high, and even fly.  But it's all done so well, that I just sat and watched in amazement, the story merely a backdrop to this action.  Feminists will applaud this film;  it demonstrates women's physical strength and endurance like no other.  Yes, it is violent, but the fact that it is fantasy dilutes that effect.  And themes of love, honor and vengeance drive the story forward.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AD9WTAOAFUZA4.html">AD9WTAOAFUZA4</a><br/><p>I don't see how anyone can possibly give this film anything less than 5+ stars (if I could, I'd give it six.)  Some folks simply refuse to sit through Foreign Language flicks, and ultimately, they are losing out on experiencing a magical epic that deserves a hallowed spot atop any Top Ten list.  The special effects are dazzling as the cast literally flies, straddles tree tops and scales walls at 90 degree angles.  The cast is brilliant, especially the starring female leads, both of whom deserved Oscar nods (again, the foreign language aspect most likely kept them out of consideration).  In every way, Ang Lee completely (and seemingly effortlessly) surprises and engages each viewer.  I found myself gasping, clapping and oohing at the screen, despite seeing it by myself (again, my American friends resisted the Mandarin, though english dubbed and subtitled versions are available on DVD, but never/rarely are they as good as the original.)  I am not one for martial arts, nor for flights of fantasy.  Nor, for that matter, do I attend war flicks or action/adverture movies that often.  But this film has stuck with me now for over a year and is likely to remain in my heart and mind forever.  Read the subtitles, and miss this movie at your own risk - it is far superior to &quot;Gladiator&quot; and completely unprecedented in terms of Ang Lee's past brilliant successes (from &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; to &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; to &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; - all favorites of mine - nothing ever prepared me for this magical odessey!)  Easily one of the best films released in the past 50 years, and sure to rank high in future AFI lists, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; earns its stripes and its 5 stars in every scene, in every sequence, and in every way!  You will be inspired and awed by this instant classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>The remarkable thing about this movie is not its narrative.  Taken from a book by Du Lu Wang (which has been described in more than one place as "pulp"), there are elements within that we've all seen before: the headstrong young girl not wanting to go through with her arranged marriage; the smoldering but never realized love between two friends; the "you killed my master twenty years ago so now you must die" plot device.  These are not original.  Doesn't matter.<p>Take a look at what director Ang Lee puts on the screen.  On one hand, it's just gorgeous.  Witness the first crane-shot of Peking, the labyrinthine compound of Governor Yu, the desert, the reed forest, and the peasant village.  All are presented with wonderfully composed shots, which calls to mind haiku poetry rather than cinema.  On the other hand, it's kinetic and exhilarating.  I'm talking, of course, of the wonderful fight scenes.  Akin to "The Matrix", yes (same choreographer), but different in a very important way.  Whereas "The Matrix" was riddled with bullets and explosions, "Crouching Tiger" works well with its silences.  The Wudan warriors are economical in their movements, whether they are gliding on air, or wielding a sword.  Thus, the fight scenes are compact and quick, rather than flashy and fast.  And they are just astounding to watch.  My favourite pits Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) against Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) in the reed forest.  If you can suspend your disbelief, then I guarantee you'll see nothing as wondrous in the cinema this year.  The forest bends and sways as the combatants perform a samurai-like duel as if walking on tightropes.  Not to be outdone, Jen has two magnificent fights with Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), one at night in the courtyard and one in Yu's training ground.  They are both balletic and engrossing.<p>The actors here are all top notch.  Chow is strong as steel, yet manages litheness unparalleled in my memory.  There's a quiet scene near the middle of the film, where he practices Tai Chi like movements (with a warrior's edge) alone in a courtyard.  It's almost as thrilling to watch his power and grace in this scene than in his fight scenes.  Throw in his thespian eyes and you've got a real charismatic star.  Only he's not really the star, is he?  He takes a backseat in terms of screen time to the two women.  And they surely deserve it.  Yeoh is all quiet dignity, fierce intelligence, and repressed emotion.  Yet she can kick your ass six ways from Sunday if provoked properly.  Contrast this with the determination and passion that newcomer Zhang brings, and you see why Chow wasn't needed all that much.  Throw in a charismatic Chen Chang as Lo (he supplies both the love interest and comic relief), and you have a fine ensemble cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>I disagree with the reviewers who complain that this movie is nothing more than another martial arts movie.  This movie combines its own mythology with the atmosphere of ancient China and the timeless themes of honor and love.  There's plenty of action for those who like fast paced films, but there's also depth and excellent acting/characterizations for those of us who want to take more away from a movie than a few entertaining hours.<p>To greatly simplify the plot: a business woman who is also a warrior (despite the taboos of both) arrives in Beijing with a legendary sword entrusted to her by the man she loves.  When the sword is stolen, a heart-racing series of events are set into motion.  The sword must be recovered, the culprit caught, order restored. Beneath the surface, the unfilled love between the aging business woman and the owner of the sword simmers, especially as the story of a headstrong young noblewoman unfolds.  <p>Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeon, as the platonic and honor-bound couple, play their roles with quiet confidence, giving their characters extraordinary range with the smallest of gestures.  Even newcomer Zhang Ziyi carries her role as the stubborn and talented daughter of a dignitary with aplomb.  Ang Lee has directed a winner that deserves a place among classics.  I am completely amazed at his ability to stage the dramatic battle scenes, evoke an ancient culture, and still inject a tremendous amount of humanity in what is, at its most basic, an action film.  The result is a warm and lyrical tale, visually stunning and heartfelt.<p>I know much has been made of the special effects used to animate the fighting.  To those who say its lack of realism detracts from the movie, I say you missed the point.  The gravity defying leaps and the straight-up-the-wall running highlight the mythology.  We are meant to take these events not only literally but as symbols of something greater.  <p>The DVD provides special features that are all well done and interesting, although, as with all DVD's, I wish they were more substantial.  <p>I highly recommend this movie.  My whole family adored it - from my thirteen year old daughter to my husband.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is Lee Ang's one of the most visionary and laudable efforts since Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility. The movie boasts an well-ensembled cast with sublime performances especially from the feisty Jen (Zhang Ziyi) and the subtle, mellow Mu Bai (Chow Yuen Fatt). It is an epic of swordsplay in virtuoso and the bitter legendary world where honor collides with passion, obligations and trust. At first glance, it is not difficult to notice its prime attractions - beautiful cinematography from the award-winning Peter Pau and the energetic and sleek martial arts movements supervised by Yuen Wo Ping (The Matrix). However, it defies categorisation of the Wuxia fable to reach deep and dissect each character's emotional trauma and restraint. Michelle Yeoh is casted as Yu Shu Lien, a dignified swordswoman whose destiny criss-crossed with the infamous &quot;Green Destiny&quot;. There she joins forces with Li to find the sword - only to be obstructed by Jen, who aims for power in the Wuxia world. <p>Lee Ang's adaptation of the fable by Wang Du Lu focuses distinctly on the character's development. Jen is trapped by the betrayal of her mentor and her duties to her family; the dramatic tragedy of unrequited romance between Li and Yu - their fates are intertwined by the sword which is the centrestage of the movie. It is at once a human drama tinged with bittersweet regrets for the warring hearts. Enhanced by the poetry of the cinematography and the enchanting score by Tao Dun, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon can probably roar and spear ahead in the race for Oscar. It is unequivocally the most refreshing piece of work this year.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Chinese martial arts films had found a market in the West during the Kung Fu boom initiated by Bruce Lee in the early 1970s... But "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" represents a new departure, an attempt to produce a sophisticated, big-budget Chinese film that would appeal both to mainstream Western audiences and to audiences in the Far East... Through their quest to find the stolen sword of Green Destiny, warriors Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) explore themes of love, loyalty and sacrifice...<br /><br />Ang Lee was an astute choice as director... The location shooting was on the Chinese mainland and the actors came from Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as China... Instead of the Shaolin school of martial arts favored by Bruce Lee, Ang Lee opted for the more spiritual form of Wudan; brute force is replace by scenes of balletic grace as opponents climb up walls or flit through tree-tops...<br /><br />The widespread success of the film is a firm indication that Chinese culture is making its mark...</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Crouching Tiger" is a blessing, a film that singlehandedly elevates the guilty pleasure of chop-sockey flicks to high art.  <p>Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh are perfectly cast as lovers who are united by their past yet forbidden to act on that love by their code of honor.  These talented actors say all there is to say with meaningful glances, conveying their mixed emotions of desire and regret.  (The dialogue is also surprisingly good for a "kung fu flick," but is much more effective in Chinese with Engish sub-titles rather than dubbed in English.)<p>Still, this movie is first and foremost a martial arts film -- albeit one with a heck of a love story.  Two fight scenes in particular - an early one at night in a courtyard and a later scene in a sparring room - steal the entire movie.  World-class athleticism combined with astounding choreography and a heart-pounding soundtrack -- sheer bliss!  <p>"Crouching Tiger" gives us heroes to cheer, villains to hiss, and colorful sidekicks to make us smile.  Put this all together with stunning camerawork and a heart-breaking climax, and you've got yourself one heck of a picture!  <p>The only criticism of the DVD is the relative paltry offering of extras.  But I'd rather have a great film with few extras than a mediocre film with a ton of goodies on the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>An interesting and refreshing cinematic experience, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is a bit overhyped, though. The plot is not all that original, as it takes from many oriental movies of the same genre. However, the acting, direction, score and settings make this effort stand out and shine. The fight sequences could be ridiculous and childish, still director Ang Lee injects a sense of style and beauty in most of them and achieves something unique. This is a well-crafted story that manages to be compelling and thought-provoking. It`s also a good alternative to most Hollywood full around, presenting something that tries to innovate and deliver a somewhat surprising achievement. The characters are tragic and flawed enough, and the basic concept of good vs bad actually works here. The ending is particularly poetic and moving, providing a memorable finale to this enticing epic.<p>Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>There's no other word to describe this film other than beautiful.  Despite that sounded clich&eacute;d, it's very true were 'Crouching Tiger' is concerned.  Ang Lee revolutinises the martial arts film by making it accessible to a much wider audience.  He does this through making the plot similar to that of a thousand films these days - the feminist standpoint, love through the social classes etc.  Conventional this may be, but it's entirely absorbing and you will find yourself mesmerised by the entire spectacle of it.  The tale of love never fufilled is gorgeously played by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh (who proves that she's much more than a Bond girl).  Also impressive is the stunning photography of empty deserts, solitary mountains and lush forests.  Obviously stand-out though are the fight scenes, which are choreogrpahed by the same guy as in 'The Matrix', and it shows.  Especially impressive are the fight scenes between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh and the fight in the treetops.  Yet what is most memorable about this is the fact that it is, quite simply, cinema at its very best.  It goes all out and it delivers in style.</p></br><a href="../users/AYUFQY3XG4ZBR.html">AYUFQY3XG4ZBR</a><br/><p>"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" may be the most galvanizing film in the history of martial arts cinema.  It is, claims the "old skool" core of fans that make up the base of support for the industry, a complete sell-out, relying on large-scale production values and special effects rather than legitimate fighting skills of the actors (with the notable exception of veteran martial arts female lead Michelle Yeoh) in order to sell itself; it is an act of sound and fury , signifying nothing.<br /><br />To the vast bulk of the filmgoing public who wouldn't know "Drunken Master" from "The Master Of The Flying Guillotine" from "The Five Masters Of Death" from "The Five Deadly Venoms", that criticism meant...well, nothing at all.  What is obvious from the first scene of this movie is that the director of this movie has fashioned a labor of love that has resulted in one of the most beautifully filmed movies in the history of cinema, regardless of genre.<br /><br />Martial arts film purists seem to revel within the primative nature of the films that temd to define that genre.  Poor acting, shallow scripts, ABYSSMAL overdubs, hack-and-slash editing...these are not the hallmarks of classically revered movies.  Yet they seem to do more to define martial arts cinema than any other characteristic save that of the action itself.  Yet "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" does not want for action.  The combat scenes (particularly those involving Michelle Yeoh; Ang Lee definitely knew his most talented fighter and exploited her abilities to the max) are extraordinary, special-effects laden or not.  The TRIUMPH of this movie is that is sees fit to actually present a story that draws the viewer in, that allows the viewer to form an opinion about the characters in between fight scenes...as opposed to just wishing that we could "fast-forward" to the next combat sequence.<br /><br />What we have is a film more suited to the Classical Age, the Greek Tragedy with better fight choreography.  The levity and sense of comic relief that could be expected with a number of Hong Kong cinema classics (and basically every Jackie Chan film ever made) is lacking here, but it is not missed as it has no place.  Themes such as honor, social expectations, unrequited love (from unexpected sources), revenge (this is a kung fu movie, after all)...portrayed in an unconventional environment in an unusual setting (for Western audiences) make this an intriguing movie that has the bonus of some drop-dead action sequences that most people lacking a background in Hong Kong cinema are going to find quite amazing.<br /><br />The acting is quite impressive.  You will want to watch the Mandarin soundtrack with subtitles for the full appreciation of the effect (particularly taking into effect that the Hong Kong/Canton-based actors do not speak it normally); Chow Yun-Fat is best known for his "gun fu" movies made with John Woo, but the depth of his performance in this movie led to his casting opposite Jodie Foster in a non-musical remake of "The King And I".  Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zhi-yi (was she REALLY only a teenager when this movie was made???) are amazing and wonderfully strong female roles that aren't typically seen in Hong Kong cinema (clearly a male-dominated genre).  Some people have called this movie the best chick flick since "Thelma and Louise", but anyone who would classify either movie in such strictly gender-limiting terms displays an ignorance which must prove to be quite burdensome and suffocatingly limiting.  This is a terrific movie, transcending both genre and gender.  It is the martial arts movie for people who don't like martial arts movies.  It took home Oscars that neither Bruce Lee nor Jackie Chan will ever see.  It is, simply speaking, what going to the movies is supposed to be all about.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're absolutely cheating yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>Quite the perfect film ... So many elements combine to keep the viewer mesmerized. The exotic scenery of ancient Chinese cultural life hook the imagination. The forces of good and evil battle directly in society and within the souls of the characters. There are underlying esoteric elements which make the story mysterious and provide for surprises and unexpected but deeply satisfying viewing moments from beginning to end. The yin-yang conflicts between various characters provide the romantic see-saw that captures the reader's interest. A highly regarded warrior who defends against evil has reached a point in his life where he relinquishes his famous and feared sword, "The Green Destiny" to discover and explore deeper aspects of himself and life ... At some point, he had gone into a deep meditation and arrived at a place his master had never mentioned nor described. Later, his master had been murdered and the warrior could not ask him to explain this experience. He has a female protaganist who is also a warrior and accepts the solitary nature of this fighter but clearly they share strong emotional bonds. This repressed chemistry promises their paths will continually cross as they explore the depth and meaning of strong feelings throughout the film. She delivers "the Green Destiny" as a gift to the local magistrate/governor of the province for safe keeping. The magistrate has a daughter who is being prepared for an arranged marriage ... to consolidate the interests of two ruling families ... Hidden aspects of the daughter's character provide for unexpected adventure and romance ...<br /><br />Secretly, the daugher had learned warrior skills and longed to express this independent aspect of herself ... but she lacks the personal understanding of the esoteric nature of this lifestyle. On a carriage ride with her family through the mountains and arid deserts she is captivated by an invading group of bandits, especially the leader who is young and handsome and has a mysterious reputation. He grabs her ivory hair comb as she leans fearlessly out the carriage window to watch the assualt. She unexpectedly jumps out, mounts a horse and shows remarkable skills during the chase scene ... all to retrieve back her hair comb. He captures her and takes her to his mountain cave home ... they fall in love. He tells her stories and allegories which serve to bind her even closer to him ...<br /><br />The forces of evil are embodied in the form of Jade Fox who was a servant and nanny to the wealthy Chinese daughter in the past. Jade Fox had acquired a book from which she learned the warrior skills but she failed to use the skills wisely. She lashes out with vengeance at the forces of good. The author's creativity and exceptional talents come alive on the screen. The hair-pin curves and twists in the plot are executed with perfection. The ending is sadly fulfilling ... leaving the viewer breathless!<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>I loved the Matrix. It was incredible.  But this film, filled with heroes flying across rooftops, selfish princesses stealing legendary swords (the Green Destiny), and ageless revenge, stole my heart with it's undertows of lost love, Chow Yun Fat's and Michelle Yeoh's Jackie Chan martial arts moves, and honor bound caste situations. Anyone who has read my reviews knows I believe cinematography and soundtrack are huge for me. Director Ang Lee has poured both into the senses. The darkness of Peking's  alleyways to the brilliant greens of the bamboo forests create moods of mystery, and the walking on treetops reinforces the magic of the moment. This movie is touching, filled with action, and envelopes you. Watch this movie in the English version the first time. This way, you can enjoy the color and story of a legendary hero, his true love he cannot confess to, and the devestation that is wrought by a selfish girl bent on elevating herself above all for the sake of her own ego. The trailers did great justice to this movie. Not only did they expose the fantastic effects, they gave you the feeling of the entrapment involved in the ancient Chinese caste system. I will NOT ruin this movie by disclosing the dual `love lost' theme. Anyone who writes a review and gives away the plot of the movie should be hung. This film needs to be experienced without expectation. The atmosphere is completely mystical. The characters, a legendary swordsman, a female anti-hero who studied the martial arts for the goal of self destruction, a selfish princess and her lover from the past, are all the reader need know. Any more steals from the flow of the film. Recommendation of CTHD has to be taken on trust. The reward at the end is such sadness yet blessed with understanding. There is a quality about this film that is truly lacking in American movies. Watch this movie the first time, and you will understand. Watch it the second time, and your heart will be broken. This question I will leave you with...does she fly to her doom, or to the redemption of others? Trust me. I know this review is sparce, but I did it on purpose. This film is magic. Rent this, or own it, and you will learn to trust me. I am nver wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>Anyone in the U.S. who has heard of this movie but hasn't seen it yet probably knows of it for one of two reasons: Ang Lee and Yuen Wo Ping.<p>Those are two very good reasons. Director Lee, of course, has gotten some attention lately for his work on the film version of Marvel's _The Hulk_ (which I think is an excellent, excellent film as well as a true-to-spirit screen adaptation of the original Stan Lee/Jack Kirby comic-book series). And Yuen, of martial-arts-choreography fame, is especially well known for his brilliant work on the Wachowski brothers' _Matrix_ series (which are among my personal favorite movies ever).<p>If you like their work on those other films, you'll love seeing what they can do together. _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ is a triumph in every respect.<p>The cinematography is, in the literal sense of the word, spectacular. This is one of those movies that you can pause at _any_ frame and see an artfully constructed composition -- the lights and shadows, the colors, the placement of the human figures. And of course the Chinese scenery is magnificent. (Lee, who is from Taiwan and resides in New York, got special permission from the government of China to film his movie there.)<p>The martial-arts scenes, choreographed by Yuen, are more real than reality. If you haven't moved like this in your dreams, I don't envy you your dreams. Physical bodies may not move like this, but minds do.<p>And actually, 'choreographed' is a good description of _all_ the movement in the film, both physical and dramatic. The film (based on the novel of the same name) incorporates elements of Hong Kong wuxia films but takes up these elements into a higher and deeper synthesis. The plot ostensibly centers on the theft of a sword called the 'Green Destiny' by the mysterious outlaw known as Jade Fox (sort of a Chinese Zorro). But in addition to the intrigue and the undeniably cool martial-arts stuff, there are two romances, a whole lot of philosophical/spiritual tug-of-war in the subtext, and some sly, subtle, and subversive questioning of tradition, all of it rolled up into one big thematic package. And -- I'm not exaggerating here -- _every_ 'movement' in the film participates in its Taoist-spirited thematic development.<p>I could comment at length on the actors, but I'll restrict myself here to admiring the work of actress/martial artist Michelle Yeoh. I'm sure people in other parts of the world have known of her for some years, but (like many others here in the U.S.) I first saw her in _Tomorrow Never Dies_ and she was easily my favorite part of the movie. (For this film, incidentally, she had to learn to speak Mandarin. I'm certainly not the person to judge her performance in that respect, but people who know the language have said that she did her job well.) She's well paired with Chow Yun Fat (who here sports a funky Manchu hairdo). I'll also mention Tan Dun's captivating soundtrack.<p>The DVD has some nifty special features (including a commentary by Ang Lee and James Schamus, a making-of documentary, and a conversation with Yeoh), but the best part is the set of options on the audio portion of the movie itself. If you want to listen to it in Mandarin and hear the actors' original voices, you'll find the English subtitles quite sufficient. And if you want to listen to it in English, you'll find that the vocal overdubs are _so_ well done that you may not even notice that they're overdubs. Somebody took extra-special care with this stuff.<p>This is a nice package all around, with something for everybody who appreciates fine filmmaking. Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/ATE5SA1VTJNP8.html">ATE5SA1VTJNP8</a><br/><p>Wow! I can't believe that there is actually a martial arts movie with great acting! The movie is just great, and the DVD is cool, it has those extra features, I was surprised to learn that the "flying effects" were not done by computer graphics, but rather with cables. <p>This is a mixture of fantasy and martial arts. The fighting scenes and chases are spectacular, and this is a beautiful film in that it was shot perfectly. And all the actors did a great job. This has the best elements of Oriental, American and European cinematography.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>This is a good film that fails to live up to the hype (a common phenomenon).  There are many elements of the film that are superlative in this martial arts fantasy, but director Ang Lee can&#8217;t seem to commit to a theme for the story causing it to meander aimlessly from one fight scene to the next.  The film is remarkable in the fact that women play a prominent role, a marked departure from the second class status of women in eastern societies.  Yet, Ang even hedges on this important point with Jen ultimately capitulating to the forces against her in an ending that is as unsatisfying as it is ambiguous.  It is almost as if he is saying, &#8220;Women are strong too, but not quite strong enough.&#8221;<p>On the plus side, the photography and the choreography of the fight scenes are superb.  While Bruce Lee was probably the most accomplished martial arts star ever, and Jackie Chan one of the most innovative and entertaining, the choreography by Yuen Woo-ping in this film is artistry that makes ordinary actors seem like skilled elite warriors.  The use of wires in the fight scenes is incredible, creating eye popping acrobatic scenes that take the genre to a new level.<p>Unfortunately, the wires are overused and give the film a Peter Pan quality that reduces its impact as a serious fantasy adventure (if there is such a thing).  By far, the biggest flaw of the film is the unsteadiness of the storytelling.  There are too many subthemes and Ang doesn&#8217;t commit to any of them.  We have two love stories going on (Li/Yu and Jen/Lo), the theft of the Green Destiny, Li&#8217;s desire to mentor Jen, Jen&#8217;s relationship with Jade Fox, Jen&#8217;s relationship with Yu, Jen&#8217;s progress as a warrior, Jen&#8217;s adventure in the desert, etc., etc.  Ang drifts from theme to theme and never ties them together effectively.  The most disconcerting of these is the overly long treatment of Jen&#8217;s pursuit of Lo into the desert to get her comb back.  This was one of the longest film non sequiturs I can remember, and it didn&#8217;t add that much to the main themes.<p>The acting is excellent across the board.  Chow Yun-Fat is the most prominent actor in China and his outstanding abilities are evident here.  He renders a strong and sympathetic character that is both charismatic and dynamic.  Michelle Yeoh is an accomplished martial arts expert, who is the only female star that Jackie Chan allows to do her own stunts.  Her presence adds great credibility to the fight scenes and her dramatic performance is first rate.  Newcomer Zhang Ziyi lights up the screen as Jen with impressive athleticism in the fight sequences and strong acting skills.  <p>Overall, this is an impressively filmed adventure with a story that is too loosely wound to qualify it as a great film.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is undeniably great entertainment as its ... U.S. box office gross will attest.  However, mass appeal is not necessarily a good gauge of filmmaking quality (as worthless blockbusters like &#8220;Scary Movie&#8221; exemplify).  Despite stunning cinematography and mind boggling action footage, CTHD lacks a compelling story, leaving all its impressive elements adrift as nothing more than extraordinary window dressing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>In China at the dawn of the 20th century, the lovely Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) agrees to convey a fabled sword to Peking as a gift from its owner, the legendary warrior Li Mubai (Chow Yun Fat) to their mutual benefactor, Sir Te.  Both Li and Yu are warriors, veterans of a life of battle against China's organized underworld which has both scarred them and yet turned them into the master warriors (restless and regretful) that they are recognized for.  The gift of the sword, and Yu's bringing it to Peking, are symbolic acts in both Yu and Li's lives, turnposts at which they might intersect free of their destinies and finally realize their mutual affections.  When the sword, called "The Green Destiny" is stolen by a masked warrior who can leap tall pagodas in a single bound, plans are put aside and the hunt is on, not so much to reclaim the sword, but to repay a debt to the evil Jade Fox, a warrior who betrayed and murdered Li's teacher.  <p>Director Ang Lee supposedly crafted this elaborate art-house film as a high-minded tribute to the martial-arts epics of his youth, in which single warriors fight off an army of lesser fighters, while more-equal-matched bouts have the fighters hurtling through the air, as if rocketed from the planet Krypton.  But "Tiger" goes further, delving into the regret of its characters.  Besides Lee, we have Yu-Jen, the elfin faced girl who's prosepctive marriage to a highly-placed noble makes her pine for the life of a brigand, one she "claims" to know only from books, and Lo, a desert brigand with whom she has fallen in love.  Then there is the evil Jade Fox herself who puts in an appearance.  Unfortunately, Lee doesn't devote enough time to any of these compelling characters, though he does work them up excellently.  The "Green Destiny" itself is too quickly relegated to an object that doesn't quite hold our attention (Like that suitcase in "Pulp Fiction", it's quickly overshadowed by the characters that kill for it), and the mysterious thief and her awesome fighting skills take center stage.  A subplot linking the seemingly innocent Jen with the wildly exotic Lo is dropped in midway and threatens to steal the movie away, but its more than made up with by the depth brought to Lo and Jen's characters which seemed to have amassed the regret that Jade Fox, Yu and Li have taken their lives to collect.  A great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>I've seen this glorious Ang Lee masterpiece numerous times but this is the first time I've watched it (Blu ray) with the English dubbed in.  Sacrilege I know, but I was curious as to how they would do this.  Very well indeed.  In addition, I learned a few things that were always confusing.  For one thing, what's with the title?  In one scene we learn that the stunning Ziyi Zhang is Hidden Dragon, so I will presume that Michelle Yeoh is Crouching Tiger.  The movie ultimately is about the two women warriors and their great love affairs...no not with each other.  Set somewhere in the late Qing Dynasty (1880"s?), Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) is part of the secretive underworld society of Jiang Hu.  The other major role is that of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) a fabled Wudang swordsman.  They have a history of unrequited love due to the fact that Shu Lien had been engaged to Mu Bai's best friend who was murdered trying to protect him.  One of my favorite fight scenes ever occurs early in the film when Shu Lien chases down Jen Yu (Zhang) who had stolen a sword belonging to Mu Bai.  The scene is not brutal, but a poetic ballet done to the tom toms of Tan Dun.  It is quite hypnotic.  Some have snickered at the tree fights but I see these as elements of fantasy, no different than many movies.  In most cases the actors actually performed these wire stunts in the trees themselves.  While the primary love story is one of halting words and longing glances, the other gets a bit more physical with Jen Yu foregoing an arranged aristocratic marriage for a relationship with a macho desert bandit.  The many fight sequences are choreographed by famed Yuen Wo-Ping who did "The Matrix" among other films.  Yo Yo Ma adds his cello work to one of the greatest soundtracks ever.  This remains one of my favorite films of all time.  Its elegant, graceful love story has no faults.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>There's not much bad I can say about the film.

The movie doesn't have a lot of violence or special effects, but rather really focuses on the four main characters and their development. I'd go so far as to say that this is he best Chinese-language film so far.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>This movie is a new concept for both the viewer from the east and west. What director Ang Lee did was to take a Chinese martial arts fantasy film and add the true dramatic component so that it would appeal to all audiences.  The sets, costumes and sound track are fantastic. The movie is set in 19th-centuary China and the clothing at the beginning of the period are of the correct period, but that soon goes out the window. Though it does not detract from the movie in any way. And the casting is nothing short of phenomenal. With the great dramatic actor Chow Yun Fat staring in his first martial arts film and Michelle Yeoh bringing her acting talents from the heart. An epic movie that is sure to stand the test of time.<br /><br />In this movie two warriors are faced with the duel challenge of retrieving the stolen treasured sword called the Green Destiny and dealing with their true affection for each other. The of course cannot speak of their love for one another for Yeoh's character was engaged to be married and her fianc&eacute; was slain by a woman called the Jade Fox. What we must understand that in China if your fianc&eacute;e is killed, you are considered a widow, so they would be breaking the rules of society if they acted on their love for one another.<br /><br />We then learn the young woman who stole the sword is the disciple of this Jade Fox, but also an aristocrat who is being forced into an arranged marriage of political convenience. We learn that Jade Fox has here own reasons for doing what she did out of bitterness. And we learn the true focus of the film is the young girl. With everything else going on, she is also in love with a desert bandit who she felt duty bound to leave. And once she marries she realizes she made a mistake, so she goes around getting into sword fights.<br /><br />The movie express epic romance, honor and self-respect along with the martial arts wirework we expect from Chinese martial arts films. And though all laws of physics do not apply, the fights are simply wonderfully choreographed. In this movie each warrior battles for justice, they each face their worst enemies as well as their true love. This is a film I highly recommend you watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>read the customer reviews and you will see a deep split between those who loved the film and those who wish it had never been made!  <p>I saw Crouching Tiger in the theater and actually sat through two performances in a row.  I just could not take the whole experience in in one sitting - it left me visually stunned.  Because I was outvoted at home, the first time I viewed the DVD, we used the English version, and although I still found the film to be exciting, it wasn't quite as enjoyable as is the original Chinese version.<p>There is little I can say to add to the multitude of voices that have reviewed this film.  I found the director's vision to be so vast and complex that is was astounding.  The window it opened to the beauty of central China  was incredible.  Lee was definitely in control of the pacing and of the performances of his cast, which are outstanding, but pale in comparison to the texture of the story and the backdrop of what is China.<p>This is one of those films where words fail to describe the experience, and gushing praise just makes others who view the film wonder ....&quot;What's all the fuss about?&quot;.  If you view it as a martial arts film, or a historical romance, or an epic, each view is too limited.  It is all of these things, and more.<p>Crouching Tiger will be in my list of the top 5 films of all time for many years to come.  Ang Lee is brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>This is a terrific film, combining the once-again-fashionable grandiloquent, epic sweep, stunning choreography (never before have fight sequences so resembled classical dance) and most remarkably, a stiffly extended middle finger to conventional blockbuster wisdom. Martial Arts movies typically obey pretty rigid conventions - they're not especially challenging on the cognitive functions and they're macho, violent and action-obsessed to the exclusion of all else (in particular characterisation and plot). <p>So in putting together this piece Ang Lee got his box-office smash the hard way: Not only did he film in Mandarin (which might explain to the perceptive reviewer below why they &quot;couldn't get the lips to sync right&quot;), but he has as the two lead protagonists and fighting extraordinaires, women. And while there's action to do you Tuesday next week, for all the sword play, there's not a great deal of *violence* (the swordfighting is more like ballet than combat), and the voguish brutal realism is replaced by surreal, liquid movement and total disregard for gravity. <p>Theme-wise, for once there really is something happening - a subtext of struggle against social convention, no small irony given the revolution against cinematic convention which the film represents. There are two love stories, but for the most part they're airily sketched - having said that, the climatic scene, involving one pair of star cross'd lovers, has all the weight of Shakespearian tragedy.<p>If anything is underdone it's the exposition on the bad guys; It's not clear (in the dubbed version, at any rate) what Jade Fox has done, nor why she's gone over to the dark side, nor why the Diplomat's daughter should be siding with her (other than on account of a wild streak). To my mind Jade Fox could have been left out of the film altogether - it would have required minimal re-writing and perhaps closed off a number of side plots (such as that concerning the police chief) which were not properly developed in the end anyway.<p>While it's not perfect, it's a landmark film, for if it achieves nothing else it provides an ideal compromise at the video store when *she* wants the English Patient and *he* wants Die Hard II. No mean feat.</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movies ever, made!

The fighting looked more like some sort of balletic dancing performed to some exotic kind of rhythms. With strings attached.

It must be for buffs of this kind of thing. Perhaps if it was explained carefully all the way through, but I haven't retained enough energy or commitment to listen to the commentary.

It is a visionary work that is unique and endlessly graceful.<br /><br />The reunion between ill-fated lovers Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) is disrupted by the theft of a sword called the Green Destiny.  The sword has been taken by the beautiful Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) who is determined to forsake her pampered existence.  Mu Bai's quest to recover the Green Destiny eventually leads to a showdown with the young thief and an old adversary from his past.<br /><br />Lee does a good job of examining the notion of romantic yearning through the characters of Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien and the notion of personal sacrifice in light of one's status through the character of Jen Yu.  Yet, it is the amazing acrobatics of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" that will catch your attention.  Your first impulse when you see the rooftop chase early in the film will be to guffaw at all the laws of modern physics that are being ignored.  At this point, you should suspend logic and embrace the special rules of Ang Lee's universe.  By doing so you will be able appreciate all the visual wonders that are on display later in the film.  Do not take "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" too literally and you will be privy to a rewarding viewing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>In ancient China two Wudan warriors will intend to retrieve a legendary and mythic sword which has been stolen.<br /><br />Basically this is the dramatic premise but there are a lot of little details to find out. The master voice and dazzling presence of Yimou Zhang behind camera is enough to captive and bewitch the most exigent viewer. His powerful expressive force and his well known touch of genius may be felt from the first shot.<br /><br />Ang Lee has remained in the great tradition of the "shaman filmmakers" if I may. In this reduced as you may figure out are Kenji Mizoguchi, Akira Kurosawa, Shohei Imamura, Kinugasa, Kobayashi and Ichikawa, just to name the most conspicuous in the East cinematography.<br /><br />Lee `s ambitious script capture images and transform them in poetry, the admirable flight combats, the delirious traveling and the charming portrait which blends, myth, humanity, honor, humor and dignity. This film overcomes its own latitudes as a true masterpiece to inscribe itself in the list of the new classics from its instantaneous release.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Some people here cannot see the beauty of things even when it hits them in the face. Ang Lee has said he has always wanted to make a Wu Xia film and he did, he brought sophistication and strong production values which, while not uncommon in mainstream Chinese cinema, was less common in the martial arts or Wu Xia traditions.<br /><br />Make no mistake; Crouching Tiger is a beautiful, beautiful movie. The colors are rich and the movements are balletic. But unlike lesser imitations, such as Hero, it is much more than that just stylish production and mesmerizing action. Most films (Western or Eastern) have a rigid plot against which characters move. At worst the characters become ciphers; they advance the story by making choices regardless of whether these choices are in keeping with their character. Crouching Tiger, like the best of cinema, has dynamic characters whose internal struggles advance the plot. The dog wags the tail, not the other way around.<br /><br />Some critics have suggested that the characterization is quite slight. I think this just demonstrates the high standard to which they were prepared to judge this film. Ang Lee perfectly marries action/adventure with drama. The results may not please purists from either camp, but for the rest of the audience it is pure magic.<br /><br />In many ways, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is pure Wu Xia. But it has also re-invented the genre and given it artistic credibility. The greatest joy of the film is watching great Hong Kong stars like Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh being given characters with depth - and watching them fill the screen with their performances. The film also benefits from great performances from Zhang Ziyi and a very under-rated Chang Chen.<br /><br />Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best artistic films I have ever seen and I would recommend anyone, whether or not they are interested in Kung-fu movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>&quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; is misunderstood by most, including those who love it and those who hate it. Crouching Tiger lovers believe that this is the quintessential martial arts movie or that it is a profound reflection of Chinese history, culture, and drama. While the fighting scenes in this movie, are thrilling and fun to watch, they are more acrobatic and fantastic than anything else. I think that's what Ang Lee intended, and I'll explain why in a moment. As to the cultural significance of this film, there really isn't one unless you are interested in obscure academic topics such as the sociological significance of Chinese martial arts soap operas.<p>And there lies the key: this film is essentially a supped up martial arts soap opera. Martial Arts soap operas are wildly popular throughout Asia and on many American TV stations with Asian language programs. I've seen many of them on Chinese TV programs in the US and China, and my wife used to watch them every weekend in the Southeast Asian city where she grew up. <p>Martial Arts soap operas often feature the same themes as Crouching Tiger, such as avenging the master's death, restoring a treasure to its rightful owner, rescuing a damsel in distress, unrequited love, etc. They also feature many of the same combat scenarios including fighters flying at each other through the air, roof top chases, sword duels, ambushes, miracle healing, and so forth. These films are neither meant to showcase true martial arts performances like some of Jet Li's earlier works, or countless Main Land Chinese Kung Fu movies, nor are they intended to bring Chinese history to life. Instead, they are genre-driven, formulaic, fun, and often absurd.<p>Does this mean that Crouching Tiger is a bad movie-absolutely not! I think Ang Lee quite deliberately set out to make a high-end, jazzed up martial arts soap opera. The first time I saw this movie in San Francisco, the largely Chinese audience enthusiastically applauded after the first fight scene, as did my wife and I. We had all seen this sort of thing hundreds of times before but never on such a magnificent scale with so much realism, grandeur, and suspense. Ang Lee pushed the martial arts soap opera genre to the limit, and he did so superbly. <p>As the months went by I usually heard one of two responses to this film. The majority of people liked it but often claimed that it was deep, profound and revealing to them-that it taught them something about Chinese culture. The film's detractors on the other hand found the fight scenes unbelievable and the plot too melodramatic. I think both sets of people failed to realize that all they were watching was a really well done martial arts soap opera.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JJOV69MAU2J2.html">A1JJOV69MAU2J2</a><br/><p>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon looks great on DVD, with great sound and lots of interesting extras, including  fascinating interviews with Director Ang Lee and Michelle Yeoh (who looks and sounds far different in real life).<p>The movie itself transcends the romance and martial arts genres with a mystical, magical fusion that is breathtaking.<p>From the moment the actors fly over the first rooftops to the last final leap, the movie is mesmerizing, taking us into a fully realized vision of old China, and its martial arts gang underworld.<p>The acting is first-rate, the cinematography revolutionary and the fight scenes weave tales of their own...<p>This is Ang Lee's second masterpiece.

Which is to say, some movies need to be seen on the big screen because when you rent them, they seem a lot less significant than in the theatre (see my review of Kate Winslet's &quot;Titanic&quot; for another entry in this category). <p>So that's part of the reason I cannot give it 5 stars. The other reason is that the film goes off on a major tangent when we learn about the Young People's love affair. Time to get out your scissors and edit it yourself to keep the momentum going.  <p>All that being said, I enjoyed &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; much more than I ever thought I would. I was curious to see it solely because it was directed by Ang Lee, who did such admirable work with &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, a great favorite of mine. When I tried to organize an outing among my friends, I was met with great resistance because they wouldn't see an Asian movie or a martial arts film starring nobody they ever heard of. The two people most inclined to go declined as they had actually seen it already, but applauded my wishing to see it, as they enjoyed it. So in the end, I went with three people who were more interested in the promised Mexican dinner afterwards. EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED to FIND THEY LOVED IT! Yes, it was effectively acted and superbly filmed in breathtaking outdoor locations. Art direction first rate. And the fighting was choreographed in a balletic style which was utterly graceful. The much-talked about flying sequences gave the movie a fairy-tale feeling, like something out of the Arabian nights. And, except for that trip to the Young People's Love Affair, the story line was very good. I was surprised to see that it was really a Women's Picture, with most of the fighting concerning them and the storyline featuring them almost to the exclusion of the male characters.<p>So, I would recommend &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; heartily to folks who think they never could, ever would like a martial arts movie. There's a lot more hidden than just the dragon!</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>I came into "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" knowing it was a martial-arts fantasy (as if people actually could run up walls and skip among bamboo trees), and was not disappointed in the least.  The story itself was a little hard to explain to others who hadn't seen it, but as it breaks down, two warriors and close friends (the always cool Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) hunt down a thief (Zhang Ziyi) who may be the student of one of their oldest enemies.  Suffice to say, things get complicated from there.  Although this is technically the middle story in the series of books from which it's based (hopefully, those rumors of a prequel will come to pass), I managed to follow the story easily and have to admit it had a lot more characterization than I came to expect in other martial-arts epics (not that I have a problem with films where I have to turn my brain off, mind you).  The action sequences in this film border on stunning (the woman-to-woman fight in the dojo definitely ranks up there as one of my favorite action scenes ever), and the photography (definitely worth winning an Oscar for) was nothing less than beautiful.  Even though the ending itself appears to be open to a lot of interpretation, I have to admit this is one of those epics that doesn't insult my intelligence (although I have to admit clich&eacute;d lines like "You will pay for my master's death" and so forth did give me a slight chuckle upon hearing them) and manages to be quite intoxicating.  This is truly a great dramatic opera, and like all great movies, is definitely worth revisiting again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Ang Lee's martial arts drama "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" earned its niche in movie history as the first foreign language film ever to gross over $100 million dollars at the U.S./Canadian box office.  It is, of course, a film of other distinctions as well.<p>The factor that sets this film apart from all previous martial arts films is, principally, the fight scenes themselves, which involve the characters defying the laws of gravity by floating in the air, walking along walls and even conducting a sword fight high above the tree tops of a windswept forest.  These sequences, which achieve a sort of heightened surrealism, are indeed breathtaking to behold in their originality, boldness and technical perfection.  They provide the unforgettable imagery that very few films these days seem able to achieve, giving the audience the all too rare sense that it is seeing something wholly new and visionary. <p>Based on a novel by Du Lu Wang,  "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" tells a quite fascinating story of a stolen sword and the attempts of two warriors, one a man, the other a woman, to retrieve it.  Like most movies set in an Asian past, Lee's film conveys a tone of quiet contemplation, even when great issues of war and peace, life and death, duty and honor are being fought over and discussed.  There is a lyrical, poetic beauty to much of this film, even - or, perhaps I should say, especially - in the non-martial arts sequences.  As the two warriors, Chow Yun Fat, a fighter grown weary of his past and yearning for the quiet rewards of peace, and Michelle Yeoh, a woman unique to her profession yet feeling deeply her unrequited love for the man she follows, bring a sturdy maturity to their complex roles.  They provide the human warmth that, in the first section of the film, in particular, keeps the work rooted in reality.  <p>Unfortunately, there is a scene about an hour into the movie, when a young aristocratic woman, destined to be married but yearning for the liberation that would come with being a warrior, has a long romantic flashback, chronicling her strange affair with a handsome young barbarian.  Although the scene ends up being crucial to the understanding of the rest of the film, it really isn't on an intellectual par with the main story of the film, coming across instead as something of an embarrassing bodice-ripper in tone and style.  Although the film does return to its main plotline eventually, it never completely recovers from the detour it has taken.  As with most movies with a midpoint sag, the audience is never really able to completely tune back in.  What a pity - for "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" clearly has the elements to make a truly great film (and, judging from the reaction of many critics and writers on this site, a large number of people feel it is).  Luckily, after the flashback, the film manages to get back on track, as we witness the complex interplay between the unthinking arrogance that comes with youth and the restraining wisdom that comes with age.  This is the most powerful theme that runs through this visually gorgeous film.<p>Thus, despite its minor imperfections, any lover of cinema would be well advised to see "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" for the many wonders it contains.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Less than half an hour into the viewing of this masterpiece I knew this would become one of my favorite films - of all time. Only in my wildest dreams (quite literally, this movie has touched me on a personal level) have I visualized such fantastic and precise choreography, so captivating that to take your eyes away during the intense confortations is to deny yourself the essence of what makes this film wonderful.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>Spectacular production; trite story line; laughably bad dialog. In many places, this cartoon-like movie comes across like an old time "tie 'em to the railroad tracks" melodrama. The fight scenes are breathtakingly choreographed, but about as realistic as those in "Buffy, The Vampire Slayer". It's fun, in a goofy sort of way, but not the "great" movie that many people have credited it with being. A solid three stars, but no more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Having seen the spoof KUNG POW only a few days before this critically acclaimed film, I found myself waiting for one of the females to let out one of Ling's "Weeeeeee"s.  Obviously CROUCHING TIGER is not a spoof, but a beautifully orchestrated film, lovingly directed by Ang Lee.  Winner of four Oscars, including Best Foreign Film, the movie is an epic tale, reminiscent of greek tragedies and sweeping romantic movies.  The fight scenes are unlike anything I've ever witnessed, and some of the cinematography is breathtaking.  Unfortunately, I found the movie rather dull and repetitious, and its poetic fantasia wasn't my cup of tea.  Can't deny its cinematic brilliance; it just isn't as great to me as to others, but hey, weeeeee.....</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>...to really appreciate it, you have to feel it.  I cannot believe the shallow-minded reviewers who thought this movie was all about martial arts.  The martial arts were great to watch but they were secondary to the story.  CTHD is a tour de force which combines a terrific plot, two love stories, mind-blowing special effects, cinematography so exquisite it is almost off the planet, great directing by Ang Lee, and wonderful acting by everyone, even the minor characters.  Zhang ZiYi as Jen is awesome to watch, but as great as she is, it is Michelle Yeoh as Shu Lien who really carries the film.  Chow Yun Fat is excellent as the lead actor, Chang Chen is a delight as Jen's exuberant young lover who, in the end, can't hold onto her, and Cheng Pei Pei is total perfection as the evil Jade Fox.  I saw this film in VHS, which, thank God, is in Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles (it's a crime to mess up the purity of this film by dubbing it into English), and unlike the DVD version, the VHS edition has kept all the scenes of the original.  The hatchet job Sony did on the DVD edition just goes to show that some things are worth waiting for.  The VHS edition is the version to get.  It's the only one that does justice to the magnificent masterpiece that is this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>This is one of the first `foreign language films' I'd ever seen, and while it didn't strike me immediately, it wore on me to the point where I now an enamored by it.  It's a truly universal and commercial film.  Everyone that I know likes it, even if they refuse to watch films with subtitles as a rule.  This seems to be everyone's exception.  I haven't seen this much universal appeal for a foreign film since, the only one coming close would have to be `Pan's Labyrinth'.<br /><br />Personally, `Wo Hu Cang Long' is a film that gets better with time and certainly lives up to its rich reputation.<br /><br />The film is really a richly detailed amalgam of cinematic influences, each strand of the films fibers coming together effortlessly to weave an unforgettable experience.  Part epic love story, part mystery, part Asian kung-fu movie, part dramatic social commentary; Ang Lee marvelously shifts the film `ever so slightly' so as to capture everything needed to convey every thought and emotion without coming across awkward, choppy or forced.  The film has a needed `breezy' appeal that carries you from scene to scene, but it never makes light of the films weighty subject matter.<br /><br />While catering towards the emotional resonance of the film (the film may be about the pursuit of a legendary sword, but the focus is not on the sword at all) Ang never forgets the films he is paying homage to, and so he beautifully renders each scene with an edge and intensity that establishes this film as one of the best martial arts pictures ever made.<br /><br />Certainly the best of this past decade.<br /><br />With a powerfully effective cast (both Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi are Oscar worthy here), these fight sequences are elevated from brainless fun to startling emotion driven works of art.  You can understand why these battles are taking place and you can see the personalities of these characters taking shape throughout.  Ziyi is marvelous here, and her character development some of the best of the year (that character was a goldmine).  Her arrogant tonal shifts are just mesmerizing and unbelievably focused.<br /><br />And let's just take a moment of silence to bask in our awe of that brilliantly choreographed bamboo tree battle (one of many breathtaking fight sequences in this film).<br /><br />Yes, `Wo Hu Cang Long' is a stunning film that totally lives up to the hype and delivers more and more with every viewing.  It is one of those films that I grow more and more in love with every time I watch it.  For all the edge and attitude it possesses, this film is one of the most graceful and elegant films I've ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>This film is Ang Lee's homage to martial arts films, and he does a good job.  We follow two aging experts - one male, one female - as they try to find a quiet life for themselves together.  Unfortunately, their old nemesis reappears with an apprentice.  The apprentice has stolen the master's legendary sword and has taught herself (from a stolen manual) the secrets of the Wudan, the martial arts society that is the pinnacle of skill, instructing its students in the art of swordplay, unarmed combat, and "flying."<p>The film is visually spectacular.  The scenery of the desert, the bamboo forest, and a recreated 18 century Beijing are all beautifully filmed and provide an epic backdrop.  The fight scenes are also beautiful to behold, well-choreographed, exciting, and oddly realistic, considering the belligerents can defy gravity at will.  The soundtrack, with its staccato drums to emphasize the action and haunting cello meoldies (by Yo Yo Ma), is a perfect accompaniment for the images.<p>Unfortunately, the story itself does not hold up the sections between the fight sequences.  Usually this is not a problem with martial arts movies, as the plot is secondary.  However, in this film more time is spent in exposition than fighting, so we must assume the plot was meant to be important.  There are two glaring problems (for me) that detract from the enjoyment of the film.  The first is the nature of the "main" character, the apprentice evil-doer.  The screenplay seems to keep changing its mind - is she the rogue with a heart of gold or a selfish brat that deserves what she gets?  We are left wondering why the old master keeps forgiving her faults, and how she could have made the brigand chief fall in love with her.  Secondly, there is the problem of a 20-minute flashback sequence explaining the love between the apprentice and the brigand chief.  It comes out of nowhere half-way into the film and disrupts the whole flow.  Surely the script should have been reworked to ease into this subplot; as it is, it seems forced on us and we resent it.<p>It's entirely possible that a native Mandarin speaker would not agree with my criticisms.  I know when I watch English movies subtitled in French (or vice versa), the subtlties and nuances do not always translate well, and I'm sure it would be worse crossing a cultural barrier from Euro-American to Chinese.  However, Lee's own "Eat Drink Man Woman" was wonderful and had the same potential issue, so I have to think the subtitles are not totally to blame and the fault lies in the script.<p>The commentary on this DVD is quite fun to listen to.  There are tidbits of information that explain why and how the film was made and explaining scenes.  There are also some funny moments, where Schamus is pointing out "cheesey shots."  There's also a making-of featurette that is interesting, showing how the stunts were performed with wires.  However, the commentary is the jewel of the DVD edition, aside from the superior sound and video quality that is inherent to the format.<p>Overall, I enjoyed the film, and can see why it was so successful.  However, I was disappointed by the inconsistencies with the apprentice character and the plotting in general, which lowered the film's rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>I've seen some of those Hong Kong/Taiwan action movies (bits of them anyway) and generally have not been impressed. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was made in homage to them and does so with class. I thought that it was much better than most of those films and might even be better than most of the so called realistic movies done in this country. I found very little to complain about. The wire act bits were usually very well done, a few scenes did have a little too much bounce in the movements, I thought they were amazing. The plot mostly made sense to me although Zhang Ziyi's flashback segment seemed oddly placed (maybe I was tired when I saw it)but good otherwise. The end scene where Jen (Zhang Ziyi) jumps from the bridge was the low point in the movie for me, was that supposed to be a suicide or what?</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>The martial arts film traditionally has attained its own unique niche in the domain of film.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a Chinese-language film that works within the parameters of the old cliches of this niche, but changes just enough to make it stand out and create an appeal that reaches far beyond the limited circle of the average martial art film enthusiast.  It doesn't lack the action that one might expect from the typical film in this genre, but it adds something new: the soul of tragedy and romance.<br /><br />An adaption of a Chinese pulp-fiction novel, the story concerns two secret lovers (the male Li Mu Bai and female Yu Shu Lien) who are warriors on a quest to recapture a legendary sword, the Green Destiny, which has been stolen by a masked bandit.  The thief turns out to be the beautiful princess Jen Yu, who is in the middle of trying to avoid an arranged marriage, because she is secretly in love with the desert bandit Lo, whom she grew to love after being abducted in the wilderness.  Behind the intrigue and romance of these two forbidden loves, lies the dark cloud of mastermind Jade Fox, the evil woman responsible for the deaths of Mu Bai's former master and of Shu Lien's fiance.  This sets the stage for a poignant drama, warm romance, and breath-taking action.<br /><br />Despite being a martial arts film, the movie breaks the traditional Eastern mould by incorporating romantic elements one would expect from Hollywood.  It has well been said that stylistically, it is "a blend of Eastern action and Western psychological drama." I think this assessment is correct, that while on the one hand the film is clearly inspired by martial-arts mysticism and action of the East, underneath the window dressing of the foreign aspects of the film lies the romanticism and drama that one is accustomed to from the West.  By catering to what appeals to the modern Western mindset and incorporating subtle criticisms of traditional Chinese culture, it's not surprising that the film was somewhat of a flop in Asia, and that its concessions to contemporary themes of love and feelings made it a breakthrough success in the West.  Stephen Greydanus puts it well by remarking: "Ang Lee has here crafted a masterful synthesis of various forms of Chinese mythology and Taoist philosophy that brings a broader perspective to its subject matter than many Asian films  including some aspects of more typically Western sensibilities and ideals  and, in the end, embraces a gently romantic humanism that is more life-affirming than the esoteric way of detachment and denial characteristic of Eastern thought."  Certainly there are allusions to Taoistic mysticism, but the Taoism is in the end rejected in favor of realism and romanticism - which perhaps explains why the movie worked for Western viewers and not for Eastern ones.<br /><br />The movie has also been the subject of scathing criticism for other reasons, not least from conservative Christian quarters, where offense was taken primarily to the implicit endorsement of extra-marital sexual relations, and the rebellious attitude of Jen toward her parents and her arranged marriage. For the most part, I share this concern, and it's good to be reminded of it. Watching too many movies which advocate the moral laxity of modern culture can dull sensitivity on this point, and unfortunately there aren't enough films on the other extreme to act as correctives.<br /><br />But perhaps most discussion has been about the ambiguous conclusion (*spoiler warning*), where Jen leaps into the unknown.  Lo has just expressed the wish is "to be in the desert, together [with you] again" and then Jen jumps off the cliff into the mist of uncertainty.  If it's not suicide, what is it?  And what happens next?  We don't know.  Some have optimistically seen this as a Christological leap of faith and sacrifice with the hope of resurrection, but it seems to me that interpreting this as a message of atonement and resurrection is being too generous and overly charitable.  Perhaps the point is that we don't know the ending, and that the movie can only leave it up to us to decide for ourselves. And isn't this typical for a Western culture without absolutes?  Maybe this is a reflection of our post-modern culture more than anything.  Not only does contemporary culture delight in being morally ambiguous, but as a result it also has an ambiguous eschatology. The best that modern Western film can offer is a nebulous promise of a hope for the future. In other words, our world today doesn't really know much about the afterlife, so it can't really tell us much about it, except offer paradoxes and try to make us come up with our own happy endings. The best promise it can give is a blend of hopeless romanticism and eastern mysticism, where suicide is romanticized as an genuine escape and a leap into another world where perhaps dreams might just come true.<br /><br />Despite being critical of some of these underlying themes and moral ambiguity, I have to admit that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is stimulating in raising these questions, in a way that few popular films today do.  It remains a fascinating film in what it says about a clash of cultures, and in what it says about our time.  The discerning viewer is sure to find some measure of profit and entertainment from this highly regarded and award-winning film. - GODLY GADFLY</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>The only thing distinguishing this film from your average "D" quality Hong Kong kung-fu film is the state-of-the-art cinemtography and slightly above average directing. Apart from that, the screenplay is whimsical, the acting dull and shallow, and the script is inundated with those generic Confucian/Dao proverbs already overused in the 70's Kung-Fu series with David Caradine.<br /><br /> Yes, Chinese kung-fu cinema often has the characters floating in the air or doing other motions that defy the limitations of physics: this reflects their notion of how the channeling of chi through mental and physical concentration can overcome natural laws. Although I'm not disturbed with such reality gaps in film, I don't see why it would be worthy of an Oscar or the amount of praise it received. The screenplay presents a story that is just as absurd as the one for Rambo II where Rambo bravely defeats an entire entire North Vietnamese regiment using just a knife. Rambo II wasn't Oscar material and wouldn't have been Oscar material even if it had a better script, an added love story and enhanced cinematography: Why? Because the story line is generic and unimaginative. The same goes for Crouching Tiger: the story is essentially no different than every other generic kung-fu film coming out of Hong Kong. This is not to say that there aren't any good films coming out of China but, kung-fu films are essentially the Chinese equivalent of our Shwarzenneger or Stallone films. Have either of the latter actors or their action films won Oscars? No. So why should Crouching Tiger: just because it's foreign?<br /><br /> Check out 'Red Firecraker, Green Firecracker', 'Farewell My Concubine', and/or 'Raise The Red Lantern' for good Chinese drama; not this overhyped and revamped generic kung-fu fiasco.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>ive seen this movie three times.the 1st time it was spoken in chinese with no words at the bottom.the 2nd was the same deal but with the english translation at the bottom.the 3rd was in normal english.thank god!in it,a thief steals a relic and some people go to get it back.it has breathtaking backgrounds like lord of the rings.beatiful music like amadeus and martial arts effects like a pre-matrix but similar.the kids could watch it.theres only one bad part.it is definately a artsy and classy type film.ang lee is the director.he also did the hulk.the hulk is better.it is not emotional per say but more inspirational.there are some chicks  but they are not portrayed in a sexual way.one guy,in the less than apropriate part gets his hand down ones pants.i dont care what anyone says,if you get this in english,it is one of the best movies youll ever see.the special effects are cool.the fighting is outstanding!</p></br><a href="../users/A3DE1IYJGU5HPW.html">A3DE1IYJGU5HPW</a><br/><p>Because Crouching Tiger was released in Taiwan before it came to the States, it is only natural that the DVD was released there earlier, too.  Nearly identical to the proposed Ameican release (the US version adds the &quot;making of&quot; documentary), I purchased a copy of the Region 3 version of this great movie.<p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon itself is a gorgeous, sensual story, boosting HK action movies to an entirely new level (although it is doubtful that many will be able to or even want to follow this act).  The story is fairly straightforward: a master swordsman searches for his lost weapon, stolen by an enigmatic thief.  Add to that a healthy dose of unrequited love, another love story that may very well become unrequited, and of course the legendary fighting scenes, and you've got a great film.<p>Subtitles don't really matter here, unlike some other films.

Rather than the usual back-patting (so-and-so was SO GREAT to work with!), Ang Lee and James Schamus discuss the difficulties behind making scripted scenes come to life, the risks they took in making the movie (10 minutes before the first fight? A 20 minute flashback?), and other aspects of production.  For those who like an educational commentary, this one is great.<p>The interview with Michele Yeoh is pretty much the standard movie-promotion fare, and the music videos are interesting as additions (for some reason, they seem really grainy, too).  This DVD looks and sounds great, and even the animated menus (if they keep the ones that are on the Region 3 disc) are clever.<p>There are very few DVDs that are &quot;must-own.&quot;  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of them.  Do not hesitate, and when it comes, savor every minute.</p></br></body></html>

Clocking in a little over three hours, this film never drags. Darabont's direction and screenplay are for at least a second time( The Shawshank Redemption) are at the top of all cinema. A great story that unfolds like you are reading a book with well developed characters who aren't all bad or all good. One of Tom Hanks best performances(I guess since 'Forrest Gump' beat out 'The Shawshank Redemption' for best picture Darabont wanted to use a star with Academy appeal?)ditto, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse and a cast of top notch character actors including Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchison and Michael Jeter. I recently bought the Blu Ray edition which is well worth the upgrade, the picture and sound are a big improvement over the DVD( and the film isn't on two discs)with all the extras carried over from the two disc DVD including some documentaries deleted scenes and commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The most important question is simple and straight forward; is this two disc edition of "The Green Mile" worth the upgrade? Yes. The three hour film is now spread over two dual layered discs allowing breathing room for the sound and images along with the inclusion of a commentary track from the director. While the previous edition released in 1999 looked extremely nice this edition has sharper images and better definition. I suspect the same transfer was probably used and just that the increased space to spread the film over two discs probably helped improve (along with improvements in digital technology)the look of the film.<br /><br /> We get a terrific and informative Commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont. Unfortuantely only two deleted scenes have survived as Darabont points out in the commentary in discussion about a scene (and the possibility of creating a "Director's Cut")most films have their dalies transferred to hard drive for assemlbing a rough cut and many of the deleted scenes were erased. The two deleted scenes included are interesting but only hint at other scenes lost during the editing process. It used to be that deleted scenes would be tossed into a bin with trims for possible later use not the digital age has made that impossible unless the director saves ALL the trims.<br /><br />We also get a great 90 minute documentary on the challenges (and fears)that Darabont faced in making another Stephen King project. He was afraid that he would be seen only as a Stephen King director (or a director of prison dramas which are hardly in vogue right now)which might limit his options as a director later in his career but he realized that the material was so powerful in human drama that it was worth the risk.<br /><br />We also get Tom Hanks make up tests, Michael Duncan Clark's screen tests, the teaser trailer (along with a look at what constitutes a great teaser), original theatrical trailer. We also get the original vintage featurette on the production of the film. I would have liked a commentary from Hanks and the other actors but with so much time having passed and the actors busy schedules it would have been difficult to assemble them for a sit down commentary track (although they could have cobbled together a second audio track with actors interviews discussing the film although I doubt it would as valuable).<br /><br />Nevertheless having compared my previous edition to this for the $6 extra dollars this is the edition to get. I should point out that many retailers (Costco among them) have this available for $9.00 the same price as the original version is currently selling for making this a terrific bargain.<br /><br />REVIW OF THE FILM BELOW:<br />"The Green Mile" the third film made by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's work is surprisingly strong and an outstanding follow up to Darabont's version of "Shawkshank". Based on the five short serial novels (now available as a single novel) published back in 1997. This marvelous follow up film is a terrific but flawed film that sags a bit at the beginning but manages to quickly pick up us its pace. It's not that it isn't involving it is but the third act of the fil is where the film picks up its momentum.<br /><br />Nominated for four Academy Awards (including Best Picture)this is a rich drama with strong performances all around including a terrific and moving performance from Tom Hanks in the lead. Well worth picking up for fans of King's work but, more importantly, for fans of moving dramas/fantasy films with more than touch of reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>When we say that a movie is too long, we mean one of two things:<p>It is so inept and boring, that time appears to slow down while we're watching it, making it seem too long.<p>Or<p>The filmmaker's had some good material to work with, but not enough to justify the extended length.<p>"The Green Mile" falls smack dab in the middle of category number two.  So, how could it have been shortened, and thus made better?<p>My first suggestion is to get rid of the old people.  Or, tidy up their scenes.  I understand the need for this hackneyed framing device (it becomes clear in the end), but somewhere between concept and execution, the idea falls on hard times.  Firstly, the old people they cast are horrible actors.  It appears that the crew set up shop in a nursing home one afternoon, handed out copies of the script, and rolled film.  Every emotion is artificially heightened, every line reading is stilted, and no one comes across as believable.  Second, I don't think the prologue / epilogue adds anything to the film, except to give the filmmakers an opportunity to once again spell out their message, in case one or two members of the audience missed it the first forty times.  Okay, so we edit out the old people scenes, and that cuts off, what, fifteen minutes of screen time.<p>Next, we have way too many executions.  They're all done well, bringing the right amount of pathos to the proceedings, without ever being manipulative (well, one is, but it kind of had to be to make its point).  But overkill (pun intended) is still overkill.  We have three executions, shown in their entirety, plus a couple of dry run trial executions (I hate being the one recommending Harry Dean Stanton should wind up on the cutting room floor, but here we are).  I say, show the bare bones only of the first one, show bits and pieces of the trial runs, show only the important bits of the second one (this should be obvious), and lay it all on the line for the third one.  That should cut another ten or so minutes from the film.<p>There's a scene where Tom Hank' Paul Edgecomb goes to visit Gary Sinise, the lawyer who represented John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).  It does nothing to further the story, or Paul's perceptions of Coffey, and can be exorcised neatly.  Plus, it tries to fuel the fires of an issue (racism) that until this point hadn't been brought up, and, given the film's tone, really didn't need to be brought up so explicitly by a secondary character.  We can see that racism is a factor without Sinise's blatant pejorative.  Okay, so that's another five minutes lost.<p>Finally, there are two characters here who get way too much screen time, much of it redundant.  Doug Hutchinson's Percy is a cowardly little skunk.  We get that information from his first couple scenes.  Then we get it over and over again.  I'd have him in the background, only emerging for his confrontations with Michael Jeter's Del (and then for Del's execution).  Hutchinson does a fine job with the role (you will hate Hate HATE Percy), but he was too big a part.  Sam Rockwell, as Wild Bill, a newly arrived inmate, also serves a purpose, but to less a degree than his screen time would justify.  Rockwell, in some scenes, is allowed to go off for pages and pages of rambling and nonsensical dialogue.  He's a whacked out hard case.  We get it.  Move on to the story, please.  Okay, that should trim another ten minutes or so.<p>Which means we have a nice, lean two hour and twenty minute film.  Probably still too long given the story they're telling, but not unbearable by any means.<p>Okay, so why does "The Green Mile" fall into category two instead of the dreaded category one?  For a film that feels so much like a stage play (the minimalist sets, unlike the realistic and tarnished prison from "The Shawshank Redemption", felt too clean and too pure to represent anything from the real world) it's got to be about the actors.  Hanks, of course, is just solid.  Paul is not a hero by any means, and, as most have said, he probably makes the wrong choice in the end.  But it was his choice to make, and Hanks ably shows the angst it took to make that choice.  Plus, he gets to play pain and indignity, as Paul has a wicked bladder infection throughout the film's first third.<p>Paul's men, played by David Morse, Barry Pepper, and Jeffrey DeMunn are all excellent.  Morse is every bit Hanks' equal in the tough scenes the two have together.  Pepper is good at playing the wide-eyed innocent, just starting out on the job, unaware of the horrors he's about to see.  And DeMunn is mainly about quiet dignity, and in the end, confusion as to what the right thing to do would be.<p>Michael Clarke Duncan, as John Coffey, did an excellent job, although for the most part he was nearly unintelligible.  Sure, that's the character (uneducated, talking in backwoods slang), but between the mumbled dialogue, and the 1930s jargon, I had a tough time figuring out what he had to say.  To remedy this, I recommend turning on the DVD's subtitles.  This fixes one problem, and brings about another.  Even though Coffey is supposed to be touched by God, his speeches were way too poetic for a man of his education.  And other times, he lacks any poetry in his speech at all.  He's an inconsistently written character.  Credit should go to Duncan, who does a fine, charismatic job bringing this hulking but innocent man to life.<p>While not nearly as good as Frank Darabont's last Stephen King-in-a-prison adaptation, "The Green Mile", while tremendously flawed, has just enough going for it to make it worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>Since I was aware that this movie was from a serial novel written by horror-master Stephen King, I expected it to be a bit more on the scary side than it actually ended up being...however I was NOT disappointed at ALL with the end result.  In fact I found it to be easily one of the best movies I saw in 1999.  <p>The movie starts off today with a gentleman in a retirement home reluctantly reminiscing about events that happened in the 30's at a Prison in the South.  Is this a horror movie?  NO WAY.  In fact it was anything BUT.  Tom Hanks is superb (but then again when ISN'T he?) in the job of being in charge of 'The Green Mile' which represents the floor color that leads to the electric chair from the prison cells.  It's not a mile, in fact it's only about 50-60 feet total...but having to walk that distance to one's ultimate demise would have to be considered a long walk indeed--one that would finish all-too-soon for some characters.<p>Everything from a little mouse--which amazingly has a rather large roll in the movie--but don't worry, it isn't silly at all-- to easily the biggest man I have EVER seen all works together to make 'The Green Mile' an incredible journey which on more than one occasion had me thinking long and hard at the death penalty. My ONLY criticism of the movie was how the supernatural portion was handled...well actually our very large character, John Coffey is accused of killing two young girls (don't worry, he's innocent--but is it enough to win him a stay of execution?) when in reality he was actually trying to HEAL them...you see John has an interesting ability to cure people of their ills.  How?  Well we never really find out, but the ONLY problem I have at ALL with this movie is, well, how he manages to expel the illness once he has removed it from the one who is sick.  Other than that, this film is one that has stayed with me long after I left the theater.  I also was shocked to find out that it was 3-hours long.  As I left the theater I glanced at my watch and could hardly believe that I had been sitting there that long.  It seemed more like the usual hour-and-a-half.  Time just stood still as I watched this fantastic movie.  I enjoyed this movie so much I actually went out and bought the book (which actually IS better, but what book isn't?) and I also found a whole new view of Stephen King.  Do NOT let this movie being written by him keep you from a true masterpiece.  Simply put great filmmaking with each character pulling in a great performance.  Oh, and even though the book was better, I think they did an incredible job of turning it into a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorite movies.  What makes that even funnier was that I just saw the whole thing for the first time a few days ago.  Before I would always catch it on tv an hour or so in and never saw the beginning.  Now that I've had the chance to see the complete movie, I love it even more.<br /><br />Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a guard in the Cold Mountain Penitentiary working on death row.  Also known as the "Green Mile" because of its faded lime colored tile, it is a ward that doesn't hold too many prisoners.  We first meet Paul when he is in a nursing home and largely the movie is  him reminiscing about a particular summer.  A summer in which he had a really bad urinary tract infection and a summer in which he meets John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).<br /><br />Coffey is a towering hulk of a man who has been sent to the prison to await his fate at the electric chair.  Accused of raping and killing two young girls there is something a little strange about this man.  Seemingly gentle he has a way about him that is almost childlike.  The guards and Paul soon discover that there is more to him than meets the eye.  Especially when he starts performing miracles.<br /><br />Not everyone likes him though.  A young guard who has friends in high places, Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) makes life terrible for all in the ward, even his fellow guard Brutus Howell (David Morse) and a few others.  He does make a friend in Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) a fellow inmate when he heals his remarkably smart pet mouse Mr. Jingles.  There is another inmate on the ward as well.  The incredibly brutal and psychotic Wild Bill Wharton (Sam Rockwell) who doesn't like Coffey and has a sinister past.<br /><br />Paul must run the ward the best he can but with all these personalities and conflicting emotions makes it tough.  Especially when Percy commits the unforgivable and endangers everyone.  With this and a daring healing involving Coffey, things are not very calm on the Green Mile.<br /><br />All the actors in this movie did amazing jobs.  Hanks plays a believable sympathetic guard and it is easy to relate with him.  Coffey is a sad character but there is something very special about him and actor Duncan plays him very convincingly.  About the best actor in this film though would be Hutchinson for his portrayal of Percy.  He did such a wonderful job I actually hated Percy and wanted to slug the little jerk.  A close second was Rockwell's interpretation of the crazy Wild Bill.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the music in this film.  Most of it was instrumental but I've always been a fan of the song "Dancing cheek to cheek". All of the music fit in well with the scenes in which it was played.  Another part of the movie was the special effects.  There weren't a whole lot of them, but what was used was tastefully done and entirely believable. They had a great interpretation of Coffey expelling the "toxins" he took out of people.<br /><br />I should include a bit of a warning about some of the scenes in this movie.  Because it is a movie about death row in a prison, there are execution scenes.  One of them is especially horrific and children might not be able to handle it.  There is also violence done to a mouse (no animals harmed in real life of course) which could be disturbing for younger children.  In addition to this, some of the paranormal aspects could be frightening for younger crowds as well.<br /><br />Wonderful movie filled with great actors and performances.  Out of all the Stephen King movies out there, this is definitely one of the better ones.<br /><br />Review by M.

The film has moments of beautiful tenderness and incredible cruelty.  Tom Hanks is the head of the block known as the Green Mile where the inmates are interred before their execution.  His efforts to be a compassionate but firm jailer run afoul of a wormy, vindictive and spiteful subordinate, placed there via nepotism.  The arrival of the mysterious, large, John Coffey reworks the dynamics on the death row - as does the arrival of a small mouse which gives immediate purpose to one of the inmates.  Finally a darker figure makes his presence known when the last inmate is transferred in, a cosmic counter-balance to the innate goodness of Coffey and his healing ways.  The interplay between all these actors is brilliant and in some instances heart rending, it certainly choked me up more than a few times.  Themes of love, hate, friendship, guilt, redemption, and healing all intertwine to combine for a memorable movie experience.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Starring Tom Hanks as a death-row prison guard in 1935, and written by Stephen King, this is an example of story-telling at its finest. My most frequent criticism of films is that they tend to be overlong, but The Green Mile, at a three full hours, needed every precious second in order to pace the story, develop its characters, and lead the viewer into the satisfying conclusion.<p>Despite some gruesome scenes depicting the details of electric chair execution, the film is a testament to the humanity of people.  The audience gets to experience the stress of the responsibility of prison guards seeking to bring a bit of dignity to the last days of the convicted men, and we share their moral dilemma when they are faced with hard choices.<p>Michael Clarke Duncan, cast as the simple and honest black man sentenced to die for supposedly killing two little girls, is absolutely superb and was nominated for an academy award for his outstanding performance.  He's 43 years old, 6'5&quot; tall and a former ditch digger and bodyguard.  He has the rare quality to be able to show emotion in a way that makes the audience understand the complexities of his character.<p>Tom Hanks, of course, is excellent, giving us the kind of fine performance we have come to expect of him.  And the rest of the cast, including Michael Jeter as the villain, and David Morse as a fellow prison guard are perfect. There is also a small cameo role for Gary Sinese as the Louisiana prosecutor who believes in the guilt of the supposed killer.<p>Directed by Frank Darabont who also shared the scripting of this film with Stephen King, every scene is constructed with just the right amount of tension to keep the viewer glued to the screen.  There was not one wasted moment.<p>But by no means is this a simple &quot;wrongly-accused killer&quot; film.  There's a slight suspension of reality well integrated into the story line.  And constant thought-provoking questions that stay with you long after the video is over.<p>Unless you are the kind of person who absolutely can't bear some heart-wrenching brutal scenes, don't miss this video.  I give it my highest rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>Stellar performances from all of the cast.  The story is compelling, and you really get to fall in love with Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, who is accused of a horror of a charge that he did not commit.

Five stars for this fine title.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>"The Green Mile" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Sephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful-and-spiritually-profound film; "The Green Mile" is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.<br /><br />THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.<br /><br />"The Green Mile" is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities of the nature of John Coffey]<br /><br />John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means "winged creature." Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easlily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse "Mr. Jingles."<br /><br />[End SPOILER ALERT]<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, "The Green Mile" is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Stephen King should be extremely proud of Frank Darabont's rendering of &quot;The Green Mile.&quot;  What an awesome cinematic experience!  It certainly does give you a whole new vision of the death penalty, and life in general.  What is truly amazing about this film is the casting!  They should have given an Oscar to all of them as the most outstanding ensemble cast in years!  It's hard to single out any one person, but if you look at the entire cast, you can see how perfect they were for their roles. Of course, Tom Hanks demonstrates why he's considered the best actor out there these days.  His portrayal of Paul Edgecomb is simply terrific.  His battle with the urinary tract infection is played marvelously, without one word of dialogue, and when he's cured, and goes to the john, the look of relief is something any male can identify with.  Truly, an astounding performance.  His face never fails to mesmerize, as he anchors this truly touching story.  His relationship with his wife (beautifully embodied by Bonnie Hunt) is so beautiful; it's rare to see in movies these days. Michael Clarke Duncan was certainly robbed by Michael Caine of his supporting actor Oscar.  Duncan is great.  A man of unbelievable size, he still evokes a gentleness and understanding of love in such a wonderful way.  His last scene with Hanks is pure gold. The rest of the cast is awesome, too.  David Morse (from &quot;St. Elsehwere&quot;) is perfect as Brutal.  All the guards seem to have a genuine love for each other, and Morse displays strength, compassion and humor in this overlooked role.  Jeffrey DeMunn and Barry Pepper as the other &quot;good&quot; guards are brilliant, too. That brings us to Doug Hutchison as Percy, perhaps the most evil and unlikeable character to ever touch celluloid.  Hutchison is brilliant in his portrayal of this evil, uncaring, unhuman guard.  What he does to Delacort in the electrocution scene is the most cold-blooded murder ever witnessed by this reviewer.  You need a strong stomach to sit through this horrible event.  Michael Jeter as Delacort, the man who gets an unusual friend in the mouse, Mr. Jingles, is awesome in his role.  Likewise, Graham Greene, only on screen for a few minutes, creates an indelible death row victim.  And it doesn't stop there: James Cromwell as the warden; Patricia Clarkson, as his dying wife; Harry Dean Stanton as the surrogate victim; Sam Rockwell as the totally irreprehensible Billy Wharton; Gary Sinise in a bit part; and of course Bonnie Hunt as Hanks' wife round out one of the best casts I've seen in years. The Green Mile is one of those movies that sticks in your mind long after you've viewed it; and I almost forgot:  Darabont's brilliant decision to cast veterans Dabbs Greer and Eve Brent as the older Hanks and his nursing home confidant.  Stunning! The movie never seemed slow, or long; it's hypnotic!  It's true film-making at its best. TEN STARS IF WE HAD THEM!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Anyone expecting a replay of Darabont's masterful interpretation of Stephen King's 'The Shawshank Redemption' would definitely be disappointed here.  Quite frankly, this is much more a Hollywood movie than Darabont's last.  The movie, also based on a Stephen King story, will test your patience with its length and although good in its own way, it never truly inspires.  Set in the Great Depression the story has Michael Clarke Duncan as a man sent to The Green Mile (the green walkway that leads to the electric chair) for the murders of two little girls.  Prison warden Hanks quickly discovers however, that things aren't what they seem when the soft-spoken prisoner heals him of an infection.<p>There's a lot to say in this movie's favour.  As usual Hanks's good guy is never less than satisfactory, and Michael Clarke Duncan manages to bring a sense of emotion to his role.  Most impressive however are the electric chair scenes, which are shocking just as much as they are compelling.  Quite simply there has never been a more graphic movie against the death penalty.  There's also a nice little subplot with a malicious prison guard that likes to take out his own inadequacies on the prisoners.<p>Still, there is a definite tendancy to sentimentalise and the theme of friendship and human worth is always pushed that little bit too far.  In addition, there are several elements, such as a cutesy pet mouse, that were completely unnecesary to the story's flow and the conclusion is hurried and overly tearful.  However, that isn't to say that it's a bad movie.  Far from it, there's a lot of worth here, but it's just as conventional as every other Hollywood prison movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z379ES750ZRY.html">A2Z379ES750ZRY</a><br/><p>A compelling script and incredible acting -- particulary by those who play the death sentence inmates and the sadistic prison guard -- keeps the viewer absorbed.

I understand it got four Academy Award nominations. Mr. Jingles ought to get an award of his own.<br /><br />The Green Mile is the walkway in the hall of the death row at a major prison. Tom Hanks is the man in charge. All of the prisoners await their journey. Some are quite likable people. Some are despicable. Same with the guards who are in charge. Mr. Jingles is a mouse who lives in the corridor and is befriended by one of the inmates. It seems like a pretty simple setting but a lot of drama is involved in the dynamics of the situation and this is the best movie in which I've ever seen Tom Hanks. The acting, direction and filming are all first rate. Well done!<br /><br />My inclination would be to give the movie five stars, without reservation, except for one factor. I didn't like the hocus-pocus of the miraculous healings. This type of supernatural nonsense tainted an otherwise outstanding movie, in my opinion. I have no alternate suggestion. The fault lies not with the movie or it's production, but with the author of the story. If you can somehow get around this built-in problem, or somehow suspend your otherwise rational beliefs, you'll find the movie to be a five-star effort on the part of all concerned.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard on death row.  It is called the Green Mile by those at the prison because of the green floor that convicted men must walk to the electric chair.  John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is convicted in court for the murder of two little girls.  He is a giant of a man and everybody believes that he must have done it but Paul begins to wonder if it is true.<br /><br />John is quiet and respectful of other people unlike a fellow prisoner.  He also has special powers that manifest themselves in front of the eyes of the death row guards.  They begin to doubt that John Coffey is a murderer, but.....<br /><br />This is a superb story that has been brought to the media of film in a perfect way.  The casting for the actors in this movie was one of the best I have ever seen.  The acting is astounding and the entire cast is perfect for their roles.  It is a story about the supernatural powers of one man and the evil that exists in the world.  John Coffey knows who killed the girls and in his own way he finds some retribution for the crime.<br /><br />This is an outstanding movie and if you like Stephen King you will absolutely love this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This is a VARY sad movie. I cry just thinking about it. John Coffee is a very good man. He didn't deserved to die. He new it, but excepted it anyways. This is a movie that you don't want to pass up.</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>The Green Mile draws its name from the lime floor tiles that cover the floor of a southern prison's death row. In a story with that backdrop and set in a 1935, you could expect death to be a main theme... in this case you'd be wrong. Surprisingly, we are quickly drawn into the lives of the prisoners and their guards in what can only be described as normal daily existence. They worry about normal things like friendships, security, conformity and boredom. We can therefore believe in them as real people, with pasts and futures, rather than two-dimensional silhouettes merely cast onto horrific scenery.<p>The Green Mile is not a film that can be easily described. All of the characters are important. If there is a plot, it is submerged beneath a dozen important sub-plots. The characters are what keep us entranced during  this three-hour celebration of morality. Our point of view is firmly glued to the senior guard on the Green Mile, Paul Edgecomb, played with feeling by Tom Hanks. Paul is a good man, surviving the great depression in a less than attractive job. We are witness to his strength early in the film as he deals with an excruciating urinary tract infection. This strength is displayed in other ways as the story progresses.<p>Based on a series of Stephen King novellas, we are not surprised when a new inmate arrives who fails to fit into any kind of prison mold. John Coffey, (J.C. - get it?), is a mountain of a man who exudes innocence and peace in equal measures. Every day that he stays on the row, increases Paul's belief that Coffey was wrongly convicted of killing two little girls. It is only after Coffey displays a miraculous healing gift that Paul starts to question the status quo.<p>But Paul's redemptive efforts, and even his work, are constantly hampered by a junior guard, Percy Wetmore, (Doug Hutchison). Percy is well connected in political circles and uses this form of protection to free his base desires. He likes to humiliate, frighten and hurt other people, never a good combination  in a prison guard. Luckily, Percy is well matched by Paul Edgecomb. We have confidence that Paul will eventually master Percy.<p>Balance seems to be important in the story because just as Paul and Percy struggle on opposite sides of morality, John Coffey is soon introduced to his opposite, William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wharton, (Sam Rockwell). Wharton is a thoroughly evil man. Not content with enjoying his own warped hobbies, he seems driven to spread as much suffering as inhumanly possible. Unconcerned with his impending execution, he takes every opportunity to attack the guards. We even feel some sympathy for Percy when he comes within the diseased reach of Wharton.<p>All the support roles are outstanding, although Graham Green's character, Arlen Bitterbuck, was not so memorable. I'd like to especially praise David Morse, who plays Brutus, Paul's right hand man; and Michael Jeter, playing a Cajun prisoner, Eduard Delacroix, who has a comic dose of eccentricity. Eduard introduces another minor character, Mr Jangles the mouse.<p>There is a lot of symbolism in The Green Mile. The mouse, eventually adopted by Eduard, seems to represent freedom. He comes and goes without  restriction. He can't be trapped and he enjoys life, as expressed through his simple circus tricks. Coffey's healing power clearly represents good or perhaps the power of God. The ephemeral black insects he releases after absorbing disease, imply more than illness. Perhaps sickness is supposed to be an evil of the body. Sadly, Coffey eventually embodies pure goodness in our minds, and then he renounces the world and its ubiquitous evil. We are almost convinced there is no hope in our lives but luckily, Paul's strength shows us that hope can never fully disappear.<p>In the end, a film that might have centered on the morality of the death penalty, takes us in another direction entirely. Our focus is always Paul Edgecomb. His moral strength and eventual spiritual test are offered to us as a testimony. Hank's performance forces us to examine our own lives. Can we recognize the good in those around us and, more importantly, can we resist the evil?</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>Great film and probably should have won the academy award or equal.  I admit to being a fan of Steven King, but this film had it all: a great story, a wonderful cast, great acting, good sets, fine filming and editing, great special effects, a haunting musical score and so on. It was far superior to The Stand (which I loved), and which many King fans think is his best film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>After "Dolores Clairborne", "The Green Mile" is without a doubt the best film adaption of a Stephen King story. Tom Hanks plays a prison warden in Florida during the Great Depression, and it is through Hank's character that we as an audience encounter many prison characters and prison officers, some good and some bad. The most interesting of all the characters in the film is John Coffey, played brilliantly by Michael Clark Duncan. Coffey is serving time in prison for raping and murdering two girls. However, we soon discover that Coffey is innocent. Coffey also has special healing powers, and once we know Coffey's background and innocence we root for him in his survival from being killed on death row.<br /> "The Green Mile" is one of the greatest prison films of all-time, and it ranks up there with "Midnight Express" and "The Shawshank Redemption". Both "The Green Mile" and "Shawshank" were directed by Frank Darabont and written by Stephen King.<br /> The special features on this outstanding two disc set include commentary by Darabount, two deleted scenes, a rare teaser trailer never before released, makeup tests of Tom Hanks, and Michael Clark Duncan's screen test. There is also an informative ninety minute documentary on the making of the movie.<br /> "The Green Mile" won four Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Micheal Clark Duncan.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E.html">A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E</a><br/><p>What a great movie! I'm not a huge Tom Hanks fan but have enjoyed some of his films. This one, though, may end up as being my favorite of his. Filled with great scenes of both hope and tragedy, of sorrow and of joy, with just a touch of redemption thrown in.<br /><br />Based on a book by Stephen King, the Green Mile starts off in modern day times and then uses a "flashback" to tell the story of a group of death row guards during the depression and the strange story of a condemmed prisoner named John Coffy (played magnificiently by Michael Duncan). The story is a mix of drama, humor, and adds the spiritual/mystical as only Stephen King can do. The story also has one of the most creative twists at the end. Very surprising!<br /><br />But what takes this movie one of the best I've personally watched is the supporting cast. Besides the well known David Morse & Bonnie Hunt, we get James Cromwell (L.A. Confidential, Star Trek - First Contact), Michael Jeter (Open Range), Graham Greene (Dances with Wolves (Widescreen Edition)), Sam Rockwell (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Widescreen Edition)) & Harry Dean Stanton (way too many great roles to pick just a couple).<br /><br />I would recommend this to any movie buff looking for originality and creativity. Great actors, great story, great film!</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>Since its release in 1999, I have had 7 or 8 people tell me how good this is, but I have always stayed away from it simply because of its use of the electric chair, the last thing I want to see is someone eletrocuted I have thought over the years, well, I decided to give it a look, & man, I can't believe that I ignored it for so long, this film was awesome, I still can't get my mind off it, there is nothing I can't say here that hasn't already been said, except to say, that it is truly inspiring & sad, that I teared up at the end, I hate it when movies do that to me, but this is one of the best films I have ever seen, It is over 3 hours, but trust me, you won't notice, Highly Recommended!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>The best adaptation of a Stephen King novel to date. Hollywood allowed this film to develope the various characters unlike most King adaptations.. There is a smoothness of this film, and a sadness as it nears its inevitable end, which holds the attention and completely disregards the 3+ hour length. Any who have seen it, will always remember it. Myself, I try to see the uplifting side, the hope the final monologue touts, but every time I watch this film, I feel the horrible sadness created by people wronging others with malice and hate. Something that does not belong in this world, but something this movie embraces.<br /><br />Michael Duncan Clark, as John Coffee, is the spritual heart of this film. It made his career. He plays the wrongfully convicted man who supposedly murdered two small girls. But he never defends himself, being too simple and too PURE. As the film unfolds, he is found to Tom Hanks and others to be a creature of God. He is able to see into peoples' hearts, and know their wrongs. Being simple, he is unable to block the pain and suffering people have brought him. He is only able to absorb the pain (physically) and while on the Mile, send the pain (physically) to the evil who spend time there.<br /><br />In my mind, this is the role Tom Hanks will hold as the pinnacle of his career. He plays the walk boss on a Texas 1920's death row, which is known as the Green Mile. His character has steadfastly executed inmates with no remorse, until John Coffee. Not only does Coffee cure Hanks bladder and prostate problem, Hanks is witness to Coffee curing a brain tumor from the wife of the warden. It is then that Hanks understands his charge is more than just something special. He is redemption.<br /><br />The theme of Coffee's gift is shown as he revives life into Mr. Jingle's, a mouse living on The Mile. The mouse becomes the final comfort to a mild mannered killer played by Michael Jeter in one of his final roles (his last role was in Open Range).<br /><br />Anyone reading this, has already seen the film. I am not touting the film so much as sharing the what viewers already know.<br /><br />I compare this film to Pay It Forward in its ability to make the viewer feel. And THAT is what a movie is supposed to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>An OUTSTANDING film, The Green Mile, follows the life of a prison guard at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in the 1930's.  That life is going to change when a new inmate arrives and is placed on death row...<br /><br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, faith, friendship, and inner strength.<br /><br />Moreover, there are some obvious elements of the X-Files that can be seen throughout the film.<br /><br />Tom Hanks, Michael Duncan, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it is an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, The Green Mile is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Frank Darabont<br />Cast:  Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Jeter, David Morse, Sam Rockwell.<br />Running Time:  180 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, langage, and a grisly execution scene.<p>As with many Stephen King novel adaptations, many viewers complain that the book was far scarier than the film and that the images portrayed visually are not nearly as efficient and signifant than on paper.  &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, an epic flim representation of the serial book series written by King in the mid 1990s, is an example of how some films are just as good as the book.<p>Tom Hanks gives another above-adequate performance as the head chief of a maximum-security penitentiary who discovers that a new cell inhabitant may not be all that he seems.  As the film unfolds and director Frank Daraont reveals the truth about the mammoth criminal (played by Michael Clarke Duncan), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; becomes less of a rehash of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; and more of a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode spliced with &quot;Cocoon&quot;.<p>The film has a great supporting cast, especially that cute little mouse Mr. Jangles (not credited), and an excellent, emotionally-involved script that will grab viewers and keep them captivated until the very end.  While a little long in its deliverance, this motion picture is one that can truly touch the hearts of individuals and shed tears in those who would not have thought possible.  A supernatural tale that seems out of place in portions, but overall a heartwarming drama that will surprise, scare, and arrest you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8AO9XASQ15C.html">A1R8AO9XASQ15C</a><br/><p>Here is a movie that is destined to become a classic over time. "The Green Mile" is more than just a Stephen King tale (in fact, it's hardly that at all); it's an epic character study, a human drama told against a backdrop of cruelty and violence. Another masterful collaboration between King and "Shawshank Redemption" director Frank Darabont, the movie represents some of the best work of everyone involved -- especially star Tom Hanks.<p>Over the last decade, Hanks has become our greatest living actor. His work in "Forrest Gump," "Saving Private Ryan," "Road to Perdition," "Cast Away" and "Catch Me If You Can" proves his name worth mentioning with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. He can effortlessly transform himself into whatever character he plays, yet still remain "Tom Hanks." His best acting may be in "The Green Mile."<p>As 1930s prison guard Paul Edgecomb, Hanks gradually unveils a wealth of sensitivity beneath an exterior hardened by life on Death Row. Another actor might have killed the role with treacly sentimentality, but Hanks focuses on Paul's tough, sturdy integrity. Only in his more private moments does he reveal second thoughts about his job, making the character all the more compelling.<p>Darabont did a sensational job directing this movie. What's amazing is that he left so much of King's original story intact; one could easily imagine the studio ordering so many cuts and trims and alterations that it would hardly make sense anymore. But I can't think of a thing that could have been cut that would have improved the film by its absence. Surely we could do without so many details of Paul's urinary tract infection, but look at the expression on Hanks's face as he whizzes for the first time without awful pain. We feel his relief, and understand pretty much everything he does after that point.<p>"The Green Mile" contains excellent performances from an expert supporting cast. I loved everybody in the movie, from David Morse and Doug Hutchison (as the despicable Percy) to Bonnie Hunt and Sam Rockwell (as a foul-mouthed, truly loathsome killer). Michael Clark Duncan deserved his Oscar nomination for his empathetic portrayal of John Coffey -- but then Hanks also deserved a nod, for which he was unfairly overlooked.<p>The movie is hard and unflinching in its look at death by electric chair. These scenes are grueling without being exploitative; Darabont gets his point across without turning the movie into "Faces of Death." Darabont (and his surrogate Hanks) treats the condemned men with the utmost reverence and respect, allowing each a chance for redemption. The most harrowing scene in the film is Paul's realization that he may be executing an innocent man -- worse, a man blessed with the healing powers of God, and that the fires of hell may be stoked for him, as well.<p>The movie never tells us whether Paul himself receives deliverance. His own long walk -- an unnaturally extended life --becomes a form of punishment. We are left with so much to ponder at the end of "The Green Mile." It is worth every minute of its running time, and is now one of my all-time favorite films.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>This film is a very great masterpiece. The story is so engaging. I have read the wonderful novel that this film is based on and the film stays true to it in both spirit and story. It is also well acted, well, shot, and well written.

He takes his time with the story and the development of the characters. Don't expect fast cuts and short scenes; each film is a work of art that is meant to be savored.<br /><br />Before I talk about the film, I have to mention a funny story. Stephen King decided to write the book in a series of six installments. King was inspired by Charles Dickens, who also liked the serial novel format. I found the first installment in a supermarket and kept the receipt. It listed the item as "Two Dead Girls" for 99 cents. It's amazing what you can buy in supermarkets these days.<br /><br />The Green Mile is set in a Louisiana prison, but, unlike The Shawshank Redemption, the inmates can only interact by talking and never leave their cells to mingle. Each prisoner is condemned to death and is awaiting a meeting with Old Sparky, the electric chair.<br /><br />The story is narrated by Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer and Tom Hanks), the head warder, and the vast majority of the story is told through the use of flashback and is set in 1935. He explains how he met a huge black prisoner named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan). Coffey is a simple man and seemingly gentle despite his size, but he was found guilty of murdering two little girls. His behavior doesn't do anything to suggest that he was capable of such an act.<br /><br />Coffey has a secret, but I can't reveal it here without ruining the movie. His nature becomes apparent about an hour into the film and it changes everything.<br /><br />The story revolves around Edgecomb's role in running the prison and how he reacts when he finds out Coffey's true nature. Prison life is fairly quiet, but Edgecomb has to deal with an annoying warder called Percy Wetmore. We are told that Wetmore has connections and so the other warders have to tolerate him or risk losing their jobs. Another thing that upsets Edgecomb's routine is the addition of a new prisoner, 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell), who likes to make as much trouble as possible.<br /><br />One part of the story concerns the appearance of a mouse. The reaction of the individual warders reveals something about their own nature and it's a brilliant plot device. Unfortunately, I can't say anything more about the mouse without ruining the story.<br /><br />The Green Mile isn't what it seems. It begins like a hard-hitting drama, but things change as we discover more about the characters. In the end, the story is about trust and belief. It's very powerful and some of the characters do extraordinary things. The warders, with the exception of Percy, are a close-knit group. They demonstrate the kind of trust that can only occur between close friends. The stakes are high and the story is compelling.<br /><br />I'll say no more about the plot other than that the conclusion is very satisfying.<br /><br />Darabont draws strong performances from every member of the cast. Hanks is superb as usual, but the story wouldn't work without Michael Clarke Duncan's performance and his Oscar nomination was well deserved. I could mention at least 15 actors who played their role to perfection. Darabont was nominated for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay and the film deserved all of the recognition it received. The mouse should have won an Oscar.<br /><br />The film has a couple of disturbing scenes, such as one of the executions, but is generally a series of character studies. You'll be sucked into the story because of what the characters do, rather than for any special effects or shocking scenes. The story has a lot of heart and will stay with you long after the credits roll. At 189-minutes, many will be wary of watching the film. Don't let that put you off. Good films never feel too long, and this is a very good film.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br />The VC-1 transfer looks very good for the most part. Detail in close-ups is exceptional and, apart from a few soft scenes, detail is generally strong throughout. Black levels are problematic on occasion. Darabont uses plenty of dark shots using blacks, grays and browns. Sometimes, shadows obscure some of the detail. I'm very happy with the upgrade, but it could have been slightly better. Owners of the DVD will be relieved that the Blu-ray comfortably contains the entire film, so you won't have to flip the disc over as you did with the DVD.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />The English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1 mix is quiet and I found myself increasing the volume by 10 decibels over my normal level. Once that adjustment was made, everything sounded clear. It's a dialogue-driven film, but the surrounds do play a part when required. Listen to the sound of the mouse running across the floor and you'll hear the fine detail in the mix. One electrocution is particularly noisy and you'll feel like it's happening right in front of you. I couldn't detect any imperfections in the track at all.<br /><br />Special Features 5/5<br /><br />The extras all appear in standard definition:<br /><br />Commentary by Director Frank Darabont<br /><br />Walking the Mile: The Making of The Green Mile (25:30)<br /><br />Miracles and Mystery: Creating The Green Mile (1:42:54) - If the commentary and "Making Of" features weren't enough, here's an in-depth look at every aspect of making the film.

And it's not hard to see why. You either buy into its sentimentality and the magic, or you don't. If you don't buy into it, you are going to hate this movie because it keeps serving you large servings of it for more than three hours. If you do buy into it, you are in for an emotionally draining and disturbing experience. I'm still digesting it, frankly, and I can't quite say yet if I'm happy that I saw it.<br />Is it well acted? Yes, but remember the emphasis is on sentiment. If you don't buy sentimentality, you won't like the acting.<br />How about the story? Like most Stephen King, there are several twists and turns and a couple of miracles along the way. It also has an incredibly disturbing execution scene that I fear did damage to my synapses permanently. I don't need that from my &quot;entertainment.&quot; This is not a movie for the faint of heart. However, in some ways it is, because people who are not yet supercynical -- the bleeding hearts out there -- are most likely to get caught up in the film.<br />Another frequent complaint is the length. I'm of two minds about that too. In general I like longer movies. You become more enveloped in the characters, more immersed in the world, but this is still a heck of a long movie when, frankly, not all that much actually happens. I think the director could have easily sliced 20-30 minutes without sacrificing any of the story.<br />As far as the ending, I'm not going to give it away like some others here do (you are forewarned), but it is more complex than the previous work by the Frank Darabont/Stephen King crew, The Shawshank Redemption. It is a proper ending to the movie, but anybody taking away simple emotions from this movie didn't quite get it, in my view. Shawshank, by the way, I wholeheartedly endorse, as a superior movie. Shawshank is one of the best movies I've ever seen, that leaves you emotionally drained and completely satisfied. The Green Mile has left me drained, but with a sense of unease that I can't quite put my hands on.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>If there ever was a movie made to win a bunch of Oscars, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is it. It has the serious story, the serious actors, and the serious length that the Academy likes to reward with serious numbers of statuettes. <p>But it's this calculated &quot;We're making a Great, Important Film&quot; attitude that really hamstrings &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, a good film that could have been far better with less liberal doses of gravitas.<p>This isn't to say that &quot;The Green Mile&quot; doesn't have its strong points; it's beautifully made, well acted, and does have some wonderful moments.<p>To begin with, the cast is excellent. Tom Hanks turns in another wonderful everyman performance as prison death row guard Paul Edgecombe, who tries to let his charges live with as much dignity and respect as a person waiting for his turn in the electric chair can. <p>The rest of the actors portraying Edgecombe's crew are also fine, but Doug Hutchinson stands out as the smarmy, abusive Percy Wetmore, a man who most assuredly gets what he deserves. Harry Dean Stanton has a great turn as Toot Toot, a old-timer con who helps Edgecombe's crew rehearse executions. (&quot;I'm fryin! I'm a done tom turkey!&quot; he exclaims from the electric chair, as Edgecombe pretends to turn on the juice.)<p>Frank Darabont's direction is suave and self-assured; like his previous film, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; portrays prison life with just the right amount of depressing reality and everyday humanity. And though &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is too long, you have to hand it to Darabont for making the film long enough for its various characters and storylines to flesh themselves out; too bad he spent too much time focusing on Mr. Jingles, the prison's resident circus mouse.<p>The problems with &quot;The Green Mile&quot; start with Mr. Jingles and John Coffey, a huge, powerful, but barely coherent man who lands in Edgecombe's care for killing and molesting two young girls. As time goes on, it becomes apparent that John Coffey has magical healing powers (check the initials); he heals Edgecombe's urinary infection and the warden's brain tumor, and even fixes Mr. Jingles after Percy crushes him. The plot centers around Edgecombe's growing certainty that Coffey couldn't possibly be guilty of the heinous crime that landed him on death row; the Big Question - whether they can execute this guy or not - is the other plot center. <p>Michael Clarke Duncan plays Coffey as a virtual mountain of pain, and the pain shows through in every shot. Problem is, there's not much more to Coffey than pain, and that's a major failing of the film, and of Duncan's performance. Perhaps the original point of the Coffey character was to show a man who simply wanted to die, but Coffey is so depressing and one-dimensional, and dominates so many scenes, that I suspect a goodly part of the audience wanted to see him die after the first hour.<p>That brings us to the subject of length. The main criticism of &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is that it's too long, and I agree. Having said that, I don't mind long movies at all...as long as they give me fascinating characters and situations, and don't beat me about the head and face with how important they are. This is why other long movies like &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, or even &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; seem to fly by, while &quot;The Green Mile&quot; drags dutifully and laboriously onward.<p>Thankfully, Darabont wisely avoids the trap of talking too much about capital punishment; given the film's subject matter and a particularly brutal execution sequence, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; could have been an anti- (or pro-) execution manifesto. But given that that death by electric chair - a particularly grisly death AND topic if ever there was one - lurked behind every frame of this film, couldn't it have focused more on people and less on Big Themes like the Messianic Man Who Must Die?<p>Darabont's mistake wasn't making &quot;The Green Mile&quot; too long; it was filling &quot;The Green Mile&quot; with so much fluff (like the mouse), self-importance, and Great Cinema flourishes that the movie sagged under the weight of its own inflated self-expectations. That's sad, because &quot;The Green Mile&quot; could have been a lean, mean, prison fable that really would have walked off with a zillion Oscars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>Stephen King has written another gem that was destined to fly from the pages of his book to the big screen.  The cast for this film was perfect on all accounts. You can't help but feel for and fall for the tender-hearted,  illiterate hulk, John Coffey. The gentle giant being falsely accused of the  horrible murder of two little girls who were sisters makes you think about  how we view circumstantial evidence... if I had been at the ficticious  crime scene, I would have found him guilty, too.<p>The twists and turns are  pleasant surprises throughout the film and you will remember a little mouse  (&quot;Mr. Jingles&quot;) for the rest of your life after seeing this  film.<p>The film is not appropriate for young viewers because of the  violence, executions, language and other adult themes... but a young  teenager has probably already seen and heard everything above and beyond  what this film delivers as far as &quot;adult content&quot; on prime time  TV.<p>The film is long, but it never feels as long as it is. The story is  intense, however, and I can't imagine watching it over and over again...  although DVD helps you jump to certain scenes you enjoy, such as watching  Mr. Jingles push a spool across the floor!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E.html">A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E</a><br/><p>What a great movie! I'm not a huge Tom Hanks fan but have enjoyed some of his films. This one, though, may end up as being my favorite of his. Filled with great scenes of both hope and tragedy, of sorrow and of joy, with just a touch of redemption thrown in.<br /><br />Based on a book by Stephen King, the Green Mile starts off in modern day times and then uses a "flashback" to tell the story of a group of death row guards during the depression and the strange story of a condemmed prisoner named John Coffy (played magnificiently by Michael Duncan). The story is a mix of drama, humor, and adds the spiritual/mystical as only Stephen King can do. The story also has one of the most creative twists at the end. Very surprising!<br /><br />But what takes this movie one of the best I've personally watched is the supporting cast. Besides the well known David Morse & Bonnie Hunt, we get James Cromwell (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790734850">L.A. Confidential</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305127638">Star Trek - First Contact</a>), Michael Jeter (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TANUI">Open Range</a>), Graham Greene (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F187">Dances with Wolves (Widescreen Edition)</a>), Sam Rockwell (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A283AW">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Widescreen Edition)</a>) & Harry Dean Stanton (way too many great roles to pick just a couple).<br /><br />I would recommend this to any movie buff looking for originality and creativity. Great actors, great story, great film!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I honestly didn't think I would like this movie at all.  I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks.  He's impressed me a few times before but honestly I can't think of a time when he's ever `wowed' me.  I am not a fan of Stephen King in that I never really have given him a try.  Aside from `Misery' I have never read any of his novels.  I have seen a few of the film adaptations and enjoyed them but I have also seen some of his adaptations and thought they were dreadful so really it's a mixed bag for me.  I decided to give this a chance only because a friend of mine raved it, and it has received high amounts of praise from the critics and have I mentioned yet that it was nominated for Best Picture of the Year at the Academy Awards so with that in mind I decided to sit down and watch this, finally.<br /><br />The film follows the effect one falsely accused man has on the prison guards in charge over him.  This man is John Coffey, an extremely large black man accused of raping and murdering two young girls.  Despite his immense size Coffey appears to be a very kind soul.  This is noticed by one of the guards, Paul Edgecomb.  Getting to know John, Paul realizes that he is, without a doubt, innocent but the evidence against him is surmountable and it appears that his execution is eminent.<br /><br />While this is the main storyline for `The Green Mile' there is so much more to uncover, and there should be since the film is three hours long.  I've read a while back that the character of John Coffey was modeled after Jesus Christ and this makes perfect sense when you watch this film and analyze it.  John's `powers' are very similar to the ones heaped upon Jesus and John's predicament is also one similar to that of Christ.  Everyone has turned on John except for a few men who put faith in his power to heal.  He is wrongfully accused of a crime he did not commit and sentenced to death by the men he was trying to protect.  It's something I did not expect to come from Stephen King, that's for sure, but then again I've never given him a fair chance...maybe I should.<br /><br />The performances in this film also elevate the material, especially that of Michael Clarke Duncan who delivers a performance so solid and so tempered that without it the film would have failed.  He is, with all due respect, the heart and soul of this film.  Tom Hanks surprised me by delivering an outstandingly tender performance.  It may actually be his best performance to date.  Patricia Clarkson sizzles in what little screen time she has as does Bonnie Hunt and David Morse and Barry Pepper do their best to stand out amidst powerful performances by James Cromwell and more notably Doug Hutchison who plays the `evil' Percy Wetmore.  Sam Rockwell is as disturbing as they come and the revelation of his character will chill you.<br /><br />Like I said in my title for this review, it is far better than I assumed it would be but it still was not as grand as some have suggested.  There are moments where the melodramatic feel doesn't quite mesh right and there are some scenes that tend to drag a bit.  I'm not saying that the length is a problem for it enables the audience to truly sink into the mood of the film but there are some scenes that could have been trimmed.  It is not one of my top five films of 1999, nor one of my top ten, but it rests well with my honorable mentions.  It is not as disturbing as `Carrie' and not as meaningful as `The Shawshank Redemption' but it rest nicely in the middle and delivers solid and gratifying entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>From all standpoits, this picture means a complex and deep sociological approach about the human behavior.<br />A prison represents the background ; the vehicle for developing a fine story filled with many narrative devices and secondary readings.<br />Lets start with the character of Percy. Obviously Percy represents the nazi spirit ; a characteristic smell in that age.But notice than much more than a political movement the nazism works out here as a living style.  Watch the way he acts ; her cut hair and his manners ; he seems to be a hard beat man and behind of this invisible wall ; you feel a man with serious emotional and affective lacks. The proofs are very clear ; he is a man without a bit of humanity a beast would be a term appropiate if not that issue may offend the animal species.The punishment for him it's excellent ; he will live in his memory over and over the horror: the Shakespeare's memory . The sin hurts much more in the memory than in the flesh.<br />We have in the prison characters who trascend his personal values through the green mile . The silent agreement : "All what it happens in the green mile , it keeps in the green mile" will be a statement that won't be too long after the redemption caused for Coffey. The mouse gag is a very ingenious clue. A prisioner will experiment a twist of fate with this pet.<br />The main character John Coffey is framed to die in the electric chair ; acussed by a murder . Slowly the curtains will reveal the awful truth and you as viewer will be reflected in the moral jury who observes the execution.<br />Notice by moments the film reminds us to a great picture of the same age (1935) , casually titled "Fury" of Fritz Lang . In many ways it doesn't sound speculation to state the rendezvous for that shocking film. The extrordinary picture Top Hat in which we watch to Fred Astaire dancing with Ginger Rogers is a touch of genius device that let introduce us and links the last will of Coffey ; Heaven ; I'm in heaven. And you can not avoid thinking in Cinema Pardiso ending.<br />The script was a hit. Frank Dubont made a very well done work with the camera , art direction , photography, cast and enlightment.<br />When the film concludes you remain in your chair thinking the multiple lines around the story . The sense of revenge , vested as justice ; the ugliness who lives in the soul of that people will watch the last minutes of Coffey beats in your face, your solu and your heart.<br />The smart ending is filled with sweetness ; it's very clever and it works out as relief for the viewer , who may forget the real intention of the film . You may assume the most comfortable position and consider the film as a beautiful redemption story : good choice for you , but the bitter message goes far beyond ; the racism ; the intolerance and the pain for the narrator who should live thinking about his silent shame , and to make nothing for avoid it.<br />To know and not to do is still not knowing said once the japanese writer Mishima.<br />This film and the wisperer's horse were the finest achievements in 1998 ; good signals that reveal the awakening of new proposals and ideas for the american cinema.<br />A winner movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks: best role since Big, and perhaps ever. Harry Dean Stanton: best role since Alien. Most of the rest of the cast: best role ever. (The notable exception: Gary Sinise, who didn't have enough screen time to  really get his teeth into the role.) The guy who played the warden, whose  name I completely forget, has made a career-- and a great one-- out of  playing total jerks. And he does it well. This may be his first role as the  good guy, and even though I kept expecting him to grab a tommy gun and mow  down the rest of the good guys, he's just plain jaw-droppingly good as a  man who's simply at the end of his rope. <p><p>But the guy who really needs  singled out here is Michael Clarke Duncan. Duncan plays the huge, gentle,  mentally deficient John Coffey so perfectly that he'll go down in history  as one of those actors who plays his role so well that people walk away  from the experience wondering whether the actor himself suffers from the  same deficiencies as the character. The only role like that in the last  thirty years or so has been Larry Drake's wonderful character on L. A. Law;  before that, you have to go back to To Kill a Mockingbird. There probably  aren't many Hollywood roles around for seven-foot-tall four-hundred-pound  actors, but if there's any justice in this world, and half a brain,  collectively, in Hollywood, someone will start writing roles for this guy.  <p><p>Want some more superlatives? How about the makeup jobs on Michael  Jeter and Harry Dean Stanton, which are up to the standards set by the  makeup jobs on Murphy and Lawrence in _Life_? There's gonna be a steel cage  match for the make-up Oscar this year, and both The Green Mile and Life are  equally deserving. The special effects, what little were needed, are  chilling, brutal, and unglamorous; there's no glorification of death here.  The direction is fantastic; the camerawork is some of the best I've seen  all year. <p><p>My problems with the film are few, and the main one is  related to the book, so most people who haven't read it probably didn't  even notice. The subplot in the book regarding the Percy-like nurse's aide  who confronts Edgecombe towards the end of book five is completely missing  from the movie. Because of this, there are a few scenes at the beginning  that trail off into nowhere. Also, the closing monologue slips pretty far  into melodrama territory, and the film would have been just as good without  it. But these are small things in comparison to the monster that is this  film. Critics have been pretty uniform in panning it; ignore them  completely. This is one of the best, if not the best, of the year. It  deserves every accolade it receives, and probably more. Filmmaking in the  nineties has only rarely been this good. However, it HAS been this good  before, and those little niggling annoyances make me give it a **** 1/2.  Still one of the best movies of the decade. If you miss this one, you're  cheating yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>Frank Darabont knows his way around a prison -- he gets the look, feel, atmosphere and assorted characters dead on.  The Green Mile, again an adaptaton of a Stephen King story, does not disappoint when it comes to  evoking this world.  But, unlike the far superior Shawshank Redemption,  this movie has, for me, an alienating dose of the supernatural, like Carrie  in prison.  The human scenes and characters, Tom Hanks chief among them,  are so compelling without this extra layer, I cannot help but feel that  this movie would have been even more powerful without resorting to the  special effect moments of strangeness.  It is also bloated in its running  time, as if the story was so important that it required three hours to  tell; the narrative simply doesn't warrant it. However, these flaws  notwithstanding, Michael Duncan is riveting; Bonnie Hunt again delivers a  subtle, warm performance as Hanks' wife; the villianous types are villians  extraordinaire, and the movie is completely enjoyable on its own terms.  A  fantasy portending to be something much deeper, The Green Mile is superbly  packaged pulp, designed, it seems, for a younger audience, with excellent  performances and production values.</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>The Green Mile draws its name from the lime floor tiles that cover the floor of a southern prison's death row. In a story with that backdrop and set in a 1935, you could expect death to be a main theme... in this case you'd be wrong. Surprisingly, we are quickly drawn into the lives of the prisoners and their guards in what can only be described as normal daily existence. They worry about normal things like friendships, security, conformity and boredom. We can therefore believe in them as real people, with pasts and futures, rather than two-dimensional silhouettes merely cast onto horrific scenery.<p>The Green Mile is not a film that can be easily described. All of the characters are important. If there is a plot, it is submerged beneath a dozen important sub-plots. The characters are what keep us entranced during  this three-hour celebration of morality. Our point of view is firmly glued to the senior guard on the Green Mile, Paul Edgecomb, played with feeling by Tom Hanks. Paul is a good man, surviving the great depression in a less than attractive job. We are witness to his strength early in the film as he deals with an excruciating urinary tract infection. This strength is displayed in other ways as the story progresses.<p>Based on a series of Stephen King novellas, we are not surprised when a new inmate arrives who fails to fit into any kind of prison mold. John Coffey, (J.C. - get it?), is a mountain of a man who exudes innocence and peace in equal measures. Every day that he stays on the row, increases Paul's belief that Coffey was wrongly convicted of killing two little girls. It is only after Coffey displays a miraculous healing gift that Paul starts to question the status quo.<p>But Paul's redemptive efforts, and even his work, are constantly hampered by a junior guard, Percy Wetmore, (Doug Hutchison). Percy is well connected in political circles and uses this form of protection to free his base desires. He likes to humiliate, frighten and hurt other people, never a good combination  in a prison guard. Luckily, Percy is well matched by Paul Edgecomb. We have confidence that Paul will eventually master Percy.<p>Balance seems to be important in the story because just as Paul and Percy struggle on opposite sides of morality, John Coffey is soon introduced to his opposite, William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Wharton, (Sam Rockwell). Wharton is a thoroughly evil man. Not content with enjoying his own warped hobbies, he seems driven to spread as much suffering as inhumanly possible. Unconcerned with his impending execution, he takes every opportunity to attack the guards. We even feel some sympathy for Percy when he comes within the diseased reach of Wharton.<p>All the support roles are outstanding, although Graham Green's character, Arlen Bitterbuck, was not so memorable. I'd like to especially praise David Morse, who plays Brutus, Paul's right hand man; and Michael Jeter, playing a Cajun prisoner, Eduard Delacroix, who has a comic dose of eccentricity. Eduard introduces another minor character, Mr Jingles the mouse.<p>There is a lot of symbolism in The Green Mile. The mouse, eventually adopted by Eduard, seems to represent freedom. He comes and goes without  restriction. He can't be trapped and he enjoys life, as expressed through his simple circus tricks. Coffey's healing power clearly represents good or perhaps the power of God. The ephemeral black insects he releases after absorbing disease, imply more than illness. Perhaps sickness is supposed to be an evil of the body. Sadly, Coffey eventually embodies pure goodness in our minds, and then he renounces the world and its ubiquitous evil. We are almost convinced there is no hope in our lives but luckily, Paul's strength shows us that hope can never fully disappear.<p>In the end, a film that might have centered on the morality of the death penalty, takes us in another direction entirely. Our focus is always Paul Edgecomb. His moral strength and eventual spiritual test are offered to us as a testimony. Hanks' performance forces us to examine our own lives. Can we recognize the good in those around us and, more importantly, can we resist the evil?</p></br><a href="../users/A37DLVPKJZGSQF.html">A37DLVPKJZGSQF</a><br/><p>From the first frame right through the final cut, The Green Mile is an astonishingly powerful, suspensefully crafted picture that is extremely hard to fault. Nominated for 4 Academy Awards, the movie has at its centre a moving performance by Michael Clarke Duncan, one that left me numb a little while afterwards. He pulls off a brilliant showcase with Tom Hanks, who has stunning screen prescense. The script is charmingly sad and brillianty planned, while Frank Darabont (who also wrote) gives very plausible efforts in his directing. Although the result is a film that misses the best film ever made quality of 1994's The Shawshank Redemption, also by Darabont, this is still an elegant picture that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.<p>One last thing, ignore the bad-mouthings about the length of The Green Mile. I didn't mind it, and it has such a high level of intrigue and utter superbness that 3 hours will feel like 1 to you too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Stephen King knows how to spin a yarn.  This is another terrific adaptation of a King novel that delivers a bittersweet story of a depression era Louisiana prison on the death row cell block.  It presents  numerous interesting character studies that induce strong emotions for the  various characters.  There is also a lot of irony here with good guys who  are evil and bad guys who are good.<p>Director Frank Darabont, who missed  out on an Oscar with `Shawshank Redemption' (also by Stephen King) to  `Forrest Gump' must have decided he wasn't going to beaten by Tom Hanks  again and secured him for this film with wonderful results.  Unfortunately,  he was trumped at the Academy by Kevin Spacey and `American Beauty', an  injustice in my opinion.<p>Darabont again does a superlative job of  creating the right mix of drama, imagery and human interest.  My only  criticism of his direction is that the film was much too long.  It  certainly could have been done in two hours instead of three with very  little lost in the editing.  We could have eliminated the entire first  execution and rehearsal without any loss to the story except perhaps the  sponge issue.<p>The acting was outstanding by all.  Tom Hanks turns in  another great performance as the tough but kind cell block boss.  Hanks  continues to show his versatility, excelling in both dramatic and comedic  roles and moving effortlessly between them like a chameleon.  David Morse  mirrored Hanks as another tough guy with a heart and played the part  nicely.  Michael Clarke Duncan engendered a very sensitive and lovable  nature to his character, making the contrast between his demeanor and  physiognomy all the more striking.  And I cannot leave out the uncredited  star of the show, the little mouse who played Jangles.<p>Overall, a well  crafted film and an excellent story that suffered slightly from excessive  length.  I rated it a 9/10.  I would recommend it highly to anyone except  those who are squeamish about graphic violence (such as the electrocution  scenes).</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>The movie is a decent sci fi drama based in a prison ,and taking place in the past (1930's) where social inequality was a terrible fact. I don't say racial; because we are all one human race with different skin colors biologically speaking. The acting is good and it is a good steven king adaptation. NOt as powerful and truly great 'shawshank redemption' another steven king story that is a straight drama , but is set back in this era as well. The acting is first class with tom hanks and the rest of the cast doing a fine job. Michael Clarke Duncan is especially good as the giant with strange abilities. (HE died of cardiac arrest at age 54 in 2012, sadly). MOst people who are that tall don't live to be sixty which is unfortunate as well, anyway he really puts in a outstanding performance here.  The blu ray is a very good one and the regular one is the same blu ray as the book version, it's a better buy , unless you want the collectors aspect. There are some good extra features on here as well. So sell off your dvd and buy the blu ray version.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>The Green Mile is the name of death row at Cold Mountain Penitentiary where most of the events depicted in the movie take place.  Tom Hanks and David Morse play prison guards on death row who get a new prisoner named John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Duncan is a mountain of a man and seems to be a simpleton but he has been sentenced to death for the murder of two little girls.  This moview is primarily a drama with a number subplots all concerning various inmates and guards at the prison.  An interesting turning point in the story occurs when Coffey demonstrates the ability to heal merely by touch.  The inclusion of this single element of fantasy into an otherwise harsh reality has tremendous impact and causes ripple throughout the rest of the movie.<br /><br />This film has a great cast from top to bottom whether it's the big names or the character actors who get typically little credit but give a great deal of depth to the movie.  Duncan steals the show as Coffey partly due to his sheer size but also because of the great warmth and decency he brings to the character.  Hanks does as fine a job as he ever has, and that's saying something.  The movie is a bit long but there is a lot of story to cover and I never felt like it dragged at all.<br /><br />In short, The Green Mile is an exceptional movie.  The script is unusually intelligent, the acting top notch, and the story keeps you interested throughout it's nearly three hour running time.  It certainly has an unorthodox story line but it works beautifully.  If you haven't seen the film yet, I would certainly recommend giving it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Possibly the best Stephen King movie (although the appallingly underappreciated "The Mangler" might give it a run for its money, but that's in a completely different vein) and one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled, including the performances of their lives by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan in the leads plus outstanding support roles from such talents as James Cromwell (the farmer from "Babe" and "Babe: Pig In The City"), Gary Sinise (from "Mission To Mars" and "Forrest Gump") and Graham Greene (from "Dances With Wolves" and "Grey Owl") to name but a few.  The cast has some powerful roles to step into, because of all the King material I've seen or read (I admit I haven't read the original "Green Mile" book but have read most of his other novels and short stories plus seen most of the movies) this has one of the two greatest repertoires of characters: interesting, delved into indepth, most of them immensely likable and even the detestable ones highly interesting and fully-realized.  The only King work that compares in terms of such a multitude of A-list characters is the novel "Black House", co-written with Peter Straub (of course Black House's predecessor "The Talisman" contains arguably the greatest individual character (co-)created by King: Wolf.  Believe it or not though, Duncan's Coffey character here actually mounts a feasible challenge for that distinction).<br /><br />  Set in a prison, a deathrow at that, in - I believe it was the 1930s; somewheres thereabouts - "Green Mile" takes a different course from most prison-oriented movies by focusing not on brutality but on hope and redemption.  That no doubt sounds clich&eacute;, but it's never been more true than it is here, with some of the greatest depictions of compassion, regret and remorse, and the existance of redeeming values in outwardly mean souls.  Of course, there are also examples of some of the scummier examples of the human race here, and as is the case in a number of excellent stories, it's the mix and contrast of the 'bright' and 'dark' elements that give the movie so much of its potency.<br /><br />  Hanks plays the warden of a prison wing (the deathrow wing) set to receive convicted child-killer Coffey, a hulking giant who (thanks to great special effects) must be at least seven feet tall, and who because of his gentle, childlike nature immediately leads Hanks to question whether he could really be responsible for the crimes he was convicted of.  Hanks surprises with his role - the parts calling for the likable, intelligent, gregarious supervisor, it's a no-brainer that he could pull it off; but where circumstances call for the character to come off hard-as-nails tough and dangerous, I would not have known he could pull it off so utterly perfectly.  "Green Mile" really shows parts of his range that he'd never had a chance to show before.  And Michael Clarke Duncan's performance is something that I'm not even going to attempt to describe except to say that it's a high mark in movie history.<br /><br />  If you're a Stephen King fan and have been putting off getting this one just because it's not horror I urge you not to deprive yourself: this is one of his best works regardless of genre.  Or if you're a drama fan and aren't sure if a horror writer will be adept at pulling off this type of material don't worry about that either - that King created this very different tale in addition to such excellent horror as "Carrie" and "The Jaunt" (a particularly terrifying tale in the "Skeleton Crew" anthology) shows his versatility as a writer just like the change of pace for Hanks and several other performers known for different types of roles shows theirs.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Having not read all of the previous reviews of this excellent King adaptation, I must add to the accolades by singling out one of the film's supporting performers, one who has been a presence for over a half century: Dabbs Greer.  Although only seen as the &quot;old Paul Edgecomb,&quot; Greer makes a memorable turn as the elder version of Tom Hanks in the movie's closing moments.  His quiet and dignified soliloquy is truly touching.  I cannot tell how moved I was by such a topper to this outstanding bit of storytelling.  Greer, as well as all parties involved, magnificently brought one of Stephen King's best works to the screen.  Along with &quot;The Shawshank Redemption,&quot; &quot;Mile&quot; ranks as the most faithful and cinematically satisfying of any jump from page to the cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>If this film had not come out, everyone, and, I mena, EVERYONE, would be missing something. This film, based on the Stephen King bestseller, is  Frank Darabont's best film along with THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Tom Hanks,  Michael Clarke Duncan, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, Gary  Sinise, and many other fine and talented stars headline this masterpiece.  At first, I thought this film would be a flop. But, thanks to word of  mouth, the film grossed $136 Million domestically. I personally think it  should have done better than that. This, along with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, is  Tom Hanks'  best performance. The visual effects, although there aren't  many, are dazzling. The relationships between the the actors is at times  sad, and at times funny. The mix of comedy, drama, fantasy, and mouse  hunting make it a film that certainly deserves to be on every movie fan's  top ten list of all time best movies. For a three hour movie with no very  exciting moments, it is really fast paced. The ending, although quite sad,  is still a happy one. Everybody who loves GREAT movies should see this.  Trust me, it will make your day. Bravo, Tom Hanks!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I am just a chump for "The Green Mile".  I know this film is an allegory that lays it's sentiments on a little thick but I am completely hooked.  Credit has to be given to Frank Darabont for his excellent direction for allowing this story, adapted from a Stephen King novella, to unfold slowly, but not excrutiatingly so, to a satisfying conclusion.  Darabont, to his credit, has assembled a first-rate cast to enact this tale.  The always solid Tom Hanks shines as Paul Edgecomb, the stolid head guard of "the mile".  Michael Clarke Duncan as the condemned John Coffey, a role that on paper borders on the one-dimensional, shines and gives the film it's heart and soul.  Excellent support is offered here by Bonnie Hunt, David Morse, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell,Gary Sinise, and Patricia Clarkson.  Special mention should be made for the late Michael Jeter who sympathetically portrays one of the condemned prisoners.  My only real gripe about the cast is Doug Hutchison and Sam Rockwell as the film's ostensible heavies.  These parts either as written or portrayed are a little over the top.  "The Green Mile" sure is long but it is well worth an investment of your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This was a surprisingly good movie. I had seen &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; (SR) and many others like it. I preferred &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (TGM) to most of them, including SR. If you liked &quot;Beaches&quot; or &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, give TGM a try.<p>Tom Hanks shines as an actor, as do almost all of the other cast members. What is more impressive is how Hanks works in prison-management skills into the movie. It is a good example to managers in all fields.<p>The movie is long at three hours. However, if it had been cut shorter, it would not have been as effective. This is one of those longer movies that should be three hours (about 90% of the others should be half their length).

His life is fairly normal until a prisoner named John Coffey is brought into death row.  Coffey is a gentle giant who brings a sense of spirit and humility to his fellow inmates and guards.  He also possesses supernatural powers which he uses for the good of his fellow man.  Wrongfully accused of murdering two young girls, Coffey, being black, is immediately suspected and ultimately sentenced to die for this crime.  While awaiting execution, he magically transforms death row into an area of caring and compassion.<br /><br />Paul Edgecomb experiences Coffey's powers first-hand.  Suffering from a terrible urinary tract infection, he is miraculously healed by Coffey.  Also, Delacroix's pet mouse Mr. Jingles (who really steals the show, in my opinion), is resurrected by Coffey after a vindictive Percy steps on him.  Even Warden Moores' wife, who is suffering from a terminal brain tumor, is healed by Coffey's magical touch.  Coffey also uses his special powers to show Edgecomb that he is really innocent of the charges against him.  However, Coffey doesn't want anything to change, merely saying that he wants everything to come to an end.  Sadly, Edgecomb and his crew accept Coffey's decision, even though they know he is innocent.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  The story is first-rate, and the acting, led by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, is outstanding.  The execution scenes are carried out with remarkable realism, as well.  Based on the novel by Stephen King, the movie is actually better than the book was.  I was impressed with the relationship that developed between Coffey and the guards and how their friendship deepend until the final scene, where the guards are openly crying while carrying out Coffey's final wish.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  This is not your typical Stephen King slasher film.  Rather, it is one that will touch your soul and uplift your spirit.  Watch and see how a gentle giant uses his powers to help others while unselfishly sacrificing himself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>Darabont followed up his brilliant adaptation of King's Shawshank novella with this brilliant adaptation of the serial novels &quot;The Green Mile.&quot;  I actually saw the movie prior to reading the book, and was absolutely amazed at how closely the movie follows the book.  If anything, the movie adds material instead of excising it.  The only subplot that the film fails to explore has to do with a cruel nursing home staff member who is practically abusive to the main character.<p>Otherwise, what you find in the serial, you find in the film.  The characters are all incredibly memorable and brilliantly cast.  Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan steal the show, while David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Barry Pepper, Patricia Clarkson, Sam Rockwell, Doug Hutchison, and Harry Dean Stanton fill out the supporting roles with enough depth for four films.  <p>Although the story has supernatural elements, the key to the story are the human interactions--Hanks' sensitivity to the needs of prisoners condemned to die in Louisiana's electric chair, and the twist ending that manages to give all of the true &quot;bad guys&quot; their just desserts (and not all of those bad guys are the ones in the cells).  <p>Perhaps the best of all of the King adaptations, the Green Mile will make you laugh and make you cry, but most of all, it will make you CARE.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>A truly great film, starring the terrific Tom Hanks. This movie shows he can play any one in any film, and he does it well. <p>Many Stephen King movies aren't worth their weight in gold, particularly some of the "Stephen King's" whatever. This one, along with Carrie, is. It's worthwhile watching (even if you do need to keep your legs crossed throughout!) and it'll definitely make you re-think certain things.<p>There any many good actors in this. Alongside Tom Hanks, there's David Morse (Brutus "Brutal" Howell), Bonnie Hunt (Jan Edgecomb), Michael Clarke Duncan (John Coffey), the late Michael Jeter (Eduard Delacroix) and Dabbs Greer - 'old' Paul Edgecomb, better known to a select few as Reverend Alden from Little House On The Prairie!<p>There is a lot of clever camera trickery used in this movie, to make Michael Clarke Duncan look even bigger! He's a big hunk of love to begin with, and considering there's only an inch between him and David Morse to begin with, it was done very well, as Michael seems to tower over everyone. Also, quite a lot of the time, you only saw Michael's top half - I'm sure he must have been standing on something. It's the first shot(s) of him, when he first comes onto the Green Mile, and everyone looks upwards!<p>Of course, unless you're thick as two short planks (like moi) you will have realised that Michael's character, John Coffey, has the same initials as another infamous healing character. So it's almost a modernised version of that, although maybe better and less graphic.<p>It's obvious what will happen, but what I noticed throughout the movie, other characters get "seen" sitting on the electric chair, and getting electrocuted, but you don't see this with John Coffey. The camera goes somewhere else and you only get a quick shot of him sitting on it - it's almost like he got a dignified exit. I suggest if you have a very weak stomach, you turn away when Eduard Delacroix gets electrocuted. It is not pleasant, and you WILL feel sick.<p>There is a lot of 'green mile' imagery in this movie - of course, during the main part of the film, but at the start, the floor of the nursing home is a green-ish colour.<p>And if you're Mr(s) Know-It-All about your movies, you will perhaps notice that the music played over the loudspeakers in the retirement home as Old Paul Edgecomb first walks out of his room is the same as the music the nurses played at medication time in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest!<p>This film comes highly recommended, and the book is just as good. The extras are quite good at the same time, although not if you don't like looking at Stephen King!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks finds himself in charge of Death Row at a penitentiary where a huge but gentle prisoner (played by Michael Duncan) has the gift of healing. The movie is a play of good against evil, but it's more, much more, than such a simplistic explanation. The movie takes its time, and every second is worth gold. Painful to watch in places, but impossible not to. Brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I honestly didn't think I would like this movie at all.  I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks.  He's impressed me a few times before but honestly I can't think of a time when he's ever `wowed' me.  I am not a fan of Stephen King in that I never really have given him a try.  Aside from `Misery' I have never read any of his novels.  I have seen a few of the film adaptations and enjoyed them but I have also seen some of his adaptations and thought they were dreadful so really it's a mixed bag for me.  I decided to give this a chance only because a friend of mine raved it, and it has received high amounts of praise from the critics and have I mentioned yet that it was nominated for Best Picture of the Year at the Academy Awards so with that in mind I decided to sit down and watch this, finally.<br /><br />The film follows the effect one falsely accused man has on the prison guards in charge over him.  This man is John Coffey, an extremely large black man accused of raping and murdering two young girls.  Despite his immense size Coffey appears to be a very kind soul.  This is noticed by one of the guards, Paul Edgecomb.  Getting to know John, Paul realizes that he is, without a doubt, innocent but the evidence against him is surmountable and it appears that his execution is eminent.<br /><br />While this is the main storyline for `The Green Mile' there is so much more to uncover, and there should be since the film is three hours long.  I've read a while back that the character of John Coffey was modeled after Jesus Christ and this makes perfect sense when you watch this film and analyze it.  John's `powers' are very similar to the ones heaped upon Jesus and John's predicament is also one similar to that of Christ.  Everyone has turned on John except for a few men who put faith in his power to heal.  He is wrongfully accused of a crime he did not commit and sentenced to death by the men he was trying to protect.  It's something I did not expect to come from Stephen King, that's for sure, but then again I've never given him a fair chance...maybe I should.<br /><br />The performances in this film also elevate the material, especially that of Michael Clarke Duncan who delivers a performance so solid and so tempered that without it the film would have failed.  He is, with all due respect, the heart and soul of this film.  Tom Hanks surprised me by delivering an outstandingly tender performance.  It may actually be his best performance to date.  Patricia Clarkson sizzles in what little screen time she has as does Bonnie Hunt and David Morse and Barry Pepper do their best to stand out amidst powerful performances by James Cromwell and more notably Doug Hutchison who plays the `evil' Percy Wetmore.  Sam Rockwell is as disturbing as they come and the revelation of his character will chill you.<br /><br />Like I said in my title for this review, it is far better than I assumed it would be but it still was not as grand as some have suggested.  There are moments where the melodramatic feel doesn't quite mesh right and there are some scenes that tend to drag a bit.  I'm not saying that the length is a problem for it enables the audience to truly sink into the mood of the film but there are some scenes that could have been trimmed.  It is not one of my top five films of 1999, nor one of my top ten, but it rests well with my honorable mentions.  It is not as disturbing as `Carrie' and not as meaningful as `The Shawshank Redemption' but it rest nicely in the middle and delivers solid and gratifying entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The Green Mile,' since it is based on a Stephen King novel, emerges as a death row prison story with a sci-fi twist. Chances are the viewer will either be swept up in this tale of life, death and spiritual renewal  involving a group of characters working and languishing in a 1930's prison  cell block - or dismiss it as a prime example of sentimental hooey. Like  the similar (and similarly overrated) Stephen King-inspired prison epic,  `The Shawshank Redemption,' this new film provides far too sanitary and  romanticized a vision of prison life to be either entirely convincing or  particularly meaningful. Indeed, `The Green Mile' goes a step further into  the realm of parable by ascribing to one of its main characters the power  of miraculous healing. Unfortunately, however, a parable is, almost by  definition, supposed to be short, pithy and to the point. The story here -  which runs a presumptuous 3 hours and 8 minutes - is so overstuffed with  subplots and subsidiary characters that it actually works to weaken the  emotional effect generated by the plight facing John Coffey, the innocent  messenger from God condemned to death, and Paul, the prison guard assigned  to run the death row cell block, who comes to learn of Coffey's  innocence.<p>`The Green Mile' certainly has its heart in the right place,  but it divides its world too evenly up into good guys and bad guys. Perhaps  the decision to cast Tom Hanks in the leading role of Paul accounts for the  fact that the character seems far too genial, soft-spoken and humanistic to  be a man dedicating his life to dispatching convicted murderers to their  just (or unjust) rewards. Coffey, a mountain of a man in the form of actor  Michael Clarke Duncan, ranks as the oldest clich&eacute; of all: an uneducated,  marginally imbecilic lug of a guy whose innocent, childlike heart and mind,  though trapped inside a behemoth's body, provide the clean vessel through  which God is able to work his wonders. Except for this last fact, Coffey's  pedigree descends from a whole multitude of earlier characters, including  Lennie in `Of Mice and Men' and even Frankenstein's monster. Is this  possibly why `The Green Mile,' in deference to the former character,  features a mouse in a prominent role? Similarly, one doubts it is mere  coincidence that the crime for which Coffey is convicted is that of raping  and murdering two little girls, an echo of Frankenstein - albeit, in this  case, Coffey, of course, is innocent; after all, having him be guilty of  the brutal murders would muddy up the moral waters and make it a lot harder  to elicit tears from a sentimental, happily rheumy-eyed audience. Also,  this allows the authors to pound home the Christ figure qualities of Coffey  (John Coffey - JC - get it?) to an unsubtle fare-thee-well. In addition to  dying innocently for another's sins, Coffey gets to heal the sick and smite  the evildoers (the latter, more in keeping with Jehovah perhaps than with  Christ per se).<p>Nor are the filmmakers much more successful with their  villains. Amidst all this amazing good will between condemned killers and  supportive prison guards, there has to be some vinegar to cut the  sweetness. This comes in the form of a too neatly balanced duo, one a  guard, the other a far-from-model prisoner. The guard, Percy, is a craven,  sadistic coward who delights in antagonizing the prisoners, taunting and  torturing the men at the moment of execution and, most monstrously of all  to the animal lovers in the audience, squashing a pet mouse on the eve of  its owner's death. The evil prisoner, Wild Bill, provides a similar  two-dimensional quality to his wickedness, serving as a too-obvious foil  for the other pure-as-the-driven-snow condemned men. By so neatly divvying  up the characters into clearly delineated categories of good and evil, the  filmmakers rob their film of the moral complexity that might have lent it  some real meaning.<p>As to the film's rather startling and, initially  unexpected, flights into fantasy, they serve mostly to further soften the  edge of this already overly idealistic and mawkish story.<p>`The Green  Mile' is certainly not a `bad' film. It sports a number of excellent  performances, generates some moments of genuine emotional power and, though  languorous at times in its pacing, admirably refuses to hurtle ahead as it  patiently gathers the strands of its story together. As with a good long  novel, one approaches it with a sense of patience and goodwill. We want to  give it the benefit of our attention. Therefore, we regret even more that  the makers of the film too often settle for the easy path of cheap  emotionalism and simpleminded sentimentality. Those of us willing to  dedicate more than three precious hours to this particular cause deserve  better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Frank Darabont's "The Green Mile" is a film that takes its time and unfolds meticulously.  It is undeniably a well-made film but one that is ultimately undone by a crucial deviation from the source material.<br /><br />Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a prison guard in charge of overseeing inmates imprisoned on death row.  One day a new prisoner named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives after being found guilty of killing two young girls.  Edgecomb wonders whether the imposing man really is guilty of the crime as he seems to be a harmless and gentle individual.  After Coffey displays a strange healing power, it becomes apparent that there is something wondrous about the man.<br /><br />Despite its technical excellence, "The Green Mile" has little in it to make it memorable.  The film flounders primarily because of the decision to replace the sobering ending in Stephen King's original work with an empty and inconsequential Hollywood finale.  In the novel, Edgecomb's character is subject to a traumatic experience that makes him question his actions in the prison.  The filmmakers completely abandoned this ending in order to produce a more generic product for the general public.  The story loses much of its weight because of this lack of soul-searching on Edgecomb's part.  The performances themselves are excellent although Hanks may have been a little too young for his character.  Duncan, Doug Hutchison, David Morse, Sam Rockwell, Barry Pepper, Harry Dean Stanton, Bonnie Hunt, William Sadler, James Cromwell, Gary Sinise, and Patricia Clarkson are all great but the film is still underwhelming despite their best efforts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ.html">A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ</a><br/><p>Wasted one hour of my life on this nonsense. I had no hope it'd get any better after 1 hour waiting.

I saved 2 hours by not watching the rest :)</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>Well-acted, nicely shot, and at moments quite moving, 'The Green Mile' is ultimately undone by its staggering 188 minute running time. Such languorous pacing adds nothing to the film - except fuel the audience's irritation with an unforgivably predictable plot and some pretty heavy-handed moralizing. Darabont tries his best to wring some significance out of King's story, but the material ultimately proves too slight: this tale could have been capably told in 100 minutes or, better yet, deployed as a vignette in a prison film such as Darabont's vastly superior 'The Shawshank Redemption'.  Dragging it over three hours stretches the material too thinly, and in the end leaves a potentially deep story looking rather shallow. This is a good lesson in filmmaking: you can have a fine director, a savvy cinematographer, a marvellous score, an excellent cast, and $60 million to play with - but if you don't have a decent screenplay, then you might as well stay home. Just ask Kevin Costner.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>This wasn't the worst film of 1999, but it was easily the most embarrassing.  Director Frank Darabont leaves no stone unturned in resorting to tired cliches in this fable about this hulking Black man (Duncan) who is on death row for murdering two white girls and befriends a prison guard (Hanks).  Through their friendship, it is revealed that Coffey has these healing powers, which, oddly, he uses to save everyone but himself.  And yadda, yadda, yadda.  The streotypes that emerge in this film are appalling.  The performances were okay, but was this really Oscar material?  The best thing about this movie is that, at three hours, it's paced fairly well.  It goes by so quickly, that you'll hardly realize that you wasted three hours on this preachy, self-important excuse of a film.</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>I often hear too many people, and I admit that I've even heard myself, say that life just plain sucks. Well, it can from time to time, but there is also so much beauty in the world that is right front of you; all you have to do is open up your eyes and see it. Watching &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; I felt my eyes open as wide as they ever had. I left the movie theater with a new appreciation for everything I was given. Sure, I give in to the natural desire to complain once in a while, but not as often as I did. Very few movies can make you feel this way. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; does. Adapted from the six-part serial novel of the same name by one of the great authors, Stephen King, Frank Darabont brought another uncommonly powerful work of King's to the screen with such depth and emotional resonance that by the end of the movie, there isn't a dry eye in the house. Once Tom Hanks, in a terrific performance as Paul Edgecombe, loses it, so do we, and we wear our tears proudly. How could we not, after all, if a seven-foot-something miracle of God such as John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) can? There are many moments in &quot;The Green Mile&quot; that are worthy of a standing ovation, and one in particular that makes your chin slam into the floor harder than I think most everyone's did at the end of &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but the soul of the movie lies in the relationship between Hanks and Duncan, whose performance is as much being as it is acting. There is a reason why the Best Supporting Actor race last year was so hectic, and it was because performances like Duncan's were in the running. This movie works in so many ways on so many different levels, and despite its three-hour running time, every minute of which is entertaining, it never falters. The ending of the film could've been trite, but there is one thing that saves it: The inspired monologue that gets us to comtemplate our own lives, and what we have done with them. &quot;Sometimes the Green Mile seems so long,&quot; Paul Edgecombe says in his 108-year-old voice.

Other reviewers have blabbed away the magnificent plot, and everyone knows how wonderfully Michael Clark Duncan played JC. The entire ensemble cast was excellent, without exception. Tom Hanks is powerful in the lead, and strong performances from Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Harry Dean Stanton, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey de Munn, and David Morse are all, individually, brilliant, and added to ensemble brilliance. Special mention must go to Doug Hutchinson's performance as the wimp. He was a nastier person than any of the guys on Death Row; that rotten little bully we've all known at one time or another, because he had "connections".It was, I thought, a courageous performance. Most unappreciated are the women; Bonnie Hunt is the ultimate devoted wife, and Patricia Clarkson will totally blow you away with her display of simplicity, insanity and renewal. At 3 hours, "The Green Mile" never fails to keep your attention. I love it.  UPDATE: I just bought the 2-disc version, and it' not that much better.

With a moderate success and forceful critic praise, The Shawshank Redemption conquered seven Oscar nominations.<br /><br />The script was pure dynamite. Darabont was able with The Shawshank Redemption - as never before did other films based on novels of King -, to transmit an emotional force that was impossible to resist. The secret was staying faithful to the original manuscript, preserving the essence of history. Summarizing, Darabont knew how to expose why like so much Stephen King novels.<br /><br />Because they are stories well told.<br /><br />It's true; they are not Shakespeare, Cervantes or Balzac. They are not intricate philosophical paradigms or moral dilemmas that make us reflect on the questions that life holds. They simply are books that captivate us because they entertain us in a pleasant way. They are frank, gripping and sure, they make us laugh or cry.<br /><br />Now, Darabont returns with his adaptation of The Green Mile, a work that, as The Shawshank Redemption, is extraordinarily faithful to the original manuscript.<br /><br />In 182 minutes, the director condensed a history that takes place in a southern prison, in the years after the Great Depression.<br /><br />In Louisiana, Cold Mountain penitentiary has a block that receives inmates sentenced to death penalty. A linoleum corridor separates two rows of cells, where criminals rest next to their guards, waiting a crucial of their lives: death in the electrical chair. That cell block is called the "green mile", in a metaphor to the color of the floor tiles where those men walk to a destiny served by justice.<br /><br />Year after year, Paul Edgecomb and his guards observe the men that come to their final stroll by the mile, guilty, innocents, and sometimes lunatic, other indifferent ones. But nothing Edgecomb had lived until then could prepare him for a black man of formidable contexture called John Coffey, guilty of the death and violation of two local children.<br /><br />Coffey intrigues Edgecomb and his guards, because in spite of his size, he behaves like a ingenuous boy, with smooth voice and afraid of the dark. For Edgecomb it's practically impossible to think that Coffey has committed a crime. Much more when he sees him practice miracles as generous as his good heart. Therefore, when the time comes to execute Coffey, Edgecomb is not able to walk that last stroll by the green mile.<br /><br />Three hours free of cynicism, filled with good moments, extremely emotional situations where sentimentality and manipulation abound, where the mysticism is viable until becoming a reality. It is impossible not to be seduced by this beauty. If you can leave at home your cynicism detector, you will enjoy this film enormously.<br /><br />The whole cast offers wonderful interpretations, from Tom Hanks like the comprehensive Edgecomb to Michael Clarke Duncan like the enigmatic Coffey. Magnificent also are Doug Hutchinson like the ruthless Percy Whitmore, David Morse, in the comprehensive and faithful role of Brutal, Bonnie Hunt, the sweet wife, Michael Jeter, the French conquered by a little mouse and Patricia Clarkson, the special lady who can in John Coffey's eyes what's in his soul.<br /><br />Darabont, obviously, doesn't have limits directing. In slow motion, he doesn't know when he has said enough, when he has unfolded too many miracles, when a horrible execution has lasted so long that the audience has to turn around their heads from that much horror. He sweetens what's already been sweetened; he magnifies events, dazzling us with his seduction tactics. He is the master of emotional impact, because he believes blindly in his power.<br /><br />The Green Mile is a memorable piece, although it doesn't reach the levels of excellence reached by its predecessor, The Shawshank Redemption. This last film has a plot more prone to the massive acceptance: its purpose is to raise the triumph of the life. The Green Mile is darker: the subject, ultimately, is death.<br /><br />And as they say, one cannot exist without the other.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>The story unfolds in a Death Row ward in the 30s, where a giant black inmate who has been convicted of killing two little white girls (Michael Clarke Duncan) is delivered into the care of supervisor Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) and his staff of decent, hard-working prison guards (David Morse, Jeffrey DeMunn, Barry Pepper).  It soon becomes clear that this inmate is not what he seems and that the Green Mile (so named for its green floor tiles) has become the unlikely setting for a time of miracles and wonder that will deeply affect everyone involved.<p>Many of the plot elements are predictable (for example, I could guess almost everything that would happen to the mouse, Mr. Jingles, as soon as he appeared on screen, and I knew how the whole sub-plot with the warden's wife would develop).  However, this did not ruin the movie for me.  I didn't foresee the outcome of Paul's story, which ends the film on a perfectly melancholy and elegiac note.  In addition, the film is so well-made and the cast so perfectly chosen that, even when I knew what was going to happen, I looked forward to seeing how it would play out in the hands of writer/director Frank Darabont and his wonderful cast.  I can't end this review without mentioning the amazing performance of Doug Hutchinson as the vile, aptly named Percy Wetmore.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Even though his two most successful movies have been adaptions of Stephen King prison novels.  However, Darabonts' storytelling has raised those two movies, including "The Green Mile," above the usual mediocre King adapted movies and into the realm of greatness.  His touch behind the camera is impeccable, and he moves the story at an unforced pace to illustrate its themes and deftly paints its characters.  He also has an uncanny ability to choose brilliant casts, as he does here.  He brings in Tom Hanks, the most reliable actor in Hollywood to play the lead as Paul Edgecombe, and Michael Clark-Duncan as the walking miracle John Coffey. He also brings in David Morse as Brutus, James Cromwell as the Warden, Michael Jeter as Eduard Delacroix, Sam Rockwell as Wild Bill and Doug Hutchinson at his best as Percy.<p>Paul Edgecombe is a prison guard during the Depression, and into his midst comes a mammoth inmate named John Coffey, who was wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of two little girls.  But he is a gentle soul, and Paul and his fellow guards have a hard time comprehending that this man could have killed two little girls at all.  Over time, Coffey reveals his extraordinary gift:  He is a healer, some sort of a miracle worker, able to cure any ailment or disease.  He does so at first, by curing Paul's urinary infection.  But one fact keeps bothering the guards, Paul most of all:  should this miracle be executed or, more importantly, is he possibly innocent.  Darabont's script and direction keeps everything tight as it moves towards the emotionally wrenching and draining ending, one that leaves you tearless because you have spent them all.<p>Everything in the "Green Mile" is laudable, right down to the gritty set decoration and perfectly crafted period-set costumes and locales.  Frank Darabont crafted a masterpiece with the "Green Mile" one that can stand up to his other work of brilliance, "The Shawshank Redemption."  The story is so well told and the acting so unforced and natural, it's disappointing that they don't make that many movies like it anymore.</p></br></body></html>

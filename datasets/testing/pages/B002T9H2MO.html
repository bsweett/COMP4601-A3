I thought I had figured out what was happening, and so there was no big surprises due, but I was wrong. I had figured out what was discovered somewhere around the middle of the film, but not how it would play out to the end. Not even close. I was probably some confused by tastes of 2001: A Space Odyssey in a couple of plot elements.<br /><br />Anyway, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is alone in the mining operation on the dark side of the moon, if you don't count Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) the computer. Resist the urge to consider him another HAL9000. Gerty has a screen that displays an emoticon to express himself with, including actually having a tear in his eye at one point. Mostly it's just happy face or frowny face, but he has a pretty decent repertoire, actually.<br /><br />The premise is that Sam is near the end of his three-year contract, and eager to get home to his beautiful wife Tess and their adorable daughter Eve. He gets messages from them which cannot be two-way because something is wrong with the communications equipment. He's missing them terribly, looking forward to getting home, when he goes out in the rover to do some routine chore at one of the completely automated mining machines and has a smash-up. Next thing you know, he's waking up in the infirmary and Gerty is explaining that he had an accident, and will need to rest for awhile.<br /><br />And then things get seriously complicated.</p></br><a href="../users/A3II1ACACC5MTX.html">A3II1ACACC5MTX</a><br/><p>wahey!! Its finally stopped asking me if Im over 13!!<br /><br />Watched this the other night, unsure of what to expect. Its a sort of futuristic retrospective, redolent of all the films others have mentioned, and also of Space 1999, and other Anderson-esque type offerings. Spacey is dull and emotionless at the best of times, making his work here as Gerty excellent casting! Rockwell is excellent as he has little to go on here, carrying the film by the strenght of his perfomance. The premise is realistic, although one couldnt imagine any corporation no matter how stingy, only manning the operation with one bloke, of course WE know why this is the case, but even so.... also the reaction of the characters to each other (trying not to give spoilers) is unusual, in the same situation, I would have spent the next 3 years WTF-ing and not so quickly fall into the rapid acceptance of their situation the characters do.<br /><br />Plotwise, (SPOILER ALERT), my other main niggle would be the lack of explantion of the ilness suffered by Sam 1. It shows all the hallmarks of radiation sickness which would be a believable by-product of his activities on the moon, as exposure to solar radiation or even mining by-products could explain this. The Director alludes to a Bladerunner type limited lifespan,but this is a much more Deus-et-machina explantion than the former, in my view.. anyway..<br /><br />Ok, you can open your eyes now, yes, excellent low budget, well put together work, feels almost like you could present it as a stage play, good score, holds the attention even though there is a lack of aliens, explosions, chase scenes etc. Go ahead and try it. Watch is with Silent Running or Dark Star and compare and contrast!!<br /><br />K</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>PLOT SPOILERS<br /><br />It was an excellent movie on all levels. There were some scientific stuff going on that was not brought out. Clones are not as good as the originals. They tend to have defects and die young. It is not a perfected science. In this movie we see some of the aspects incorporated but never stated: testing of the clone when revived and disposal after 3 years. Today we are speculating that He3 mining on the moon could produce fusion energy in the future. I believe that was what the mining operation was doing, although not much was stated. It has several similarities to 2001, most have been listed. The most important one was that this was not an unreasonable science fiction with a long list of impossibilities, but rather a work which keeps within the realm of science fact, the way Arthur would have wanted it. The idea that they made the computer similar to HAL 9000 is not unreasonable. In fact I fully expect any NASA computer with the capabilities of the HAL 9000 to be named the same after the fictional work. The only thing I would have changed in the movie would be to show a glimpse of Sam viewing 2001 while on the space station.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Here is a job you might be interested. Three years in a lonely mining station on the moon, harvesting and sending to Earth helium-3, new energy resources for the futuristic society. You are totally alone during the time and a super-intelligent computer GERTY will maintain the entire facility and also take care of you.<br /><br />Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell, terrific as always) is the current worker. His three year stint is coming to an end and he is looking forward to meeting his wife Tess left on Earth again. But Sam realizes something is not right about this mission. He is not feeling well these days, and there are a few other things Sam is yet to know about the isolated station he has been living in.<br /><br />The visuals and narrative of "Moon" harkens back to an old-fashioned style of sci-fi films like Douglas Trumbull's "Silent Running," films made with a low budget but whose creators had a lot of imagination. The interesting stories have a message or two about our society, which is thought-provoking, but not preachy. Incidentally, "Moon" is directed by Duncan Jones, son of the star of "The Man Who Fell to Earth."<br /><br />"Moon" is part mystery and part sci-fi, but the film's success is due to the dramatic tension between the characters including the computer GERTY (voice by Kevin Spacey). Maybe not the most scientifically accurate film, but "Moon" offers an interesting story and unique visions of the future.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Going into "Moon," I had a preconceived idea of what was going to happen based on the first five minutes.  I thought this would be another paint-by-numbers predictable SF movie, another "Carnival of Souls" in space.  Instead, "Moon" delivers an original movie, with a bit of "Carnival of Souls," "Blade Runner," and even "Outland" thrown in the mix.<br /><br />What really makes the movie is the actors.  In a film where we're stuck in a moonbase with two characters for an hour and forty minutes, the actors had better be good and had better be well-written.  The script, and Rockwell and Spacey, deliver.  The "two-man show" is one of the most difficult bits of drama to pull off, and they manage to do it very well.  In another refreshing turn, the ending is happier and more optimistic than I had expected.  I don't need a happy ending every time, but I also don't need every movie to have a downer 70s German film style ending either.  While this is not a hugely effects-driven movie, most of the effects look great, as if they were part of a much higher-budget movie.  My one geek quibble is that, the entire movie, everything takes place at Earth gravity, which is fine.  To do otherwise would have cost 20 times the money.  But at the very end, all of a sudden there is some lunar gravity reflected in how a person moves around the lunar surface in a spacesuit.  That's no reason to not watch the movie, but it's jarring enough to take you out of the suspension of disbelief and make you think about the gravity and not the movie.<br /><br />The pacing of "Moon" is deliberate, perhaps too much so.  I would have cut 10 minutes or so out in order to get this down to the magic 90 minute mark.  However, "Moon" doesn't go on overly long or wear out its welcome.<br /><br />SF lovers, and probably the population at large, will enjoy at least renting "Moon."</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>This was a great movie! It's a SciFi movie with an outstanding "emotional twist".<br />Sam Rockwell carries the entire movie by himself and is worth watching from beginning to end.<br />The movie moves quickly through the story and never leaves you bored.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>I have no idea why this movie was never seen in theaters. While you have some of the more boring high-budget films out there, this one slipped through the cracks because it's an independent film, but it doesn't seem like it. Sam Rockwell does an incredible job of portraying different aspects of the character, and Kevin Spacey really puts a lot into his vocal work for Sam's only companion, a robotic assistant.<br /><br />The special effects here are top notch, but it's the story that takes center stage. There were several times when I thought I would know what was going to happen, but the story would turn from there. I honestly never saw the ending coming, and that made it much more satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>Moon (2008)- I just want to add my five star vote.

Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a space miner whose job is to make sure that the massive mining machines keep running and to ship the fuel they extract back to Earth.  He's at the tail end of a three year stint, and can't wait to go home -- and Gerty 3000, his robot companion whose design and mission is a significant twist from that of Hal 9000 (of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ASUM">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a>), seems worried he is beginning to lose focus on the mission.  It turns out Sam has much bigger issues to worry about.<br /><br />The German philosopher Martin Heidegger wrote that in an age of technology, where everything is treated as a resource, we ourselves become just another means to an end.  We think of technology as our servant, but humanity itself becomes another means to an end, a cog in the globalized technological machine.<br /><br />Director Duncan Jones has created a profound yet simple and small science fiction film that thematizes questions regarding the impact of technology on human life, how it affects human relations to each other, even what it means to be human.  The film feels like a return to some of the most intriguing science fiction of the seventies and the eighties, films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016I0AJG">Soylent Green</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR1">Silent Running</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDD">Alien</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UD0ESA">Blade Runner</a>, even if it is working on a smaller scale than the last few of these.  (It's worth watching more than once for its inclusion of clever references to many of these films - the script and the setting include a number of subtleties, that are likely to be missed on first viewing.)  The production team obviously made the most of a small budget, and managed to create a very realistic moon base, and very convincing machines and subtle use of special effects.  Of course, the most impressive component of the film is the performance of Sam Rockwell, who almost singlehandedly carries the entire show, and gives a delicate and nuanced performance throughout.  This is excellent independent science fiction.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Sam Bush (Sam Rockwell) is in the last two weeks of a three year contract, mining fuel that can only be found on the dark side of the Moon. He talks to his plants and has his cubicle bed surrounded by pictures of his wife and daughter. The three years of isolation is taking its toll. He's seeing things, and losing his concentration. When he gets into a lunar rover to investigate a problem with one of the land strip-mining machines, he accidentally crashes, only to wake up in the infirmary with GERTY 3000 (voiced with HAL 9300 coolness by Kevin Spacey).<br /><br />But something is wrong. Sam thinks there's someone else with him. And there is...another Sam. Has Sam lost his mind in the isolation and aftermath of the crash? Did he die and just hallucinate what is happening? Is there a conspiracy of clones? Is he really being rescued, as the messages from Earth suggest? Thus is the premise of Duncan Jones' (aka Zowie Bowie) "Moon." Rockwell plays himself and himself, trying to reconcile all that is happening to the twin hims in hopes of achieving wellness before he can go home. It's Science Fiction with very little science, only a lonely miner and his robot friend trying to figure out what is going on in their isolated outpost.<br /><br />To that end, there are obvious parallels with modern classics like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR1">Silent Running</a> (isolated man battles himself after greedy corporation screws everything up) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey.</a> Rockwell plays the everyman of Sam Bush very effectively as he unravels the mystery of his predicament. It's also nice to watch a science movie where plot-lines are not connected by an endless series of explosions or CGI aliens (in fact, the special effects are largely retro in nature, something I found refreshing). Jones provides us with an ambitious debut as a director, as well...and given that the only two pop songs he inserted into the movie were ever popular "Walking On Sunshine" and one hit wonder Chesney Hawkes' "The One and Only," says a lot about him not taking easy choices.<br /><br />After all, how simple would it have been to call up Dad and ask for "Space Oddity?"</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>The film was viewed on a 50" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player. The AQ and PQ are both crisp and clean. Unfortunately I missed the film on the festival circuit, but am glad I finally had a chance to see it. Sam Rockwell does an absolutely fantastic job playing dual "roles", and the special features which discuss the technical aspects of achieving such shots, as well as the entire look of the film, with a relatively small budget, are very interesting. If you're interested in film at all, from its technical aspects, you may like to investigate the featurettes, especially on the visual elements. Another striking element of the film is its score. Though simple and repeating, for me, it matches the isolation, repetitiveness and loneliness of Sam's character, as well as his predicament, very well. The twist in the film is not necessarily shocking but blends into the story seamlessly and further elevates the film as a modern sci-fi film with a quiet, yet powerful temperament. It's not your typical "trapped in space, with a creature" type film, and without giving anything away, it is an interesting character study, psychologically, as well as visually. The film was shot for 5 million, and for its objective of shooting a sci-fi film with interesting visual elements, I found it to be very visually appealing. Definitely check this one out, it may surprise you.</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>One Man Play in Outer Space, is what it is.

It's way cool, way intense, way intelligent, way well acted and way Spacey--Kevin that it who plays the voice of Hal...I mean, Gerty.<br /><br />Basically, it looks like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey but it's so much more than that. You actually feel like you're on the moon with some terrific scenes of the lunar surface. The light and shadow they work in is simply amazing.<br /><br />Then there's Sam Rockwell's tour de force playing the lone astronaut sent to the moon to man a "mining" operation up there. I won't spoil it for anyone but he plays his roles (yes, that's with an "s") far beyond anything you've seen in any evil twin story.<br /><br />Then there's Kevin Spacey's voice. You'll have flashbacks to 2001's Hal but in a better twist he's a helpful robotic voice.<br /><br />The extras too are exactly what you'd want in a DVD. Besides a couple of commentary tracks, we get the rundown on how they created the visual effects (mainly from models and it shows giving the picture a far grittier realism).<br /><br />There's also two Q&A sessions where you'll be confused as to whether they cloned the director Duncan Jones. In the better Q&A at NASA's Space Center in Houston we get far more the nuts and bolts of the film. In this one DJ looks like a roly poly grad student.<br />In the Sundance Festival Q&A with various members of the production crew there's someone channeling Sam Rockwell's character complete with beard and it's DJ. You'll do a double take but that laugh gives him away. That Q&A seemed so much like the usual--dumb questions from moviegoers. Did nothing for me but contrasted with the NASA Q&A it was fun to watch.<br /><br />That's not all. You also get a 28-min. film called Whistle about a contract killer who hits his marks with the help of laser technology...and it has a nice twist. Having said that, the no-lipped actress who played the killer's wife was sheer awful in her role. Could they not have cast someone better?</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Moon is definitely one of the more interesting films I've seen lately.  It's actually easy to understand from a storyline point of view, and that's not something I normally encounter with science fiction movies.  Normally while these type of movies roll along, I'm left sitting there totally confused and uncertain what's taking place on screen.  Not at all in this case.<br /><br />Let me state that I'm by no means an expert when it comes to outer space-type movies.  Most of the time I ignore them because they make little to no sense to me (because they require too much patience to absorb the finest of details).  Moon is an obvious exception.<br /><br />It's about a man who goes to the moon to gather enough resources (fusion energy) to bring back to earth.  However, he's apparently stuck on the moon for 3 years waiting for assistance to come, pick him up and take him back home to his loving wife and daughter.  A good portion of the storyline deals with his ability to accept being away from home for all those years.  It concerns the emotional side of him and tests his patience and level of frustration on numerous occasions.<br /><br />A good chunk of the storytelling deals with this robot/computer that's capable of interacting with the man extremely well.  It constantly guides the man to make the correct decisions by floating up and down the hallways of the lunar base.  This robot plays a BIG role in the storyline- it's constantly around.  The fact it's able to show emotion and especially sympathy is another fascinating element to the storyline.<br /><br />Eventually the storyline kicks in even more and the subject of cloning occurs.  Now THIS is when some obvious confusion will take place for the viewers.  Why?  Because the main character has a twin clone, and he shares the role of lead character.  The question then becomes "Which one is the man we've been seeing all along?"<br /><br />I will say this- the storyline isn't as confusing as it seems with one glaring exception- the final 10 minutes.  I'm not really sure what actually happened there.  It's not enough to encourage me to lower the rating, though.<br /><br />Overall, the acting is solid, the storytelling is compelling enough to keep your interest the entire time, and it's just an overall solid movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>The product description calls this a cerebral sci-fi film.

Whatever goes wrong with their honest attempts at making a buck and solving the Earth's biggest problems will be thrown back at them through accusations and interrogations and committees.<br />Lunar Industries does something great: they are mining the backside of the moon for the fuel that provides clean energy on Earth: Helium 3. The station is run by one man and a robot: Sam Bell and Gerty. The latter has Kevin Spacey's voice. Sam has contracted for a 3 year term, which is nearly up. 3 years, he finds, was way way way too long. Sam thinks he is the boss and Gerty is programmed to help him. Quickly we smell a problem between the two: Gerty seems to be on the way to usurp power. Complications start when Sam has an accident on an outside mission...<br />The story really works better if you do not know it in advance, so I will not tell you more here.<br />You just have to believe me when I say that this is a superior sci-fi story. I will admit, though, that non-afficionados of the genre may find the going slow. I will also admit, following some comments, that the plot has its holes. Which sci-fi story doesn't require the suspension of disbelief here and there? (Upon second thought, I withdraw one star for this reason, thanks to the shrimp.)</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>I had been curious about this movie for awhile and was glad to have the opportunity to watch it.<br /><br />The key to the movie is Sam Rockwell who is effective and convincing as Sam Bell who is the only Moon based employee of a large corporation with a mining operation on the moon. Sam's "companion" a computer named Gerty reminds one of "2001 A Space Odyssey;" there is a major point of deviation in the ending with Gerty responding very differently from the HAL computer during the climax of the story.<br /><br />The story starts as Sam is nearing completion of a three year contract and is more than ready to go home and see his wife and little girl. The suspense begins to build very nicely when it appears he's not alone on the Moon and then hints begin to be dropped as to what might be actually going on and finally suspicions are confirmed by the end of the movie.<br /><br />If you are a science fiction fan I think you will definitely enjoy it; I found it interesting and worth the time.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Initially, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2MO">Moon</a> might seem like a remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a> - it even has a HAL-like computer called Gerty - but it takes a different turn. In fact, after the first half-hour, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2MO">Moon</a> is more about lunar technician Sam Bell's mysterious origins than space exploration. The plot is surprisingly thick and takes some unexpected turns. I won't spoil it, but it's definitely pretty cool.<br /><br />I love the ambience of the movie. The sterile, white setting really does seem like a realistic portrayal of man's future in space. The eerie silence  (there's not much soundtrack) adds to the effect. Soon into the movie, you'll feel like you'r right there on the moon base.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended. This didn't seem to get much attention in theaters, but it's definitely one of the better and more original releases of 2009.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>The Dark Side Of The Moon, The Future: Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the one man overseer of an automated mining operation which excavates and refines Helium Three - an energy source which we are informed is now responsible for meeting the needs of 70% of the world's energy requirements - using four large automated 'harvesters' which roam the planet's surface sifting the sands. Living in isolation on the moon in a largely sterile habitat with only environment computer "Gerty" (voiced by Kevin Spacey) and the occasional time-delayed message from Earth for company is beginning to take its toll on Sam, but with the end of his three year contract in sight he remains chipper; until, that is, an accident on the lunar surface causes him to question his sanity, identity and real purpose on the moon...<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Duncan Jones' "Moon" because it is a return to the values of the golden age of thoughtful, philosophical science fiction films which appeared around the end of the sixties and dawn of the early seventies. Jones clearly grew up adoring the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR1">Silent Running</a> and Andrei Tarkovsky's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006L92F">Solaris - Criterion Collection</a> as much as I did, and the production design, themes and pace of his own film is quite self-consciously styled after those films - all of which which were a) actually about something other than moronic hero cliches running around with with laser guns and b) used space as a metaphor for loneliness, alienation and madness. As with these earlier films, the drama in "Moon" comes from existential torment rather than exploding aliens.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the fact that Jones eschewed CGI in favour of model miniatures shot 'mise en scene' (with a little CGI augmentation) and kept it largely old-school. Personally speaking, models have always seemed much more realistic than CGI to me when they're shot properly. To Jones credit, he also doesn't allow the effects to overtake the film (in opposition to most mainstream sci-fi movies such as "Avatar", to use a current example, most of which really do just appear to be derivative nonsense designed to showcase the latest innovations in CGI).<br /><br />Performances are good. Rockwell makes a splendidly tweaked lead and Kevin Spacey is also rather good as the disembodied "Gerty"; He doesn't quite manage to pull off the deeply sinister air of detachment elicited by Douglas Rain as the "HAL 9000" in "2001", but then I suspect that noone will ever be able to upstage Rain's portrayal of a malevolent computer - definitive portrayal of a mildly disconcerting machine intelligence that it was.<br /><br />Be sure to explore the extras on this DVD as they're fascinating - and do make sure that you watch Jones' previous short film, "Whistle", which is included as an extra and which is a superbly offbeat tale of a hi-tech hitman having a crisis of conscience.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A328547P5BGZC.html">A328547P5BGZC</a><br/><p>Tired of watching the same action, romantic comedy, horror movie over and over again!

Though I liked "Moon", it's unlikely I'll ever watch it again.<br /><br />For at least the last 20 years, I've noticed an increasing affectlessness (lack of genuine emotion) in movies. Movies increasingly seem to be made by people who only know movies, who don't have any deep connection with "life".<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is arguably the poster boy for this sort of filmmaking. It isn't simply that most of his films have been "lightweight", but rather that too many of his films seem to be more about the subject of the film, or even its genre, than the characters in the story. ("War of the Worlds" is a particularly egregious example. The Classics Illustrated comic book actually conveyed more of the story's emotion.) And he's hardly the worst filmmaker in this regard.<br /><br />Directors and writers are more and more guilty of holding the characters "at arm's length". Filmmakers no longer seem much concerned with "connecting" with the audience. It's unfortunate that we have to watch /animated/ films (such as "Up!" or "Toy Story 3") to be moved in any deep way.<br /><br />This is the basic problem with "Moon". It has a far-fetched but not-bad premise -- which is revealed about a third of the way in, rather than coming as a lame surprise at the end -- but the writer and director don't do much with it. There is little attempt to get the audience deeply involved with Sam Bell's predicament, which is an existentialist one of "Who am I? Why am I here?". Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to churn out an "in your face" story -- but they're being /paid/ to come up with something original. The result is that "Moon" doesn't ultimately engage the viewer on more than a superficial level.<br /><br />A good example of this failure occurs when GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) approaches Sam while he's trying to enter a password. Is GERTY going to help Sam, or block him -- perhaps even kill him? The director fails to build up any real ambiguity about the situation. This is particularly surprising, as Kevin Spacey was clearly chosen for this role for his ability to alternate between (apparently) sincere and unctuous/slimy.<br /><br />I might as well continue kicking this down dog by complaining about the lack of scientific accuracy. There is no radiant sound in a vacuum, and when Bell drops the coffee cup, it falls as if it were in a 1-g field, not the 1/6-g field of the Moon. (I don't know how much this would have cost to animate in CG, but I doubt it would have blown the budget.) The miniatures are, by modern standards, terrible, mostly because the people making them have no understanding of scale.<br /><br />The R rating is not for the brief shot of Sam's substantial and well-shaped gluteus maximus (which might be present for the obvious joke), but for a dozen unnecessary F bombs. There is no reason otherwise that your teenage kids shouldn't see this film.<br /><br />Your call. I would rent before buying.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>"Moon" was directed by Duncan Jones based on his original story with screenwriter Nathan Parker. It stars Sam Rockwell as astronaut Sam Bell who is near the end of a three year stint as the sole employee on a lunar base on the moon gathering a clean energy resource that helps Earth's fuel problems. With only the company of a robot GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey, Sam's loneliness has gotten to him and he begins to hallucinate.<br /><br />This movie rests almost entirely on Sam Rockwell and boils down to a one-man show. His character is isolated in this moon base and after a discovery, he begins to doubt everything he has believed to be true in his time there. He plays multiple versions of himself overtime with and without facial hair and injuries and somehow keeps it all straight.<br /><br />Rockwell's performance as Sam Bell is masterfully done in a way that few people could ever accomplish. I am in shock that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this film. It is a true test to his power of endurance, skill, nuance, subtlety, and raw emotion and he carries it through with flying colors. Bell's biggest goal is just to get back to his infant daughter and his wife whom he left back on Earth. With two weeks to go, every event seems blown up in scale to hindering his return. Their presence is always in the back of his mind and he is often reviewing time delayed tapes sent from his wife and dreams about her as extra motivation to persevere.<br /><br />This story feels like a blend of the claustrophobia and psychological mind games found in "Sphere" (especially with the added element of Kevin Spacey's voice) with the extra isolation of space like in many movies like "Apollo 13" and even "Alien".<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's GERTY has a smiley face icon on one of its panels that changes expression to try and interact with and take care of Sam Bell. It walks the fine line between being suspiciously enigmatic and occasionally sweet as Sam's company. Spacey's dry, comforting, and emotionally even tone really builds suspense as the audience tries to figure out what the robot's true agenda might be.<br /><br />Visually, the moon looks amazing, almost as if it could have been shot on location. The design of the stations and vehicles seems very realistic. This science fiction is a well-thought out puzzle that unfolds slowly over time. It has an older feel with the pacing and themes and as always, sometimes technology can get the better of us. The transitions are seamless and the story amazingly well told and engaging. Some of it is heartwarming, some is disturbing, but all the ups and downs are worth it. I really can't go into it any further without giving away major spoilers suffice to say this is one of the BEST movies of 2009 by far and I am so glad I finally got to see it. Please see it if you haven't!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Despite the fact that this was filmed in just 33 days, Moon is an excellent motion picture. As others have noted, it was at first easy to believe that Moon would be all too similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey; but I too am happy that I was wrong. Yes, there are some similarities but the plot is so different and the sci-fi/horror/thriller elements so original and inventive that Moon works on all levels. The acting is superb and the casting was very well done; the cinematography and the choreography work wonders for the film. The script was well written and the action move along at a good pace although they could have edited this down just a few minutes to make the action and the plot a bit tighter. However, this is a minor detail.<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who, at some point in the future, has been assigned to a three year solo mission on the far side of the moon to "harvest" helium-3 for cleaner energy; and he sends it all back to Earth as his bosses at Lunar want him to do. Sam has only his robot named "GERTY" for company; and yes, there are some similarities between GERTY and HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey but by the end of the picture you'll see that these are two different robots.<br /><br />With just two weeks left to go, Sam is eager to go home. Indeed, he is so lonely that he talks to his plants and watches with frustration the sporadic one way-feed, incoming only video messages he gets from his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and their young daughter Eve (Rosie Shaw) back on Earth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one day on an expedition outside the base, Sam has an accident with his vehicle and he awakens to find himself in the base's infirmary. It's not long after that Sam discovers that there is in fact someone else on the base with him after all--and who is also named Sam (Robin Chalk)! This shocking discovery creates riveting drama with thriller features and creativity that impressed me very much. Although it may seem as if I've given too much away, there's actually much, much more to the plot and I won't provide spoilers to keep it interesting for you.<br /><br />The DVD comes with some nice extras. There are two optional running commentaries; and I particularly liked the "making of" featurette. In addition, Kevin Spacey does a great job of providing the voice for GERTY.<br /><br />Moon is one of those rare, somewhat softer sci-fi thrillers that gradually pulls you in and then never lets you go until the very last moment of the picture. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy sci-fi, thrillers with drama and even mysteries. You won't be disappointed!</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>An entertaining space mystery, horrifying yet genuinely moving. Kevin Spacey is great as this film's version of HAL.<br /><br />In the future, most of the Earth's energy needs are met by one corporation mining some wonder material on the moon. The protagonist is the sole human operator needed, scheduled to be rotated out soon.<br /><br />On a trip to check out a mining location, he has an accident. This sets off a strange cascade of events, which he has to unravel to understand his situation.

It was also the story about the goodness in one's self.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>In reading the volume of negative and average reviews here and elsewhere I think everyone (that is interested in this film anyway) should give this a watch in Blu then check out the supplements, especially those parties that have some nagging questions about the unexplained elements.<br /><br />The BD is transferred eloquently, with all of the shortcomings (in my view the sets and props added the exact "atmosphere" the director was shooting for and explains in the Q&A and commentaries) captured in original production being preserved perfectly here. Yes, the surface sets and CGI used with the harvester's moondust look noticeably bad, but there are plenty of plot points and a performance strength to make up for it. The clarity in most of the film is competent, with almost a pinnacle in seeing an "invisible" prop - the shower scene his polyclear bikini is obvious. The sound is a valid DTS with some variant usage off screen (reference the scene where GERTY is talking live to command). The supplements are thorough and include:<br /><br />* Commentary by four of the staff. See below.<br />* Commentary by two of the staff (director Jones and producer Fenegen). I much preferred this one, it had a great deal more material that I enjoy about logistics and behind the scenes stuff. Plus only two guys were talking or interacting which is better than four vying for talk time on a quiet film like this.<br />* Whistle, a short film by Jones, 28 minutes. A decent little piece for being a first time project.<br />* Making of, 16:18 minutes. A lodef interview laden set with all of the main staff and cast.<br />* Creating the effects, 11:09 minutes. Gives some good insight on the robot (Gerty), the moondust, vehicles and such.<br />* Science Center Q&A, 20:48 minutes. Jones being interviewed by a group of people in March 2009. Roughly 20 questions ranging from hidden themes, subtexts, a sequel, unanswered plot points and assorted fun stuff. For those having issue with certain outcomes, or mysterious story lines - this actually answers almost all of them - Jones' demeanor was much more  relaxed here than in the Sundance footage.<br />* Sundance Q&A at Moon premiere, 11:15 minutes. Rockwell shows his grace in letting it be all about the staff here, but I felt this was his film hands down - wish he would have talked more.<br />* BD Live, nothing new, just the standard 100 points for registering your disc at Sony.<br /><br />A solid performance film for Rockwell, hope he gets some acknowledgment down the road. The BD is not stellar as the original product was not there to reference, but still a worthy watch - an owner for me not a renter. The MPAA rating is incorrect as it should be R for brief nudity, language and one sexual situation as I found playing it in the store had a couple people all fussy (I don't care about the language but I guess Rockwell's behind and him working his wife in bed caught a few eyes, whatever). Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Moon" sets the table for a sharp little black comedy in outer space, but constantly finds it necessary to toe the party line on science fiction: Even if the ideas aren't revelatory - and nothing in writer/director Duncan Jones' sophomore effort qualifies - fake it anyway.<br /><br />The result is a picture that produces faint echoes of "2001" for too long, alights on a clever conceit in act two, then fails to mine its potential in favor of the same old rant on corporate greed. Look hard, and you can see the smile in Jones' film - especially in the half-daffy lead performance of Sam Rockwell. But you have to squint through the ponderous foreground.<br /><br />Rockwell is, appropriately, Sam, an employee of Lunar Industries, which mines a new helium energy source on the dark side of the moon. He's on the tail end of a three-year contract - accompanied only by an on-ship robot (named Gerty, voiced by Kevin Spacey) - communicating by tape with his wife and mission control, as the live feed seems permanently broken.<br /><br />Sam gets in a rover accident and wakes up in the infirmary...changed. He's younger. More alert. And Gerty - along with mission control - doesn't want him to perform his usual repairs outside. Why? And why did Gerty seem to be having a live conversation with mission control when Sam wandered out of his hospital room?<br /><br />"Moon" is 90 minutes long, but remains larded with filler. Mystery in space isn't the same as menace, and since "Moon" doesn't work as horror, we're left with a lot of stock shots of the lunar station, and Sam traveling from one part of it to another. There is no payoff when Sam talks to plants he's tending, or he whittles away at a wooden model of his hometown, and Jones hasn't yet developed a visual mastery that makes these images compelling (like Steven Soderbergh did in "Solaris"), and Jones lacked the budget and scope of Kubrick's "2001." "Moon" doesn't look cheap, but its fast-forward-through-this-scene quality points to it.<br /><br />The movie's big "reveal" is no stunner to the sci-fi veteran, although it gives Rockwell some elbow room. Already accomplished at depicting duality - "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," "Heist" and "Choke" reflect some of his best work - Rockwell has some fun fleshing out Sam's...many layers. But even these scenes grow tedious - a bit like an one-act play, with gizmos - as the audience squirms for the climax, which includes a rescue ship, a clever switcheroo, and a key sacrifice.<br /><br />Though it snuck its way onto a few end-of-year Top Ten lists, "Moon" is more fashionable than powerful. Kudos to Jones for taking a road less traveled, but here's to a bigger budget and stronger story for his next foray into the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>If ever there were a debut with an elephant in the room this is it. And, here, it's an elephant which no-one seems to want to acknowledge: not the director, not the marketers, and curiously, not the critics: every review you see studiously and kindly and respectfully treats Duncan Jones as just any first-time feature film director. Yet everyone quietly wills him to do well, giving hopeful benefit of the doubt to a feature which, for about 30 minutes, looks to be a pretty mediocre sort of outing.<br /><br />And then it dawns on you that this film isn't ordinary at all, and it's casually dug into some gnarled and complex questions about isolation and alienation, through the metaphor of a lonely and seemingly deranged individual, rattling around in - well, in a tin can - irredeemably isolated, far above the world.<br /><br />And then you notice the big old elephant again, sitting quietly in the room, and you get to wondering what it might have to do with anything.<br /><br />For, to spell it out, the scenes where Sam Bell (a terrific Sam Rockwell) is forced, quite literally, to confront himself, and doesn't like what he sees, resonate very strongly with the artistic output of another fresh-faced British artist whose burst on the scene, a generation ago, exploring similar themes through the prism of similar metaphors.<br /><br />Moon doesn't owe everything to David Bowie, of course, but pretending it would have been picked up, financed, viewed or received as it has been had Duncan Jones not been christened Zowie Bowie seems fanciful. That's certainly why I made a point of seeing it. To be sure it is artfully low budget (the crappy miniatures of the moon base are hilarious), its production design is neat and cheesy (somewhere between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBOZYW">The Tomorrow People</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UWQT">Silent Running</a>) and it bears as much resemblance to Silent Running and Solaris as it does to its more obvious analogue, 2001, a Space Odyssey. And here perhaps is another in-joke: Jones, in his directors Question and Answer Session, makes much of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C24F3">Alien</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VPP84W">Blade Runner</a> as antecedents and jokes (no doubt referencing Space Oddity), that 2001 was really more an influence on his parents' generation than his own!)<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd put Moon quite in Ridley Scott's league), although robot Gerty, not altogether persuasively voiced by Kevin Spacey, is something of a cross between HAL and Huey, Dewey and Louie.<br /><br />Moon certainly gets better as it goes along: early plot improbabilities (such as why would anyone, let alone a man with a young wife and child, take up a three year janitorial role in solitary confinement on the far side of the moon?) are resolved satisfactorily, and rockwell's excellent performance builds out impressively as the narrative develops. This is certainly thinking persons' sci fi, and I'm pleased I saw it.<br /><br />Jones' next film, he says, will be the "spiritual successor to Blade Runner".<br /><br />Fighting talk.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>The info says that effects look cheap on this movie, that's not really the case it's got decent effects and the moon outside scenes actually look pretty good. The blu ray version really brings out these effects to good effect too. But Sam Rockwell puts in a incredible performance by any standard. This isn't a slam bang science fiction movie ( which are great too)  it's a intelligent thinking persons movie and It's very well done. The story is a good one and it  is not a slow movie at all. In fact this movie moved quite quickly for me. And Kevin Spacy really was able to make his character of the robot come to life. That's hard to explain but his voice acting was incredible. The robots actions made sense and even the main character comes to see that this machine is more humane than the men who placed him on the moon. I have no doubt that fully sentient machines will evolve in the future and we will by then see them as more than machine in someways.<br /> Kevin spacey and the people who designed this robot have really done things right. The director too; hopefully will keep on making more movies as he can really bring out alot of nuances in a film. This isn't a movie if you are looking for a action sci fi movie but it's story would do well on the now gone classic show 'the outer limits" (one of the few shows that both versions are highly regarded, the classic 60's one and the excellent 90's one). This show also was in my opinion easy to understand and to relate to and that helps.<br />Anyways this is a fine movie and it is a worthy addition to any sci fi fans library especially on blu ray.  This has a short film as a bonus and other features such as 'the making of' etc as well.  A good flick that is better than some a movies due to it's acting, and it shows how good a upper class b movie can be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>For much of the movie the main character is hallucinating, which isn't particularly interesting to watch, more like a waste of time.  In the end there were some interesting plot twists but not enough for me to recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>It was easy to dismiss Moon as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66J1M">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> clone based on the trailers, claustrophobic space station setting and the HAL 9000-like robot assistant (GERTY). It is a surprisingly fun space mystery and I'm glad I was wrong. The film opens with a commercial from Lunar Industries, promising a safe, dependable, and clean energy source from the moon. Then it cuts right to the lunar surface where astronaut/miner Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is preparing a cargo of helium for launch back to Earth.<br /><br />With 2 weeks left of his contract, he is more than ready to go home. Living in isolation on the dark side of the moon for the past 3 years, with the satellite dish down, his only link with Earth are company transmissions, delayed TV feeds of sporting events, and the occasional pre-recorded video relay from his wife. With not another living soul on the moon, Sam occupies himself by talking to his plants, carving a miniature model of his town, and talking to GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). Sam thinks he's going insane from the psychological stress of isolation and starts seeing things. He scalds his hand on boiling water and later causes a serious crash with his rover, knocking out one of the giant combine harvesters. This is where the real mystery begins, as Sam discovers that he is not alone. I won't spoil the surprise, but what follows is an entertaining and suspenseful experience.<br /><br />GERTY's monotone diction, calm demeanor, and design are unmistakably inspired by HAL 9000, a perhaps deliberate decision by the filmmakers to heighten the sense of mystery and play on our preconceived notions of the sci-fi genre built up by other films. He also has a camera "eye" like HAL, and we've also seen the maniacal ship's AI Otto from Wall-E. We don't know if GERTY's pleasantly warm voice and smiley face LCD display means he is genuinely helpful or if he's concealing a secret agenda. Director Duncan Jones is using our expectations against us, and this is part of the fun of unraveling the drama of Moon.<br /><br />The film draws influences from other films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBMWG4">Blade Runner</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXAE">Aliens</a>, and of course, 2001 (whose vision of the future is clean and white interiors with bright lights) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR1">Silent Running</a>. With a 90 min runtime, the film is short. Made on a tiny budget (by today's standards) of $5 million, it is carried by the remarkable performance of Rockwell whose shows many sides of the Sam character. Interiors are very convincingly designed, with some lunar surface shots and CG that are perhaps a bit too heavy on lens flare. Except one instance of backal nudity (unfortunately, it's from Rockwell and not the lovely Dominique McElligott), a scene of nasty vomiting and a fist-fight, nothing too graphic is shown. The ending could've used maybe 3-5 minutes more of exposition as it did feel a bit rushed, but don't let me dissuade you from watching this wonderful film. A totally worthwhile way to spend movie night. 4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/AHF97M45JFCB.html">AHF97M45JFCB</a><br/><p>Once in a while, and more frequently in this genre than most others it seems; a film comes along with a very modest budget (in this case $5M), a limited cast, and a whole lot of heart.  In the case of Moon, director Duncan Jones continues on in the tradition of works like Danny Boyle's Sunshine or perhaps even more appropriately, Neil Blomkamp's District 9.  However, its inclusion in the oft-suspect category of independent science fiction entertainment is by no means synonymous with cheesy rubber masks, shoddy sets, or below par CGI; in fact quite contraire.  Moon manages to accomplish a surprising deal of well-written plot structure and melds it with consistent, appropriate and believable visuals (whether special effect shots or otherwise).  Amidst the current trend of bloated CG-overloaded "blockbusters" that attempt to make up for their lack of substance with flashy visuals, Moon is a refreshing diversion to say the least.<br /><br />The tale centers on Sam Bell, the only man living on the moon in an undisclosed future date (but based on the technology, certainly the foreseeable future), who is nearing the conclusion of a three-year contract to work for Lunar Industries.<br /><br />As the lone employee stationed at their lunar facility, Sam's primary job responsibility is to harvest and periodically ship (via rocket) to Earth supplies of helium-3; the clean and apparently extremely abundant fuel source used by future society.<br /><br />In addition to the loneliness Sam experiences in complete isolation, there apparently is no direct communication link available between the lunar station and Earth.  Fortunately he does experience a good deal of daily interaction with GERTY; an artificially intelligent computer/ robot that tends to his daily needs (voiced brilliantly by Kevin Spacey).<br /><br />While the viewer is treated to a heartfelt demonstration of Sam's almost singular desire to complete his contract and return to Earth to be with his wife Tess and their infant daughter Eve, things start to get very interesting when with only two weeks to go, he gets into a rover accident at one of the mechanical harvesters and is rendered unconscious.<br /><br />To continue on with the plot summation would not only provide critical spoilers (something I despise personally and make a practice of avoiding in my critiques) but it would also jeopardize some of the most spectacular moments of the prose whereby the viewer, through the bewilderment of the lead character, discovers that all is not as it initially appears.<br /><br />What is revealed as the layers of mystery are rolled back like the skin of so many proverbial onions is actually a subliminally sad account of the cruelty of the human mind and the frailty of the human body.  And while there is undeniable hope to be found in the tale's conclusion, it comes with the bittersweet lacing of the would ifs, could ifs and what-nows that are left for the viewer to ponder once the credits roll.  This fact alone is nearly a guarantee that the film will continue popping up in your thoughts for days, maybe even weeks after viewing.  In fact I'm thoroughly convinced that this is one of those rare pieces that, like a fine wine, requires a lengthy period of digestion (processing) to fully appreciate.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell's performance of lead character Sam Bell is remarkable upon first impression and perhaps even more so upon examination of the unique capture process in the film's "making of" documentaries.<br /><br />Speaking of, the single disc DVD boasts a surprisingly robust extra-feature set including two full-length commentary tracks (one with Writer/Director Duncan Jones, Director of Photography Gary Shaw, Concept Designer Gavin Rothery and Production Designer Tony Noble and the second with Writer/Director Duncan Jones again and Producer Stuart Fenegan), "Whistle" a Short Film by Duncan Jones, The Making of Moon, Creating the Visual Effects, Science Center Q&A with Director Duncan Jones, a Filmmaker's Q&A at the Sundance Film Festival, and like a whole lot of Sony trailers.<br /><br />About the biggest complaint I've encountered surrounding the project would have to be gripes that the prose isn't action-packed, particularly comedic, or even that the pacing is a bit tedious.  While I cannot dispute all such claims, I can assure that the cleverness of the script is solid enough to command even the most restless viewer's curiosity.  Coming in at a runtime of 97-minutes, there is no fluff or unnecessary plotting to cloud the potency of the tale.<br /><br />In all it is very easy to recommend this piece of independent science fiction as it represents the culmination of all that is wrong with big budget filmmaking these days by contrast.  The fact that Sony Classics was wise enough to recognize this reality is hopeful of things to come in and of itself.  Duncan Jones deserves credit on having written and directed a wonderfully entertaining motion picture that will, hopefully be only the first of many such future developments.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>"Moon" stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, an employee of a moon-based energy company called Lunar.  Sam lives in an isolated base that controls three massive "harvesters," which travel across the surface of the moon to collect rocks containing Helium-3.  His only companion is a large robot named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) who looks like a copy machine suspended from the ceiling.  Gerty also has a screen that displays emoticons to express his feelings.  With his three-year contract nearly up, Sam is preparing to return to earth and the loving arms of his wife and new-born daughter, both of whom we see in video calls.  However, Sam has an accident while trying to attend to one of the harvesters, and he wakes up confused in the infirmary.  Gerty tells him that he was unconscious for only a short time; however, Gerty is acting rather oddly (his emoticon's eyes do that darting back forth thing that cartoon characters do when they lie).  Is he lying?<br /><br />First time director Duncan Jones (AKA Zowie Bowie - the son of David Bowie) helmed this indie sci-fi flick with a meager $5 million dollar budget, or roughly the amount "Avatar" spent on bagels for the craft services table.  Nevertheless, the film's look and effects are quite believable.  Scenes on the moon were filmed with models overlayed with CGI, which gives them a fairly realistic look.  Written by Jones with Nathan Parker, The plot has some predictable elements (a meddling evil company, a lying robot).  However, the story manages to hold some surprises and intelligently explores Rockwell's predicament.  To borrow a line from his father's first hit single, Jones "really made the grade" with his debut.<br /><br />Jones wrote the movie for Sam Rockwell.  I'm not a fan of Rockwell's work but he definitely brings something different to the role as a twitchy astronaut who (to borrow from another song) finds that "it's lonely out in space."  [Actually, now that I think about it, Elton John's "Rocket Man" is much better description of "Moon" than is "Space Oddity."]  One of my favorite parts of sci-fi films is the robots, and I loved Gerty and his emoticon face.  Spacey's vocals strike the perfect balance between a human-sounding robot and still sounding vaguely ominous (apparently his vocals were altered slightly).  Another major strength is the haunting score by Clint Mansell, which manages to highlight and elevate key scenes without being the least bit intrusive.  I enjoyed "Moon" and was happy to read that Jones is planning a follow-up of sorts called "Mute," which will explore another story set in this timeline.<br /><br />The DVD is packed with extras including two commentaries with the director (one with the writer/producer and another with members of the technical crew) and several behind the scenes making of flicks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>Moon is probably the best "true" science fiction movie to come into theaters in many years. What do I mean by true? Well the science fiction genre has many facets to it. You have the space opera (Star Wars, Fifth Element, etc), the stellar exploration (2001, Destination Moon, etc), the monster movie (Cloverfield, Alien, etc), cyber punk (The Matrix, Ghost in the Shell), and a few other categories that all make up the sci-fi genre. What many fans call a true science fiction is one where the story moves beyond the confines of a futuristic setting or technology. When a science fiction concept is placed in a situation that really gets you thinking is that these fans are hungry for, and Moon is the perfect meal for what they crave.<br /><br />Moon is not an action film so don't expect Bruckheimer-esque explosions or flashing guns. Moon is a drama at the highest sense of the word. The unfolding story is dramatic. Dramatic in a what they can really mess with your head if you really stop and think about it. Moon is about a single man working in a mining facility on (of course) the moon. Just when he is about to finish his three year assignment everything he knew falls horribly out of control. There is of course a plot twist that brings this about, but the masterful way director Duncan Jones presents it makes the twist itself less surprising than the implications that it represents. We are talking a major screwing around with your thoughts and emotions. I don't want to ruin it for you and I really recommend you NOT to try and find out before you see the movie. It really will spoil the effect for you.<br /><br />Speaking of effect the movie has a top notch production on both sets and special effects. Moon's budget is reported to be a minuscule $5 million, however the movie looks like it was made with ten times that amount. The sets are very convincing and make you believe there can actually be a moon facility. The style is very much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 or the first two Alien movies. Absolutely no computer generated special effects are in this film. The sets are really built. The moon and the buildings/vehicles on it are actual models. So much is done with practical techniques and the results are more impressive than many CG-heavy films made today. In other words eye candy.<br /><br />There is essentially one actor in the movie and that's Sam Rockwell. Playing the character that has, oh lets say 99.9% of the screen time, Sam has to really carry the movie all on his own. This he does with gusto. Rockwell makes this movie just as much as the impressive sets and excellent script. You also get Kevin Spacey's voice as the station's computer, GERTY. You can think 2001's HAL with a bit more personality and charm.<br /><br />This movie has such a wonderful combination of style and substance. Add to that the fact it's an independent film made with a budget that wouldn't even pay for an A-list actor. If this underdog story can get any more endearing I have no idea how. Moon made it's money in worldwide box office sales and never was shown in much more than 250 theaters. So odds are you may have missed this film's theatrical release altogether. Now you have a perfect opportunity to see this amazing film for yourself. Here are the extras on the Blu-Ray:<br /><br />- 1080p 2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen<br /><br />- English, Italian and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />- English, Italian, Spanish and Hindu subtitles<br /><br />- Two commentaries with Director Duncan Jones on other production staff members<br /><br />- "Whistle" a short sci-fi film made by Duncan Jones back in 2000. It's a rather cool concept about a high tech assassin, but the story is also a bit disturbing as well as predictable. Masterfully executed by the way.<br /><br />- Documentary "The Making of Moon" has a good deal of interviews with Duncan Jones on how the movie came to be and what his influences were. From this feature and the Q&A's it seems the biggest influences are Silent Running, Outland and Alien (in pretty much that order). Serious sci-fi fans should be able to pick out those influences easy enough from the film.<br /><br />- Documentary "Creating the Visual Effects" delves into not only the digital and CG effects, but also the practical effects like models and forced perspective. I was surprised to see what was computer generated.<br /><br />- Featurette "How Did They Do That: Cloning Sam" touches on how they got the two Sam's together on film interacting with each other. Some of it is the technical aspect, but the fun stuff is hearing about how Sam Rockwell dealt with acting against 'himself' when he won't see it until post production.<br /><br />- Science Center Q&A with Director Duncan Jones is a little speed with questions answered before an audience within the scientific community. Not really any science questions came out, but still very interesting.<br /><br />- Filmmaker's Q&A at the Sundance Film Festival is a pre and post speech from Moon's Sundance appearance along with question and answers after. A little better than the previous Q&A.<br /><br />- Concept Art Library<br /><br />If you are a science fiction fan, a true science fiction fan, then you absolutely must see this movie. Trust me. It's right up there with Blade Runner, 2001, Gattaca and other great sci-fi dramas. If you like dramas I think you should check this movie out too, and don't be afraid of the fact it's in outer space. The story that you get from this "space" movie will be far greater than you reluctance to trust in a good sci-fi drama. For the rest of you if you love a good story that will make you think and don't mind it not being your standard popcorn movie I say give it a shot. You won't be sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>The premise is intriguing, but honestly, if you don't figure out what is going on less than half-way through the film, then you don't watch alot of movies... It is exactly what you thought it would be-the surprise is very minimal. That said, I still enjoyed watching this film, if only for Sam Rockwell who does a wonderful job as pretty much the only actor on screen. He is very believable and fun to watch. The only other 'character' is 'GERTY'-the main computer, voiced perfectly by Kevin Spacey. Usually, when dealing with an artificial inteligence in a film such as this, you are immediately suspicious and are left wondering what will happen. GERTY remained the only true mystery in this film for me.<br /><br />This isn't a bad film, just not as original as people hyped it out to be. It is extremely predictable, which is unfortunate because once you have it figured out, the rest of the film is not as mysterious for you. At least that was the case with me. Still, I have seen alot worse in regards to this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y0HX12MCT6OR.html">A1Y0HX12MCT6OR</a><br/><p>I was really looking forward to this one, being lauded as a critically acclaimed sci-fi film, boy were they wrong.<br /><br />Before you call this a sci-fi consider this: what if the guy was on an island instead, and was harvesting coconuts or whatever, then he dies and a clone replaces him, etc, the script would play out as the exact same thing because this is a bad drama movie with cloning thrown in for good measure. Just because a movie has clones doesn't make it a sci-fi, this movie is as much of sci-fi film as Attack of the Clones. Clones are like zombies, any idiot can write a hackneyed "BIG GOVERNMENT IS EVIL" clone story, just look at George Lucas. Moon's script SUCKS.<br /><br />I was watching the first half expecting some awesome mind-blowing complex third act that had something to do with the actual Moon, but nope, clones is all you get. "Ok" you might say, "it's not an M. Night Shymalamadingdong movie so it's not about the twist, it's about the journey", welp they failed in that regard too. The director (and I don't care who his father is, that's no excuse) is awful at mainting interest, he hasn't the first clue about the genre he's trying to ape, and Sam Rockwell alone is the only reason this turd has floated to the surface.<br /><br />I came out learning nothing new about the moon, I did not find any different perspectives on science or humanity to ponder as brain candy, and getting another hackneyed lazy "CORPORATIONS BAD!" story was the appropriately bland/unoriginal ending to a bland/unoriginal film. I was waiting anxiously for a bland predictable plot to unravel into something marvelous, but instead it actually got worse and worse until the mercifully rushed ending.<br /><br />Gerty also had almost no point, they easily could've developed his angle, but I think the real reason his character exists is so they can slap Kevin Spacey's name on this for marketing and sales purposes. Also how many scenes of the two clones getting in wacky scuffles did we have to see? It's frankly embarrasing that people consider a film where the director has to spoon feed the audience the plot as a 'sci-fi' film.<br />I've also noticed that all of my friends who say that Moon is good tend to not like sci-fi films in general, so that seems to be the jist of this movie, a sci-fi movie for people that don't like sci-fi; much like Star Wars it's just an excuse to change the location to outer space while still giving the audience a dumb predictable story.<br /><br />You're better off watching Sunshine.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>"Moon" just entered that long list of movies, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00498VS1E">Alien</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BO0LH2">The Island</a>, in which the Evil Corporation treats human material as a consumable. You won't find bam-pow action in this movie. Instead, this thoughtful movie sneaks up on you and opens its secrets to you one by one.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the movies revelations, since plot drives this movie rather than action or effects. Each new discovery unfolds more of the plot, down to a few lines captured from radio broadcasts at the very end.<br /><br />Although somewhat claustrophobic, "Moon" carries itself beautifully. It echoes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NWPY20">Solaris</a> in some ways, but replaces a mysterious external force with an all-too-understandable human one. I recommend this highly.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>This film is more of a psychodrama than most sci-fi, and though it does have elements of 2001, SOLARIS, and OUTLAND, it isn't a clone of any of them. Sam Rockwell delivers a superb performance as an astronaut in the 'near' future, that may, or may not be going nuts, and may, or may not be alone during the last few weeks of a 3-year hitch, harvesting helium on the darkside of the moon. There are no big shoot-em-ups, no CGI-heavy effects, and the action is more internal than external. It may not be quite a classic of the genre, but it is definitely worth seeing a few times.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>This is Sam Rockwell's film, make no mistake of it.  There is rarely ever anyone else on-screen, and his role is complicated enough that he has to run the gamut of emotions in a very short frame of time.  I can think of very few actors who can pull off this performance, and Rockwell is at the top of that list.  Duncan Jones's directing is superb, and Nathan Parker's screenplay is almost flawless, but without Rockwell, this film would merely be a well-thought, intellectual mess.<br /><br />Rockwell plays Sam bell, an astronaut approaching the end of his three-year solo term on the moon.  The time's been getting to him, however; he's been all alone except for the company of a robotic construction (voiced by Kevin Spacey, and his voice is so perfect for the role, one wonders how he hasn't done this before).  Sam begins seeing things...and then he's involved in an accident, and when he comes to, things just aren't the same.  To say more would be to ruin the experience.  And yet, here's the great thing about MOON: it's not one of those twist-based sci-fi films.  There is a twist, but it comes relatively early in the film, and the rest of the movie builds upon it, layering characterization on top of plot.  This is a character study, a thoughtful science fiction film in the vein of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (which is a far superior film, of course; but if you hated that movie, you probably won't like MOON, either).  This isn't a movie for action buffs, or alien-based sci-fi films; MOON is for people who like their science fiction with some depth and emotional resonance.  And if you're just a fan of acting--check out Rockwell.  His performance is worth the price of admission alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This film was a nice little surprise.  I missed it entirely when it hit the theater and only rented it because I saw a review on the web.  Shot for only 5 million, this is a nice science fiction thriller.  For the Transformers crowd, there are no big explosions or lasers.  This is a character driven story with the only face you really see is Sam Rockwell.  A few faces appear on monitors, and you get the voice of Kevin Spacey(very HAL).  It is hard to describe the movie without giving anything away.  Earth has exhausted its resources, but on the moon they can mine Helium-3 which is a great energy source.  Sam is alone on the moon for the last 3 years overseeing the automated mining operation.  He is two weeks away from going back home.  But then things start to go wrong and questions arise.  Really a good performance by Sam, especially considering he had no one else to play off of.  There were a couple of little plot holes that I noticed, but it takes away very little from a wonderful story.  Anyone interested in a character driven story with a sci-fi touch, then this a great movie to pick up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>"Moon", the 2009 sci-fi independent film written and directed by Duncan Jones is a multi-award winning film which was shot for $5 million.  Featuring a screenplay adaptation by Nathan Parker, composer Clint Mansell ("Blood: The Last Vampire", "Doom", "Sahara") and cinematography by Gary Shaw ("Space Chase").<br /><br />The film received positive reviews from critics and had a limited release in a few theaters worldwide but the film made over $7 million worldwide and now the film receives its Blu-ray and DVD release stateside on Jan. 12, 2010.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Moon" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and with a budget of only $5 million for a sci-fi indie film (compared to "Sunrise", another indie sci-film made for $50 million), you can only wonder how the crew was going to pull this one off and sure enough, they managed quite well.<br /><br />Picture quality is quite solid as you can see the rocks and craters in the lunar surface with a very good amount of detail.  The CG work is quite impressive and skin tones are natural with one of the Sam's looking really sick and pale, while blacks are nice and deep.  You can see the skin pores and bruises of Sam Bell, blood stains on the skin to the stains and post-it note residue that can be seen on the surface of GERTY.  A good amount of detail inside the lunar base and outside in the lunar surface.<br /><br />There is a fine layer of grain and for the most part, the filmmakers managed to make things work with the budget that they had.  I was very impressed with the lunar sequences and the CG work.<br /><br />As for the lossless audio, audio is presented in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1. Dialogue from Sam and GERTY are clear and understandable.  The soundtrack is very well done as you can hear the rovers and the harvesters on the lunar surface.  Each boom goes quite nicely via LFE and scenes that include surround and rear surround usage.<br /><br />The film really has a good amount of kick through the bass featured in the special effects and one can expect their subwoofer(s) to be put into use with this film.  Music by Clint Mansell is well done and definitely sets the mood for the scenes in the movie.  But for the most part, I was very amazed by the lossless soundtrack for this independent sci-fi film.  Well done!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Moon" comes with the following special features in standard definition, English stereo and Spanish & Portuguese subtitles:<br /><br />  * Commentary with Writer/Director Duncan Jones, Director of Photography Gary Shaw, Concept Designer Gavin Rothery and Production Designer Tony Noble - An upbeat commentary that is more about the technical side of the film and the guys joking around about certain scenes.  A more in-depth talk about the scenes of the film, the props used and how certain scenes were shot.<br />  * Commentary with Writer/Director Duncan Jones and Producer Stuart Fenegan - A commentary that discusses the making of the film, how they would work with Sam Rockwell, the production side of the film and more.<br />  * "Whistle" a Short Film by Duncan Jones - (28:46) A short film by director Duncan Jones about an assassin that uses satellites to target his victims in London but then the assassin starts to feel remorse and ends up being the target.<br />  * The Making of Moon - (16:18) The making of "Moon" featuring director Duncan Jones, actor Sam Rockwell, other cast and crew discussing their experiences of making the film and behind-the-scenes footage.<br />  * Creating the Visual Effects - (11:08) Featuring the visual effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp of Cinesite talking about the visual effects of the film.  From the creation of motion control,<br />  * Science Center Q&A with Director Duncan Jones - (20:40) A screening was given at the Science Center at NASA's Space Center Houston and the following Q&A is featured.<br />  * Filmmaker's Q&A at the Sundance Film Festival - (11:15) The intro by director Duncan Jones before the film screening and the Q&A session after the screening of "Moon" at the Sundance Film Festival.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:06) The original theatrical trailer for "Moon".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I have to admit that when I first saw the trailer, I thought that "Moon" would be a hybrid "2001: A Spacey Odyssey" and "Solaris" style of film and that it would lack originality.<br /><br />But after watching this film, I was quite impressed by the storyline and also how awesome this low budget independent sci-film looked.  This film really rivals a lot of the big budget sci-fi films through a wonderful performance by Sam Rockwell.  The fact that he has to act with himself and making sure the two are similar people but different in circumstances because one has been in space for three years alone, while the other has been there for only a week is pretty interesting.  Again Rockwell is amazing in this film.  Kevin Spacey's voice as GERTY definitely gave the film an eerie feeling and for the most part, it's the visual surrounding of the film and how the visual effects really played apart in creating that lonely lunar atmosphere was well-done.<br /><br />In fact, there are so many times throughout the film that I thought we were going to get the Solaris craziness, or crazy robot ala "2001: A Space Odyssey" or humans just losing it in space ala "Sunshine" and "Armageddon".  But Duncan Jones who was influenced by sci-fi films from the 70's and 80's really did a solid job of creating a film that may have borrowed some themes (or pay homage) from those classic sci-films but managed to make "Moon" his own sci-fi film.<br /><br />The whole concept of Helium-3 and harvesting it for energy for Earth was quite intriguing but also to learn that even in space, corporate greed is still in full-effect and the concept of long distance relationship (from Earth to the moon) was well-written.  And a few other important things that are part of the film that I don't want to spoil for anyone but Duncan Jones did a really good job in bringing his story to the big screen.<br /><br />And even with the $5 million dollar budget, I suppose I was not expecting too much from the film and thought everything would be shot outdoors.  But set design was pretty solid and the CG work, absolutely awesome looking and it all looks vibrant and detailed on Blu-ray.  And it was great to know there were a good number of special features including two major Q&A's included on this release.<br /><br />Overall, "Moon" was more than I expected and that is a great thing.  The film featured a solid performance by both Rockwell and Spacey, a solid screenplay and the right people to make this film look very awesome!<br /><br />An awesome independent sci-fi film and psychological thriller worth watching and even worth owning!  Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>Moon is probably the best "true" science fiction movie to come into theaters in many years. What do I mean by true? Well the science fiction genre has many facets to it. You have the space opera (Star Wars, Fifth Element, etc), the stellar exploration (2001, Destination Moon, etc), the monster movie (Cloverfield, Alien, etc), cyber punk (The Matrix, Ghost in the Shell), and a few other categories that all make up the sci-fi genre. While all are considered sci-fi what many fans call a true science fiction is one where the story moves beyond the confines of a futuristic setting or technology. When a science fiction concept is placed in a situation that really gets you thinking is that these fans are hungry for, and Moon is the perfect meal for what they crave.<br /><br />Moon is not an action film so don't expect Bruckheimer-esque explosions or flashing guns. Moon is a drama at the highest sense of the word. The unfolding story is dramatic. Dramatic in a what they can really mess with your head if you really stop and think about it. Moon is about a single man working in a mining facility on (of course) the moon. Just when he is about to finish his three year assignment everything he knew falls horribly out of control. There is of course a plot twist that brings this about, but the masterful way director Duncan Jones presents it makes the twist itself less surprising than the implications that it represents. We are talking a major screwing around with your thoughts and emotions. I don't want to ruin it for you and I really recommend you NOT to try and find out before you see the movie. It really will spoil the effect for you.<br /><br />Speaking of effect the movie has a top notch production on both sets and special effects. Moon's budget is reported to be a minuscule $5 million, however the movie looks like it was made with ten times that amount. The sets are very convincing and make you believe there can actually be a moon facility. The style is very much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 or the first two Alien movies. Absolutely no computer generated special effects are in this film. The sets are really built. The moon and the buildings/vehicles on it are actual models. Everything is done with practical techniques and the results are more impressive than many CG-heavy films made today. In other words eye candy.<br /><br />There is essentially one actor in the movie and that's Sam Rockwell. Playing the character that has, oh lets say 99.9% of the screen time, Sam has to really carry the movie all on his own. This he does with gusto. Rockwell makes this movie just as much as the impressive sets and excellent script. You also get Kevin Spacey's voice as the station's computer, GERTY. You can think 2001's HAL with a bit more personality and charm.<br /><br />This movie has such a wonderful combination of style and substance. Add to that the fact it's an independent film made with a budget that wouldn't even pay for an A-list actor. If this underdog story can get any more endearing I have no idea how. Moon has made its money in worldwide box office sales and never was shown in much more than 250 theaters. What's even cooler is as of this writing Moon is still being shown in a few theaters. Better still in the month of October it's been increasing both it's theater count and box office draw. Amazing for a movie that was released in June.<br /><br />Despite Moon's longevity in the box office odds are you may have missed this film's theatrical release altogether considering how low the theater count has been. Now you have a perfect opportunity to see this amazing film for yourself. The DVD release I know more about is the U.K. release, which comes about a month before the U.S. release. Here's what I found what is coming on the U.K. DVD:<br /><br />- 2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen<br />- English Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- English and Hindu subtitles<br />- Two commentaries with Director Duncan Jones on other production staff members<br />- "Whistle" a short sci-fi film made by Duncan Jones back in 2000.<br />- Documentary "The Making of Moon"<br />- Documentary "Creating the Visual Effects"<br />- Science Center Q&A with Director Duncan Jones<br />- Filmmaker's Q&A at the Sundance Film Festival<br /><br />There is also a Blu-Ray release that has a couple extra features and more audio/subtitle options. As for if the U.S. release being the same as the British release I see no reason why it wouldn't considering how incredibly easier it would be to port that release (aside from changing the region code) than to produce a completely different compilation. Keep an eye out for announcements around the holidays, folks.<br /><br />If you are a science fiction fan, a true science fiction fan, then you absolutely must see this movie. Trust me. It's right up there with Blade Runner, 2001, Gattaca and other great sci-fi dramas. If you like dramas I think you should check this movie out too, and don't be afraid of the fact it's in outer space.

You won't be sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>Duncan Jones, director and co-writer of Moon, has a lot to live up to. His father is legendary glam rocker and consummate performer David Bowie. While not exactly following in the footsteps of his old man, when you're the heir of such talent and originality a lot is expected of you. Add to that the weight of making a movie that nearly completely surrounds one actor, and the chips don't exactly seem stacked in your favor. Duncan Jones, though, handles the pressure admirable and creates a modern sci-fi masterpiece.<br /><br />Astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) has been on the moon for nearly three years harvesting Helium 3 to send back to Earth to help solve the energy crisis, alone except for the moon base's computer GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey), and unable to make live transmissions to earth due to a faulty satellite. Nearing the end of his service, and preparing to return home, Sam gets into an accident with a Moon Rover when he goes out to fix a harvester. After being treated, Sam goes to check on possible meteor damage, but things start to go awry when Sam finds a crashed Moon Rover with a barely living Sam in it.<br /><br /> As I've stated before, in my opinion science fiction is at it's best when it's trying to relate to the world around us. Duncan Jones, and first time screenwriter Nathan Park, create a believable future in which an energy crisis on earth dictates the need for another energy source off planet. In so doing, the premise leads to an indictment of the corporate world's lack of sanctity in human life. The screenplay is masterfully written, creating real characters that you feel for, in a very real world.<br /><br />Among what really makes this film pop is the visual style and the special effects. Duncan realized the Moon base in a visual style reminiscent of the Nostromo in Alien, giving us something to latch on to in science fiction. Also adding to the realism, just like in Alien, is that fact that we're not seeing an amazingly clean, bright future, but a real, and somewhat gritty future. For a film made on the cheap during the writers strike over a period of only 33 days, the special effects look more real than most of big blockbusters that have come out this past summer. One of the reasons for this is because rather than use CGI to render the outside scenes and special effect, Jones chose to use miniatures and visual effects lending more realism to scenes that could have possibly looked cartoonish and taken away from the gritty dramatic feel of the rest of the film.<br /><br />What really shines through in this film though is the acting. Sam Rockwell is a real tour de force playing two sides of the same coin. Playing the Sam who has been on the Moon he plays a calmer more plaintive version of Sam, and in playing the new Sam to arrive on the Moon base Rockwell plays him as an arrogant hothead. Never at any point do we get the feeling that these two characters are talking to air, or that they aren't in the same room, Rockwell's interactions with himself always feel genuine and believable, which is hard to attain, especially when practically the whole movie requires him to act against an actor who isn't there.<br /><br />This is one of the rare films I don't have anything bad to say about. I highly recommend this film if you like science fiction, but unlike most sci-fi that comes out nowadays, this isn't an action packed extravaganza. This is a great character study with subtext that you can grab hold of. But even more than that, it's a very entertaining ride!<br /><br />5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>The one and only drawback of a truly great movie, like debut director Duncan Jones' Moon, is that it is a film which unravels in a way that makes it difficult to talk about without giving away significant plot points that are better left unsaid for any viewer.  In fact, I'll say now that while I certainly do not plan to give away key details, I still caution potential readers here that the film is likely more effective if you know absolutely nothing about it at all going in.  Duncan Jones is an English filmmaker who is young enough that we can expect many more intelligent and engaging films from him in the near future.  He is also the son of musician David Bowie, of who I am a huge fan.<br /><br />Moon is a film that stars a nearly solitary Sam Rockwell in what is actually more than just another great performance in a nearly immaculate acting career; this is Rockwell's best work and it would be a shame if he was not nominated for the Oscar for best actor.  Rockwell's character is the everyman Sam Bell and he is accompanied throughout the movie by his kindly robot friend voiced by Kevin Spacey.  There was a time when Spacey was the best actor in the business so it's nice to see him at least voice a character in an inspired film like this.  Anyway, all these elements I knew going in and I thought I was going to watch something like 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, based on the great Tevis novel and starring Moon's director's daddy, the one and only thin white duke, as the earthbound alien of course.  For those who have seen Moon, you now know how little I knew going into it.<br /><br />The moon has helium-3, something rare on Earth, and likely quite useful in terms of fuel alternatives.  So Sam Bell, a married man and father, was contracted by a company called Lunar Industries to oversee a very ambitious project to extract this clean fuel alternative from the dark side of the moon.  His contract of three years will end in just two weeks and he will be free to go home and see his wife Tess and his now toddler age daughter Eve.  During his time on the mostly automated lunar base, Sam has only had two forms of communication; one with GERTY, a robot assistant (Spacey), and the other is just regular recorded transmissions from his family and the company he works for.  The satellite that allows live communications to and from Earth has been down indefinitely and Lunar Industries has little interest in making it a priority to fix.  So Sam Bell has been alone for a very long time.  That is only about 10% of the story but I'll stop there.<br /><br />Moon is timeless, even visually the sets are reminiscent of older films, but it is also incredibly authentic and modern. Moon really is a film about humanity in a primal sense that just escapes words, but it is wrapped-up brilliantly in a very sound and believable science fiction setting.  In addition, the cinematography and soundtrack serve to make the whole picture more seamless and cohesive and are among the best efforts within their respective film-making trades of 2009 as well.  However, it is the screenplay that might deserve the most praise of all.  The dialogue is witty and speaks surprisingly to either the thoughtful or angry anarchist, or even just your everyday thinking independent.  These ideas are of course in stark contrast to the elements of this mystical "Lunar Industries" authoritarian entity, as they are in nature, which is once again a timeless theme in both general story-telling from Orwell to Alan Moore, and in both past and contemporary paranoia toward corporatism and big active governments.  This is a smart movie but it is also incredibly engaging even in a more superficial understanding.<br /><br />There were a lot of great movies in 2009 and it's been a while that I can say so early on that I've seen most of them.  District 9 was a great movie for many different reasons and perhaps I'll get into that in another review.  I also loved Star Trek and Drag Me to Hell, but it's this little $5 million dollar space movie that gripped me most of all.  It is a perfect movie and I cannot recommend it enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Moon (2009)<br />Drama, Mystery, Science Fiction, 97 minutes<br />Directed by Duncan Jones<br />Starring Sam Rockwell and the voice of Kevin Spacey<br /><br />Do you remember a time when science fiction movies relied on a strong story rather than showy special effects? That's what Moon achieves. Most of the acting is performed by Sam Rockwell, although he interacts with the voice of Kevin Spacey and a couple of other actors.<br /><br />The setting is the far side of the moon and Sam Bell (Rockwell) is mining for Helium 3, which supplies 70 percent of Earth's energy needs. His only companion is GERTY (Spacey), who resembles the HAL 9000 computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Sam spends his free time working out and carving a model village. He is two weeks away from the end of his 3-year contract and is excited about returning to Earth and seeing his wife and daughter.<br /><br />One day, while Sam is performing routine maintenance on one of the mining harvesters, he crashes. If you were the only human being within 300,000 miles, that could be quite a problem. But, somehow, Sam wakes up in the infirmary with GERTY explaining that he has suffered an accident. How did GERTY rescue him? Did someone from Earth recover Sam, or was the event dreamed or imagined? Is Sam starting to hallucinate or go crazy after three years of isolation?<br /><br />There are many subtle audio and visual clues to what is really happening, but you might miss most of them on first viewing. When you know the film's secrets, little details take on additional meaning. Note also how Jones uses what we know about 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the kind of character Spacey usually portrays, to bring us to certain conclusions about GERTY.<br /><br />We spend the first 28 minutes of the film seeing how Sam lives. At that point, something happens which changes the feel of the entire film. Events start to become much clearer. I'm reluctant to spoil the reveal for anyone who hasn't seen the film, so I'm not going to discuss the plot any further.<br /><br />Rockwell delivers a wonderful performance as the multifaceted Sam. His isolation reminds me of Cast Away, 127 Hours and I Am Legend. The film examines the psychological effects of being alone and the difficulty in dealing with the outside world when that isolation finally ends. There are also deeper themes such as morality and our fundamental freedom.<br /><br />When I look at the 2010 Oscar nominees, I have to wonder how District 9 was nominated ahead of Moon. It's also surprising that Rockwell missed out on a Best Actor nomination.<br /><br />The budget was just $5 million, and the film looks incredible when you consider how little was spent. At no time did I think anything looked unconvincing or that I wasn't on the Moon. Clint Mansell's score was also noteworthy and set the mood perfectly. Moon is told in such a subtle way, but the tension slowly builds and creeps up on you. It's a very intelligent piece of writing by Director Duncan Jones.<br /><br />If you enjoy classic science fiction and good acting, Moon is worth checking out.<br /><br />If you like Moon:<br /><br />Duncan Jones was given a $32 million budget for his next film, Source Code. It's a science fiction thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Vera Farmiga and Michelle Monaghan. It shares some of the themes present in Moon, such as freedom, morality, and key female characters appearing on a screen. Both films will make you think and the scripts are always intelligent. If Duncan Jones continues to progress at this rate, he could become the next Christopher Nolan. It's so refreshing to watch good science fiction that doesn't rely solely on special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/ARYSE5JQ3AG7L.html">ARYSE5JQ3AG7L</a><br/><p>If you like sci-fi, you have something new to watch.<br />Is it original?

This is a very good independent film in the genre of space science fiction/drama with the well crafted elements of mystery and thriller. Of course, the film immediately brings to mind such classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solaris (1972) as well as Silent Running (1972), Alien (1979) and Outland (1981), all of which Jones names as the memorable films from his youth.  I say this not to criticize Moon. On the contrary, I believe it is an achievement of the young director/ writer that he made a film on the themes and subjects that have been explored many times by famous and prominent directors, and as result,  he made a clever, exciting, touching,  and original film. Moon  does not fascinate with the spectacular and flashy special computer generated effects, masterfully set fights or breathtaking chases. With 97 minutes of running time, Moon is basically one man show which belongs to charismatic and talented Sam Rockwell. Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut, working under the contract with the International Lunar Corporation, the company that found the way to efficient production of helium-3 on the Moon. The resulting helium is then shipped to Earth to be used as a source of cheap and much needed energy. Sam's contract  lasts 3 years, and when we meet him on the space station he has only two weeks left until his returning home to his wife he desperately longs for and the little daughter, whom he had never seen because she was born after he left for Moon. The only creature he communicates with all this time, is highly organized AI - computer Gertie, for whom Kevin Spacey lends his voice. Like the best films in the genre of sci-fi, the Moon is about a human in extreme conditions, physical, mental and moral. It is about the indifferent silence of space, the nostalgia for home,  for love, for Earth. It is also a thriller that makes an interesting twist in the plot. Most importantly, Sam is such an interesting and compelling character that we truly experience everything that he goes through and the choices he makes. To say more would be to spoil the movie. I only add that IMO, Kevin Spacey played one of his best and most human roles for long time.<br /><br />Jones is planning a follow-up film, titled Mute, which will serve as an epilogue to Moon and I would like to watch it because the ending of Moon was a little rushed, and I have few questions that were not answered in the first film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Last month I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QW7AJY">Pandorum</a> about a couple of guys seemingly stranded in deep space that find themselves in a very confusing situation. And I suggested that Pandorum was reminiscent of the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5U5EE">Twilight Zone</a> series. While Moon's story is completely different and unique, I would venture to say that I was again reminded of The Twilight Zone, and it is about a guy in space--on the Moon to be exact--that finds himself in a very confusing situation.<br /><br />Moon is a one man show...well, that's not exactly correct, but you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean. Sam Bell played by Sam Rockwell has a three year mission on the moon to oversee a mega corporation's mining operation that runs mostly on autopilot. While the autopilot of the mining operation keeps production flowing, and the base where Sam is housed has a mainframe with the AI of...well...of Kevin Spacey, Sam is needed to perform tasks that only a human could complete. But what if something unexpected happened to Sam?<br /><br />When I first heard about this movie I wrote it off as one of those films that was sure to be a psychological drama about a guy that go nuts from an extended solitary mission in space. Okay, Moon may ultimately have a tad bit of that, but by far Moon is a movie with much much more. Rockwell's acting is great. The movie never gets boring and is in fact quite suspenseful at times. Simply put: Moon is a great movie.<br /><br />And where was Sam Rockwell's nomination for Best Actor? I mean the guy completely carries Moon with a little voiceover help from Kevin Spacey.<br /><br />If you believe there's nothing up my sleeve, you've got to see Moon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Moon is a smart science fiction film with impeccable special effects (and on a limited budget too), an Oscar-worthy performance by Sam Rockwell in the lead, and a screenplay that constantly goes in different directions than you think it well; whether you're a SciFi junkie or merely someone who appreciates good cinema, check out this film.<br /><br />3.5/4</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>At last, a return to that 70's vibe when sci-fi meant thought provoking, and not whizz bang gee whizz displays of special effects.  Here, the illusion of a future world is perfectly maintained, but effects are very low key, and the emphasis is in drawing you into the tale, and even more into the character's head.<br />Sam Rockwell gives an amazing (set of) performances here, as the man on the last few weeks of his 3 week stint alone on the moon with only Gerty the robot (voiced by Kevin Spacey) for comfort.  When he has an accident, his reality starts to get challenged and he questions who he is and how much of what he knows is truth.  To say more would give too much away, but suffice to say the film's success is partly due to the slow burn but absorbing script, but at least as much again to Rockwell's performance, never less than convincing, and by the end, you may well want to go back and watch it again to grasp the nuances of what is going on.<br />The set itself is low key, and even one might say familiar, with elements of the sparse whiteness of 2001, and also the lived in but blocky 70's style of Space 1999 or even Silent Runnings, for those that remember that far back.  It's interesting to remember that the director's father is David Bowie, and wonder how this might have influenced his visual choices, remembering Bowie's sci-fi outing in The Man Who Fell To Earth.  Clearly the visual style owes a lot to past visual styles, but that does not mean it does not have it's own originality.  Gerty is no HAL clone for all his similarities, but an intriguing pseudo-anthropomorphised functional robot who is Sam's only companion as the movie begins.  The music is similarly sparse and atonal, but it's simplicity suits the frame of mind being conveyed and the bleakness of the setting.<br />All told, this is no crash bang wallop special effects display - far from it, but it is nonetheless one of the best sci-fi stories around in years, because it actually IS a story and not just links of set-pieces.  The resolution may irk you, or it may satisfy you, and certainly given how languidly the plot moves throughout the movie, it's a shame the ending is so quickly wound up with a few too many questions lingering.. but whatever your impression on viewing, you'll undoubtedly be thinking about it some days later.<br />Recommended thinking man's low budget sci-fi.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>I love the basic idea here (won't spoil it with details), but by the time it was revealed and started to flower, we were rather bored. It then got very interesting and thought-provoking, however, so if you can wait for about 45 minutes there is a fine payoff. If it had been revealed early on and then played out with more time, I think this would be a truly classic film.<br /><br />Rockwell certainly is good here, though of course I can't really detail that comment without spoliers!<br /><br />I was overly reminded of 2001 and Blade Runner a little too often, especially the latter towards the end here. But, those are fine progenitors to have, so fair enough. The director is to be complimented for such a fine job on a pretty small budget, in any case, and for getting a great performance from Sam.<br /><br />In short, if you like character peices and/or sci-fi, this is well worth checking out.<br /><br />The blu-ray is excellent, btw, with a nice transfer and a bunch of good extras, including two commentaries, a few little docs, and a rather good short film by Jones, quite decent in its own right, with some very fine footage of Swiss locales and an interesting plot.<br /><br />All in all, a nice little package for a unique film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Duncan Jones makes an auspicious feature film debut with "Moon", which draws on the sci-fi flicks of Jones' youth in the 1970s and early 1980s for its tone and existential themes. Sometime in the near future, Earth relies on Helium-3 fusion for much of its energy supply. The He-3 is collected by Lunar Industries from a mining base on the dark side of the moon. The Sarang Mining Base has a human staff of one, who is responsible for maintenance of the harvesters. That man is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell). He is assisted by a creepily polite robot named GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey). Sam's 3-year contract will be up in 2 weeks, and he can't wait to get back to his family on Earth. But Sam starts seeing things. He has an accident while tending to one of the harvesters. It begins to look like things at Sarang may not be what they seem.<br /><br />GERTY is reminiscent of HAL of "2001" fame. "Moon" isn't coy about alluding to other films, but the allusions are more often used to create an expectation in the viewer that will later be challenged than to simply imitate. "Moon" goes in a different direction. It was made on an impressive $5 million dollars, shot in only 33 days, and spent a year in post-production. A tiny budget for sci-fi, but it looks like a lot more. There are 400 effects shots, but most of the moon scenes are done with miniatures. Miniature models always look better than CGI, especially since they can now be cleaned up digitally. Sam Rockwell deserves praise for being able to carry the film with no one to talk to but himself. "Moon" has some lose ends that don't add up, but that doesn't distract from the unique environment and suspense that make it so appealing.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2010): Bonus features include a short film, 4 featurettes, 2 commentaries, and a theatrical trailer (2 min). "Whistle" (26 min) is a short film by Duncan Jones about an assassin who carries out his plans long-distance from his home with his family in the Alps. "The Making of Moon" (16 min) interviews Duncan Jones about sets, genesis of the film and Sam Rockwell about playing two roles. In "Creating the Visual Effects" (11 min), effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp tells us how the clones, GERTY, lunarscapes, and lighting were achieved. "Science Center Q&A"* (20 min) was a Q&A session at NASA in Houston, where Duncan Jones takes questions. The NASA folk asked interesting questions but not technical. "Filmmaker's Q&A at Sundance" (11 min) was after the screening there.<br /><br />There are two feature commentaries. The commentary by director/storywriter Duncan Jones and producer Stuart Fenegan is the more informative and technical. They talk about why they made the choices they did, sets, which shots are on set vs miniatures or CGI, set details and technologies, the story and the Sams. The other feature commentary is with Duncan Jones, Director of Photography Gary Shaw, Concept Designer Gavin Rothery, and Production Designer Tony Noble. It is not very informative, as the participants are talking to each other rather than explaining anything to the audience. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and French, and English for the commentaries. Dubbing available for the film in French.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Moon is something of an oddity to be sure.  In the realm of the science fiction film genre, many films usually occupy the sub-genre of alien invasions/contacts, interstellar travel, etc.  Now and then however, a few films will pop up in the genre that akin more to the kind of hard science fiction that 2001: A Space Odyssey pioneered years ago; films like The Fountain or Steven Soderbergh's remake of Solaris.  Moon falls into that category of hard science fiction, marking the feature film debut of director Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie.  Sam Rockwell stars as Sam Bell, an astronaut on the way of coming to an end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon.  His only company is the robotic GERTY 3000 (voiced by Kevin Spacey), and needless to say, he's looking forward to reuniting with his wife and young daughter.  Things take a strange turn however when Sam starts seeing and hearing strange occurances, and then things really take a turn after he recovers from an accident and discovers that he isn't quite as alone as he thought he was, and things are definitely not what they seem.  I really don't want to give anything away here, but when things twist and turn with Moon, they manage to truly surprise the viewer.  The film presents some thought provoking moments, and while things don't always work out as well as they probably should (the film is quite slow moving), the end result is that Moon is a haunting, and surprisingly touching at times, science fiction film.  Rockwell is superb, and truly one of the most underrated actors working today.  Hopefully after Moon, and with his upcoming role in the high profile Iron Man II, he'll finally get the right kind of recognition that he wholeheartedly deserves.  All in all, give Moon a chance at the very least, regardless of what sorts of science ficiton films are your cup of tea.  You'll be pleasently surprised, as Moon is indeed a future cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Moon" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: It is the near future. Astronaut Sam Bell is living on the far side of the moon, completing a three-year contract with Lunar Industries to mine Earth's primary source of energy, Helium-3. It is a lonely job, made harder by a broken satellite that allows no live communications home. Taped messages are all Sam can send and receive. Thankfully, his time on the moon is nearly over, and Sam will be reunited with his wife, Tess, and their three-year-old daughter, Eve, in only a few short weeks. Finally, he will leave the isolation of "Sarang," the moon base that has been his home for so long, and he will finally have someone to talk to beyond "Gerty," the base's well-intentioned, but rather uncomplicated computer. Suddenly, Sam's health starts to deteriorate. Painful headaches, hallucinations and a lack of focus lead to an almost fatal accident on a routine drive on the moon in a lunar rover. While recuperating back at the base (with no memory of how he got there), Sam meets a younger, angrier version of himself, who claims to be there to fulfill the same three year contract Sam started all those years ago. Confined with what appears to be a clone of his earlier self, and with a "support crew" on its way to help put the base back into productive order, Sam is fighting the clock to discover what's going on and where he fits into company plans.<br /><br />The cast led by Sam Rockwell (in a career-best performance as Sam Bell) is excellent! The directing by Duncan Jones (who also wrote the story) (who also directing the upcoming "Source Code" (2011) is brilliant! The story by Jones & the screenplay by Nathan Parker is brilliant!<br /><br />The music by Clint Mansell (who also did the music to "Requiem For A Dream" (2000), "The Fountain" (2006) & "The Wrestler" (2008), which were directed by Darren Aronofsky) is brilliant! The cinematography by Gary Shaw is brilliant! The film editing by Nicolas Gaster (who also did the film editing to the upcoming "Welcome To The Rileys" (2010) is brilliant! The casting by Manuel Puro & Jeremy Zimmerman is brilliant! The production design by Tony Noble is brilliant! The art direction by Hideki Arichi (who is one of the set designers to the upcoming "Robin Hood" (2010) & Josh Fifarek (who also did the set decoration to "Mulholland Dr." (2001) is brilliant! The costume design by Jane Petrie (who also did the costume design to "28 Weeks Later" (2007) is brilliant!<br /><br />This is a brilliant and impressive sci-fi thriller that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. This is a brilliant debut for Duncan Jones and a career-best performance for Sam Rockwell, thus far. The visual effects are impressive. This is one of the best films of last year.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>This is an interesting and thoughtful character study of a lonely man on a lunar mining outpost.  He finds out after a while that.....spoilers ahead...............<br /><br />he is simply one in a long line of clones of the original Sam Bell, who apparently died some time ago.  The clones are of course not supposed to be aware that they are clones, nor are they to know that there are many more just like them.  This is the central conflict.<br /><br />More could have been done with the emotional complications that would ensue if any of us discovered multiple copies of ourselves. We would feel threatened and frightened.  Sam shows some of this, though not quite enough.<br />Still, this is a fascinating look at loneliness and corporate exploitation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Judging from the advertisements, Moon seemed to be about a man going slowly insane on, well, the moon. I assumed it was more of a movie like Event Horizon, where a lonely person stumbles on some mind-blasting truth. Fortunately, I was wrong.<br /><br />Actually, that's an accurate description of the film - it's jut that the mind-blasting truth is eminently relatable and human. Moon's a lot more complicated than it looks.<br /><br />Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the sole inhabitant of a moon base dedicated to mining Helium-3 for Lunar Industries.  His companion is GERTY (Kevin Spacey), a ceiling-hung robot that expresses itself through emoticons. For three years, Sam has overseen the various mining robots, worked on his wooden models, talked to his plants, and longed to be reunited with his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and daughter Eve (Rosie Shaw). With his time up, he's ready to go home. The catch is that Sam perceives everything through a filtered lens - even his transmissions to Earth are delayed.  Sam isn't just alone for three months; he's alone without any synchronous human contact.<br /><br />Red herrings abound. It's easy to focus on the HAL-like robot GERTY, a major character and foil for Sam. How can you trust something that sounds so benign as Kevin Spacey? Ironically, GERTY is one of the most human characters on the base.<br /><br />Moon's twist isn't in the revelation of The Truth, but in its implications.  Moon questions who Sam is, what he represents, and what makes him - and us - human.  We are, the director seems to say, defined by our memories, and that's enough to fuel us in our daily grind.  Sam is every worker who has been at it for years, always waiting for the next big break, the next reorganization, the next lotto ticket that will get him out of the crappy dead end job. It's a lot like Memento, high praise for a film that cost just $5 million to produce.<br /><br />The fun is in watching Sam deal with the truth of his situation and how he rises above it (or succumbs to it). Moon is littered with clues, making it worth another view. This is a tightly crafted, smart film that takes a single science fiction element and explores it thoroughly.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Director Duncan Jones pays homage to previous science fiction classics such as 2001, Silent Running, Outland and Alien, and does so from the same type of "grown up" science fiction perspective. His first film, Moon, does just that, offering a psychological edginess to one man's experience out in space. In the film, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is completing a three year contract for Lunar Industries, where he lives on the moon and collects samples of helium3, a source of energy. He has virtually no contact with humans other than via video messages from his wife; GERTY (Kevin Spacey), a robot, is his only companion during this time. Sam feels a sense of cabin fever and claustrophobia as the time winds down, and begins having strange hallucinations as his time is almost up. While exploring out on the moon, he has an accident. The aftermath of the accident is where the film gets tricky. He wakes up in the infirmary talking with GERTY, but sees what appears to be another version of himself in the room. Realizing that he is not hallucinating this time, Sam begins to uncover secrets about Lunar Industries and events back home.<br /><br />Some may take Moon to be standard sci-fi fare, but I think Moon has its own approach to understanding the effects of isolation on an individual, and what it means to be human, and develops its own answers for these issues. Sam's searching for answers out in space involve being exposed to emotionally-draining truths and revelations. Moon is an intelligent, thought-provoking movie that you can step back after watching and reflect upon. At points, the film investigates the claustrophobic feeling of not only being "closed in" and isolated from society, but from doubting one's own identity or where one is at in the universe, spiritually, psychologically, or physically. An unsettling perspective is realized throughout Sam's point of view, and Sam Rockwell does a superb job of capturing a wide range of emotions: anger, frustration, despair, paranoia, sadness, hope. The ending might not be awe-dropping, but Moon is a solid, smart sci-fi that makes you think about the essence of technology and its place, and what measures we should or shouldn't take in gaining knowledge.<br /><br />The extras from the DVD are exceptional. There is a commentary with Duncan Jones as well as The Making of Moon, which sheds some light on the basis for the story as well as the effects. I particularly enjoyed the Q and A session with Duncan Jones at the screening in Houston. Hearing the direction for the film, and the inspiration for it, gives you a better perspective for what the film was trying to achieve.<br /><br />Over all, Moon is a great addition to the sci-fi film genre.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is just another worker on the dark side of the moon. He's there to man the lunar base, and to make sure the mining machines function properly. Sam is alone, except for the base robot / computer, Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey). All is well until an accident occurs during a routine check, plunging everything into chaos. MOON is a superior science fiction effort w/ a memorable central (almost sole) character. Sam's isolation and loneliness are palpable. He is supposed to be nearing the end of his 3-year mission. Of course, that would be too simple! If I had to compare MOON to any other film, I would say that SILENT RUNNING would be it's closest relative. Both films deal w/ solitary figures in bleak situations. In space! Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Earth's energy needs are met with the mining of the moon.  The process is so mechanized, only a single person is needed to operate the mining station.  Sam Bell, played by Sam Rockwell, is two weeks away from the end of his three year contract staffing the station, and he can't wait for it to end.  "Three years is a long time," he confesses in a message to his handlers on Earth.<br /><br />Sam's only companion is GERTY, an AI presence on the station transported around by overhead railings.  GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) also stands in as a cook, a hairdresser, and a medic.  To give Sam a "sense" of GERTY's mood, GERTY flashes a "happy face," "frowny face," or something in between on a little screen.<br /><br />Sam knows he is tired.  When he begins to see things on the station, he recognizes his mental exhaustion.  And when one illusion causes him to wreak his "lunar tow truck," the story gets very complicated.  He is rescued.  But... there is only him and station-based GERTY.  So who is his rescuer?<br /><br />Sam Rockwell's appearance and actions throughout mimic a person who lives in isolation.  He talks to his plants, is consumed by his hobbies, and yet demonstrates great competence at his job.  Sam wears a worn and dirty pressure suit, shaves when he feels like it, and is happy to have GERTY do the "housework."<br /><br />After things begin to happen, Sam Rockwell, the actor, does a tremendous job staying in character for the rest of the movie.  I can't picture, for example, Harrison Ford or John Travolta starring in Moon.<br /><br />I've watched this film twice, once on the big screen and again as a DVD.  It's great both ways.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>Ok, ok, ok, this movie may not contain the most innovative plot. Heck, it might not even be that original. What this movie does, does and very, very well, is portray the feelings of the main character. This character is a lonely miner stuck on the moon. A man without any human interaction and working under a false assumption that he is himself. Through the movie he finds that what he thought was true is a lie, and then must deal with the emotional fallout of this realization. This is what this movie portrays so, so very well. So well, in fact, that you will feel his suffering and anger. Get this movie and see emotions on display with little being held back.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I've heard nothing but great things about Moon from both critics and us regular movie watching folks, so I'm happy to say that the hype did not let me down.<br /><br />The movie starts off slow, but then the mystery element kicks in and keeps this baby moving right along. It plays out like an extended Twilight Zone episode, but in this case, it's like one of the great episodes. There are also a lot of similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The main twist is revealed earlier on than I expected, but I liked the way it was handeled. You think you have it figured out, then it goes in a surprisingly new direction. I have to admit that it caught me off guard.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is very convincing here in a role that requires him to just talk to a robot, voiced by Kevin Spacey, or to himself. Since he is the only actor we see for 95 minutes, his role demands someone of his talents and he deserved an Oscar nomination, as did the movie itself. Why broaden the Best Picture category to 10 films this year and put The Blind Side in over Moon?<br /><br />I recommend not knowing anything about Moon before watching it. I didn't even bother to read the description of the movie before viewing the rental last night. If you must, Amazon gives a brief explanation of the the plot without revealing too much. In any case, this is a low budget Sci-Fi gem that is getting the respect it deserves.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Shot in just 33 days for a paltry $5 million by first time director Duncan Jones, MOON is as much of a breakthrough for this unknown director as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SJIO5E">District 9</a> was for (relatively new) Neill Blomkamp. Yes, it's THAT good.<br /><br />Clocking in at only 97 minutes, the film also gives a sense of urgency to a situation that easily could have been snooze inducing. Instead, Moon will have you on the edge of your proverbial couch, cheering on its main protagonist(s) and asking tough questions about big business, genetic research, and what it means to be human.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH93GU">Frost/Nixon</a>) is in almost every frame and pulls in an Oscar caliber performance (although I doubt he'll get nominated since this isn't a big budget flick and hit only a limited number of theaters before going to DVD). Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a lonely man. In fact, he is the only man at a moon-base that collects Helium-3, a valuable energy commodity that gets shot back to Earth. Sam's only companion is a Hal-9000-ish machine called Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AMHNKW">Recount</a>) who's sole job is to protect Sam. But not for long, because Sam's three year contract at the lunar base is coming to a close and he's ready to return to his beautiful wife and daughter back home. But an accident injures Sam and he awakens in the infirmary with Gerty caring for him.<br /><br />Memory gaps and surprisingly good physical condition (after such a bad accident) allows Sam to get back to work quickly. But he soon discovers a stranger trapped in a vehicle, and this stranger looks a lot like Sam.<br /><br />As the two Sam's fight, argue and eventually gain an understanding of what they are, a terrible realization hits them both. It is a poignant, graphic and horrible moment that will have many a hair standing up on peoples' necks when they see what has happened and what lengths a corporation is willing to go to in order to minimize expenses.<br /><br />The time spans are fascinating and leave much open for discussion. How long can one truly last living alone on the moon? How much radiation exposure would you get? And how long, genetically, was Sam designed to last? None of the answers are readily available, but most viewers will be asking themselves these things long after the movie has finished running its final credits.<br /><br />Congratulations must be given to director Duncan Jones for chasing after Sam Rockwell to do this role; he was, no doubt, the absolute perfect person to do it. Also, the miniature moon-scape scenes were phenomenal and never looked cheap or forced, as did the lunar station.<br /><br />The music was the perfect mix of creepiness and forlorn so that you really don't know how to feel about Sam and his predicament at the end. Empathy is there for sure, but what good it does is anyone's guess.<br /><br />Looking for a great independent film that you won't soon forget? Shoot for the Moon.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>The moon has long been a fascinating neighbour in the universe with the Americans being the first to land there during the Apollo 11 mission when Neil Armstong was the first man to walk on the surface in 1969. Duncan Jones' directorial debut Moon sees our neighbour in the cosmos not only conquered but being harvested of its valuable resources to be sent back to Earth to replenish wilting supplies. Amidst this seemingly straightforward procedure is an intriguing sci-fi thriller that offers a fascinating puzzle.<br /><br />Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), an employee of Lunar Industries, is on a three-year contract on the moon to oversee the harvesters that are drawing helium from beneath the moon's surface. Sam's job is to maintain the harvesters and to send canisters of helium back to Earth once they are filled. Sam's is a lonely task with his only companion at the lunar base being an artificial intelligence system known as GERTY (delightfully voiced by Kevin Spacey) whose moods are transparent via a yellow face on its screen with the movable mouth revealing its current state of mind. Sam maintains irregular contact with his employers and with his wife, Tess (Dominique McElliott), and the daughter he has never met, Eve. The film opens with Sam just two weeks from the end of his contract but with the luxury of returning home to his family so close, Sam's mental state suddenly becomes frighteningly fragile and he is faced with a staggering revelation about the lunar base.<br /><br />Despite the communications with Earth this film is largely left to Sam Rockwell to carry alone though the presence of Kevin Spacey, in the guise of a robot, does help prevent monotony setting in. Sam's daily activities are largely mundane and routine but with the end of his contract so close he begins to have strange hallucinations. First he sees a girl eating at a table, then while driving on the moon's surface to inspect the harvesters he crashes his vehicle after seeing someone standing outside! Waking in the infirmary Sam is informed to rest for a few days by GERTY and becomes suspicious when he eavesdrops on his companion talking to a board of directors from Lunar Industries who insist Sam cannot go outside again. Sam manages to trick his way out of the lunar base and after locating his crashed vessel from earlier he finds a wounded astronaut aboard who looks identical to him! The two Sams begin with a dislike of one another but gradually band together in figuring out what is happening on the moon and at the lunar base.<br /><br />To say any more about the storyline in Moon would give the game away but this is a perplexing sci-fi mystery as the two Sams do some exploring of the moon's surface and discover some unwanted truths. GERTY is something of a mystery, a seemingly helpful assistant that obeys both Sam and the directors of Lunar Industries but I found myself suspicious of it as the film progressed. Kevin Spacey's voice works brilliantly with the artificial intelligence, seemingly bereft of any emotion, just retaining a calm tone throughout even when trying to stop Sam from doing anything outside of Lunar Industries' authorisation. Good as Spacey is, it is Rockwell that rises to the challenge of being forced to dominate the film and even in playing two versions of Sam there are obvious differences between the two. Watching one continue with seemingly no problems while the other slowly deteriorates into physical and mental collapse was tragic but at the same time enthralling.<br /><br />The only downside to Moon is the length of the film. After a good build up to Sam's encounter with another version of<br />himself the pace seemed to hasten about halfway through and the ending felt a little rushed with a potentially satisfactory outcome being hinted at rather than shown to us. That may seem harsh but it shouldn't deter anyone from giving this one a try. For a debut effort this is impressive stuff and it was made on a limited budget which makes the shots of the moon's surface all the more impressive.<br /><br />Moon is a mind-boggling sci-fi mystery that begins slowly but soon gathers pace and although you may figure out the answers before they are revealed this will still keep you guessing how it will all turn out in the end. With stellar performances from Rockwell and Spacey this is an impressive debut from Jones who could be set for a fabulous career if he can maintain this standard.</p></br></body></html>

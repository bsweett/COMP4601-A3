Night Shymalan's second film is not more widely praised. "The Sixth Sense" is a hard act to follow, but "Unbreakable" is a remarkably good film and one of my favorites.<br /><br />If you look at the career of Shyamalan, the similarities to the career of Orson Welles are remarkable. Each started off with a bang, creating truly memorable films. Granted, "The Sixth Sense" is no "Citizen Kane", but both are remarkable in their own rites. Then each made a second film which was good, but flawed. In Welles case, this may have been the result of studio tampering. After that, each subsequent film has been less successful, less interesting, and less memorable. Welles will always be remembered for his masterful first film, and some flawed but interesting work throughout his career, "The Lady from Shanghai" stands out as a good example. It is far too early to tell if Shyamalan will suffer the same fate, but after the disastrous "The Village" and the mediocre "Lady in the Water", it doesn't look promising for the former wunderkind.<br /><br />David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a security guard at a college football stadium in Philadelphia, travels home from New York on the train. As he flirts with a woman and contemplates how well his interview went, he begins to notice something is wrong. Then the train crashes. David is the only survivor and he doesn't have a cut on him. His wife, Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and son, Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark), are overjoyed to see him when he is released from the hospital. Soon, David receives an invitation from Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), the owner of a rare comic book store called "Limited Edition", to come and visit. Elijah has a rare disease making his bones brittle. When he was born, his legs and arms were broken during delivery. Elijah is convinced that David has superpowers, but David is dubious. Soon, he begins to wonder and puts himself to various tests.<br /><br />"Unbreakable" is a very intelligent, well made movie about the myth of superheroes. I think the film may have been a little ahead of its time. Shortly after the film's release, Michael Chabon published "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" and suddenly there were many projects examining the origin of myth and superheroes, giving the ideas entertaining twists and fictionalized roots. So why didn't "Unbreakable" catch on? I'm not sure. Perhaps the film's approach is too cerebral, rooting everything too much in the real world. People may have been disappointed because David never really takes on a super hero persona. It happens in stages, in a more subtle way.<br /><br />There are many layers to every character, giving them depth and interest, making it a joy to watch them. David is a minimum wage security guard struggling with his relationship with his wife and child. He is trying to get a better job, to make things easier for them, to ease the strain on the family. The train accident leaves him shell shocked, but he doesn't give it much thought. Then, when he meets Elijah, he naturally discounts the strange man's theories. But Elijah has many facets as well. He sells rare comic books and comic book art, something that kept him going through his lonely childhood. But he won't sell the prized possessions to just anyone. He is far too attached to the pieces for that, they have to be able to appreciate the work they are about to purchase. If he doesn't believe they will, he doesn't sell it. He is obsessed with all things `comic book'. As he grows older, he becomes convinced that there are real super heroes out in the world and scans newspaper stories and newscasts for stories about survivors. Then David appears, in his own hometown, and he is sure.<br /><br />This is one of Bruce Willis' best performances to date. As David, he is a quiet man, unsure of his status in life at any point. Then, as he begins to question why he survived this train wreck, when no one else did, he becomes even more skeptical. As he deals with these questions, he still has to deal with the problems most people have; his strained relationship with his wife (they sleep in different rooms), his son, work, money and more. As he slowly becomes convinced of Elijah's theories, he sets small tasks for himself; he bench presses huge amounts of weight, as his son watches with admiration, he can see or sense things about people just by touching them, he looks for people to help. At one point, he decides the idea is just too ludicrous and completely discounts it, causing Joseph to become confused. Joseph is so sure his dad has superpowers that he sets a test of his own. This is a very emotional scene because everyone is scared. When Joseph presents the challenge, David is scared that he may just be a regular human and will die. So he yells at his son, his wife yells at their son, finally getting him to stop.<br /><br />We meet Elijah, right after he is born, and learn of his condition. Later, as a young boy we learn of his loneliness. He doesn't like to go outside, to play, because he always breaks a bone and that causes him pain. Then, as an adult, Samuel L. Jackson takes over the role; walking with a glass cane, wearing predominantly purple clothes, Elijah is a memorable presence. At one point, he chases a man David stopped, to see if he is actually has an item that David saw, providing more evidence of the security guard's powers. Chasing the man, on his fragile legs, he trips and crashes down some stairs. In the next scene, David meets Elijah who is now in a wheelchair, his legs broken and immobilized to help them to heal. Elijah is even more determined to prove David has unusual powers, but David is even more reluctant. As the two characters continue to exchange ideas and thoughts, we realize there is something going on, below the surface that we can't quite identify. Something that is driving both of them.<br /><br />Shyamalan does a masterful job with much of the film, letting scenes play out, letting them go to places we might not expect. There are many scenes involving David and his family and many may ask why it is necessary to have to watch this. Let's get to the superhero flying. These scenes add texture and back-story to the characters. Because we know David is having trouble with his family, we understand why he is reluctant to immediately jump into the role of superhero. He doesn't want any harm to come to them. Also, he is just learning about the whole thing, we are watching the birth of the character. As he deals with his job, we learn about events in his past, revealing a lifelong reticence to create or attract attention.<br /><br />One particularly impressive scene happens late in the film. Almost convinced, David sets out to prove that he has some powers. With Elijah's guidance, he goes to Grand Central Station and walks slowly through the crowds of people. As he has just left work, and it is raining, he still wears his Security poncho, his cape. As he brushes against people, he is able to sense something about them; he is looking for someone to help, to save. One teenager participated in an assault, throwing a bottle at two African American couples from a passing car, injuring one of the women. Another college student took advantage of a drunken co-ed in his dorm and he now returns home to mom and dad. Then David finds him; brushing against a maintenance worker, he gets a vision of the man invading a home and causing all forms of havoc. This is David's test. He follows the man to his new home and quickly assesses the situation before setting about his task. This scene is masterful because it contains almost no dialogue, yet we always understand what is going on. It is also suspenseful and well done.<br /><br />Perhaps even better, is the next scene in which David reveals to his son what happened the night before. Joseph starts to cry because he is both proud of his Dad and happy to see that he was right.<br /><br />Shyamalan also introduces us to Elijah very early and lets us see some key moments in his life, developing the character even further. The obsession with comic books, his belief in human super heroes, and his disease will all make sense in the end.<br /><br />All that said, the film is available as part of a two DVD set. The second DVD has a wealth of extras, including a documentary narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and many more standard extras hosted by the director, `making of' documentaries, creation of technical aspects, etc. But the packaging is some of the worst I have ever seen. The film is packaged in a cardboard sleeve, which is encased in a cardboard slip cover. Because of this, the box was partially smashed when I received it. Removing the plastic and the security tags yanked off a large chunk of the cover art. The security sticker was stuck directly to the cardboard and the cover art. The package is completely ruined because of this. This damage could've been avoided by using the regular plastic holders 99% of DVDs are packaged in.<br /><br />"Unbreakable" is a film I think about often. The performances are powerful, the story is interesting and believable and the production values are top notch. You should give it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The first time I saw this movie I would have given it three stars. Now that I have seen it numerous times, I would consider it my favorite M. Night film (followed by The Sixth Sense, The Village, and finally Signs) even though I liked all four of his films a great deal. It's a little slow at times, but it is a  great superhero film with a little more realism than say Spiderman. Worth buying, especially if you like M. Night's films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Life is not a comic book, and Superman doesn't exist.<br /><br />There are no caped crusaders, no black-cloaked night-defying vigilantes serving as unseen sentinels of Truth, Order, and Justice, watching over the harried commuter as the literal incarnation of the better angels of our Nature. The City out there has teeth and claws: you're going to get in trouble, and when you do, no one is going to come to your rescue.<br /><br />You see that weaselly, wizened, bespectacled clerk across the aisle from us on the train? That's the one, you got him pegged---looks like Clark Kent, doesn't he? Now, when that wild-eyed guy three rows down from him opens up his trenchcoat to reveal an AK-47 and makes the 6PM rush-hour express his personal butcher-shop, Clark Kent is going to stay just that---weaselly, bespectacled Clark Kent. No phone booth transformation for him, no salvation for you and me and our fellow passengers. Nope, he's going to scream, and try to run, and die Clark Kent, along with you and me.<br /><br />In our world, men and women die meanginglessly every day: in traffic pile-ups, in air disasters, pushed on the subway tracks by anonymous madmen, who later disappear in the crowd. There is no Superman; there never was, there never will be. Or will there? M. Night Shyamalan leads us right down that particular rabbit hole in the eerily profound and deeply moving "Unbreakable", his meditation about the meaning of a superhero in a callow age.<br /><br />Case in point: Security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is riding home on the train from a Manhattan job interview (he didn't get an offer---see?---real life). He checks out his seatmate; yeah he's married---but it's a bad marriage, dying a day at a time---and she's lithe, tall, slender, good facial structure. She stows her carry-on in the overhead bin, and as she does her shirt rides up, revealing a black rose tattoo. Nice.<br /><br />They make small-talk; she's a sports-agent on her way to meet with a rising young football star; in the football spirit, David Dunn makes a pass---and fumbles. She gets creeped out and takes a seat a few rows down. A minute later the train shakes, there's a high keening noise, another furious bump---the bad kind, the Something is Very Wrong kind---and the train derails.<br /><br />Everyone aboard dies. Everyone except David Dunn, who walks away from the steaming, smoldering carnage without a scratch.<br /><br />Shellshocked, baffled, confused, he attends the church service for the dead; staggering outside, he finds a glossy invitation---with a cryptic phrase---to a Philadelphia art gallery affixed to his windshield.<br /><br />That leads him to reclusive art dealer Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson, who along with Willis carries this movie with poise and presence), taunted as "Mr. Glass" by his erstwhile classmates, sufferer of a rare bone disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (a real disease): the slightest stress can snap his bones to splinters.<br /><br />In turn, we meet Elijah's true life's work: reasoning that if a man of Glass could exist the Bell Curve of human genetics would also feature a Man of Steel, he has spent years sifting through horrific accidents for survivors--and more importantly, for that one man in a million who could be a Superhero.<br /><br />Just as with ghosts and werewolves and vampires, you can deal every day with arguments against---but it only takes one true positive to change the world. And in David Dunn, Elijah feels he has found his Positive.<br /><br />Dunn isn't having any of it: besides, he has tons of evidence why he's not a comic book hero: he's just a GUY---dead-end job, marriage on the rocks, and he's not invulnerable---hell, as a rising young college football star, he was injured in a nasty car accident---with his then girlfriend and now wife Audrey (Robin Wright Penn)---that injured his legs and ended his football career.<br /><br />The superficial have called Shyamalan a great many things: a spooky director, a horror director, a 'twist' director---but in fact, M. Night has really always been interested in probing the Human Soul, and has tilted at a wide range of genres---Alien invasion, Ghosts, Monsters in the Woods, Superheroes---to dig into the human condition. What makes us tick. What distinguishes us from the animals. Our Gods, our night terrors, our inspirations. Knowledge---of reality, of self, of destiny---comes at a price. And as this strangely sedate, moody piece winds its way to culmination, we find that Dunn's price is extraordinary frightening---and severe.<br /><br />Shyamalan serves "Unbreakable" up as a warped riff on the superhero origin story: the initial reluctance and bewilderment on the part of the crime-fighter, the secret identity, the strange ellipitical orbit of superhero and supervillain. His directing here is restrained and reticent, and this restraint is given fuller effect by cinematographer Eduaro Serra, who casts everything through a blue filter than enhances the moodiness, uncertainty, and depression.<br /><br />Finally, M. Night proves again that he's an actor's director: this moodpiece is brought off nicely by essentially four actors: Willis playing it with brooding---but hopeful---understatement as David Dunn; Jackson serving as perfect sounding board, foil, and fencing master for the reluctant hero Dunn; and Robin Wright Penn (Audrey) and Spencer Treat Clark bringing up the rear as the dubious wife and adoring son.<br /><br />Not a flashy, gangbusting epic like Spider-Man, "Unbreakable" is no less a moody, thoughtful treatment of the Origin Story---no less so because Shyamalan is wrestling with the hero within all of us. Prepare to be have your emotions broken---prepare to be shaken.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>I thought that this latest M. Night Shyamalan film was much better than his last, The Sixth Sense. First off I think the story is much better. It tells the tale of Bruce Willis' character who basically cannot be hurt, or can't get sick. I don't want to give any of the movie away, so I won't get into it in specifics. All I can say that I was on the edge of my seat in numerous scenes, with my heart just pounding away. There were some very creative angles in which some scenes were shot in the picture. An example of this would be the opening sequence on the train where Bruce is talking to another woman. Its like you are looking between the seats in the section in front of them watching the action. Little sutlties like that give this film a look of its own. An actor which impressed me was the young boy who plays Bruce Willis' son. I wish I knew his name, but I think he had a great performance. I had read some critics reviews and many had said they thought the ending was terrible. Well honestly, I don't know what they are smoking, but I thought it was shocking and unexpected, at least in my point of view. Definetly what I was hoping for in this movie, I'm surely going to see it again.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / High Profile 4.1<br />Running time: 1:46:39<br />Movie size: 27,02 GB<br />Disc size: 32,21 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 23.96 Mbps<br /><br />LPCM Audio  English  4608 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 16-bit / 4608kbps<br />Dolby Digital EX Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1-EX / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital EX Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1-EX / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital EX Audio  Portuguese  640 kbps  5.1-EX / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital EX Audio  Spanish  640 kbps  5.1-EX / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital EX Audio  Thai  640 kbps  5.1-EX / 48kHz / 640kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Chinese / French / Indonesian / Korean / Malayalam / Portuguese / Spanish / Thai<br /><br />Number of chapters: 29<br /><br />#Behind the Scenes (SD, 14 minutes)<br />#Deleted Scenes (SD, 29 minutes)<br />#Comic Books and Superheroes (SD, 19 minutes)<br />#The Train Station Sequence (SD, 4 minutes)<br />#Night's First Fight Sequence (SD, 3 minutes)<br />#Trailer (HD, 2 minutes)</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>How does one classify this movie?  Some might call it a drama, as the slow pacing, muted emotions, lack of comedy, and modern, urban setting all fit the descriptions of many modern dramas.  Some might call it a fantasy; a reluctant superhero discovered by his arch-enemy who knows no bounds.  The former has strength beyond his knowledge, while the latter uses cunning to overcome his physical limitations.  Others might call it a suspense movie, as it has all the hallmarks of a classic suspense; good guys and bad guys are only sorted out at the end, and the audience discovers things as the protagonist does.  Maybe it is a combination of all three genres, another achievement from the M. Knight Shamalayan.<br /><br />However one might classify this movie, it is an incredible piece of story-telling.  Its as if Shamalayan wrote a traditional fairy tale, set it in a modern American city, and then reversed all the normal rules of fairy tales.  First of, the premise of superhero ignorant of his own destiny is a common starting point; think of Harry Potter, X-Men, and Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings.  But the heroes in these stories are all young, at the beginning of their lives.  Bruce Willis's character here, David, is old, past middle age most likely, and looking back on his glory years.  Second, heroes needs to be revealed unintentionally, through accident or fate.  David is discovered by both accident and fate.  Accident put him on a train, but fate assured him to survive.  Third, each hero needs a weakness.  Superman had kryptonite, Batman had his past and Spiderman has his loved ones.  But water, who would ever imagine water to be the one weakness of David?  Last, all heroes need an antagonist, that villian they must stop.  But here, it is the villian who seeks out the hero, helps him find his power, and finally, guarantees the hero's victory by sealing his own doom.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great movie.  For the budget it was made one, with the cast it starred, it delivers a great story with heart and soul.  Its setting is modern, yet the storyline is more mythical than anything else.  The conceptual background of comicbooks contrasts nicely with the plot itself.  I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson star in this movie, and M. Night Shyamalan is the director and filmaker.  I love Shyamalan's work, and also recommend The Sixth Sense, which he also wrote.  This movie may not be better than The Sixth Sense, but it is better than The Village and Signs (also by Shyamalan).  It quietly advances leaving you wondering where the impact is going to be, then you see it and it is significant, interesting, and sometimes intense.  If you watch with a careful eye, you will get the most out of this film.  Be patient; you are in for a whammy of an ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Beings that M. Nights new movie 'Lady in the Water' is released today I decided to take a look at his previous films.  I've already reviewed 'The Sixth Sense' and anyone who knows me knows that I hold that film in the highest regard, as one of the best 'ghost' films for it's smart script and excellent direction, not to mention the chemistry between Haley and Bruce.  Now I have always been a diehard Willis fan so I was excited when I first saw 'Unbreakable'.  I was expecting another 'Sixth Sense' type vibe but what I recieved was something much different.  As everyone knows, I feel that Night has done no better than 'Sixth Sense' and I fear he never will BUT 'Unbreakable' is a very close second for many reasons.<br /><br />First of all, the film is far from scary, but it has very dark tones.  The entire film is directed in dark lights with eeire music and the characters are haunted by the way their life is going.  Willis plays David Dunn a man whose struggling to make his life work.  He works as a security guard and is trapped in a marriage falling apart.  The opening scene has David on a train travelling home from a job interview and he is seated next to a beautiful woman.  Just watching his character remove his wedding band and then, almost awkwardly, proceed to put the moves on this woman says a lot.  You can see the state his character is in.<br /><br />Moments later the news is on and Davids son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) realizes that the train his father was on has just crashed.  Come to find out his father is the sole survivor of that crash and he hasn't even suffered a scratch.  To everyone they shrug it off as coincidence, even Davids wife (played brilliantly by Robin Wright Penn) but as time passes and a strange man (Samuel L. Jackson) who believes that David may in fact be a superhero.<br /><br />This may sound far fetched, but come on, if we'll go see 'X-Men' or 'Superman Returns' then we can get with the program.  This is just a superhero movie for adults.  But here's what makes this movie so great to me.  This is not about being a superhero as much as it is about becomeing a superhero.  This film revolves around a man not sure of who he is or what he is for that matter and his unwillingness to believe he's more than normal, but once he does realize then it all starts to make sense...for David it all starts to make sense.<br /><br />You'll see that once he starts to take responsibility for himself, knowing what he needs to do and doing something about it his whole life takes a turn for the better.  This is going on the theme that many of us are unhappy with our lives because we're unhappy or unsure of ourselves.  Once David realized who he was he knew he had purpose...much greater purpose than to be a security guard who once had dreams of something greater (we see in flashbacks that David had dreams to once be a pro-football player but due to an injury...wink/wink...he gave it all up).  Knowing he had a place made him whole, made him happy, and made him see that what he had was what he wanted.<br /><br />The entire cast is superb, Willis especially, and the story and direction is Shyamalan at his best.  Yes, since 'The Sixth Sense' Night has slipped from a lot of people's lists and has somewhat become concidered a dissapointment (I think this is mostly due to poor advertising), but when looked at properly he really is a magnificent storyteller.  The final frames will leave you breathless and will send shockwaves down your spine.  I feel it's a brilliant film with a universal message we can all appreciate and understand.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>I'm going to risk coming off like I'm slightly off my rocker to people who are slightly less...eccentric...than I am and say what I really think of "Unbreakable": this movie is the first small portion of what Should happen in the real world.<br /><br />  A train wreck kills every one of its passengers onboard (okay, that isn't the part that should happen in real life, obviously) except one survivor (played by Bruce Willis in his best role ever) who doesn't have a scratch on him.  This attracts the attention of a comic book historian, of all things, who has a most unusual theory on why this one man was able to escape even the slightest injury.  This historian, briliantly played by Samuel L. Jackson, has reasoned out a theory that seems very reasonable, and very very familiar to me personally.  In this current world, we have crime, war, poverty, neverending famine, disease, and every other malady that preys on the world.  Driven by tremendous hardship in the course of his own life, Jackson's character has wondered: could not nature somehow produce a counterbalance to everything that always goes wrong?<br /><br />  "Unbreakable" is filmed in a grim, dark, rather bleak style meant to highlight - in its early portions - the negative aspects of the world rather than the positive ones.  A broken world, for the most part.  And Jackson is looking for something to break the gridlock from a highly unusual source.<br /><br />  Great performances by the whole cast, tremendous suspense, thought-provoking and dream-provoking, groundbeakingly innovative, "Unbreakable" is Willis's best, and possibly M. Night Shymalan's best as well.  Possibly Jackson's best along with "Star Wars", although he didn't play as large a role in those movies (and to be honest, there's still a couple of excellent-looking Samuel Jackson movies out there I haven't seen yet).  This could have spawned not only a sequel or two, but an entire line of movies now that the first crack is in the floodgate.  They wouldn't even have to all have the same characters; the potential for expansion on this concept into a whole movie universe is astonishing.<br /><br />  If you're intrigued by the comic book references and parralells and would like to give one or both of the 'big' ongoing comic universes a try but don't know where to start, I have a few suggestions.  These collections don't require as much of a foreknowledge of the histories and concepts involved, and get right to the hearts of key characters, and thus would make good starting points. DC- "Superman: No Limits", "Batman: Evolution", "Hawkman: Endless Flight", "JLA: Pain Of The Gods".  Marvel- "New Avengers: Breakout", "Incredible Hulk: Return Of The Monster" (well, right to the heart of one of the Hulk's many incarnations anyway), "Astonishing X-Men: Gifted" and "Amazing Spider-Man: Sins Past"</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>How do you follow up a massive success? It's been a question long asked with certain filmmakers. How can James Cameron top Titanic, which is still the top money-making movie ever(not counting old movies and inflation). And George Lucas will pretty much be that Star Wars dude. Upstart director M Night Shyamalan came out with The Sixth Sense, an intriguing thriller with one of the best and well-known twist endings in existence. So how do you follow it up? Make something similar.<br /><br />A train derails and causes a huge disaster killing everyone. That is except for one: David Dunn, a security guard working at a stadium. The kicker is: not only did he survive but he didn't even get scratched, hurt, a headache or anything. This attracts the interest of a comic book enthusiast Elijah Price who gets David's attention by asking a simple question: how many times have you been sick? Turns out David can't and he can potentially be what Elijah's been looking for: a real-life comic book hero.<br /><br />The trailer was probably the most interesting thing about the film. Someone stumbles upon an immunity to pain and injury and we're trying to figure out how he does it. It comes out and it mentions comic books. Like subsequent films The Village and Lady in the Water, Unbreakable was an intriguing premise until it steers off in other directions. What is here though is intriguing regardless. I always was fascinated by mythology and special abilities that comic books can bring so of course, me and my nerdness gravitated towards this. The only thing is that it might be unintentionally funny. When David is told that something is like his kryptonite it's kind of like "oh, boy".<br /><br />The one thing that makes this different is that unlike the others which had character moments interspersed with full-on thriller scenes, this gears into more drama and character stuff. For some, it's a great change of pace rather than relying on scary stuff and spooks but for others it's kind of tedious and slow. The one thing that irks me though is that there's a bit too much flashyness with the camera. The camera is upside-down, reflected in mirrors, shot through that sliver of space in seats. Now granted Shyamalan is one of the few that knows where to put his camera but at times it's like "quit showing off, man".<br /><br />Performances-wise it's good all around. Bruce still talks in that kind of I-sound-super-bored voice that he always has and Robin and Spencer are good in their respective roles, a highlight scene being a little confrontation at the dinner table. Samuel L. Jackson comes in and of course acts awesome but with a haircut like a run-in with an angry blow-dryer and full pimpness complete with cane, it comes a bit close to campy. You can almost imagine characters to go "smack!" or "zop!" when someone gets punched.<br /><br />In terms of where his films stand, this is either everybody's least favorite(or the Village) or it's underrated and we just don't get it. I'm more in the middle. It's a good film, not great.</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>You wake up in a rather murky setting. The stretcher beneath you creaks under your weight as you raise yourself into a sitting position. The curtains around you are mostly closed, leaving an opening the size of a small door. On the other side, you see a man lying on a hospital bed, completely wrapped in bandages, and there is a growing spot of red that tells you the man is hemorrhaging. He is about to die. Everything is kind of fuzzy, but you know that you and the dying man were both victims of the same train wreck, but while he is wrapped up like a mummy and quickly approaching death, you look at yourself, and there isn't a scratch on you. <p>The idea of something like this happening prompts a series of thoughts to streak through your mind, and each of these thoughts is captured in director M. Night Shyamalan's follow up to his masterful &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;: &quot;Unbreakable.&quot; And I think I have to answer one question before I really dig into the guts of this review: No, this one isn't as good as &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but it's still ridiculously good.<p>&quot;Unbreakable&quot; examines a world of possibilities that is very similar to comic books. If someone like Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) exists in the world with the horrific disease of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (a genetic disorder that makes bones very easy to break), then the logic of a comic book reading mind would deduce that there must be someone at the opposite end of the spectrum. Someone whose bones are unbreakable. Someone who doesn't get sick. Someone whose destiny is to utilize his or her powers to protect the rest of us.<p>Elijah (a biblical reference to one who would pave the way for a savior) Price believes that he has found his opposite when a train crash outside Philadelphia kills everyone on board except for one man, who escapes totally unharmed. That man is David Dunn (Bruce Willis, with the double-sounding hero name like Peter Parker or Clark Kent), an ex-college football star who now works as a security guard at the local football stadium. One day, after the train wreck, David finds a note held under the windshield wiper of his car, and in it is scrawled a question that starts the true meaning of the film coming into focus: "How many days of your life have you ever been sick?" David makes it his mission to find out, and he makes some incredible discoveries along the way.<p>M. Night Shyamalan does not disappoint his followers with this film. Sure, the film has its implausible moments, but that is more than forgivable, not just because of the believability of the Willis character, but because this film is, in essence, the first comic book movie that wasn't based on a comic book. The cinematography is outstanding, giving this movie the look and feel of those impossibilities that we love seeing in comics. Shyamalan shows he is quite an established shot-maker, the best I've seen since Spielberg and Sam Raimi, and he uses his music (composed by Maestro James Newton Howard) to accent every scene perfectly. And it wouldn't be an M. Night Shyamalan film without a surprise ending and some really clever sequences.<p>&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is an uncommonly absorbing film that gripped me from beginning to end. The visual style is incredible, the characters are believable, and the acting is stellar. The ending, I thought, was rather tacked on, but nevertheless effective: It doesn't cheat. If I had to pick one movie star to be a superhero, it would be Bruce Willis. Why? Because he never fails to be cool in every single movie he does.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Great acting, good filming, and compelling storyline made for a truly memorable movie about two men bound together by fate. One suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle-bone disorder) while the other one seems really lucky as he is able to avoid serious injury and death. Why? Well, watch this movie and you'll see... it really is an awesome film, and Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson do great job in their respective roles. This is also one of M. Night Shymalan's better - if not best - films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MQ672FYFNM7B.html">A3MQ672FYFNM7B</a><br/><p>In "Unbreakable" Bruce plays an everyday man David Dunn who has extraordinary powers. After escaping a tragedy unharmed he starts to think that there is something wrong with him because he's never been hurt in his life. David comes to meet another gentleman on the other side of the pendulum, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who has gone out of his way to follow David's miraculous powers. The more the plot unfolds the more we learn that David is such a heroic and humbled man who just wants to find out why he is like this. Bruce Willis was especially believable during the scene with the gun. There was so much passion in his voice. But it's not until David starts to embrace his special powers that he was born with does he really start to see what is going on around with him. It's like he is able to step outside of the box and look at the entire picture and that picture isn't very pretty and it's not very nice to look at. And that's why this role was so perfect for Bruce because he was able to channel his natural abilities of drama and even action to give such power and credence to an everyday man who happens to be everyone's hero. There is a plot twist that will really catch you for a loop, I can't imagine anyone would expect it. This is a wonderful movie because it's both uplifting and empowering and shows that heroes or angels or whatever you want to call them walk among us. "Unbreakable" is also an affective movie for displaying evil and virtu in the most semblance and basic ways. Robin Wright was also excellent playing Bruce's wife because there was an almost severe and magnanimous quality about her character that came shining through. If you enjoy Bruce Willis (and who doesn't?), dramas with a twist ending or just excellent movies that you can be proud to share with your entire family than this movie is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Security Guard David Dunn miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia. Not only is he the sole survivor out of 132 passengers, he also is completely unharmed. A little later, comic book specialist Elijah Price contacts him to confront David with an incredible theory: Elijah, who has been nicknamed "Mr. Glass" due to his more than fragile bones, thinks that David has got all which he himself lacks. The two of them "seem to be linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends". First, David does not believe the strange man, but every single thing he had said proves to be true: David has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't. Slowly, David begins to discover the shocking truth behind Mr. Price's assumptions. But after all, David's fate is not only to find his real place in the world. It also is about proving Elijah's theory of his own existence. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes Bruce Willis, M. Night Shyamalan, comic books or just an exciting, suspense-charged movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable is very rare class of superhero film, trying to be incredibly logical, while also having plenty of absurd moments.  This is okay, sense the director's other films have also followed a similar formula... But, typically with his films you find yourself taken away by the emotional drama and characters, and the films move along so quickly you never really get a chance to stop and question the logic behind the events, because if you had the chance to question it you'd realize how ridiculous the entire situation is.<br /><br />We are introduced to the story with an awkward man by the name of David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a security guard, who seems to have some serious issues in regards to being social, and communicating.  While on his way back to New York he winds up being the only man to survive a colossal train crash (the other is seen dying from substantial injuries, giving us a wonderful shot of Willis being counseled by the doctor as you slowly see a flailing sheet soak in blood).  He emerges from this crash completely unharmed, which leads to speculation and confusion from doctors, and the media.  Soon after he is given a letter from an art gallery, which displays comic book art entitled "Limited Edition".  There he meets the owner, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a man who has suffered from multiple injuries as a result of weak bones, making kids call him "Mister Glass".  Since he spent one third of his life in the hospital he has read many comic books, and takes them to a serious level of philosophy and sub textual meanings, and he believes David to be a real life hero.  To Elijah, comics aren't children's tales about men in brightly colored outfits fighting menacing beings of evil seeking the destruction of good, but as one of mankind's most important visual arts.<br /><br />As the plot moves on the evidence of "truth behind the panels" become clear to David and Elijah, though David doesn't want to accept this, for the already strained relationship between his wife and son has only just started to mend itself after the train crash.  The audience can tell that this will ultimately end with David accepting the truth and mending relations with his family, and they can also anticipate the typical Syamalan twist ending.<br /><br />Yes, this is a drama with a concept that is hard to take seriously, but Willis and Jackson do take it seriously and that's all that really matters in a movie like Unbreakable, where acting can be the saving grace of the plot's weaknesses.  The two leading actors' performances are worth noting, as is the director's keen attention to details, and sense of visual style.  The music score is at times rather slow, not really capturing the right emotion for the events taking place on screen and that lessens the power of the film.  The twist at the end will probably be anticipated by most moviegoers, or comic book readers, but it isn't as simple as the twist in films such as The Village (Honestly, shame on you if you didn't see that one coming).  This film isn't as good as `Signs', or `The Sixth Sense', but fans of Shymalan's other films will certainly accept this one with arms open wide.<br /><br />The best parts for me (as a writer, and a comic reader) came from Samuel L. Jackson's character, Elijah Price.  When he got in character and talked about how grand and important the story-telling history behind comic books I felt completely attached to the character.  I grew attached in these moments because I do believe comics are much more than simple stories to amuse children.  They are a very important way of communication, and have been for centuries.  Struggles of good versus evil, right and wrong, they have modeled lots of our cultural traits, whether we believe it or not.  These, philosophical speeches he gives describing comics, and the art styles characters are drawn in captures the truth behind comics, and I hope if anything people can come out of seeing this film with a greater respect for this age old genre of story-telling.<br /><br />Unbreakable does suffer several problems, which is why the highest rating I can bring myself to give it is four stars.  The main problems, for me, are found in the musical score and the pace of certain scenes.  At times this film is incredibly...well boring.  By boring I do not me it lacks action (you shouldn't expect much adrenaline pumping action in ANY of Shyamalan's films, because he lacks a visual style suited for action), but as in some scenes just don't have any compelling force to catch the audience's attention.  The music, as I said is slow, and I feel it could've really improved these slow scenes if it would've had the musical score that caught your attention, not as in loud and obnoxious, but subtle and mysterious, because for me this film was a supernatural mystery tale, so I think the score should've been more mysterious, dark, and forbidding.<br /><br />Unbreakable is not as good as `Signs' or `The Sixth Sense' (my personal opinion, so don't get testy if you disagree), but if you DID enjoy those two previously listed films you'll probably enjoy Unbreakable.  If you only liked `Signs' and `The Sixth Sense' because of their suspense, sci-fi, supernatural, and horror aspects, well, you need to realize Unbreakable is a totally different supernatural-drama, so you might want to ignore this one if you don't want to see a superhero film where the "Hero" only takes up the task of fighting evil in the last twenty minutes of the film.  If you watch Shymalan's films because of their style, and emotion, than hop aboard, sit back, relax, and enjoy Unbreakable for what it is.<br /><br />Shaky, but manages to squeeze out a 4/5 from me due to all the things it did RIGHT, and for the performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>These days any film associated with comics is likely to be a special effects extravaganza full of action and short on character development. Well director M. Night Shyamalan has taken us in a different direction, (no surprise there). His film, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, explores the action comic philosophy without becoming an action comic itself. You won't see  men in spandex leaping from tall buildings to save the day. What you will see is a thoughtful investigation of the unusual skills we humans may or may not have, and the choices we make regarding their use. <p>I have a talent for putting holes in T-shirts. My sister can permanently stop any watch she wears for a few weeks. It's hard to see either of us becoming crime fighters or maniacal masterminds on the strength of these talents but it does makes you think. Let's stretch our imaginations a little further. What if a man had the uncanny luck to avoid virtually all injury or illness? Could this be significant? Would he even notice? Where would it lead him? <p>Unbreakable introduces us to such a man. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, the sole survivor of a tragic train derailment that killed the other 131 passengers. David walks away without a scratch and barely notices his fifteen minutes of fame on the local news channels. But at least one other person takes note of David's uncanny good fortune. Elijah Price is an art dealer, played convincingly by Samuel L Jackson. His gallery specializes in comic art and he is very passionate about the seriousness of his chosen profession and it's medium. <p>Elijah believes that action comics represent an ancient wisdom, exaggerated and commercialized but still containing an essence of truth. His theory is that there are  people with extraordinary abilities and that these people have a destiny. Whether these people become legendary hero's or any other larger than life figure depends on them realizing their destiny and fulfilling their potential. In David Dunn, he suspects lies the heart of a hero and Elijah's obsession soon drags David and his family into a new world. <p>Shyamalan takes his time with this story. It could have very easily been boring, because when boiled down, little actually happens. However, Unbreakable avoids that trap and becomes instead, a strange mixture of longing, suspense and doubt. We truly get to know David's wife Audrey and his son Joseph. They are not an atypical family; marital problems, boredom and some other dysfunctions feature at the start of the story. In a way, David's gradually more serious attempts to explore his &quot;gift&quot; become the catalyst to improve his home life. <p>The sub-plot of David's crumbling relationship with Audrey, (Robin Wright), is not fully explored but we are given several clues that make it interesting. David is chasing job offers in another city, even after the accident little emotion passes between he and Audrey, and they sleep separately. All of which points to a lack of love. But to counter this we discover that David sacrificed a promising football career to capture Audrey's heart and, even in the hardest times, he has remained faithful to her. I like these quiet story lines, where nothing is forced down your throat and you have to work it out on your own. <p>By far the most interesting character is Elijah. Born with a brittle bone disease, his life  has been crowded with pain, torment and ostracism. At school he was taunted with the moniker, &quot;Mr. Glass&quot;, and to an extent he has embraced this title. If you look closely, you will see that he is always close to glass, for example, his fragile glass walking stick. Elijah is a fighter. His mother headed off a life of seclusion when he was a depressed boy and convinced him to accept life's challenges, eventually leading to his becoming a professional success. Elijah's passion and conviction are magnetic. He not only draws David and his son into the world of duty/destiny but the audience is forced to believe, long before David starts to. <p>Unbreakable is a subtle film about taking risks, acknowledging hope and following dreams. Whether we have special gifts or not, it challenges us to take a look around and try to find opportunities to make a difference; to stand up to the small and large evils in this world and do our part. I can only hope we see more of these inspiring characters in future films. I want to feel this way again.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>David Dunn ( Bruce Willis) is the sole survivor of a massive train wreck, and does not even suffer a single scratch. Elajah Price ( Samuel L Jackson)has a condition that leaves his bones extremely vulnerable to breaking and develops the nickname &quot;Mr. Glass&quot;. He is also a comic book specialist. His theory is that comic book heroes walk the earth, and due to the recent events, Elajah suspects that David is one of them. The theory is based on the spectrum of life. At one end is Elajah who is incredibly weak and extremely vulnerable. At the other end is someone who is extremely strong and invulnerable. At first David refuses to believe. But Elajah soon convinces David to look into his past. David soon discovers that he has never been sick, never been injured, has exceptional strength, and possesses a unique gift that others don't.... <p>M. Night Shyamalan made one of the most popular horror films in history with &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. But in my opinion, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is his best film and extremely underrated. While people often criticize this film for being too slow, and hard to understand, it still continues to be one of my favorite films. The fact that the films move slowly, is what gives the film its brilliance. The events unfold at a pace that really lets you soak in the story and what the characters are going through. The story succeeds on five different levels. The first being the trouble with David's job as a security guard and his fight to find his place in the world. The second is the trouble with his marriage, and David's relationship with his wife Audrey ( Robin Wright Penn).The third is the endless need to proove Elajah's theory wrong. The fourth is with David's son Joseph ( Spencer Treat Clark) and how he thinks his dad is a hero. The fifth being what David does with his life, after he finds the truth. All of these aspects are blended together beautifully to create a well rounded story. M. Night Shyamalan is also known for his endings. The ending to &quot;Unbreakable&quot; will blow you away and is extremely shocking! Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Spencer Treat Clark, and Robin Wright Penn are all spectacular in their roles. Each bring an important part to the story and are equally captivating. Finally, the camera work, set designs, and use of color are amazing, and really bring the story to life. <p>The VISTA SERIES DVD however, might be the thing of all. The extras are out of this world. They really let you see the film in a whole new light. You get additional scenes, a behind the scenes documentary, and much much more. This is definately a must own</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Unbreakable is about the mythology behind comic book superheroes and the purposes that each of us have in life.  The film opens with the birth of a baby boy with all four of his limbs broken.  He is Elijah Price, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson, and he has type I OI or brittle bone disease.  As his life goes on, he gets the nickname of "Mr. Glass" as up the point of present time in Unbreakable, Elijah had broken bones in his body 57 times.  Elijah is motivated early on to socialize in some capacity by his mother and his primary interest becomes comic books.  As he gets older he soon begins to question what the reason is for his own existence and comes to the conclusion that if people like him exist with his weakness, then surely there must be someone on the other end of the spectrum with massive strengths.  Elijah believes there is nothing scarier than to live life without knowing your purpose and he makes the assertion that there are in fact real-life superheroes.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a security officer, who, unlike Elijah, is trying to find his own purpose in life.  He gave up his football career for his wife but now his marriage is falling apart.  David survives a train wreck that kills 131 people, and he is the only survivor.  He was completely unharmed.  Elijah believes David to be a real superhero and gradually confronts David with his theory.  David's son Joseph believes Elijah and assists David in finding out more about his potential powers. Just to add, I'm of the opinion that it is an absolute pleasure to watch Willis and Jackson act in pretty much anything.<br /><br />As with any M. Night Shyamalan film, giving too much away is hugely detrimental to the experience and please know that this film is entirely worth going into with no more information then I have already provided.  What Shyamalan has done here in retrospect, while considering the recent onslaught of big-budget comic book movies, is create a completely unconventional yet convincing adaptation of comic book heroes' origins. At the same time Unbreakable celebrates the mythology behind these fictional characters.  It takes a profound imagination to come up with a screenplay that gives this concept the treatment that Shyamalan has.  It is the kind of concept that might have taken almost a lifetime of brainstorming.<br /><br />A friend of mine once said that the Sixth Sense was a gigantic and nearly perfect movie for absolutely everyone, while as a comic book fan Unbreakable was tailored made perfectly for him.  Though I'm half the comic book fan he is, I concur with that assessment enough to confidently invoke it hear.  If you truly love comic books, Unbreakable is your film.  If you are not a lover of comic books, then try to walk into this film expecting little action and you shouldn't be disappointed.<br /><br />It can be argued that Shyamalan has lost his way in recent years, although he does retain his technical prowess even now.  Nevertheless, Unbreakable is still a joy to watch and is a shining example of Shyamalan during his most inspired and generative phase.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>I suspect my grade will go up in time -- this movie, like &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; requires a bit of thinking about after it's over. <p>And, also like &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; it's hard to talk about this movie due to the risk of saying too much. <p>I will say this, as it occurs in the first 15 seconds of the movie, before even the credits begin: The film opens with a discussion of comics in America today, with text talking about the number of issues sold, how many hours a comic collector will read comics in their lifetime, and so on. <p>&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is a movie about superheroes. Sort of. <p>This isn't a gritty &quot;real life superheroes&quot; in the vein of &quot;The Watchmen.&quot; For all its dark sets and whispered dialogue, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; has more in common with &quot;gosh wow&quot; comics than it does grim 'n gritty stuff. That's only natural, since the movie is about hope and the possibility that there are, among us ... well, to say more would be to give it away, although I suspect most people can guess. <p>As with &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; there is a twist at the end, but it's not the key to the whole movie, unlike in the previous film. <p>And, as with &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; the movie is more than a clever concept and good writing, although it has both. Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright Penn and that little boy -- I was almost expecting Haley Joel Osment in this -- all do outstanding work, making what could be flat characters into real people. For all of the comic book tropes at work here -- the alliterative name of the protagonist, the uniform he wears that gives him a classic silhouette, and so on -- the film never feels like a gag or a gimmick, and it's the quality work of the actors that elevates it away from schticky territory. <p>This is absolutely the smartest, most mature comic book movie ever, and a film for even those who find comic book movies abhorent to begin with. <p>Thoughtful, thought-provoking and a film well worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan faced a formidable task in delivering a follow-up to his last outing, "The Sixth Sense," which was a remarkable film; and his attempt at capturing that same quality and integrity in his latest effort has resulted in a film that, while it does not surpass "Sense," is nothing less than it's equal.  Beginning with a screenplay that is brilliant in concept, content and structure, and realized with equal acuity,  "Unbreakable," starring Bruce Willis, is a unique, challenging film that will test the limits of audience perception like never before.  From the cryptic opening scene to the denouement, this is enthralling drama that offers singular insight into the dark capabilities of human nature, and a perspective of evil never before suggested in any movie in the history of the cinema.  Conan Doyle said there's nothing new under the sun, and that may be true; other films may have dealt with similar themes, but the approach Shyamalan takes here is entirely original.  Shyamalan approaches his material like a quiet, unobtrusive Hitchcock, resulting in a style that is quite his own.  His pace is deliberate, and information is doled out in subtle, measured proportions which affords the discerning viewer a chance to  place the myriad pieces of the puzzle into proper order as the story unfolds.  It's a mystery that refuses to let you off the hook, and demands that you think about what is actually going on without respite.  To say that this is thought provoking material would be an understatement; it's an intricate story, the plot of which is complemented by equally complex characters who are detailed and extremely well written and developed.  As he did in "The Sixth Sense," Bruce Willis proves once again that there is so more to him as an actor than being just an action hero.  His portrayal of David Dunn, a man facing a transitional period in his life, is played with a staid countenance that successfully reflects the inner turmoil of the character.  You know from the outset that there is something going on beneath the surface; something unsettling for which Dunn is seeking resolution.  When he becomes the only survivor of a train wreck, it adds to the irresolution in his life as he is suddenly confronted with new issues that take him into still deeper, uncharted waters.  Willis gives a performance that is understated with nuance and depth, and gives Dunn a sense of controlled distress with which the audience can readily identify; that unknown, intangible something that one can feel, yet which remains elusive and unnamed.  It's a powerful statement that illustrates the thin line between reality and the surreal.  Samuel L. Jackson gives a strong performance as well, as Elijah Price, victim of a congenital disease that renders his existence fragile in the extreme.  It's a sympathetic character that somehow refutes sympathy; and Jackson has a presence that makes Elijah real and believable, which is pivotal, as his infirmity is integral to the plot, as is the fact that he and Dunn represent opposite ends of the vast spectrum of life.  Effective in a lesser, yet still significant role, is Robin Wright Penn (Audrey Dunn), who fleshes out the disarray of a wife dealing with the emotional absence of her husband.  The supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn), Charlayne Woodard (Elijah's Mother) and, in a cameo, M. Night Shyamalan (Stadium Drug Dealer).  With "Unbreakable," Shyamalan has taken up the gauntlet and emerged victorious, with an intelligent, entertaining film so profound that it will no doubt become one of the most under-appreciated films of all time.  There is simply a depth to it that will soar beyond the grasp of the casual viewer; few films have such substance and vision.  Like a Monet, this is art that is both impressionistic and invaluable; a true original in every aspect, and a testimony to the talents of M. Night Shyamalan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>In the aftermath of a terrible train wreck, a man finds himself with nary a scratch in the midst of all the devastation, the corpses and the detritus. The only survivor, this seemingly ordinary man David Dunn (Bruce Willis), living a crumbling marriage and working mundanely as a security guard, comes to realize that he is very different from other people. He has never been hurt in his life, has never even had a cold. He meets an intense, strange, brittle-boned man, Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), who informs him that superheroes have always existed in one guise or another, and that David is one such - that David is, in fact, an archetype. David undergoes a  journey of self-discovery as he strives to challenge the limits of his powers, and figure out where he fits in, in a world that has become suddenly eschewed. But Elijah Price also sees himself as an archetype, and not that of a superhero...and that the roles of superhero and -villain must be played out.<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan unveils his love for the genre with the film's implementation of his very heady concept: what if superheroes walked the earth? Unbreakable plumbs the comic book mythology and delves into the pop psychology of the superhero phenomenon. M. Night's conceit is that the archetypes of the Hero and the Villain have always been around, but now have been channeled into contemporary comic book superhero sensibilities. Shyamalan has his "superhero" follow the classic pattern as David Dunn runs the gamut of shocking discovery, the search for existential meaning, the quest for his rightful place in the world and finally, his acceptance of his unique seemingly pre-determined role. In the climactic scenes, David's shapeless poncho somewhat becomes a symbol of this acceptance, becoming, in fact, his superhero costume.<br /><br />The dependable Bruce Willis invests his role with his trademark, career-making everyday man persona and brings home a sense that, yes, this is how a Regular Joe would react to such unusual circumstances. I always relish when he takes the minimalist road as his acting choice (though his mouthy and brash Moonlighting and Blind Date persona is also fun). Either way, he's believable. Samuel Jackson's assured Elijah provides a very good foil for Willis's stoic David. The ever cool Jackson can be relied on to always bring in the noise, the funk and the bravado. Robin Wright Penn's character is nicely miserable but hopeful and should've been more involved in the proceedings. And, while I understand Shyamalan's need to inject a kid character into the story - to symbolize and convey the innocence and wonder of the comic book theme - the kid actor he finds ends up being cloying and annoying.<br /><br />Good or bad, Shyamalan goes the gloom and doom route. There is a sense of prevailing glumness to Unbreakable, a certain somberness to the music, a moroseness to the look and the atmosphere of the film. It infects David's dreary, humdrum life and his on-the-outs relationship with his wife. The pace is plodding, the action pieces far apart. In the special features, M. Night mentions that he had originally conceptualized the film in three stages: David's discovery of his inhuman abilities, his  several encounters with sundry crooks and villains, and, finally, his mega face-off with a worthy supervillain. But M. Night admits he didn't "feel" the last two segments and altered the storyline to this more bleak version. Shyamalan is earnest in his writing and directing effort but *sigh* I wish he'd found a happy medium between his original concept and the version with which he ended. He shoots for the grandiose moments and almost, almost gets there. But not quite. Still, I admire his sincerity and great effort and I was entertained enough to recommend this film: 3 and a half stars.<br /><br />Unbreakable's special features include:<br /><br /> - Additional scenes with an intro by M. Night.<br /> - An in-depth "Behind the Scenes" feature.<br /> - "Comic Books and Superheroes" - a fascinating feature delving into the superhero/comic book mythos with avid fan Sam Jackson, the great Will Eisner, Scott McCloud, Alex Ross, Denny O'Neil, Michael Chabon and Frank Miller (Eisner talks about the origin of his Spirit hero).<br /> - A multi-angled feature on the train station sequence.<br /> - An excerpt from "Millionaire" - an amusing early film endeavor of a younger M. Night in a fight scene with two kids.<br /> - 2 collectible but forgettable illustrations by comic book artist Alex Ross.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>I was searching around here on amazon.com and wanted to look at some lists compiled by people, with their favorite movies on here...well, came across this little gem, and thought that I would check it out.

While Sixth Sense was a character drama with a supernatural touch, Unbreakable is a mysterious history with continuous growing suspense.<br /><br />Unbreakable tries to present to us, in the most realistic way possible, David and Elijah's journey towards the discovery of something "greater", beyond the human understanding, about "that quality" that makes some people different from the rest of humanity.<br /><br />Faith, coincidence and the presence of a sixth sense are constant subjects in this story, where two men opposed in many ways - physically, intellectually and philosophically- must learn to develop their instincts and to discover their mission in life. The atmosphere in the movie is less than chilling, full of anticipation and surprises.<br /><br />Using like reference the worlds displayed in heroes stories like Superman, Spiderman and such, Shyamalan tries to make us understand that the latter are not mythical stories where good faces evil, but human efforts to explain the very nature of the evil.<br /><br />The cinematographic style applied to the film maintains an involving and realistic tone: the images are deep, full of important actions; the sequences are long, full of sorrow, tension and complexity. The narrative is absorbent.<br /><br />While the central characters and their complicated emotional maps are exposed, we get caught by the unusual world the movie displays. Bruce Willis reflects a wide emotional turbulence as the reticent man who has to accept his destiny, while Jackson is magnetic like the man full of fantastic theories, worthy of a lunatic who has just escaped an asylum.<br /><br />Once again, Shyamalan demonstrates that he is a brilliant film director. Imaginative, able to surprise, confuse and please our expectations. His work in the direction keeps exploring new ways; his eagerness in the details is admirable.<br /><br />An unexpected end, although not as surprising as the one in Sixth Sense, will leave you with the sensation that Shyamalan, without no impudence, has made fun of us again. Everything what we thought we knew about heroes and villains will not be worth anything while we pleasantly discover the secrets Unbreakable hides.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Before the superhero genre became really popular with X-Men, Spiderman, Hulk and Daredevil, Unbreakable slipped onto the scene with a truly fascinating look at the possibility of Superheroes and comic books being a form of modern mythology.<br /><br />Now before you completely discount this movie for being anything like the other Superhero movies, let me reassure you that the approach on this subject is so strictly geared toward being realistic you could very much believe the premise.  The best part is that the `hero' doesn't even know he is a hero.<br /><br />In an intelligent move on his part, M. Night Shyamalan reveals almost nothing about the movie except for the phrase stated in the trailers, `There is a train wreck, there is one survivor, and he is miraculously unharmed.'  With this statement we are intrigued.  How did he survive?  Not even a scratch?  How?<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays the survivor, David Dunn, a seemingly normal individual with a bad marriage and non-communicative relationship with his son and wife.  Immediately after the wreck he is approached by a strange individual; Elijah Price, superbly played by Samuel L. Jackson.  He states his case to Dunn, revealing to him his lack of illnesses in his lifetime and the fact that subconsciously he chose a profession as a security guard.  He lays out everything with dead on seriousness and conviction.  Intrestingly, Price has a condition of brittle bones that causes them break in even the mildest of impacts.  This is what made him seek out Dunn, their stark contrasts.<br /><br />As events unfold we find out along with Dunn as he discovers he can do things he never dreamed or tried.  Shyamalan smartly tones it down in order to keep us on board.  Dunn doesn't go out and suddenly lift a car over his head.  He finds that as he works out, he can add more and more weight to the bench press.  He struggles a bit, but eventually manages to lift over 900 pounds.<br /><br />This kind of realistic discovery about himself and the enlightenment of his own abilities starts to change his own life.  He seems to find purpose, or at least importance in what who he is.  The dichotomy of his character and Elijah truly comes to a head in the finale.  This movie is slow paced thriller, with a dramatic story and a twist that is worthy of the Sixth Sense.  There is nothing in Unbreakable that would make you predict the ending of this one.  Highly recommended, a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>There are some out in the world that say that comic-books are humanities? last great link to the ancient art form of expressing messages and stories through pictures. Since the dawn of human civilization when cavemen drew on walls to showcase fantastic, possibly even exaggerated, achievements of the people of the era, man has sought to express stories of ?heroes?, whether they be true or legendary, through the use of pictures so that other people in their travels through the land would know of that person?s great achievements and spread them throughout the tribes. In the centuries that would follow, this method of communication would be passed down to the ancient Egyptians who would develop the pictorial language which they would use the walls of their temples to tell the legends of their gods and their deceased rulers. Even to this very day this language art form can be found in the average comic-book shop but the surge of comic-book franchises quickly being adapted to the big screen can lead to its demise, with more interested in the aspect of profits rather then the messages their art expresses.<br /><br />The story centers on a man whose survival from a tragic train accident begins to unravel a mystery into who he actually is and what he was destined to do with his life. While on a train ride from New York, which he had gone to seeking a higher-profile security position, to his home town of Philadelphia, David Dunne contemplates on his life and wonders why he has this inscrutable feeling of sadness, one of which he finds himself with each and every day of his life ever since a near-fatal car accident years ago brought a direct halt to his college football career. With a flash, David finds himself lying on a bed within a hospital with no clear understanding of how he got there. After receiving strange looks from doctors and nurses checking in on him, David discovers that he is the lone survivor of a tragic train accident that took the lives of one hundred and thirty-one people. Not only that but after careful examination there appears to be not a single scratch, bruise, or mark on David?s body. David begins to fall deeper into seclusion and sadness contemplating on why he alone survived the train accident but so many more fortunate innocents did not. Why was he special? After attending a memorial offered to those who died in train accident, David discovers a note on the windshield of his car that asks the question, ?How many days of your life have you been sick?? After meeting with the mysterious Elijah Price, who Dunne first dismisses as a man who?s sickness (low protein that makes he?s bones easily breakable) has taken over his sanity, David takes the opportunity his survival from the train accident has given him to patch up the relationship with his wife and son. But the more David puts off the eccentric comic-book curator, Elijah Price, the more the truth behind the great mysteries of his life is revealed to him, in that the David may be one of the great ?superheroes? Elijah?s comic books once harkened about. The story for Unbreakable may not have had quite the impact director/writer M. Night Shyamalan had been hoping for in its initial release and that may be attributed to the fact that it was created well before its proper time. For those who witness the magnificence of this film will find its thought-provoking concepts of heroes and villains, both in the comic-book world and how those are reflected in every day life, absolutely chilling, more so when one factors in the film?s pre-9/11 release.<br /><br />As with most M. Night Shyamalan films, the cast of Unbreakable, namely those who?s screen time consisted of more then a mere cameo in the film?s nearly two hour timeframe, is remarkably limited with the course of the film?s story centralized on the actions of two characters that of Bruce Willis? David Dunne and Samuel L. Jackson?s Elijah Price. Bruce Willis? performance is nothing short of spectacular but even that heap of praise may be selling his role short. In essence, Willis takes on the type of role his co-star in The Sixth Sense, Haley Joel Osment, dealt with, that being a character that is so sensationally challenging and complex that only the most talented of actors can pull off the role. Not only does Willis have the play the role of the victim early on in the film but he has to seamlessly transition from that aspect to that of the rising hero by the film?s end, which not easy to do in any film and even more difficult with a script as intricate as Shyamalan?s. Samuel L. Jackson does a magnificent job in the role of Elijah Price, the mysterious comic-book artwork curator who uses his knowledge of the comic-book universe to reveal to David Dunne his true identity. The reason his role works as well as it does is the way both Willis and Jackson play off each other and how the character, while in the process of helping Dunne realize who he is, hints at the secret identity he has held back from everyone including himself. The only complaint came from Robin Wright Penn?s role as the wife of David Dunne, none of which concerned her particular portrayal of the character but rather the way she was scripted. Either she?s too whiny or she?s sitting idly in the background contributing nothing to move the story along. If were given more to do or she had a greater impact on who David Dunne will become by the end of the film, we would care more about her character but that doesn?t exist in the film audiences are seeing now.<br /><br />Overall, Unbreakable was greatly underappreciated at the time of its late 2000 release but since then the traumatic events that occurred on September 11th, 2001, as well as the realization that America is, and has been, in a war to combat terrorism, not only in our country but abroad, have made this film of greater significance to see in this time of our nation?s history. Triggered by those events, Americans have awakened to the truth, much in the same way David Dunne did, that ?there are extraordinary things inside themselves, as well as others? and we need not look far and wide to find ?supermen? when they live amongst us in our daily lives. Shyamalan demonstrates an increasing sense of maturity both in the script?s sophisticated dialogue as well as in the style in which he sets the complex group of characters. The rising director never ceases to amaze his audiences with the haunting atmospheres in which he set his films and the driving messages he invokes within in each and every one of them. All that can be said about this film is that it the Shyamalan?s best film to date, though Signs does come pretty closes to matching up with it based on overall satisfaction and quality. For those who have been significantly effected by the events of September 11th, whether you be a family member of a victim or simply another average American horrified watching the aftermath, Unbreakable the definitive film to raise your hopes and show to you that there are ?heroes? all around us, some whom need only to know it within themselves for that ?hero? aspect to find its way through their actions.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>Ah, the dreaded ?sophomore project?.  Director M. Night Shyamalan?s second big feature film had me hoping for the best but fearing that the typical pattern would prove true with Unbreakable.  This time the director explores the transcultural hero mythos, which according to the film?s logic is preserved in our modern culture through comic book stories.<br /><br />David Dunn is a security guard with a wife and kid in a big city.  He seems quite ordinary, and probably never would have suspected the truth about himself until a key event changed his life forever:  he survived a devastating train wreck.  In fact, he was the only survivor, unscathed.  There is no logical explanation for how he escaped a mutilating death, and from that point on he is on a mission to track down the answer to Why.  In the process, he meets a rare comic book dealer who explains the universal structure of the guardian/hero archetype told through stories around the world:<br /><br />Heroes ? appears ordinary to the world, but cannot be killed by ordinary means, exceptionally strong; life?s work is to protect the weak and innocent of his time.<br /><br />Villains ? opposite of the hero, but often very close to him, best friends even; life?s purpose is destruction and/or domination. It becomes clear that David was indeed born to be a hero ? but then, who is his opposite terrorizing the city anonymously?<br /><br />I though Unbreakable was a nicely shot in a moody, Film Noir style.  Solid performance by Bruce Willis, who is so very well-cast as an Everyman type who wakes up one day to realize who he really was all his life.  Samuel L. Jackson is his unforgettable counterpart Elijah, the comic bookstore owner -- superbly played. Just slightly slow pacing drags the plot a bit in places, but it is redeemed by a nice twist or two.  I would say that overall, this was a much better-than-average sophomore project for M. Night.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the dark and speculative genre.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>This one changed my opinion of Shyamalan.  I dismissed this guy as a total schmuck who found fame in making a movie that [take] the entire plot to "Carnival Of Souls"(and "Jacob's Ladder" in a way).  I don't want to get off on my essay on all the reasons why "The Sixth Sense" was rotten, but I want you all to understand that I HATED Shyamalan about as much as I hate Don Henley(and that's alot).  Well, after his success with "The Sixth Sense", he could have gone on to do just about any movie he wanted.  Instead of making some multi-million dollar CGI filled, action packed "scary" film, he hits us with this bizarre little thriller that almost ventures into David Lynch territory.  I'm not saying that I now like Syamalan based soley on that principal..... I really did like this movie.  Sure, it's slow moving(but the best movies usually are), there aren't jump-out-of-your-seat moments every five minutes, and (this is debatable) there isn't anything really supernatural about it.  I guess I can see why people were let down by this.  I'm sure everyone was expecting this to be another "Sixth Sense" or even to top it.  Everyone seems to love that film more (God only knows why), but "Unbreakable", in my opinion, was a pretty clever piece of work.  At least it didn't [resemble] the plot of an older (and much better) horror film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>After surviving a horrific train crash, the only sole survivor is David Dunn (Bruce Willis in a underrated performance) came out of the train crash without a single scratch in him.

THis is a good movie with good acting and good direction, a different plot (ok, different plots may sometimes be silly, but it's cool to see something different). By the wasy, I like comic books.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>How are heroes born? What if the hero doesn't know he's a hero? What role does evil place in the birth of good? More importantly, can a heroic type of good exist without an equally strong, deep evil to fight against? All these themes have been explored for decades by comic book writers and artists. But I don't think any movie has fully explored the dark reality of superheroes and villians (and their identity crises) as well as Unbreakable. Yes, as many have complained, this movie has a dark, brooding side and it moves rather slowly. But I'd argue that is only fitting for a movie which explores two men (portrayed by Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson) who haven't realized who they are and what parts they play in each others' lives - not to mention the world at large. Only when they meet each other do they begin to fulfill their destinies. Until then, they are rather lost and a certain somberness seems appropriate. If you pay close attention, however, you'll notice that the serious, dark colors at the beginning of the movie change to lighter, brighter colors. And do keep your eye on the colors in each scene; they lead the way to even greater revelations. I will warn you that this movie is NOT for those who want constant action and thrills. This one forces you to think and it often goes rather slowly, giving the viewer a chance to fully appreciate every detail. I plan to watch it again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NVM7IAPF2NS.html">A17NVM7IAPF2NS</a><br/><p>First and foremost, let me get this off my chest:  PLEASE, PLEASE STOP PUTTING THIS UP AGAINST THE SIXTH SENSE!!  Doing that is nearly as inane as saying, &quot;Well, Spielberg directed 'Duel', so 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' has to be the same kind of film.&quot;<p>Now, with that out of the way, let me say that this is a DIFFICULT film to review.  I wanted to give it 3 stars based on the film's &quot;shaky&quot; storyline, but 5 stars for its breathtaking idea of taking a classic story and trying to mold it into the REAL world.  A superhero in our society?  How would that work?  How would he discover his powers?  In this light, the film works beautifully in terms of self-doubt on Bruce Willis' part and almost religious fervor on Samuel Jackson's.  And let's face it...it tries to delve a little more into a human being becoming a superhero based on knowledge and character as opposed to &quot;Super *whatever* one day stumbles into a radioactive factory, has these powers, and for some inexplicable reason finds himself compelled to do good for everyone!&quot;<p>However, the plot jolts around a little while and one almost feels compelled to bang your head against the screen and tell Bruce Willis to &quot;get on with it!&quot;  Still, once one comes back to earth and realizes that the story IS supposed to take place in the real world, it becomes a little more plausible--as plausible as fictitious superheroes get.<p>Enjoy the film!  It's not the strongest story and the ending is a little bit on &quot;ehhhh...&quot; side, but it is groundbreaking in its premise.<p>Best image in the entire film--Samuel Jackson's cane breaking...that is a shot that won't leave my mind!</p></br><a href="../users/A29IYGR7SNPRIV.html">A29IYGR7SNPRIV</a><br/><p>I'm a Bruce Willis fan&Ntilde;not always, but most of the time. I'm also a Samuel L. Jackson fan. And I loved The Sixth Sense. So now comes Unbreakable, with a premise that is wonderful. Our culture is bereft of Heroes and we're offered, in the best comic book tradition, a wary, unwilling, unwitting hero. Willis's performance in this film (as it was in The Sixth Sense) is just a splendidly controlled one; and Jackson, as always, is never less than completely watchable. As the ultimate &quot;breakable&quot; man, Jackson is angry, inscrutable, and brilliant.<p>The director has a wonderful feel for children, for their fears and sensitivities; and Spencer Treat Clark turns in a fine performance as Willis's son, as does Robin Wright Penn as his long-suffering wife.<p>Ninety percent of this film is highly compelling. The viewer anxiously, eagerly accompanies Willis along the path to recognition of his &quot;super&quot; powers, at the urging of cartoon connoisseur Jackson. We arrive at a satisfactory climax where our hero's powers get tested. It's a strong, chilling sequence. And then, splat, the whole thing falls to pieces with an entirely unbelievable ending. Sadly, it's all too obvious that the director, M. Night Shyamalan, just couldn't think of a viable resolution for the tale he'd constructed. And that's a pity, because this could have been a great film but ends up as a misfire. None the less, the film is worth seeing for its intriguing and unique premise and for the fine performances of everyone involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>For a movie like this, picture and sound are paramount to enjoying this, and the transfer on this DVD is exceptional.  I also enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes, and the little documentaries on the subject matter that makes up &quot;Unbreakable&quot;.  I have to confess I didn't see this film when it was in theatres, and for the most part, people I talked to who did see it were pretty divided. One of the things that impressed me about &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was that it didn't stay in a conventional genre.  It's not really a drama, a thriller, or even a comic-book type film.  The performances are solid and the ending (while being somewhat abrupt, and being a major punching bag in the negative reviews of this film) works just fine.  It's a flawed, but impressive film nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>In the summer of 1999, Disney released a movie written and directed by a little know director named M. Night Shyamalan. Studio executives hoped that the movie, a supernatural thriller, would perform well and make a profit. To their surprise and delight, it became a smash hit all around the world. The movie was The Sixth Sense. As you most likely know, it was about a child psychologist [Bruce Willis] who tried to help a young boy [Haley Joel Osment] who claimed to see dead people. In his newest movie, Unbreakable, Mr. Shyamalan again returns to the occult with a spooky tale about a man who is a super hero and doesn't know it. <p>Bruce Willis again stars. This time he is David Dunn, a mild-mannered, frequently depressed guy who works as a security guard in Philadelphia. As the movie opens, he is returning home on a train. He gets an odd feeling, and the next thing he knows, there is a terrible wreck. He is the only passenger who survives. His wife and son are ecstatic. Not only he is alive, he has escaped without a scratch. The fact remains that David and his wife, Audrey [Robin Wright Penn], are planning to divorce. The train trip was for a job interview in New York City. Though estranged from Audrey, David is exceptionally close to his son, Joseph [Spencer Treat Clark]. The impending separation is tearing everyone apart.<p>Leaving a memorial service for the victims, David finds a note engraved with the words "Limited Edition". Inside, someone has written, "How many times in your life have you been sick?" He traces the note to a chic art gallery that specializes in comic book art. The note was written by the owner, Elijah [Samuel L. Jackson], a strange and slightly ominous man who suffers from a genetic disease that causes his bones to be brittle and to break easily. It is he who thinks that David is more than he appears to be. Elihah tells him he may be someone with special powers, someone who can tap into the forces of good in order to fight evil. Naturally, David thinks Elijah is a nut case. He even orders Joseph, who as accompanied him, not to drink the water Elijah has given him. Yet he also senses something in what Elijah has said. Soon, odd things start to happen, and David finally realizes that the answer to Elijah's question is that he has never been sick a day in his life. But what does this fact, as well as recent events, mean? And what is Elijah's interest in it?<p>There are many similarities here to The Sixth Sense, including a surprise ending. For several reasons, Unbreakable doesn't work quite as well. It has many interesting elements, including lots of references to comic book heroes. There is a theme involving water that is excellent. The photography and the set decoration are impeccable. The cast is great. But Unbreakable is even more dark and brooding than The Sixth Sense, its pace is slower, and its ending is even more far fetched. As a result, many viewers will find it less enjoyable. I don't think this is all Shyamalan's fault. When your last picture was a boxoffice phenomenon, it truly is a tough act to follow.<p>I was intrigued to discover that the director's next project, Signs, is about a farm couple who finds mysterious crop circles in their fields. The supernatural theme continues. Wouldn't it be great if Shyamalan turned out to be the next Alfred Hitchcock by devoting himself to just one genre or theme? I thought of this while watching Unbreakable because, after all, even movies by The Master of Suspense varied greatly in success, both artistically and commercially. It was the body of work by Hitchcock that was important, and I hope the same proves true of Mt. Shyamalan.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Unbreakable, simply put, is the best PG-13 movie that I have ever seen. Period.<br /><br />The first time I saw this movie was a couple of years ago right after watching the sixth sense. The sixth sense was good with a shocker of an ending but was overated. Now comes Unbreakable, a movie in a so called trilogy, but this obviously got cancelled once everyone hated it. Well, I can't agree with that. And, I can't sit back while this movie gets criticized. Give me 0 out of 567777777 helpful votes, I don't care. I need to get my point across.<br /><br />First of all, PG-13 movies are horrible. End of story. The only good ones are the comedies. SOMETIMES ONLY THOUGH. After that, well, it's crap. The action movies are horrible with nonstop explosions and horrible acting. Simply put, well, if you look in my top 50 movies of all time (which I find to be veryaccurate), there are probably ZERO PG-13 movies. Only R. Why? Because R movies are realistic, and it's there that I can find the powerful dramas and the eye popping action movies. But wait what's this? Unbreakable, a PG-13 movie in my top 50? Scary. But true. I am very dissapointed that this movie didn't fare well because it gives all. It is a powerful movie, with excellent acting, and a fantastic ending. The plot is remarquable and finally something original. I found the movie to be very well made, with wonderful directing and writing. The actors are all connected and are great together. As for the plot, wow, it's amazing. The movie is about a man played by Bruce Willis that survives a horrific train crash. Without any injury. Without a scratch. Meet Elijah played by the always wonderful Samuel L. Jackson who does as usual an excellent job. He is very breakable, with a very serious problem that makes him very vulnerable to injuries. He is an avid comic book collector and when he hears of the crash and one survivor, he knows that he is a superhero. Like in his comic books. Of course he is crazy. Right?<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic and has great chemistry with Bruce Willis. The movie has a very unpredictable ending (oh I'm sorry that I'm not as smart as the one reviewer who had it predicted in the first 5 minutes. ? He didn't even have the wreck in the first 5 minutes! We didn't even meet Elijah yet! And you want action, right? This isn't an action movie!)<br /><br />The movie had a very good moral and had a deeper meaning I found to be very intersting.<br /><br />This trully is a wonderful and compelling movie that I adore. And for a movie fan like me, this is just what I've been looking for.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>But oh Lordy was the dialogue bad. I mean very, very, very bad. Bad to the point that my cousin my girlfriend and me almost walked out. Also it took quite while for anything to happen. But when it did it was kind of worth it. And being a comic book fan myself I appreciated it more than most.<p>I think it was a good idea for M. Night Shyamalan to film this movie in widescreen. As you probably know from my other reviews, I hate 1.85:1. The Sixth Sense was made this way and I found it very irritating. Also, this film was way better than Sixth Sense and I found the twist to be more wholesome and pleasing.<p>The kid who plays Willis' son looked uncannily like Haley Joel Osmet and Samuel L. Jackson made a BIG mistake with the afro. But his performance was still good. It's good to see that actors and directors take comic books seriously as authentic literature rather than classifying them as "geeky" things. For that I like the movie despite the abominable dialogue.<p>The DVD is in Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 2.35:1.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>After M. Night Shyamalan's huge hit &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; he could do anything he wanted.  What he chose was an earlier story idea he had that is essentially a reworking of basic plot elements of his previous smash.  <p>&quot;UNBREAKABLE&quot; springs from a flimsy premise about comic book heroes existing in real life.  It's a dark, grim, but sometimes absorbing metaphysical mystery about an ordinary blue collar guy, Bruce Willis again, who encounters himself and his nemesis (Samuel L. Jackson) as he attempts to restore his troubled marriage and maintain a bond with his sometimes nutty kid (who wants to shoot him to see if he's really an &quot;unbreakable&quot; superhero).  <p>The sumptuous two disc set includes an unusually muted widescreen transfer with a rich but repetitive sound design.  A ton of extras including &quot;Comic Books and Superheroes&quot; with Jackson.  Nice fold-out packaging but disappointing content.  Rent before you buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>As both a writer and a director, M. Night Shyamalan is attempting to bring a whole new sensibility to American moviemaking.  Unlike most filmmakers who dabble in the "horror film" genre, Shyamalan eschews sensationalism and gore in favor of understatement, subtlety and indirection, preferring that we, in the audience, be given room to conjure up our own demons rather than having the filmmaker do it for us. The characters in his films drift like somnambulists through worlds drained of sound, color and emotion - and where the fine line between the normal and the abnormal, the natural and the supernatural, the real and the surreal is vague and easily crossed.<p>Shymalan scored a major critical and commercial success in 1999 with "The Sixth Sense," a film so brilliantly conceived and executed that it cried out for multiple viewings - the first time to be amazed and dazzled by the sheer ingeniousness of the multileveled plotting, the second to study retroactively just how intricately each plot element fell into place, catching us unawares the first time around.  <p>It is natural that Shyamalan should have tried to duplicate that success in his next film, using virtually the same stylistic elements and the same leading man, Bruce Willis, as he did in "The Sixth Sense."  Unfortunately, "Unbreakable" fails to live up to the quality of the earlier film. For one thing, "The Sixth Sense" really WENT someplace - it built and built to an infinitely satisfying resolution.  "Unbreakable," for all its admirable stylistic flourishes, simply leads us to a dead end - nay, worse, a conclusion that is absurd, undeveloped and thoroughly unsatisfying.  <p>Shyamalan's subdued narrative and visual style needs a solid dramatic core to attach itself to.  Here, however, he never finds it.  Willis plays a character almost too similar to the one he portrayed in "The Sixth Sense" - a brooding, taciturn man who seems to wander through life in a perpetual emotionless fog of detachment and depression.  David Dunn, a man caught in what appears to be a loveless, deteriorating marriage, is the sole survivor of a Philadelphia train wreck.  Already we are alerted to "Sixth Sense" parallels, so much so that we begin to subconsciously suspect that this might indeed be a sequel of sorts to the previous film.  Actually, it isn't, but rest assured there is something "not quite right" about this man, although the revelation of what it is has no where near the kick provided by the earlier work.  After his miraculous escape, David is contacted by Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, a man suffering from a strange genetic illness that causes his bones to shatter like glass and who becomes convinced that David may be his alter ego, i.e. a man immune from injury and disease.  This premise, based on a built-in dichotomy (just as "The Sixth Sense" was built on the dichotomy of life and death), also tries to explore the twin dichotomies of good vs. evil and hero vs. villain, but the context in which the filmmakers launch their exploration - the world of comic books of all things - robs the film of much of its potential profundity.  We just can't take Willis very seriously when he is wandering stoically around the city, clad in a hooded sweatshirt, like some sort of "super hero" on Prozac, saving innocent victims from the clutches of evildoers whose purposes he senses when he brushes up against them in crowds (the tag line for this film could well be "I see criminals").  <p>Thus, without a decent story to tell, the film turns out to be all style and no substance.  What was artistry in "The Sixth Sense" becomes artiness here.  Even clever visual motifs - like showing us many images upside down first, then right side up or having only the bad guys dressed in bright colors so that they stand out against the muted grays of everyone else - become sheer artifice with no thematic purpose behind them.  <p>"Unbreakable," for all its beauty of atmosphere and tone, leaves us bewildered, frustrated and unsatisfied.  Shyamalan is definitely a talent worth nurturing.  Let's hope next time he can once again find that perfect marriage between form and content that he hit upon so brilliantly in "The Sixth Sense."  We need adventurous filmmakers like him around.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>I loved THE SIXTH SENSE, and Shamalayan's take on the possibilities of actual superheroes in our midst ( and our present society's fixation on such an improbability ) in UNBREAKABLE was presented in such a low-key ( some might scoff, and say 'simplistic' ) fashion that one almost wishes that the premise were true. Willis and Jackson as the main protagonists in the film deliver some quite nuanced performances, and the atmospheric camerawork, and subtle ratcheting of tension throughout the film built to a very decent ( and not overtly contrived ) conclusion. If not taken too seriously, UNBREAKABLE is quite engrossing, even thought-provoking, and well worth a second, or even a third viewing. Good stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>This was a five star film experience for me and the ending was as surprising as Vertigo. M.

B<br /><br />ut they weren't the first to use that -- M. Night Shyamalan tackled in in "Unbreakable," an intensely geeky, eerie thriller about a man who discovers that he is a superhuman. It's full of solid acting and writing, but has a big fat letdown of an ending.<br /><br />A train derails, killing everyone on board -- except everyman David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who survives without a scratch. As he tries to deal with this, he is contacted by crippled comic book dealer Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), whose "glass" bones made him speculate: what if there were people at the opposite end of the spectrum -- real superheroes with great strength and powers, REAL "men of steel"?<br /><br />Realizing that he has never been sick or endangered (except when exposed to water), David begins to explore his newly-discovered strength and second sight, despite the harm it does to his fragile marriage, even saving others from criminals. But there's a sinister side to his discovery and the accident that caused him to explore his powers...<br /><br />"Superhero movie" usually makes you think of loads of colourful action and young hunky heroes. But Shyamalan takes the opposite approach -- a middle-aged Everyman hero with wife and kid, and the movie is cloaked in shadowy camerawork, not much action at all and eerie, overquiet dialogue. Still it's very geeky, and very intelligent.<br /><br />Instead of action, "Unbreakable" devotes itself to the mythic qualities of superheroes, and David's slow awakening to his own abilities. Rather than his usual suspense, Shyamalan uses atmosphere to keep the plot captivating, giving it the feeling of a creepy intense dream. And since every superhero has to fight the baddies, he weaves in some tightly-choreographed, grimy fight sequences as David finally makes use of his superstrength.<br /><br />So what's the problem? Quite simply, the ending is a huge letdown -- while rationally it makes sense, David's actions at the climax leave you feeling, "That's it? That's all the 'unbreakable man' is going to do? What the?" And somehow it feels odd that a "supervillain" wouldn't really have any superabilities (or compensation for them) himself. Slight stumble there.<br /><br />Bruce Willis gives an excellent, understated performance as David, who longs for an indefinable something in his life, and slowly grows to realize that he is "unbreakable." Nice ordinary guy who turns out to be very extraordinary. But Jackson is even better as Elijah Price -- intense, passionate, and somewhat detached from the real world. His powerful personality balances out his frail body.<br /><br />Shyamalan goes into comic-book geek mode in in "Unbreakable," a slow-moving, suspenseful movie about a hero's awakening... that only stumbles in the final scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>This movie was interesting and unexpected.

Jackson, Robin Wright Penn, Spencer Treat Clark, Charlayne Woodard, Eamonn Walker, Leslie Stefanson, Johny Hiram Jamison, Michaelia Carroll.<br /><br />Running Time:  106 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements including some disturbing violent content, and for a crude sexual reference.<br /><br />M Night Shyamalan's eagerly awaited follow-up to the astonishing, genre-defining "The Sixth Sense" may not hit the heady heights of its predecessor, but it is still an intriguing film.  Bruce Willis (returning with Shyamalan after his stunning performance in "The Sixth Sense") is American everyman David Dunn. His marriage has fallen apart and he finds it hard to relate to his young son. After years as a security guard at the local football stadium, he goes to New York for a job interview. On the journey home, the train crashes at high speed. Dunn is the only survivor and emerges from the wreckage completely unscathed and something of a media celebrity.  His story is followed closely by local comic book enthusiast Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), an unhinged loner with a rare genetic disorder that makes him prone to broken bones. Price becomes convinced that Dunn is some kind of super-human, immune to pain or injury, and constantly pesters him about his history and lifestyle. It suddenly dawns on Dunn that he has never had a sick day or been injured in any way his whole life. He also has an uncanny knack of spotting potential trouble-makers and ne'er-do-wells at the football stadium. Price claims his choice of profession was borne of a subconscious desire to protect people and urges him to harness his powers in the conquest of evil, but Dunn is a reluctant superman. Despite an improvement in his relationship with his son (who is thrilled to have a comic book hero for a Dad) he remains unconvinced he is anything other than normal man (albeit a thick-skinned one).<br /><br />Obsessive comic book fans will probably not like the performance of a big wigged Jackson, wide-eyed stare and grandiose dialogue. Willis does his whispering trick again like he did in "The Sixth Sense" and sadly can't portray the emotional turmoil needed for a character like David. Much better are Clark and Penn as David's son and wife, both of whom find themselves questioning David as much as themselves,the atmosphere and tension are built up well and the obligatory twist at the end is well written and well disguised.  "Unbreakable" never fully hits its stride until the end but when it does, it proves to be a tense thriller full of the quasi-supernatural imagery that Shyamalan loves.  Not up to par with "Signs" or "The Sixth Sense", but certainly worth the gander.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>Immensely enjoyable, tightly presented, and even the edits are sensible.<br /><br />Usually, I find that at least some deleted scene is a studio ripout of a key scene. This was done so tightly, that it all made total sense; however, the sense also had an incredibly visceral side. The one element that sticks out in the worst possible way is the bone breaks that the baby, the child, and the adult, played by Jackson , goes through... kind of an OUUUUCH, that GOTTA  hurt, sort of feel.<br /><br />Most of the action seems to be about Willis's characters journey, however, in a very sudden twist, we discover that this is a journey of a dualistic kind.<br /><br />In many respects this is a reductionist version of a superhero style story.<br /><br />However you view it, this film will leave you with some degree of impact, and you will undoubtedly take sides. It is absolutely brilliant escapism.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Their are many theories as to why this film failed to have the impact that "The Sixth Sense" did with audiences.  I will be the first to admit that there was no way that M. Night Shyamalan could have caught lightning in the bottle with this film.  "The Sixth Sense" was a phenomenon and audience expectations were too high for this film.  I remember this film had a targeted Thanksgiving release date and it was probably rushed to theatres before the kinks in the story could have been ironed out.  It's obvious from the get-go where the story was going and the abrupt ending didn't help matters.  All that aside, I like this film alot.  Shyamalan is a master at mood and developing tension and it is apparent in this film.  Shyamalan does not so much copy the masters(Hitchcock and Spielberg) but pay homage to them.  Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson give superb performances here.  This is a good time to revisit this film now that it is divorced from the hype and expectations that it engendered on it's initial release.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>After the overrated yet average &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, Shyamalan presented another intriguing and different piece of cinema with this peculiar movie that gives a new perspective into superheroes` conventions. Bruce Willis returns for the role of the quiet, laid-back lead and shares the screen with Samuel L. Jackson`s enigmatic presence. Like the &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; also tells a mysterious slow paced story where and adult man has deep connections with a kid, but this time the plot is more interesting and original. The direction is terrific and certainly helps to create an absorbing and gripping mood and atmosphere, even if some scenes are too slow and unengaging. The score is adequate as well, as is the convincing and subtle acting. However, some energy wouldn`t hurt this movie, since it has few dynamic scenes given the overall slow rythm. And the ending is a bit anti-climatic and disappointing too, even if it provides a strange surprise. Still, for the most part &quot;Unbreakable&quot; works pretty well and suceeds as a very well-crafted and unusual story worth discovering. It`s also refreshing to watch a superhero that`s so distant from most of the cliches that are common within the genre.<p>Not a classic, just a good effort.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan has done three mainstream films. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; which is a rehash of a twist that we have seen before. &quot;Signs&quot; which is a homage to B-Movie films and &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. Unbreakable is Night's most original piece but actually has no meaning and there is nothing to take away from this one at all. However there is plenty you can BRING to it because of the nostalgia of Superhero movies of the past. Night does all of that here in a modern day reworking of these themes which is played out with a hint of realism. This sort of gives it more appeal and makes it less fantastic and thus closer to reality. I will not tell you the plot or anything about it because it will ruin it for you. When released the film was based on a &quot;man&quot; who is the &quot;soul-survivor&quot; of a &quot;trainwreck&quot;. There was no mention of Superheros when this film was released. <p>Now that it is tagged with that in the product description I think it is safe to say that this is a movie about a Superhero coming to terms with his own powers in the modern world. It is a good flick and well worth watching if you like the nostalgia of this theme. The film does work. The final twist does say ... &quot;Unbreakable 2&quot; but it is more or less there just to play with us a little and broaded the scope of the superhero theme. It is an interesting gimmick more than a plot twist here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>M. Night Shamalayan burst on to the scene with the incredible SIXTH SENSE.  He is obviously a young director/writer with a vivid imagination, and perhaps a little bit too much belief in his artistry.  His third film, &quot;Signs&quot; wasn't all that great, and this middle entry, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; suffers from too much artistic input.  Now that may sound crazy, but in watching the special feature in which Night discusses his deleted scenes, and especially in the inclusion of his first home movie, I felt that his ego is a little too much considering this movie.<br />I think the plot is very intriguing, and there are some wonderful shots, including the use of comic book colors to heighten the sense of unreality.  Bruce Willis and Spencer Treat Clark do a fantastic job in their roles; Willis is a lot better actor than many people credit him for.  Clark is an uncanny little actor, who can be seen in this year's excellent &quot;Mystic River.&quot;  I found three major problems:  first, Shamalayan over-utilized his &quot;from a distance&quot; shots.  There were too many of them where all this activity is going on in front of the leading characters and it served no purpose to me other than artistic experimentation.  The other two things wrong with this movie, for me, were the lackluster performances of both Samuel L. Jackson and Robin Wright Penn.  Jackson has yet to enthrall me with his acting (having watched &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Deep Blue&quot; recently.  Penn on the other hand has done some good work, but in this one, she seems unattached and disinterested.<br />&quot;Unbreakable&quot; is an entertaining movie, and it's ending is quite surprising, but pulling a punch at the end doesn't rescue this movie from its other flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>it was inevitable that, unless Shyalaman were to produce the best film of all time, his sophmore effort would not live up to the stunning Sixth Sense. But this film, while moving much slower, still produces a beautiful story that keeps the comic book idea within the realm of reality. our heroes and villians may not fly or call upon lightning, but they are still heroes and villians.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>Unbreakable could have been written as an episode for the Twilight Zone. Meaning, the story could have been told in 30 minutes.  All that was built up ends in a Twilight Zone type twist ending, yet it is a disappointing one.  The film making is stylish and moody, but the pacing is too slow. Also, the Samuel Jackson character as well as Spencer Treat Clark as Bruce Willis' son are hard to sympathize with.  I'm a comic book collector, and this movie did not put &quot;fanboys&quot; in a good light.  I think a lot of people were not impressed with this movie.  Just look in the Amazon.com &quot;Used MarketPlace&quot; and you'll see why.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>Unbreakable silently sneaked its way onto the big screen, then vaporized as if never there. Why?! Bruce Willis plays someone that is on the edge of loosing everything: his family. Though the topic of unfaithfullness is addressed you can tell that there is something truly devistating between his life, and his wife's (Robin Wright Penn). The once avid spark of love has fragmented and broken, and for this reason, he takes a train ride to get a new job in New York. If the job turns out, he is leaving his wife and son. It is on this train that something tragic, and wonderful happens. The train crashes, killing every passenger...except him. He survives without a scratch. Samuel L. Jackson plays a comic book dealer that is full of dark secrets, and knows after reading about Willis's survival in the train crash, that perhaps a life long search is over. Jackson is a character that has a disease in which he is very fragile, and breaks like glass. Maybe, just maybe, the survivor is his exact opposite. Someone that can withstand anything, and can't be sick, or injured. And, he believes, that superheroes could possibly exist. As he is fragile like glass, maybe there is someone on the other end of the spectrum that is unbreakable. <p>The reason Unbreakable is so important, is if in fact there is to be a trilogy about a hero, won't you wanna find out where he came from? What was his original drive? I think one day we will look back on this movie as the first superman, or matrix. The story behind the story. That does something great. It promises No Prequals, and No bloody six year wait, as in the Star Wars series. I recommend this movie for sixth sense fans, and to those of you who love a good surprise ending. And it helps if your tastes border on drama/thriller/suspense. After watching it once I bet you'll wanna watch it again. That to me is the first and foremost way to rate a movie...the re-watch factor. Once just ain't enough. Unbreakable taunts your brain and raises a lot of questions, and is entirely believable. As for other movies I had high hopes, but this time I wasn't let down. After you watch it you will probably roll the plot around in your mind and wonder whether or not you have ever been injured, sick, or broken... Well...have you?</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>Unbreakable is overwhelmingly underwhelming as a movie.  It has slow, deliberate pacing and takes itself far, far too seriously.  It took Bruce Willis an hour and eighteen minutes to even entertain the idea that he had special powers, when the viewer knew it from square one.  Knowing that this is an M. Night Shyamalan movie, viewers can expect a big twist of a pay-off at the end of the movie, and Shyamalan doesn't disappoint.  It's not clear if the journey is worth it, however.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>With all the hype to this movie, I thought it was going to be a top-notch thriller.  Instead I found a slow-paced movie for which I kept waiting for something occur.  Bruce Willis gives one of his sleepiest performances as a security guard,who has unbreakable bones and seems to be able to sense bad people.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is the opposite in that he was born with incredibly weak bones and goes through life constantly in and out of hospitals with fractures.  His one solace in life is comic books.  Jackson is obsessed with finding his opposite and he does this by looking for survivors of disasters.  He seeks out Willis, who is the sole survivor of a train wreck.  We later find out that Willis has never been sick and he may have survived some other disasters as well.<br /><br />You keep expecting Jackson to ask Willis for a bone marrow transplant or some other type operation to strengthen his bones but Jackson's motives are inspired by the comic books that hold his fascination.<br /><br />The director seemed to miss some opportunities in the movie.  We have a scene at the beginning, where Willis tries to pick-up his female seat mate on the train and then after the train wrecks, we know that she is dead so you later expect something more out of Willis and his feelings.<br /><br />Jackson also comes off as a loony throughout the film and you wonder why Willis ever talks to him at all.<br /><br />There is one brilliant scene, where Jackson is trying to sell a comic art print to a man and goes through the whole history behind the print.  At the end of Jackson's passionate rendition, the man says he will take the print to give to his 4-year old son (who obviously would have no sense as to the value of the print).  This infuriates Jackson enough to throw the man out of his store without selling him the print.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan followed &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; with this offbeat film. While this film does not even come close to the brilliance of &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;, it does hold it's own by itself. Bruce Willis stars as a family man whose marriage on the rocks. On a trip home on a train, the train is involved in a horrible accident. Everyone on board dies....except Willis. There's not a single scratch on him. He then begins to realize that he's never been sick, or has ever been really hurt. His son thinks he's some kind of superhero. Enter Samuel L. Jackson. He plays a comic book collector with a rare bone disease. His character tries to tell Bruce that he is indeed a superhero. I won't tell you what happens. You'll have to see for yourself. Shyamalan delivers the moddy colors and haunting shots like in &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;. They work here as well. Jackson is really good in his role. Willis is really starting to become a 'real' actor. Everybody always thought he was some dimbulb action star. How wrong those people are. He is solid here. This movie is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. You'll either love it or absolutely hate it. You just have to remember one thing : It's just a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>Although Shyamalan's "Sixth Sense" perhaps had more chills and more of a classic twist-ending - I personally think "Unbreakable" is his best film. I'm not sure if you would call it's ending a "twist," but it made me gasp when it suddenly brought a whole landscape of emotion into focus with an amazing depth of field.<br /><br />Furthermore, this movie has one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen on screen. Samuel L. Jackson plays a precise and learned art dealer with a special affinity for original classic comic book drawings. His genetic affliction limits the physical activity he can engage in, but his imagination has always been free to entertain strange possibilities. This truly is an original portrayal that could never typecast Jackson. His role is not as romantic lead, not as supporting character actor, not as doctor, lawyer, merchant... It's what he is that in the end creates the shock of brilliant resolution.<br /><br />This is a movie whose intricacies will haunt you long after the fact. And even if you never had any interest in comic books, you will probably walk away from `Unbreakable" with a new respect for what Joseph Campbell might call their "power of myth."<br /><br />One word about the availability of this film - I see a lot of the single-disc versions of it are available only in "Region 2" DVD format. You would need a "Multi-Region" or "Universal" DVD player to play these versions. As I understand it, all DVD players are manufactured with the capability of playing all DVDs. However, the players are then set by distributors to play in only one region, most often the US/Canada Region 1 - in order to block overseas bootlegging versions and other illicit overseas offerings.<br /><br />There are on-line sites presumably listing decoding sequences that will allow you to "unlock" your specific DVD player so it will play all regions. However most people I've talked with have found these decoding sequences don't work. This can be frustrating because it seems an increasing number of English or foreign movies and comedy series are being offered only in non-Region 1 formats lately.<br /><br />So if you want to buy one of the single-disc Region 2 versions of "Unbreakable" listed on this website, you might need to consider buying a "Multi-Region" DVD player on-line, or else you might want to go to an ethnic neighborhood (such as an East Indian community) in a large city to find a Multi-Region player.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>There is a notion that all of us have a particular talent or power within us, which must be used, defining our place and purpose in life. This is the central theme in M. Night Shyamalan's original film, ~Unbreakable~.<p>Do you wake up in the morning feeling a touch of melancholia or sadness, because you're not really doing what you're supposed to be doing - are you fulfilling your destiny?<p>David Dunn (Bruce Willis) certainly feels this sadness. When he miraculously survives a devastating train accident, the sole survivor, an eccentric character enters his life, Elija Price (Samuel Jackson), and reveals Dunn's true destiny. If you haven't seen ~Unbreakable~ Dunn's true calling will surprise you.<p>This theme is similarly explored in Shyamalan's other films - 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs'. In 'The Sixth Sense' a little boy must overcome his fear to fulfill his destiny - helping the dead resolve their unresolved issues on earth. And in 'Signs', a man of the cloth loses his faith, only to find it again after a series of life changing circumstances. However, ~Unbreakable~ has to be the most original of the three.<p>Shyamalan's talent as a filmmaker is without question - he uses certain techniques to create a suspense-filled atmosphere in his films that causes, for me at any rate, a visceral response.<p>Everything about this film, screenplay, direction, editing and the performances are first rate. ~Unbreakable~ is a five star viewing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>If there is one thing I love about M. Night Shamalayan's films, it is that they generally work on several levels, are thought provoking, and don't rely on generic material to tell a story. Sure, viewers of his films now look for the "twist" at the conclusion (thanks to The Sixth Sense), but there is so much more to the viewing experience that we shouldn't judge a film solely on its conclusion (like many did in The Village). Unbreakable is such a film that works on many levels, and has a symbolic, yet human aspect to it.<br /><br />The first time I saw Unbreakable at the movies, it just struck me as a strange flick, seemingly slow-moving but telling a tale of two vastly different characters. Years later, having seen the film several times since, I have a love and appreciation for this film and its depth. The film itself works as a sort of comic book story told in human form. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a man who has had the remarkable fortune to been the sole survivor of a terrible train wreck. He's also never been sick in his life. You might say that, despite his fortunate moment, David is a pretty normal guy, with an uneventful, yet somewhat conflicted life. He works as a security guard at a stadium, but has had marital problems and isn't as happy as he could be with life. Shamalayan brings a real human, everyday quality to David, who comes to the realization that larger forces may be at work in his life. David's ho-hum existence will be interrupted by the man who really is his opposite, Elijah Price. Elijah (played brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson), is David's antithesis. Nicknamed "Mr. Glass", Elijah is prone to injury, sickness, uses a cane to walk; he is eccentric, odd and strange, and has a fanatic, obsessive streak about comics. Elijah is quite obsessed with David's ability to survive and sees an almost superhuman relevance to his existence. It will become evident to David only later what this encounter with the strange man means, as several conflicts surface.<br /><br />Unbreakable incorporates an understated level within its telling, but it is masterful in building both a symbolic and literal level of storytelling. On one side is the comic book angle of good vs. evil; both sides exist in the world and seem to balance each other out. Each of the two main characters, David and Elijah, represent these two angles. The story that is told from David's point of view brings with it a simple, but readily identifiable theme: we each have a gift, and we need to use it for the common good. One aspect of Unbreakable is really just David finding his identify and existence in the world. The scenery, visuals, colors all enhance the experience of watching as well.<br /><br />If there is one drawback, it is the ending, which other reviewers have noted. I don't fault it on its intentional or unintentional supposed "twist", but rather that it was just rushed and not thought out. The ending seemingly kills the momentum of an otherwise deep film.<br /><br />Still, I think that the film is excellent, and the DVD gives you fantastic extras which give background into the story of Unbreakable and the cast, but more importantly, put much of the film in perspective. Well worth the purchase.<br /><br />4 stars for the film, but 5 for the entire DVD package.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>I had not known of this film when I purchased it on the name of Bruce Willis. I suppose it warrants the characterization of "atmospheric" since in fact that is about all there is. Action plays a subordinate role to Willis' portrayal of the man with an itch from a source he cannot fathom. The Jackson character is given limited scope, inherent in its delineation by the film's creators. Apparently, this is to be the natural history of a comic book hero born of real, normal parents, living a real man's family life but alienated from meaningful connections with the world. In the denouement, with Jackson's hel, he finds that place. The ending is a distinct falling off a cliff, its abruptness being a let-down from the build-up and pinnacle.It is one of those endings which makes one feel that the creators ran out of steam and didn't know what to do next; or, perhaps, the financial chief said that there was no more money to be spent, cut it where you can.<br />At any rate, despite the glacial pace and lack of substantial characters aside from the two stars, and the role of Willis' son, it holds interest until that lack-luster ending.<br />Over-all, I have to fall back on the old cliche in recommending it, that is, it is the kind of film which people who like this type of film will enjoy. Anyone looking for a Bruce Willis film will probably be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A328547P5BGZC.html">A328547P5BGZC</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan is the master!<br /><br />This movie is excellent! As every M. Night movie is.<br />Great characters, great acting and a unusual, never been done before story!<br /><br />Never pass up the chance to see a M. Night Shyamalan classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Unbreakable (M. Night Shyamalan, 2000)<p><p>Okay, people, get over it: M. Night Shyamalan may never make another film as good as The Sixth Sense. Very few people, especially those trapped in the Hollywood machine, may ever make another film as good as The Sixth Sense. So comparing Unbreakable to The Sixth Sense is probably not the best of ideas.<p><p>Not that that will stop me.<p><p>Unbreakable is the story of David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the only survivor of a nasty train wreck outside Philadelphia. After he leaves the hospital, he is approached by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who believes that Dunn may be the real-life equivalent of a comic-book hero, a guy who's basically put on earth to protect the weak, get kittens out of trees, etc., etc. Looking at Dunn and the life he leads, it's not exactly an easy concept to grasp; his wife (Robin Wright Penn) is estranged, though living in the same house; his kid (Spencer Treat Clark, last seen being Russell Crowe's kid in Gladiator) is obsessively<br />attached to him and lives in daily fear of the parents finally separating; Dunn himself is a simple security guard at a fictional Philadelphia university (that looks suspiciously like UPenn). This guy is a comic book hero impervious to damage who's going to save the small fry from the evil mastermind?<p><p>Comparisons to Shyamalan's last film aside, it turns into a well-done story. Willis and Jackson, reunited for the first time since Die Hard with a Vengeance, have the same chemistry that made that turkey into something vaguely watchable, and everyone involved plays their parts to the hilt. Shyamalan sets everything up just so, and then lets the ball roll, and it rolls well.<p><p>Problem is, this film begs to be compared to The Sixth Sense. Not just because it's Shyamalan and Willis, but because everything about it says Shyamalan was trying way too hard to reprise his earlier film. The red motif is replaced by a water motif that doesn't go nearly as far, Spencer Treat Williams could be a stunt double for Haley Joel Osment, Shyamalan makes his cameo, etc. It just doesn't have the same obsessive attention to detail that made The Sixth Sense such a wonderful experience, and so it doesn't quite pull at the heartstrings as much. But it's still a worthwhile movie, for what it is, that was unfairly bashed by many critics unwilling to see past the Shyamalan mystique. *** 1/2</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Writer/director Night Shyamalan had a hard act to follow after his success with "The Sixth Sense", but he outdid himself with "Unbreakable", a film I liked even better.  This is an outstanding tale that incorporates fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, human interest and a complex character study of a man coming to terms with an unusual gift.  The story maintains its intriguing edge throughout, and just when the viewer thinks the last surprise has been revealed, another leaps forth.  The ending is fantastic, and will certainly surprise anyone who hasn't been tipped off.<p>The direction is superb in every aspect.  The photography is outstanding, with creative use of the camera that enhances the mystery and drama of the film.  Though some have complained about the pace of the film, I found it to be necessarily deliberate, avoiding the temptation to rush through the psychological elements and heightening the suspense.  The direction of the actors is also smartly done, with everyone working well together creating a realistic feel despite a story that flirts with fantasy themes.<p>Bruce Willis can't seem to do a film lately without a kid to play opposite.  As was the case with "Sixth Sense" and Haley Joel Osment, he works well with Spencer Treat Clark in this film.  The scene where Clark confronts him with a loaded weapon will nail you to the wall.  Willis plays the part just right with a combination of skepticism and curiosity that makes his transition from regular Joe to action hero extremely believable.<p>Samuel L. Jackson knows only one way to play a part and that is flat out.  Once again he delivers, with a darkly enigmatic character that makes the entire mystery work.  Jackson's talent and intensity again makes me wonder why he has only been nominated for one supporting Oscar ("Pulp Fiction").  Robin Wright Penn rounds out an excellent cast with a solid performance as Willis' wife.<p>For anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller this film won't disappoint.  I rated it a 9/10.  It will keep you guessing and intrigued throughout.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Why? Cos you immediately compare the two! I've seen Sixth Sense a few times before this, and I knew there was going to be a twist to the film, just like Sixth Sense. So you're constantly looking out for the twist coming, and trying to second guess what is going to happen, or what could happen to the character. I found this ruined the movie slightly, I probably would have liked it more if I could have seen it from a fresh perspective. <p>It's such a shame that Unbreakable didn't do as well as Sixth Sense at the box office, cos it's an amazing movie to watch. It's fascinating to watch how it quickly reels the viewer - and how much you get annoyed when someone phones at the crucial moment! However, I did find it a lot slower than Sixth Sense, and I hated how it was rated a 12 - so much more could have been done, for example they could have actually shown the train derail, with a higher rating.<p>Bruce Willis seems to be a favourite of M. Night Shyamalan's, and quite right too! He's been terrific in both Sixth Sense and this, and once again, shows he's great with kids, since he's so great with the little guy who plays his son. He also has a lot less hair in this movie - which results in him NOT needing a hairstylist! Sorry, I found that really funny!<p>Samuel L Jackson just didn't look like his usual self in this movie. I dunno whether it was the weird, big hair or what. But his character was cool. What annoyed me at first, is when you see the baby/young Elijah, he's very much often reflected in glass. Stupid me, I didn't make the connection, cos his &quot;name&quot; is Mr Glass - as in &quot;the kids call me Mr Glass&quot;. Purely cos he breaks easily. As a newborn, he's reflected in the mirror; as a young child, he's seen reflected in a blank TV screen; he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David's (Bruce) car; he's often seen reflected in the glass frames in his art gallery, and what I found strangest of all, his walking stick is made of glass! (Although it provides a pretty spectacular scene when he falls and it shatters). As I said I didn't make the connection, but instead, I thought it was to do with him not wanting to see himself, because of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta? Just the (strange) way I see things!<p>Unbreakable focuses heavily on comic books, including a funny scene, where Elijah brings them down around him, and then picks the one he wants! There's also a lot about colour in the movie, particularly, what I noticed, all the 'bad' guys are very often wearing bright colours, so look out for that if you can. (Oh, kinda giving the game away there!)<p>What I found annoying to start with, but then began to like, was the amount of 'important' stuff that was introduced upside down. It gets tedious trying to twist your head to see what the hell you're looking at! These included: the TV train wreck footage; Elijah's first comic book; the &quot;Keep Out&quot; sign guarding the train's wreckage; the silver gun with the black grip, which Elijah sees in the belt of the man with the camouflage jacket while lying on his back; Audrey in the car crash flashback and Elijah's face after he falls down the stairs.<p>This was a terrific movie, so don't believe all the bad reviews you see. If you get a chance to see it on DVD, go for it! I think certain scenes would have been much more effective on the big screen, particularly the train station scene.<p>Oh, and watch out for M. Night Shyamalan doing a trademark - appearing in the movie! He appears twice in this, as two separate characters. (He also appears in Sixth Sense, as one of the doctors tending to Cole)<p>Oh, and I did NOT get the twist! I never do.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to the superb The Sixth Sense is an equally excellent film, with masterful storytelling, great acting and strong direction from Shyamalan. The storyline is about a seemingly-normal guy David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who finds out that he is impervious to pain and stronger than Schwarzenegger, when he discovers he is the only survivor from a horrific train crash. David meets up with comic book guru Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who befriends him and tells him what he can accomplish with his extraordinary gift.<p>While not as well-played as The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has again created a world with fascinating characters and bizzare events. And like Sixth Sense, the film does throw up a shocking twist at the end which is even more unpredictable. Utilising the same techniques, the audience is treeted to the director's compelling world, much alike to the early Spielberg films; extraordinary events happening to normal people. The top-notch acting from Willis and Jackson makes the film's ideas work even better. And the premise provides a series of weird events, building up to a thrilling finale. If it has a flaw, the pace drags sometimes, but the material is handled with aplomb. This is one of the hottest new directors around working his magic to superb effect.<p>The extras are really good, with comprehensive &quot;making of&quot; documentaries, some deleted scenes which add little to the film but still make for an intersting watch, and the &quot;train sequence&quot; with a natty multi-angle feature that allows yout to watch the film fron different view points. Plus trailers, a booklet and more production info. Impressive stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>A literal hit and miss, "Unbreakable" is M. Night Shyamalan's cinematic blunder, a jigsaw puzzle with integral pieces missing from its obscure image.  As can be expected, it suffers greatly at the hands of comparison to Shyamalan's Oscar-nominated masterpiece "The Sixth Sense".  "Unbreakable" is filmed with the same swart and creepy ambience as its predecessor but hopelessly flounders from an indistinct plot and underdeveloped characters.  Where as SS genuinely bolstered interest in the supernatural and managed to include a finale with some reasonable closure, this film is severely lacking of both.  It struggles to clarify its chaotic concept and miserably fails.<p>From the get-go, "Unbreakable" is a jumbled mess.  It remains so in the fact that it bears no plausible connections to the numerous theories it proposes in its laboriously paced two-hour time frame.  It strays far from its preliminary premise and sloppily interjects a scatterbrained theory from a comic book fanatic named Elijah Price, a man who has spent nearly his entire existence in the distilled milieu of hospitals.  Elijah suffers from a rare genetic disorder, one that severely depletes his bone density - his limbs will literally shatter like glass from a misstep of any kind.  In the search for his counterpart, the long-awaited news comes to him in the form of a tragic accident.  Two railway trains collide and all save one perishes - the sole survivor is David Dunn (Willis), an assumed everyday man who is currently enduring a crumbling marriage with his wife of twelve years (Penn).  He emerges from the horrific catastrophe unscathed, leaving his doctor and his family to ponder the miraculous outcome.  Elijah is intrigued and contacts David, bringing to light his inconceivable immunity to bodily harm and insisting that there is an underlying reason for his divine existence.<p>After this assumedly concrete plot is introduced, we are led to believe by not only the trailer but also the first half-hour itself that David's incredible circumstance is an existing phenomenon that begs to be defined.  Instead, we are left in the impenetrable shadows of the movie's ethereal cinematography as the characters themselves scramble to make sense of what is going on.  Because of Shyamalan's conflicting talents as a writer and a director, the plot bends left and right with indecisiveness.  In this inconsistency, Shyamalan throws his audience to and fro and we are left with yet another surprise ending that, unlike SS, lends no ample plausibility or clarification to the rest of the film.<p>Bruce Willis applies his near-a-whisper acting technique acquired from SS to the role of David Dunn, the man who is the moniker of this very movie.  There is never any dramatic tension from this limp character until a specific point in the movie when a gun is pointed at him from the most unlikely of people.  Robin Wright-Penn is wasted in this film as Dunn's eternally exhausted wife Audrey.  Penn always appears as if she has just taken a heavy dose of Secenol, her sluggish approach to her character almost unbearable to witness.  Samuel L. Jackson seems to be the only fire to these watery performances, but even his vehement candor is kept at a bare minimum by Shyamalan's lethargic style.  When examining the performances this film begets, I warn you: be prepared for pure somnolence.<p>There is not much more to comment on this film except that it is a far cry from what we know Shyamalan is truly capable of, and avid fans of SS will be extremely disappointed by the lack of artistry and attention to detail.  "Unbreakable" is doomed from its very induction and will be broken down to the every flaw by many critics to come.</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>This Movie is easily one of the greatest films ever made. It made me remember why I ever went to the movies in the first place. It was Haunting, Wonderous, Exciting, Humourous (when it wanted to be), and most importantly, it was highly entertaining. Now, I am not being Biased. Anyone who has looked at my members page will know of my feelings towards Bruce Willis (He is The Greatest Man to ever walk the face of the Earth). Even if Lorenzo Lamas stared in this film (and gave a good performance), i'd love it just as much. <p>As I said above, these films are the reason I watch movies, I don't think I've felt such wonder since I first saw &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. <p>The Acting is Perfect, the Direction is Perfect, it really is a perfect film. I've heard the word SLOW peppered through some reviews, but I call it &quot;leisurely paced&quot;. And the Ending is one of the most stunning I've ever seen, as with the Sixth Sence, the ending really knocks you for six. (get it, knocks you for SIX..)<p>I pray that the rumours of the Willis/Shyamalan Trilogy are true, at least then we know there'll be one great movie on the horizon.</p></br><a href="../users/ANOAF9M5MTJHN.html">ANOAF9M5MTJHN</a><br/><p>this movie was so policial crap i wouldnt watch it again if you paid me . wh yowuld someone never get hurt and be good but one who suffer all the time be bad .</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />From the first scene, this movie grabs you.  Yes, there's a twist at the very end, but you can kind of figure it out as the movie goes along.  There were some scenes from which I had to shield my eyes -- such as when the character played by Samuel Jackson falls down the stairs in pursuit of a villain.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson's character is very sympathetic. You feel his physical and emotional pain. Even at the end, despite who he turns out to be, you still feel sorry for him.  Bruce Willis' character is also very sympathetic -- an emotionally stunted firefighter, with a wife and child from whom he appears estranged.  The son gives a strong performance -- especially the scene where he figures out that his father is extraordinarily strong.<br /><br />By far the best movie directed by M. Night.  Too bad there were no sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This movie is the best sci-fi drama I've ever seen. M. Night Shamalan does it again with such great direction and an original story line. The story is basically about a guy who soon finds out that he may possess human powers and his ordeals coping with it. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver very powerful performances, so it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen. Like Shamalan's other films this one leaves you in suspense throughout the entire film, and has a surprise ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AWEOR1WZSMBEZ.html">AWEOR1WZSMBEZ</a><br/><p>It's intriguing to know that whilst there are people who could qualify as a member of the new X-Men due to their body characteristics, there are also those who are like the exact opposite.  &amp; this is where &amp; how the story started.  One man continually searching his anti-thesis.  For what?  I really could not tell but maybe simply for the satisfaction of knowing that his belief, derived from comic books, is correct afterall.  What I cannot fathom though is how a paraplegic can pull off all those accidents when he obviously cannot even help himself.  Hhhmmm...strange, really strange.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan struck a gold mine when his film &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was released in 1999, bringing in overwhelming audiences and garnering Oscar nominations including a nod for Best Picture. It is one of the films that will go down in history, not so much as a movie like, for instance, &quot;Titanic,&quot; but still will be remembered. <p>&quot;Unbreakable,&quot; his follow-up feature to that success, didn't do as good as its predecessor, and upon watching it for the first time, I can't understand why. There are elements at work throughout its discourse that, under Shyamalan's brilliant direction, fit together in an intricate puzzle that comes to an earth-shattering halt with the film's ending. It's a brilliant and complex piece of filmmaking. <p>Like &quot;Sense,&quot; this film contains a mystery surrounding a central character, though this one isn't haunted by ghosts who need favors. &quot;Unbreakable&quot; begins with a horrific train accident, seen only through television footage and through the gauze of the last dying passenger as the sole survivor, David Dunn (Bruce Willis), looks on in a dazed silence. There is no scene of gory bloodshed, no sequence of special effects or derailing train cars... Shyamalan is able to prove that, through visceral images of victims' relatives and their expressions, the devastation of such an event can be just as effective without the use of a special effect. <p>As the story continues, more pieces of David's life come into play: his marriage is suffering, he goes into deep depression, and that, added to questions he has about the fact that he suffered no injuries, not even so much as a single scratch, plague him each day. His work as a security guard seems like any other job to him, until he meets a man named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), who believes that comic book heroes walk the Earth. <p>Elijah's life also has many complications: he suffers from a disease which causes his bones to break easily, ever since childbirth. His belief stems from his illness, that just as he is someone who is completely weak, there must be someone on the opposite end of the spectrum who is equally as strong. As he guides David through to the realization of his place in the world, a bigger revelation is at work, someone even as strong as David cannot withstand. <p>In a slow, emotional process, Shyamalan brings out the best and worst of his characters. In taking his time with the story, he is able to allow David to evolve from a hardened, unbelieving survivor into someone forever changed by the realization that the he possesses can be put to good use. I'm not going to reveal just how he comes to that realization: that's for you to find out. But I will say this: it's sheer brilliance. <p>The story structure for this film bears striking resemblance to &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but does not fail in keeping us intrigued. It begins by introducing the characters, and developing them in the midst of a very involving mystery. It then evolves into a story of realization and revelation, and just as in the previous film, there's a surprise twist ending, one that is more shocking and unexpected. <p>Shyamalan made the right choice in bringing Bruce Willis back for this project; one could even go so far as to say that the part was written especially for him. Once again, Willis is able to define himself as a true actor, one that can go from the guns and bombs of &quot;Die Hard&quot; to the sentimentality of a man whose belief in everything is shaken in this film. Cast opposite him is Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah, who also proves he is just as effective in a wheelchair as he is on his feet. <p>So why would this film not be as great a success as its predecessor? The answer may lie with the audience. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; drew many crowds of various types of people, the kind of people who generally don't see movies of this sort. &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is a much darker film, and I guess that was a turnoff for some people. <p>But who cares? &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is everything you'd expect out of a movie and more. There's the same subtle suspense and rising intensity you'd expect from its director, the same magic, the same awe-inspiring brilliance. Everything fits together, it's dynamic, it's intriguing. There's not enough praise for a movie like this, one of the best films of 2000.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>These days, it's rare to have a Director whose works have the capacity to captivate audience from start to finish.  Shamayalan has done just that.  It's very easy, really by providing audience with hints little by little until we get the whole story in the end.  His style of directing is rather unique too: dark &amp; sombre background as always, slow frames, focal attention towards the main characters for character development purpose, fitting soundtrack by James Newton Howard.  If you want to enjoy this movie, it's better you watch by not knowing anything from the beginning.  Otherwise, the essence of the whole movie would be lost.  I'm unsure if this movie could hold up for the next 2 sequels or if we would be fed up with this format of directing by  then.  The only downside I could see from this movie is that Robin Penn Wright should be given more chance to do her share.  We weren't told why her character in the movie started to drift apart from her husband character aka Bruce Willis...Definitely worth watching to kill hours but I still think the plot should be darker and heavier than comic book connections.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>This is truly the stupidest movie I've seen this year! People seem to be looking at this movie in the wrong context. Many people for some odd reason seem to think it's a drama, when infact it's a boring,dull,long,and unfunny,comedy-of-manners. When you get right down to it this movie is about Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to convince David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that he is a superhero! What sort of profound mind could dare come up with such an idea!? This movie is so stupd, i saw this movie with a bunch of people who had really no idea how to view this movie. Let me give everyone who hasn't seen this movie two prime examples of what exactly I'm talking about. There's a scene where Jackson first proposeses the idea to Willis that he is infact a modern day superhero. That right there, is worth a laugh, but wait, there more absurdity on the way. Jackson then starts rambling on about how comics are windows into the past, yet again, this is worth another laugh. The man is speaking so profoundly about comics. He's stating their importants in the world. Give me a break! This, to me, is a funny, ludicrous scene. And to top it all off, Jacksons, says his lines, with such honesty. I was actually waiting for him to start to laugh. And the audience i saw this with, seemed to be so taken away with this scene. They seem to have forgotten just how dumb this movie is. That, it is okay to laugh at it. Here's a man, telling another man, he's a superhero. You have to admit that's funny in thought. Just think if someone came up to you and told you that. Wouldn't you think that person needs help and laugh in their face? Of course you would! Another example is, Willis's son believes what Jackson has said to be true about his father, and to prove it to him, he wants to shoot him to show him he won't get hurt or die. After pleading with his mother and father not to shoot Willis, the little boy says &quot;Only once mommy!&quot; as if that will make everything ok. Let me shoot daddy once, it won't hurt lol. And yet again, people just looked on not laughing. My two friends and I couldn't stop laughing at such a remark. I noticed, soon after people heard us laugh, many people then started to laugh also. It was as if they needed to be told it's &quot;okay&quot; to laugh. There's nothing wrong with that. I was able to see this movie for what it is, something many,many people aren't doing. This is a ridiculous movie with an insane storyline. And that's what it's suppose to be. A comedy - of - manners I feel. The whole idea amny have to agree is funny. One man trying to convince another man he's a superhero. If Mel Brooks would of made this, people wouldn't be able to stop laughing. My pick for the worst film of the year! * 1\2 out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>This movie had promise but QUICKLY went down hill.  Not even the likeable Bruce Willis could do much to save this ridiculous mess.  I'm so glad I borrowed it off a friend, rather than rent it.<p>M. Night Shyamalan films are not clever, artistic or even original.  He tries to make his films unique but they fail even before the middle of the film.  Just look at his other film called &quot;Signs&quot;.  Mel Gibson couldn't save that either.  Not even big names can help his movies.<p>Overall, far fetched nonsense films which don't deserve any of our attention.

He is invulnerable and invincible.  He cannot be harmed and he has super human strength.

Jackson), that has searched for him all of his life.  He is a physically handicapped man with an evil side and he believes that if there are people like him in the world, then he believes that there are people like David Dunn.....<br /><br />This movie is about a man who has to learn to believe in himself and about a father and son's love for each other.  It also shows how one man can be a hero while others are evil!  This movie is one of M. Night Shyamalan's hits and he wrote, produced and directed the movie.  He also appeared briefly in the film.  He takes the time to develop the characters in the story and you get to understand their personalities.  You also won't see out of this world special effects but just a well told story about a man trying to find himself and understand his abilities.<br /><br />This is an excellent story and movie and Bruce Willis always does a good job in a motion picture and he succeeded in this one of putting forth a good performance.

The end was a curve ball and that's good,but to get to this was at times boring and made you wonder what you were watching.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Unbreakable' is one of those films that has aged rather well with me.  When director M. Night Shyamalan first introduced himself to the movie going public in 1999 (`The Sixth Sense' was his second film, but it was the first that got anyone to take notice) he had so much promise, but sadly `Unbreakable' is the only film since that has expounded on that promise.  One day I'll bombard you with a verbal slaughtering of `Lady in the Water', `Signs' and `The Village' (I refuse to see `The Happening'), but until then you can relish in some praise for `Unbreakable'.<br /><br />Shyamalan's answer to the super hero origin story, `Unbreakable' tells of David Dunn, a unhappily married man who lives a rather ordinary (if not bland) life until a tragic train accident adds a new purpose to his life.<br /><br />This is not your average superhero story, and it isn't anything like `The Sixth Sense', so it may be hard for many to completely get into this film.  I remember when I saw it in the theater I was let down pretty bad, and so was everyone else I was with.  We were expecting something like `The Sixth Sense', complete with the scares we felt when watching the 1999 thriller.  Instead, `Unbreakable' is a slow and brooding character study that is more haunting than scary.  Like I said, it has aged well with me.  I appreciate the film much more now than I did when I first saw it (kind of like `The Village', although I still think that `The Village' is a mediocre film).<br /><br />One thing that I really admire about this film is Shyamalan's direction.  Sure, his screenwriting skills have become convoluted and forced as the years have progressed (he tries way too hard, and it shows) but his direction is always near impeccable.  He knows how to capture a mood and tone.  Here, he gives a very dark and gritty atmosphere to the film without ever compromising the comic book feel (the way the film is shot is almost TOO smart).  The characters are shot in ways that accentuate their personalities and eventualities marvelously, using such clever technique to embellish what Shyamalan has crafted on the page.  In fact, upon reflection I think that this direction may be even more accomplished and noteworthy than that of `The Sixth Sense'.<br /><br />The acting is all very appropriate and at times even moving.  Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career in `The Sixth Sense', and he follows that up with yet another very well controlled and admirable effort.  Although he is known for his action films, for me he really shows a depth and range here that he should tap into more often.  Robin Wright Penn is also quite impressive in her scenes, and although Jackson does come off somewhat clich&eacute;d and campy at times, he evokes a genuine chill (as in `down the back of your spine') that captures Shyamalan's vision marvelously.  I actually thought that the films best performance came from Spencer Treat Clark, who understood the balance between his characters fear and admiration of his father.<br /><br />It was stunning and only grows more and more haunting every time I see the film.<br /><br />The idea of the `every man' coming into his own as a superhero has been approached before, but Shyamalan adds a layer of realism to this film by ditching the corny one-liners, ridiculous costumes and unrealistic `super villains' and their dastardly deeds, replacing them with a normal man muddling through realistic dialog, struggling to understand himself in a world with drug dealers and murderers and front page headline stories that you read about everyday.<br /><br />Like I said, this is not your typical superhero story...this is a superhero movie for people who don't like superhero movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>J. Night Shyamalan has made yet another cerebral thriller and this time its super heroes. You get all the same kind of engrossing mystery as in Sixth Sense, but this time with a little dose of comic book "what if?" is thrown in the mix. What comes out is a seriously cool adaptation to a theme that just about every one of us has imagined at least one time in our lives. What would it be like to have super powers?<br /><br />Just like his other thrillers. The beauty of the movie is slowly learning what the heck is going on. You go through this ordinary security guard's tribulation of finding out if he really is nigh invulnerable. The story is done really well in this aspect. You get really swept away in this trek to find the truth. Many of the scenes use color, sound and other cinematography techniques to bring out an even greater artistic enhancement of storytelling. These techniques almost make you feel like you are seeing techniques used in comic books to enhance the story in a subtle and realistic way. Very, very nice!<br /><br />The acting is superb. Bruce Willis has never disappointed me yet. When he is needed to show strength you see the inner strength. When he needed to be a vulnerable character you can see it in his eyes and the way he carries himself. Masterful work. Samuel L. Jackson plays his role as Elijah Price so well that you almost think Jackson himself is the infinitely frail. He also has a great presence and complexity that further makes him perfect for the role.<br /><br />Like most of Shyamalan's other movies this one isn't action based, in spite of what the story is about. Unbreakable is, however, an excellent coming-of-super-age type story with one doozy of a surprise ending... an early Shyamalan trademark. If you absolutely, positively need lots of action in your films then you might as well pass this one. However you will miss out. Anybody who likes to see more depth in his or her heroes you won't see anything better on any superhero movie hands down. Don't deprive your mind of this brain food. It's a winner.<br /><br />I don't really see a very compelling reason to get this Blu-Ray if you already own the two-disc Vista series DVD. The visuals don't seem like they have improved that much, but then again I didn't compare the two versions side by side. I won't say the picture isn't significantly better, but I will say it's not the kind of visual pop you would find on movies people use as high def references. Now the audio on the Blu-Ray is PCM 5.1 lossless and it's really nice. You get to hear a lot of subtle audio queues that may or may not be noticeable on the previous releases (again I didn't compare the two side by side).<br /><br />The special features are a 100% rehash of the Vista series extras with absolutely nothing new to the table. This kinda dissapoints me, but in the end most of the time when they make a Blu-Ray exlusive featurette it sometimes tends to be throwaway content. Here's what you get:<br /><br />Behind the Scenes - A documentary of interviews from the cast and crew. Not bad, but not groundbreaking.<br /><br />Comic Books and Superheroes - A cool analysis of comic book heroes and villans. Shows that Samuel Jackson does have a love for the genre.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - There are some really cool scenes that were taken out and now you get to enjoy them. Some, of course, are obvious why they were taken out. My favorite is the weighlifting scene at the college gym.<br /><br />The Train Station Sequence - Uses the multiple angles feature to switch between the movie and the storyboards. Not really interesting unless you plan to direct.<br /><br />Night's First Fight Sequence - One a Shyamalan's home movies depicting the title sequence. Just shows the budding directory building his chops as a teen with a camcorder. Interesting bit of historic trivia, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I didn't feel the Blu-Ray really stood out on the visual end, but it did look really good. I would have liked to have seen some more content on this release like maybe a director commentary, maybe an analytical retrospective. Something new. If you already have the Vista series DVD I can't say with 100% certainty this is the one to get. I keep wondering if a new and improved Blu-Ray release will come down the pike with more features or maybe a director's cut adding some of those deleted scenes into a longer movie. If you don't have the Vista series DVD then your choice is easier as you get all the special features plus the improved visuals (likely) and audio (definitely).</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Currently hit show "Heroes" is riding high with the premise "what if ordinary people found that they had superpowers?" But they weren't the first to use that -- M. Night Shyamalan tackled in in "Unbreakable," an eerie thriller full of solid acting and writing, but a big fat letdown of an ending.<br /><br />A train derails, killing everyone on board -- except everyman David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who survives without a scratch. As he tries to deal with this, he is contacted by crippled comic book dealer Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), whose "glass" bones made him speculate: what if there were people at the opposite end of the spectrum -- real superheroes with great strength and powers, REAL "men of steel"?<br /><br />Realizing that he has never been sick or endangered (except when exposed to water), David begins to explore his newly-discovered strength and second sight, despite the harm it does to his fragile marriage, even saving others from criminals. But there's a sinister side to his discovery and the accident that caused him to explore his powers...<br /><br />"Superhero movie" usually makes you think of loads of colourful action and young hunky heroes. But Shyamalan takes the opposite approach --  a middle-aged Everyman hero with wife and kid, and the movie is cloaked in shadowy camerawork, not much action at all and eerie, overquiet dialogue. Still it's very geeky, and very intelligent.<br /><br />Instead of action, "Unbreakable" devotes itself to the mythic qualities of superheroes, and David's slow awakening to his own abilities. Rather than his usual suspense, Shyamalan uses atmosphere to keep the plot captivating, giving it the feeling of a creepy intense dream. And since every superhero has to fight the baddies, he weaves in some tightly-choreographed, grimy fight sequences as David finally makes use of his superstrength.<br /><br />So what's the problem? Quite simply, the ending is a huge letdown -- while rationally it makes sense, David's actions at the climax leave you feeling, "That's it? That's all the 'unbreakable man' is going to do?" And somehow it feels odd that a "supervillain" wouldn't really have any superabilities (or compensation for them) himself.<br /><br />Bruce Willis gives an excellent, understated performance as David, who longs for an indefinable something in his life, and slowly grows to realize that he is "unbreakable." But Jackson is even better as Elijah Price -- intense, passionate, and somewhat detached from the real world. His powerful personality balances out his frail body.<br /><br />Shyamalan goes into comic-book geek mode in in "Unbreakable," a slow-moving, suspenseful movie about a hero's awakening... that only stumbles in the final scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>One of the best thrillers of 2000, Unbreakable is writer/director M. Knight Shyamalan's follow up production to the 1998 blockbuster The Sixth Sense. Although not as phenomenally successful as that film, Unbreakable is nonetheless a memorable and suspense ridden picture certain to entertain. Shyamalan uses a unique comic book format to weave a tale of a superhero who fails to realize his own powers. But audiences won't confuse Unbreakable with Spiderman or Superman. The film isn't as one-dimensional with its characters, and the employment of special effects is not a focal point of the film. Instead, Unbreakable remains more of a mystery, thriller combination, and one that works well...<br /><br />Security Guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) makes headlines as the sole survivor of a massive train wreck which kills 130+ passengers. But not only does David survive the wreck, he emerges from the wreckage without a single scratch. Soon after, David is approached by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), owner of a comic book art gallery and expert on the world of comics. Elijah suffers from a genetic disease which causes his bones to be extremely brittle. Confined in his home, Elijah's mother bought him comic books throughout his youth. Believing the comics to be a modern form of ancient storytelling describing the lives of real people of super-human abilities, Elijah postulates that David is one such person.<br /><br />The fanatical comic book lover produces evidence of David's survival of a car wreck twenty years earlier, his survival on the train, and his injury-free days as a star football player. As the polar-opposite of David, Elijah has been in search of such a person for his entire life. Now, he must convince David that he holds the aforementioned powers. As David comes to believe he holds the power of the 'unbreakable', he also develops an awareness of a special sense which gives him the ability to tell if someone has done, or is about to do, something sinister. As David comes to appreciate his special powers, the world around him crystallizes with a terrifying clarity...<br /><br />Featuring one of the better surprise endings of the decade, Unbreakable is one of the reasons Shyamalan's reputation has risen to such a lofty position in the world of film. Well-written and well-directed, M. Knight Shyamalan creates a brilliant follow up to The Sixth Sense with the dark and mysterious Unbreakable. Samuel L. Jackson plays his part well, employing the use of his penetrating stare and authoritative voice for maximum effect. Bruce Willis stars again in a role he knows well - that of the hero.<br /><br />Although it lacked the commercial success and Academy Award speculation of its forerunner, Unbreakable is nevertheless an entertaining film. Weaving a strange and exotic tale of two men who lead opposite lives in the physical realm, it makes deft use of cinematography and dripping suspense to leave its audience perched on the edge of curiosity. As a result, Unbreakable made a place for itself among the best films of 2000, and it definitely ranks as a must-see film...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>M. Night Shyamalan's rapid-fire follow up to `The Sixth Sense' is, for my money, the better film.  With his wonderfully original and perfectly structured screenplay, this young master once again has us entirely in his thrall.  But it's the beautifully understated performances from Willis, Wright and Jackson which really make this work.  With the wrong actors, or the wrong direction, this unusual story with its `family values' subtext could easily have descended into absurdity or melodrama, but the tone of chilling plausibility is maintained till the end.  Slick production design, thoughtful camera work and editing, and a surprisingly effective score from James Newtown Howard, add the final touches to what is a very, very impressive piece of work.</p></br></body></html>

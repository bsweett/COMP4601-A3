If someone was hoping for or expecting more from it, I guess you've never seen the previews or any other movies by Michael Bay...cuz his movies are either fast moving, overblown, ridiculous and boring (PEARL HARBOR) or fast moving, overblown, ridiculous and kinda amusing (BAD BOYS).  None are art...none will be remembered for long.<br /><br />But on its own terms, there are many things to recommend this film.  The premise is the best part:  clones are raised as replacement parts for the rich people who can afford to have them manufactured.  For reasons the movie only barely explains, the clones have to live full, sentient lives or they are no good as doners...so the fabulously wealthy and very villainous company that owns the clones invents a complex "futuristic" society where everyone dresses the same, does mundane work and is pretty much forbidden to ask questions.  Their only reason for living is to win the lottery and a free trip to live on "The Island," the only uncontaminated outside environment left in the world.  Naturally, the winner of a trip to the island is actually winning a one way ticket to euthanasia, so their organs can be harvested.  This is not a new idea, exactly, but the life in this society is actually portrayed in a fun, original and enjoyable manner.  We know...because we've seen similar stories before...that there is no Island.  But we enjoy seeing these na?ve humans running around with no real purpose.  It's a "Brave New World" kinda place.<br /><br />The movie also has an appealing cast going for it.  Ewan MacGregor plays Lincoln, the clone who discovers the secret.  He's just really a likeable, personable actor and he's good a being squeaky-clean and na?ve.  He's good at playing an "innocent" and his outrage when the innocence is lost is fun too.  If a more "hard-boiled" performer had been cast...more of a typical action star...we would not have enjoyed his discoveries nearly as much.<br /><br />I admit I was worried about the idea of Scarlett Johanssen in this film.  Sometimes she is just SO still and quiet and introverted that she can be a bit dull.  But she puts on a little bit of "perky" personality, and her placid face works well for the type of character she's supposed to be...something of a blank.  When she gets to "escape" and toughen up a bit, she makes it credible enough that I never thought "she was the wrong choice."<br /><br />Sean Bean is the main villain, and he could do this character in his sleep...but that doesn't mean he isn't good at it.  Djomon Honsou (from AMISTAD and IN AMERICA) plays a bounty-hunter type character.  It's a nothing role...I mean really nothing...but he has a great screen presence.  Michael Clark Duncan (THE GREEN MILE) has a small but very effective part.<br /><br />There are bad things too.  There is one spectacular highway car chase where Lincoln starts throwing heavy old train tires off a truck onto the highway, where they bounce and spin and crash spectacularly into the chasing cars.  But the scene is VERY much like Bay's scene in BAD BOYS II when boats are thrown off the back of a truck into the chasing cars behind.  For so much time and expense, you'd think he could have done something more original.<br /><br />The movie has no real surprises either.  It's fun for awhile to know more than the clones do...but towards the end we realize that we have no surprises in store...it's just a lot of noise and explosions.  There is no real emotional payoff in the movie...and no Michael Bay film ever has any.  They are so fraught with explosions, over-edited and so poorly written that we never CARE about anyone.  Thank goodness MacGregor is likeable enough on his own to carry his part without the help of a good script.<br /><br />But overall, I still recommend the movie if you go into it with appropriate expectations.  It is escapist fun.  Nothing else.  As such, you should enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YC9XEDFKXPLK.html">A1YC9XEDFKXPLK</a><br/><p>Mixed reviews are always interesting to read and the reasons why over a film like this...Make no mistake, while the topic of cloning is a seriously thought provoking subject matter (moral,ethical,medical issues,etc.)the viewer must not forget The Island is sheer entertainment ! Obvious visual and partial story line ingredients echo sci-fi films of the past such as Logan's Run,Blade Runner,THX-1138,Fifth Element----the list can go on forever.Think of what director Michael Bay has done is an homage to those films and not an easy rip off! Also, The Island manages to really hit close to home in that cloning technology in the 21st century isn't sci fi fodder any more, but fact.Could something like this really happen with clones? Is it happening already? Who knows...<br /><br />Ewan McGregor portrays Lincoln who begins to question his existence and why things are the way they are in his clean-room environment society; This in great part is fueled by repetitive and haunting cryptic dreams that he cannot shake.Are they just dreams, memories, premonitions or all of the above? Are they his or someone else's? Are memory implants transferrable and possible? One can begin to see the underlying theme here about human existence and mortality that permeated and resonated strongly in 1982's sci-fi cult classic Blade Runner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?). Lincoln also suspects something is amiss and wants answers about The Island; A beautiful piece of remaining inhabitable paradise left untouched as an untainted remnant of the "contamination" war.Those fortunate enough to win the lottery get to leave their hermetically sealed world and live the remainder of their lives on Fantasy Island...or do they ?...Lincoln soon unravels the mystery of the Island. Under dire circumstances he escapes his underground hi-tech world with the lovely and intelligent Jordan played by Scarlett Johansson. Just watching the underground city escape sequences through the labyrinth of obstacles, tunnels and secret corridors brings back my own memories of watching Logan's Run in 1976 for the first time when Logan is also escaping the city with another runner named Jessica...Through Lincoln's own investigating he discovers the true horrors that await all residents of The Island...<br /><br />McGregor never disappoints as an actor and over the years has established himself pretty well. He may not have the box office draw or pull of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, or even Tom Hanks, but his performances always come through with great believability and ease.He's not good at his craft;he's great at it ! Roles he has chosen are always likeable and easy for most audiences to connect with. Majority of roles he chooses compare to those  trustworthy friends we have and can easily hang out with with no pretentious airs.There's an honesty to his portrayal of characters (the guy you would want to back you up in a bar brawl). McGregor connects with the average Joe. Thus, his character wants answers that most of us want about our "existence" and place in the universe;All the why's and how's.<br /><br />Steve Buscemi,ever since I saw him years ago in Reservoir Dogs, always garners a film with his unique acting talent.Regardless if he is cast in an Oscar contender of a film or the bomb of the year,  Buscemi always adds that "lift" or comical nuance that is unmistakebly his style and angle!<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson as Jordan is a hot beauty that delivers as well. The chemistry between McGregor and Johansson works smoothly.Scarlett is destined to become even a bigger star as more roles come in and time goes by. She definitely has that "it" factor and a magnetic presence that indicates she's an actress and not just a cover girl hottie ! Her dialogue and character's emotional range may have seemed limited, but what was evident was absolutely tangible.<br /><br />Give The Island a visit for the acting, story, and I almost forgot to mention, it's super sci-fi high octane special effects.Don't just judge it by saying ,"Oh, another sci-fi geek film".Plenty of product plug ins as well that should make both Chrysler and Cadillac proud in showing off their hot current production autos and concept vehicles used as vintage and police cars in this film;20 years ago the movie RoboCop did the same for Ford by using the then somewhat "futuristic" and  stylish Taurus car(by 1980's standards that is)... Gotta love all the cars, toys and gadgets in this film !It's a pretty thrilling and captivating flick with amazingly slick and polished chase sequences and pyrotechnics !</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>This movie starts off a little slow as it establishes the premise. But later it has lots of action with excellent CGI effects which complement the futuristic environment. From the concept the film has a touch of "Coma" and "Blade Runner" with a superb execution making it its own. The acting is okay, and the movie is mostly carried by the concept, premise and execution of great photography and direction. It's also a smart motion picture with an actual storyline, etc. Also, many new vehicles in modified form like the Dodge Magnum and Chrysler 300 C, the Cadillac SRX, the Honda Element, etc. including some concept cars can be found in this flick. After the film ended, most of the movie goers I observed and met seemed to like this movie a lot and felt that they got an incredible entertainment experience which was well worth their money. The bottom line is that it is well worth watching this film because of the excellent concept, vision and execution, and most likely it will make it into my DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>The Island is a real science fiction movie of the "Logan's Run" variety, and outside of Star Wars III the best hard sf movie at least since Minority Report.  The first half of the movie takes place in a futuristic city, sort of an anti-utopia where every choice is made for  you, every aspect of your life is planned to optimize your health, because, we are lead to believe, a global contamination, or epidemic, has left few survivors, which are all brought to the city when found.  Life is pretty mundane, though healthy and stable.  Citizens have little to look forward to except a slim chance of winning a trip to the one remaining uncontaminated spot on Earth:  The Island.<br /><br />Lincoln (Ewan McGregor) is one of these survivors who learns the real purpose of the city, it's occupants, and most ominously and secretly, trips to the Island.  Lincoln and  his girlfriend Jordan (Scarlett Johansson) embark on their own "Logan's Run" to escape the city and reveal the deadly secret.  The rest of the film is an action-packed chase involving explosions and crashes of just about every type of vehicle, with more effective special effects than most action movies -  in broad daylight in realistic settings.<br /><br />Sean Bean is good as the bad guy, Steve Buscemi better as one of his employees, Ethan Philips best as one of their typical victims.<br /><br />It's a little bit morbid in spots, but otherwise suitable and recommended for the whole family.  It does have a timely message, though to discuss it would give away too much of the plot.  See it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>If you passed on THE ISLAND (DreamWorks) because of the misleading title, strange trailers and obtuse poster, some bad reviews, well, you missed a great-looking, high-energy thriller that's essentially an uncredited remake of 1979's CLONUS (Mondo Macabre).<br /><br />Set in a near and believable future, it's about the ultimate insurance policy wedded with cutting edge science.<br /><br />To say more would be unfair. For a surprisingly satisfying, edge of your seat experience about identity and mortality check out this overlooked flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>great action pack movie not what i expected, it has some similar patterns to other movies i've seen but i think they did a good job</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>There has been a catastrophe; the entire planet has been contaminated and is virtually unlivable.  Survivors of the disaster must remain inside an enormous compound if they hope to live.  The situation could be worse, though.  The compound is very beautiful (if monochomatic), and every luxury is available to them.  Swimming pools, exercise rooms, computers, even fresh food.  What's more, the surviors have hope.  There exists an island which is the only place on Earth that hasn't been contaminated, and the people live in the hopes that soon, they will win the lottery and will be moved to the paradise.  For a post-apoctalyptic society, things aren't so bad.  Or are they...<br /><br />Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) begins to question things when he starts having "dreams" that suggest everything isn't exactly as it seems.  Along with his friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), they escape from the compound only to learn that not only is the world still in perfect condition, but they are clones of rich people on the outside.  People like Tom Lincoln (McGregor) and Sarah Jordan (Johansson) paid to have themselves copied so that if they ever need an organ transplant, they will automatically have a perfect donor.  The clones are viewed as products, and instead of names, they have serial numbers.  Their names include the surname of their sponsors (Lincoln), their location code (6 means that Tom Lincoln lives in LA), and their generation (Echo refers to the year in which the clone was grown).<br /><br />Since this is a Michael Bay movie, one can expect there to be many explosions (and there are) as well as awesome special effects.  However, the story is just as compelling as the effects are cool.  Furthermore, the characters are fleshed out and multi-dimensional.  The movie's villain, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), who is the creator of the clone research facility, isn't an evil mastermind bent on torturing people.  He truly believes in what he is doing; he sees his job as helping people.  Granted, he refers to the clones, who are real people, as just soulles products.<br /><br />Another good thing about this movie is its charm.  The clones (or agnates as the Merrick company calls them) may have adult bodies, but they are mentally at the age of 15.  So when L6E and J2D encounter real people for the first time, the results are pretty funny (I love Johansson's bubbly delivery when some lowlife in a bar asks for her number, and she responds by saying "2 Delta").<br /><br />It is good to know that a summer blockbuster (especially one from Bay) can have heart behind it.  Hopefully, this film will set a precedent for future summer flicks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>One of the best things about watching a good science fiction film is the opportunity to see interesting interpretations of what the future might look like. If "The Island", the new film by Michael Bay, is to be believed, the year 2019 is dominated by Aquafina Water, Michelob Light, Cadillac, Adidas and Microsoft. Everyone uses these brands, and only these brands. And when they use them, we get a long, loving look at the logos. When exactly did the extent of creating a futuristic universe become product placement? "I, Robot" also fell victim to this (over)using Audi and Adidas. In one scene, Will Smith's character gushes over his new Adidas. Filmmakers! Use your imagination. The future is more than product placement lines.<br /><br />Michael Bay's "The Island", starring Ewan McGregor ("Star Wars: Episode III") as Lincoln Six Echo and Scarlett Johansson ("Lost In Translation") as Jordan Two Delta, is about a select group of people who have escaped the widespread contamination of the planet. They currently live in a safe holding facility, segregated by sex, working, exercising, waiting for their chance to win a trip to live on the Island, the last uncontaminated bit of land on the planet. But Lincoln Six Echo begins to ask questions of Merrick (Sean Bean), the leader of the facility. And he finds some answers, alarming answers.<br /><br />"The Island" is all `too'; too long, two separate films, and filled with too many product placements.<br /><br />The first part of the film tells the story of Lincoln and Jordan, establishing their life in the facility, after the widespread contamination, giving us an alarming look at the future. Surprisingly, a fair bit of humor is interspersed, enlivening the story. All of the inhabitants have their every step monitored and if something is noticed, everything is changed accordingly. One morning, after Lincoln awakens, he has a pee and his urine is instantly monitored and an abnormal sodium level is detected. At breakfast, the server knows this and refuses him his customary bacon. Just as Jordan is called to leave for the Island, Lincoln learns some secrets and tries to convince her not to leave.<br /><br />This part of the film works fairly well. Bay has abandoned the frenzied editing style he used to excess in films like "Armageddon" and "Pearl Harbor" in favor of actually telling a story, developing characters, building a time and place. From the moment we are introduced to Lincoln and Jordan, we get a sense that something is wrong with them, with their society. Everyone rescued from the contaminated areas is very na?ve and childlike. What happened to them before they were rescued? Bay handles this well and uses his budget to create glossy, well-rendered settings which are, unfortunately, marred by excessive product placements.<br /><br />At one point, Lincoln complains that all they have to wear is white. "It's impossible to keep clean." I almost expected a hand to reach in from off screen and hand him some Tide or All. Because Product Placements have become so standard in film and television, the next step is to make them prominent. We are so used to seeing a Coke can pop up in a film, we might overlook it. Filmmakers now have to make sure the product gets noticed. Science Fiction seems to be the vehicle of choice for this type of advertising. In films like "I, Robot" and "The Island", the filmmakers have taken already recognizable brands or concepts for future products and use them as "The Future" in their films. Because Cadillac allowed the use of their concept cars, the camera seems obligated to linger on the logo on each cars grill, lovingly, for long periods of time. A `futuristic' bottle of Michelob Light sits in front of Steve Buscemi's character. They need to leave the bar immediately, but he still has time to pick up the bottle, logo front and center, take a drink, and put the bottle back on the bar, the camera holding on the bottle after Buscemi has left. Enough with the product placements already.<br /><br />This bit of the story fills the first 45 minutes or so. Then Bay seems to get bored. The second part of the film becomes a more traditional action film. Lincoln and Jordan are chased through one situation after another. As this is a Michael Bay film, the chase scenes are big, loud and impressive, but they just don't fit with the first half of the film. First of all, the two characters are so na?ve and childlike, how are they able to escape a band of hired mercenaries lead by Djimon Hounsou for so long? Lincoln and Jordan know nothing beyond the containment facility, yet they are able to allude this team of men in helicopters, motorcycles and souped up Cadillacs for almost an hour of screen time. How exactly do they know that the information booths emblazoned with the MSN logos will be able to help them? Or that they should avoid the many MTA trains gliding through the sky? How much did the MTA pay for that piece of fiction? As impressive as the action scenes are, they just don't work with the rest of the film.<br /><br />At about two hours and fifteen minutes, the film is way too long. The first part is good, but at 45 minutes, it seems like a major portion of the film. When the chase begins and it then lasts for over an hour, you start squirming in your seats. Alarmingly, Bay even stops the chase at one point for Johansson to watch her own Calvin Klein Perfume commercial in a shop window. Huh?<br /><br />Both of the lead actors are acceptable, but I expect so much more from both. McGregor has been in a series of very good independent and foreign films. He is a very good actor and in "The Island", he manages to convey Lincoln's naivet&eacute; and curiosity well. What he doesn't manage to do is convince us that he can suddenly outwit a band of mercenaries chasing him. As Jordan, Scarlett Johansson takes a real step back. This is the type of role Jessica Biel would be good at. Standing around, looking good, like eye candy. In the film, someone exposes the two to Maxim magazine. Didn't Johansson do a spread for Maxim at one point? Basically, she acts like a living spread for Maxim throughout the entire film. She looks good standing next to McGregor's character and acts dumb throughout.<br /><br />The first part of the film shows that Bay can make a film about characters, with a story, and create a definite sense of time and place. Now, he simply has to stop second-guessing himself and allow this creative side to take over. Mr. Bay, you don't need to resort to elaborate freeway chases to tell a story. Throwing large wheels off the back of a truck at pursuing Cadillacs might make for a fun chase, but they aren't necessary in every film. You can do better, Mr. Bay. Remember "The Rock"? Excessive yes, but in a fun way.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>The Island (2005) is a big budget science fiction/action extravaganza directed by Michael Bay, that has the prodigious special effects, and breathtaking action sequences, that have become a trademark for many of Bay's recent films.  With lots of flash and glitter, and attractive leads in Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, there's plenty to dazzle the eye, but despite its positive attributes, the film seems to lack originality, realism, and a genuine heart.  Spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.<br /><br />Like most science fiction, The Island puts you in a particular reality.  The year is 2019, and the situation feels a lot like Logan's Run (1976), as a group of people dressed in uniforms, live in a controlled underground environment.  They believe that the outside world is uninhabitable, due to some kind of catastrophic disaster.  All they have to look forward to is winning a trip to `the island', supposedly a paradise.  Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) live in this reality, operated by Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), where nearly everything in their lives is governed by his rules.  Merrick Biotech is actually in the business of raising clones for wealthy clients, to provide them with `spare parts' to prolong their lives.  Clones are programmed to believe a fantasy, and have the intelligence of the average teenager, except that they are unaware of sex.<br /><br />Lincoln 6 (L6) discovers that instead of going to the island, his comrades are being killed and their bodies harvested for whatever parts are required.  Some females are used as child breeders.  Jordan Two (J2) is on her way to the Island, when L6 convinces her to run away, just as Merrick's security team closes in.  The pair escapes from the underground facility, and emerge in a desert area somewhere in Arizona.<br /><br />Clueless about the real world, the pair turns to McCord (Steve Buschemi) a worker at the Merrick facility who helps them to get on their way to Los Angeles, where J2's sponsor lives.  The plan is to have clone and client meet, and find a way to stop Merrick's operation.  To deal with the crisis, Merrick brings in mercenary Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) and his team to hunt down and recapture the runaways.<br /><br />There are plenty of fireworks and over the top action, as the clones evade Laurent's men in Los Angeles.  Among them is a crazy freeway chase reminiscent of Bad Boys II, a fake looking jet bike ride through the crowded skies of LA, and a ridiculous escapade on the side of an office building.  It's a thrill ride, but one without any real sense of danger.  Things do get more interesting when L6 and the real Lincoln come face to face, but once again the plot takes an overdramatic ridiculous turn.  The film's conclusion features a couple of twists, but is still pretty silly and pretentious, as L6 reenters the facility.  Merrick's world comes crashing down, and the once doomed clones run free in the desert, again reminiscent of the finish to Logan's Run.<br /><br />While The Island scores points for its technical achievements, the overload of special effects doesn't compensate for a story that fails to generate actual tension, and make a real emotional connection.  Part of the reason for this is because the clones don't think like real humans.  Johansson and McGregor aren't robots, but they aren't quite real either, and the story fails to connect on a basic human level.  We are supposed to feel joy that clones are set free, but why isn't entirely clear.  It doesn't help that most of the human characters are cartoonish and one dimensional.  Sean Bean and Djimon Hounsou are certainly capable of much more.  Steve Buschemi as McCord, is the only major character with any real personality.<br /><br />Michael Bay's commentaries are typically very articulate and informative, and that is again the case here, although he's a bit more conservative with his words.  You won't get much critical examination of the plot, but he defends product placement, and covers some interesting technical points.  High gloss science fiction with some outrageous thrills and special effects, The Island is a lightweight fantasy that is visual treat, without much of a heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2005's Sci-Fi thriller "The Island" features Ewan McGregor as Lincoln Six-Echo and Scarlett Johansson as Jordan Two-Delta, residents of a high-tech facility in which "special" humans are sheltered from "contamination" in an unseen outside world.  The residents lead a simple regimented life like overgrown school children; their health, diets, and activities are closely monitored, and they are discouraged from asking questions.<br /><br />Lincoln Six-Echo develops an unhealthy curiosity in the outside.  On a fateful excursion through a service tunnel, he discovers the residents are "product", living tissue banks paid for by wealthy clients of a bio-tech corporation.  He and Jordan Two-Delta make a break for the outside, just ahead of ruthless armed mercenaries sent by the head of the corporation (Sean Bean in full-on doctor with a god-complex mode).<br /><br />The long, breathless escape sequence at the core of the movie is filled with exciting stunts and astonishing special effects.  The struggle of Lincoln Six-Echo and Jordan Two-Delta to adapt to an unfamiliar world is the source of some humor and a touching bonding experience.  Their escape will, however, lead them to tough choices.<br /><br />"The Island" gets off to a slow start before going into stunt overdrive.  This reviewer wishes two superb actors had spent less time running and been given more time to explore.  "The Island" is highly recommended as an interesting, exciting and entertaining sci-fi movie experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>The Island / B000BO0LH2<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />Love him or hate him, you generally know what you're getting into with a Michael Bay movie: lots of action, quite a few cliched one-liners, and at least one or two plot holes so big you could drop a cow through them. And I don't mean that in a bad way - fun, mindless action is a valid and amusing way to spend a weekend evening. "The Island" is a step above many Michael Bay movies, though, in possessing a very thought-provoking philosophy underneath all the explosions and whizzing bullets.<br /><br />Not that the plot holes don't impinge heavily, of course. The clones being grown for extra parts are kept placid and calm with hypnotic suggestions that they want to go to the island, that they live to go to the island, that they don't need to think or question their surroundings. While the issue of "Why don't you just grow them in a vat?" is touched upon and discarded (the organs need stimulus in order to thrive), one wonders perhaps why they don't just give up this whole island scheme and just hypnotize the clones to want to serve as useful and happy organ donors. I can hear the objection of human survival instincts, but there have been plenty of death cults in the history of humanity and it seems like it wouldn't be too tricky to engineer one in this situation. Then you would have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345418921">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a> situation where you can cut right through the issue of "is it moral to eat meat?" by having a cow that actually *wants* to be eaten, and is capable of saying so to the expensive clients.<br /><br />But I digress, and really "The Island" is better as a metaphor for the current debate as to whether poor people should be allowed to sell their own organs in order to support their families. In this metaphor, "going to the island" would mean giving up your life to provide a better one for your family, and in this case the whole "but they are human, too!" rejoinder cuts just as harshly (if not more so) as with vat-grown clones.<br /><br />Realistically, though, any philosophy in "The Island" takes a firm back seat to the action. Male characters like fast things that go "vroom!" loudly, simply because they are male, and female characters are sweet and pretty and emotionally sensitive because that kind of stuff is handed out with the second X chromosome. But in true Michael Bay form, the excessive action is lavishly expensive action, and the special effects are spaced out with extremely good acting on the part of all the major actors. In light of all this, it's hard to get too nitpicky about the plot holes like the fact that memories are encoded into DNA and ancillary bad guys don't usually have major changes of heart at the last moment. View "The Island" for what it is - a pretty, if somewhat vacuous, destination that is worth a nice visit, even if you wouldn't want to live there.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>This thing is very noisy and the action, after a slow opening, is almost non-stop car chases, crashes, explosions, building collapses etc etc. After awhile, it all begins to look the same. And sound the same. Also, at 2 hours and 10 minutes, this is about 40 minutes too long to tell its story, which is rather simple. There is nothing to justify the length, other than, perhaps, the director's reluctance to leave yet more noise on the cutting room floor. At least ScarJo is something to look at. But why is Djimon Hounsou always dripping, just dripping, with sweat dripping offf his bald head, while no one else is? Hmm?</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />With a much higher focus on character than the usual Michael Bay film, The Island develops people (or clones) that the audience cares about and then runs them through a series of exciting chases and action set-pieces; something of a box-office bomb, this is a nonetheless Bay's most accomplished film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>Life underground is controlled. Everyone wears the same uniform and everyone has a specific job although they don't know the purpose of their jobs. There is a lottery to go to an island get away and all members look forward to this. What do they don't know is that the lottery winners coincide with policy holders needing a body part and that they are the prize.<br /><br />We both liked this futuristic action about a society of clones who live under ground without knowing who they are. Two of them learn that they are being grown for their body parts for the original host (who thinks they are vegetables) and escape into the outside world to let the real world know what's going on underground.<br /><br />Beautifully choreographed actions scenes, a good script and a great team of actors help pull off this movie that is somewhat reminiscent to the 70s cult classic Logan's Run. The Island raises the obvious question about how far we should go in cloning research and whether a line must be drawn, where, and just who gets to pick up the pen. I highly recommend this film for its entertainment value and thought provoking innuendo. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The concept behind `The Island' is one that, despite claims of forgery, is quite impressive.  In fact, with the initial concept the script could really have gone one of three ways.  It could have been worked into a thinking man's film, ala `Children of Men' and really been at the head of the Oscar race.  It could have become a strategically executed action film in the vein of, well just about every other Michael Bay film or it could have fallen flat of expectations and really dissolved all potential.  `The Island' decided to take the middle road, and while I would have loved to see this concept taken a little more seriously I can't complain about the outcome.  `The Island' may very well be Michael Bay's best film, although `Armageddon' is still stupendous in my opinion.  Aside from a brilliant synopsis, `The Island' also sports some mind-blowing special effects and some sincere and unexpected performances, especially when you take the genre into account.  Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are two brilliant actors and so casting them in this brand of action film was a smart idea.  This film is more than just your typical `blow stuff up' action film for it has heart and moral and emotions and getting two actors who are capable of pulling that off was essential.  I really don't care what others may say, Scarlett Johansson is above and beyond our finest young actress working today.  Anyone who disagrees is just jealous in my opinion.<br /><br />So I'm ranting and raving about this concept and still I've really said nothing about it.  Well here it goes.  The Island itself is the last livable surface upon the Earth, a beautiful and serene garden where only a select few have the chance of dwelling.  In fact, all of Earth's remaining survivors of the `contamination' are dwelling within a facility completely sealed off from the outside world.  Here they await their selection (via lottery) to leave the facility for life on the island.  The truth behind this though is that these so-called survivors are not even human.  No, the place in which they dwell is not holding grounds for human survivors but a breeding ground for human clones, clones contained and harvested for spare parts.  The lottery selecting the `survivor' heading to `the island' is really sending the selected clone to his or her deathbed as they're essentially murdered and dissected so their human sponsors can live on.<br /><br />The clones are oblivious to the real goings on of the facility, but they have their speculations and questions that continue to go unanswered.  There is one clone in particular though that has more than a few questions and theories.  Lincoln Six Echo is suffering from strange dreams of a past he can't quite remember.  When he oversees an act of violence that raises a few flags and explains a few concerns he quickly puts the pieces together to realize that this island is not the promised paradise but a reward not worth attaining.  When the lovely Jordan Two Delta is selected to leave he has to work fast to save her life, putting his own in danger.  With the help of an employee to the facility, McCord, both Lincoln and Jordan escape and enter the real world, a world which they know nothing of.  They are soon pursued by bounty hunters while they struggle to find their sponsors in an effort to attain their freedom.  They journey is harrowing, exciting and intense.<br /><br />The action sequences are astonishing and beautiful to watch and the chemistry between McGregor and Johansson is phenomenal.  The rest of the cast is also well rounded.  Steve Buscemi is fine as McCord.  He has this way about him that makes him almost an essential actor, like any other actor wouldn't do.  My wife hates him but I think he's greatly unappreciated.  Sean Bean is fantastic as the villain Merrick.  He plays a good brand of evil.  Djimon Hounsou is one of my favorite new actors (well, not really `new' but `newer') and here he does a fine job.  In fact his performance as bounty hunter Albert Laurent effortlessly portrays the emotions needed for the pivotal role.  I really want to see this actor shine in years to come.  He's displayed the ability to (in films like `Gladiator' and `In America') but he's also been embraced for less impressive performances (ala `Blood Diamond') so hopefully he'll settle down on perfection and move forward from there.<br /><br />One performance I wanted to mention was Michael Clarke Duncan's only because it's so short yet so brilliant.  The act of violence Lincoln Six Echo sees involves the murder of Duncan's character Starkweather, and his performance therein is phenomenal.<br /><br />So, there is a lot of good to look forward to when watching `The Island'.  It's a brilliantly orchestrated science fiction action film that lives up to Michael Bay's name, but it also features some warm and textured performances that help aid in the emotional relevancy of the material.  Sure, it could have gone another route and maybe have been technically a `better' film, but it surely excels in the route is takes and for that we can all be thankful.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I had the opportunity to watch this film the other day and though it was okay. I've took it as another movie that has something desperately to say along with a long line of other frustrating Hollywood thrillers. There are a number of things that is good here but the bad brings down the entire experience. The underlying problem with this movie is Michael Bay. He has missed the mark yet again. The Island starts out as an engaging, entertaining Sci-Fi film. Then, about halfway through, it gets Bayified. Guns, explosions, chases, and actors yelling "run" over and over again.<br /><br />The movie starts out in a futuristic world where everybody dresses alike, lives in a contained environment, and believe that their only salvation is the prospect of getting to 'The Island', the only place in the world where life still flourishes. Well, as we all should know by now, "life finds a way". Lincoln, played by Ewan McGregor, starts to get curious about who he is and why he lives the way he does. Why can't he have bacon? Why is Tuesday always tofu night? Why does he always have to wear white, even after Labor Day. He has a "friendship" with Jordan, played by Scarlett Johannson. This could have been a movie in itself as these characters begin to understand who they are, or what they are, and why they live the way they do. Instead, about 30 minutes into the film, Lincoln discovers the big secret, grabs Jordan, yells "run!!", and the Michael Bay film begins. Don't get me wrong I love action, but it's like Orange Juice, it's much better smooth and pure, than processed and stagnant.<br /><br />So, what's good in this movie? First, McGregor is good as both Tom Lincolns and you can tell them apart base on blond highlights. Secondly, I liked the fact that they realized that 2019 isn't that far away, so L.A. looks different, but not that different. There are familiar buildings, cars, brand names, etc. Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan and Djimon Honsou are all solid, not surprisingly. The movie has some funny moments, such as Lincoln getting worried when he's told his friend is "in the can". I know film-making technology has really come along way, but the scenes involving both Lincoln characters are so well done that you forget there's only one actor on the screen.<br /><br />What was bad to me in this film was Scarlett Johannson. I though she was completely wasted in this movie. It is by no means her fault. There is no character for her to play. The movie literally could have existed without the character of Jordan. She's basically there to look good in each scene. I liked Honsou as the tough; no nonsense operative out to retrieve the missing clones, but of course there ends up being more to his character. Otherwise, Honsou never would have been in this movie. And of course, there's the Bay factor. There are only so many times that characters can survive car wrecks, and falls from great heights, and bullets just missing them. It just gets old, and the box office reflects that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Michael Bay has a lot of good movies under his umbrella. However, whether producing or directing, greatness has eluded him. The aversion to greatness held true under his direction of The Island.<br /><br />The Island is a good movie. Tons of action. Funny moments. Good suspense. And good acting by A-list actors. It's has a very cool story concept....<br /><br />It's too bad that cool story concepts with clever twists are often ruined for viewers that have not yet seen a film by reviewers that think it's a good idea to tell the story of what happened in a movie instead of giving thoughts on whether it is worthy of viewing. The neat little plot twist in The Island is so "out" that most viewing this movie already know the strange intricacies of the world that the two stars live in.<br /><br />Kudos to Michael Bay for not divulging the twist in the trailers to the movie.<br /><br />Hopefully you're reading this, and only this, as your basis to view, because I won't spoil it for you. I will say that Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor are excellent in their rolls as two escapees from an isolated colony designed to keep out the contaminations of a world gone bad.<br /><br />McGregor and Johansson flee through a futuristic city into extremely over the top situations where they survive what no else could possibly survive through. And this sensational, death defying ability of the two to stay alive really takes away from what could have been a much more realistic look at a possibility of something that could happen in the not too distant future.<br /><br />At least if the plot has already been ruined for you, the movie's entertainment value is not completely lost. It's a fun movie to watch that you can catch on cable as of this writing; no need to buy or rent unless you don't get any of the pay channels.<br /><br />So if you've got no new movies to look at in your queue and you see that there's a showing of The Island in your On Demand service...go for it. It's time well spent watching some Survivors getting cast off to Exile Island.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>Well, I thought this movie was going to be a rip off of various other sci-fi thrillers about the future, and it wasn't totally. Taking place in the not to distant future, Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlett Johannsen are two people living in a "colony" after the earth had a big contamination that just about killed everything.  Their goal in life, to win the colonies lottery and go to the Island, the only part of earth that supposidly was left to repopulate.  Well, after making friends with a colony worker (steve bushemi, Ewan mcgregor begins to question exactly what is outside the colony.  He discovers the whole thing is a scam, and he take Scarlett and escapes, and the chaise is on.  I won't fill in any more details, but it's worth a rental at least, but consider bying it. It got decent action and a fair story.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>The Island, the latest Michael Bay film, released in the summer of 2005 had a lot going against it.  First, it was a Michael Bay film.  Second, it had an original plot and was not a sequel or a remake.  Third, the title "The Island" seemed ambiguous.  I think this is definitely a movie you should check out.<br /><br />The first act is captivating, the world where these people live.  They work, eat, and live in an isolated area on the earth to protect them from the contaminated earth atomosphere.  At random times, a lottery is held to determine a winner.  This winner gets to go to the island, the last safe place on earth.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor as Lincoln and Scarlett Johanssen as Jordan are friends.  Jordan's name is drawn.  Before she departs for the island, Lincoln discovers something is drastically wrong.  She isn't going to the island, she is going to die.  Lincoln and Jordan escape and must be tracked down before the secret about the Island can be revealed.  The movie then procedes to be a standard action thriller with a few touching moments.  McGregor and Johanssen are great and this movie is worth watching for their performance and for the first act of the movie.  If the emotional ramifications of the Island, specifically Jordan's phone conversation with a little boy, had been explored more, this would have been even a better movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I had heard that this movie didn't do all that well at first at the box office. I had really low expectations. After watching it I must say that I thought it was pretty good and had some really entertaining action sequences. It kind of reminded me of a Bruckhiemeer version of THX 1183. Scarlett Johansen and Ewan McGregor were both excellent in their roles. It had all the twists and turns that any movie involving the complexities and moral questions of cloning should have.<br /><br />I liked it. Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Ewan McGregor plays a man who lives in a futuristic society that he believes is the world today. Everyone is lead to believe that the air outside is poison. Yet one lucky person at a time wins a so called trip to a place called the Island. McGregor uncovers that it's more like a trip to the surgery room where you're sacrificed to give someone the liver they need or any other body part. When his friend  played by Scarlett Johansson wins a trip there, he realizes he needs to get the both of them the hell out of there.<br /><br />  That's when the film turns into an action packed ride. The beginning is more of a brilliant sci-fi thriller and both parts work although they're basically like watching 2 different movies. In the outside world they realize what they've been missing. They see that the air isn't poison and that they're actually the clones of people in the real world. People who are waiting for their organs in-order to survive. Since they're clones they have feelings too and while on the run they also plan to expose the cloning facility to the entire world. Since not everyone knows about the place.<br /><br />  Michael May had some clunky and pointless car chases in Bad Boys 2 and here he gives us the best highway car chase since the Matrix Reloaded. Yet this film made farless money than Bad Boys 2 or any of Bay's other bad films when it's by far better. It's even by far the best clone movie. It's way better than The 6th Day or Godsend. If there's cloning going on so people can get a liver transplant while clones are getting false hope. The movie makes you against cloning and we know there's attempts in cloning going on since we hear it on the news from time to time. The movie gives you a strong message while being entertaining and fun the entire time. Newsday just dis-missed the film with one star but no way is this a one star movie. It is a little long but I never had a problem sitting through this film, it had my attention the entire time. It was one of the summers best and I like everyone else missed out on it to see other movies that just aren't as good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Island brings to the screen the story of a man and a woman who flee a secret facility, which produces clones for "spare parts."  At first it might seem like an improbable scenario, but Hollywood has been noted to foresee events before (e.g. Wag the Dog-instead of Albania it was Yugoslavia, The Day after Tomorrow-instead of ice it's hurricanes, Deep Impact-instead of a tidal wave hitting the USA it hits Indonesia and Sri Lanka, Outbreak-instead of the Ebola-like virus it's SARS and/or the bird flu, etc).<br /><br />Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The first half of the movie is really good, but the second half is a bit of a disappointment with its unnecessary and extremely long car chases and explosions.<br /><br />In addition the whole escape sequence from the facility was rather unrealistic even for a sci-fi movie.<br /><br />Aside from that, the plot and the setting, are both excellent!  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.<br /><br />Overall, even though The Island lacks that extra something to put it over the top, it is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>This movie, because it's a "Summer, Sci-Fi/Action" flick, will probably do extremely well at the box office, if for no other reason than the fact that Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are in the cast.  Regrettably, however, even after it's been out for awhile it will probably never reach as wide and diverse an audience as it deserves until it's release on DVD, when-- hopefully-- positive word of mouth recommendations will lead those who usually avoid this particular genre to it.  Because "The Island," directed by Michael Bay, is a cautionary, thought-provoking tale set in the not-so-distant future that holds a mirror up to our current society and poses some serious questions about moral judgement and how unmitigated secrecy on the part of institutions and those we "should" be able to trust affects us all on a daily basis that is especially relevant in today's world.<br /><br />The story concerns the survivors of a "contamination" who must dwell within a seemingly sterile, self-contained city where their happiness is paramount to those in charge, while at the same time their only hope for the future is to be the next lottery winner, which would afford them a one-way ticket to the last uncontaminated place on earth, The Island.  And to tell it, director Bay, no stranger to action films with such offerings as "The Rock," "Armageddon" and "Bad Boys I&II" under his belt, has drawn upon myriad other classics of the genre and used the collective threads to successfully weave his own story and imprint it with the kind of metaphor that elevates it beyond the next action sequence or explosion.  A comparison to "Logan's Run" goes without question, along with an obvious nod to "Blade Runner," a smattering of "The Matrix" and even a pinch of "Star Wars."  Which is not to say this is a "copy" of any of those; it definitely is not.  Bay has merely-- and wisely-- drawn upon some of the more successful elements of those films, and in most instances expanded upon them, to deliver a memorable film that far surpasses the genre's usual board of fare.<br /><br />Arguably, this is Michael Bay's best overall film to date.  Though he has demonstrated in the past that he knows how to do action, he has outdone even himself with this one.  There is one heart-stopping scene, for example, involving a number of vehicles and helicopters that eclipses even the highly touted freeway sequence of the second "Matrix" film.  The F/X are top notch, and once the action begins in earnest, he sets a pace that builds the excitement without allowing it to lay or lapse even for a second, right up to the very end.  Add to that the fact that this film really has something to say, and it will make you appreciate what Bay and his company of actors and technicians have accomplished here even more.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as Lincoln Six Echo, using his boyish charm, good looks and manner to lend the necessary credibility of innocence to his character.  The charismatic Scarlett Johansson finds just the right note, as well, to bring her character, Jordan Two Delta, to life.  Bay gives each of his actors, in turn, a moment in which to define their respective characters and underscore the plausibility of the film, and when that time comes they each succeed in a way that sustains the interest in the story beyond the action and the F/X.  Excellent performances by both McGregor and Johansson.<br /><br />In a supporting role, Steve Buscemi adds color to the proceedings as McCord, the man with the answers to a number of questions Lincoln Six has been asking about their environment and way of life; questions to which others in positions of authority respond with guarded circumspection, among them Merrick, one of the apparent caretakers of the city.  Played by Sean Bean, Merrick is one of the pivotal characters of the film, and while Bean's performance is decent, it lacks the nuance that could have taken it to a much higher level.  As it is, while effective to an extent, it is a fairly lackluster and generic portrayal.<br /><br />The excellent supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Starkweather); Ethan Phillips (Jones Three Echo); Brian Stepanek (Gandu Three Echo); Noa Tishby (Community Announcer); and Siobhan Flynn (Lima One Alpha).  For most, "The Island" will be an exciting summertime diversion; but for those who pay attention to the underlying social and political significance of the story, the rewards will most likely exceed any and all expectations.  And that's the magic of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Set in the year 2019, "The Island" provides yet another dystopian view of the future, one in which mankind must grapple with ethical questions specifically related to how he will use the technology he's created.  In this case, it  has to do with human cloning and how far we are willing to go to prolong our own hitherto limited life spans - and at whose expense.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are two young people living in a hermetically sealed world after some sort of global "contamination" has ostensibly rendered the majority of the outside world uninhabitable (all except an island paradise that the people living here can travel to if they are lucky enough to win it as a prize in a lottery).  Recently, however, McGregor has come to question many of the "truths" he sees in the world around him, wondering if there isn't some other, more sinister and diabolical explanation than the one he has been given by the powers-that-be, who monitor and run virtually every aspect of not only his life but the lives of those living and working alongside him.<br /><br />Watching "The Island" is a bit like riding on a train that runs along smoothly for the most part, yet keeps jumping off the tracks at frequent and inconvenient intervals.  You eventually arrive at where you're going, but there's an awful lot of frustration and delay in getting there.  When the screenplay concentrates on the moral and ethical implications raised by its brave-new-world premise, the film is often incisive, thoughtful and compelling.  Yet, as this is a Michael Bay film, the audience can't be allowed to become TOO thoughtful, so the filmmaker loads on one lame action scene after another to the point where the issues become buried under all the pyrotechnics.  Every so often those issues manage to rise again to the surface only to be pushed back down by seemingly endless high speed car chases, earsplitting explosions and shattering glass that cascades in slow motion streams onto hero, villain and innocent bystander alike.<br /><br />McGregor and Johansson aren't given much to do in the way of acting in the film, but Steve Buscemi manages to create something of a genuine character in the few scenes he is given.  The art direction and set design are highly impressive and the over-the-top action scenes are admittedly well mounted and executed, even though they wind up weakening the movie.  Yet, just when you're about to give up on it, "The Island" manages to climb back onto the rails and get you interested in it again.  That's actually something of a step forward for Mr. Bay.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>The big thing about "The Island" is...there is no island. It's just a ploy to lure unsuspecting clones to their deaths. The year is 2014 and a corporation has developed a method to produce human clones. The clones have been led to believe that the Earth has been contaminated, which is why they're all being quarantined indoors. Every so often the facility has a lottery drawing, and one lucky winner is offered the chance to go to "the island," which is supposedly the one place on the planet that hasn't been destroyed.<br /><br />One of the clones, Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) finally discovers the truth when his friend Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) is chosen as a lucky lottery winner...in order to protect her from being killed, he convinces her to break out of the facility and find out the truth behind their existence. A man who Lincoln befriended at the facility (Steve Buschemi) informs the clones that they are only several years old and have been implanted with the memories of their "owners"...filthy rich people who paid a fee of $5 million apiece to have clones provided as "insurance policies."<br /><br />Unfamiliar with their new surroundings, Lincoln and Jordan set off to find their owners and enlist their help in bringing down the cloning facility. They manage to avoid being captured killed by the facility cronies, the FBI, and the LAPD, and Lincoln finally comes face to face with his owner, Tom Lincoln (also played by Ewan McGregor). Unfortunately for Lincoln, his owner isn't thrilled about the fact that his insurance policy just wandered into his living room, and Lincoln and Jordan have to take it upon themselves to try and stop the mastermind of the cloning facility (Sean Bean) from killing more innocent "copies."<br /><br />"The Island" is both a great action/sci-fi movie and a very emotional story about two people who are forced to examine the purpose and validity of their own existence. McGregor and Johannson deliver superb performances and have great onscreen chemistry. I also enjoyed the chemistry that McGregor has with...himself! The scenes between Lincoln and Tom were very enjoyable. (It would have been nice to see Jordan's character encounter her owner in person, but the movie is over 2.5 hours long, so there really wasn't any room for extra footage.) The cinematography is also very impressive: in typical Michael Bay style, many of the scenes flash by in extremely fast sequences, which is unique and really sets the film apart from other action movies.<br /><br />In an age where cloning is a very hot topic, "The Island" definitely raises some interesting questions. There are a few cheesy moments in the film (such as when Sean Bean borrows a line from Cliff Huxtable in "The Cosby Show"...that was so lame!), and the first 40 minutes of the movie drag a bit. Things pick up quickly when Lincoln and Jordan finally manage to escape the cloning facility: from then on it's nothing but non-stop action and adventure.<br /><br />Overall, "The Island" is a very interesting sci-fi thriller, and those are pretty hard to come by these days. Fans of McGregor and Johansson will be treated to great performances by two very fine actors, and the plot will give you plenty to talk about when you go out for drinks after the film. :)</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>The outside world's no longer safe<br /><br />For human beings to dwell<br /><br />Polluted, dead and out of bounds<br /><br />It's no more than a shell<br /><br />Inside, a whole new world is formed<br /><br />All sterile, white and clean<br /><br />Utopia it seems to be,<br /><br />Each day the same routine<br /><br />But every week there is a draw<br /><br />Around a central theme<br /><br />The lucky winner's Island-bound<br /><br />It's every person's dream<br /><br />Then one day Lincoln Six wakes up<br /><br />And finds he's lost a shoe<br /><br />He's having dreams about a boat,<br /><br />and even drowning too<br /><br />The sensors say his diet's wrong<br /><br />And cut back on his bacon<br /><br />He meets the $exy Jordan Two<br /><br />and something starts to waken<br /><br />He starts to find out for himself<br /><br />The truth behind the lies<br /><br />No one sees he's out of bounds<br /><br />Because he's in disguise<br /><br />By accident he learns the truth<br /><br />That shocks him to the core<br /><br />He and Jordan fly the coop<br /><br />And learn there's so much more<br /><br />It seems the rich have found a way<br /><br />To cheat Death while he's reaping<br /><br />They buy insurance policies<br /><br />And store them for safekeeping<br /><br />This movie's full of gaping holes<br /><br />Its plot's a slice of Swiss<br /><br />and if you think a little bit<br /><br />you'll find something's amiss<br /><br />A mish mash of a dozen films<br /><br />It's Product Placement Day!<br /><br />Errors run throughout this tale<br /><br />But otherwise, okay<br /><br />Amanda Richards, March 10, 2006</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I was very impressed with this movie, mostly because I can't understand why so many critics bashed it, so I walked into it not really expecting much and about half-way through I thought to myself "the critics were VERY wrong".  I have to say, I've never been too impressed with Ewan McGregor's acting abilities, I mean, he's been decent in a few films, but this movie is the movie he was born to do...His charactor is so alive, so interesting and very well played, unlike is Obi-Wan who is just plain boring.  The plot of the film is this.  There is a facility hosting the last remaining humans after the world has been contaminated and everything has died.  SO these humans are awaiting their trip to 'THE ISLAND' whch is the last uncontaminated natural habitat and they can only win their trip to the Island via a lotery that is run each week.  Lincoln (McGregor), like everyone else is just waiting his turn, until his besst friend Jordan (Johansson) is chosen to leave for the Island.  After doing a little snooping around Lincold see's something that disturbs him enough to where he realizes that this Island is not real.  So thus he grabs Jordan before she meets her doom and they escape.  Upon hearing the truth (they are clones) from a friend McCord (Buscemi) they set on a course to find their sponsers.  They do find Lincolns sponser, Tom Lincoln and they try to attain his help to show the world what is happening in this facility, that they are creating living humans and then killing them for spare parts.  The movie is a great thrill ride, with excellent performances by McGregor and Djimon Hounsou who is really proving himself to be a great actor (see, Gladiator and the 4 Feathers).  I was a little unimpressed with Johanssons charactor but that was just a lack in writing there....she is a very talented actress and gave this her all.  I just have to say that this movie is far more than just an action film.  This movie has heart and has a great moral.  It shows that humans really will do anythin to survive, and it stresses the point that you can't trust anyone, but in the end, you realize that the people you deem least likely will be there for you 100%.  In the wise words on Miss Johansson, "The Island is real, it's us!"</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Had the writers and director of THE ISLAND been able to sustain the fascinating first half hour of this flimsy film, the result might have been an enlightening examination of the current discussion of cloning.  But as soon as the movie captures our attention it fizzles and what is left is two and a half hours of noisy endless destructive chase sequences that put this reviewer to sleep.<br /><br />Using fine actors like Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson and Sean Bean one would think more attention would have been paid to a good script.  They have us in the beginning as we slowly come to realize that this space-age environment is not the 'rescue place' from the end of the world by contamination, but rather a very expensive human cloning lab where wealthy people up on top of the subterranean lab life have paid huge sums of money to have duplicate donors on whom to rely for organs and integument  as age begins to erode their own.  Every 'person' in the lab (thinking that they are waiting transfer to the Garden of Eden Island of the title) is actually a manufactured copy of the owners topside.<br /><br />Well, not all secrets can remain hidden and McGregor follows a butterfly to discover the truth about the venture and the rest of the tale is McGregor's and Johansson's escape into the world above in search of their 'real' counterparts.  Once on the surface of the earth the movie goes downhill fast in a mixture of special effects and destruction derby that it just loses all interest.  This is a movie that only avid fans of McGregor and Johansson will want to see - because there is little else to recommend it!  Grady Harp, December 05</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>While watching Michael Bay's sensory and action orientated overkill, The Island, I was struck by how derivative the film is. It's actually a direct rip off of the book Logan's Run and the 1976 film of the same name, which starred Michael York and Jenny Agutter, the similarities are too obvious to miss - we have a hermetically sealed, insular world, a hero who decides that he wants more and ends up questioning his environment, and a daring, tension filled escape. I'm just amazed that author, William F. Nolan hasn't screamed "lawsuit!"<br /><br />The Island is almost schizophrenic in tone and theme. The first half of the movie is a creepy, sparse, and chilling science fiction parable, while the second half is a high-octane storm of bullets, car chases, and multiple explosions. Both work well as separate movies, but perhaps don't sit particularly well as a whole. It seems as though Bay, burns up his ideas in the first hour and pads out the rest of the movie with joltingly repetitive and over the top action sequences which look as though they would be best suited to another film.<br /><br />It's the year 2019, and Lincoln Six Echo (a strangely bland Ewan McGregor) is one of several hundred survivors of a catastrophe that left the whole world contaminated, save one place - the illusive and sort-after Island. This lush retreat, Lincoln and the other refugees are promised, will one day be their home. For now, they're kept in a lavish but sterile research facility, where they are treated as "special" and their every whim catered too.<br /><br />But from the outset we know that all is not right, that these people are not what they seem. An aura of creepiness surrounds the facility as the authorities force the inhabitants to wear identifying wrist bracelets, carefully monitor their moods, diet and metabolism; and strictly forbid male-female "proximity." Suspicious by nature and prone to prophetic nightmares, Lincoln finds his worst fears confirmed after Starkweather (Michael Clarke Duncan), is selected by random lottery to go to the Island.<br /><br />When Lincoln's friend and burgeoning love interest, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), is the next one to win the lottery, Lincoln grabs her and together they stage a jailbreak. Alarmed by the breach, sinister mastermind Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) hires a mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) to hunt them down. The fugitives make their way to Los Angeles where they manage to elude their pursuers and survive one close call after another.<br /><br />While the narrative is pretty generic and there aren't that many surprises - viewers will learn pretty early on what the menacing doings of the research facility are, one is left to admire the slick, glossy and obviously expensive production design. The biotech facility, in particular, suggests a cross between a day spa, a spaceship, and a maximum-security prison, all sleek and gleaming with its inhabitants walking around in shiny white space suits.<br /><br />The most visually spectacular sections are when the couple land in Los Angeles, with the city's current skyline given a futuristic, dazzling feel. Los Angeles locals will get a kick out of seeing that in a future Los Angeles, all the traffic problems have been solved, with gleaming, fast sky rail trains traversing about the newly revitalized downtown streets. But even here, Bay's direction zips along at such an un-modulated rush, so eager to get on with the next set piece or expository line of dialogue, that we have precious little time to soak up all the startling images.<br /><br />The Island is one of those movies that come across as so studio manufactured and contrived, with product placements abounding and the usual vertiginous headache inducing camera movements. In terms of spectacle, the movie is a pileup of kinetic mayhem, as Lincoln and Jordan's first actions in the real world include dodging bullets, destroying several police cars, and crashing a hovercraft into a skyscraper. It all becomes rather silly and preposterous after awhile.<br /><br />McGregor and Johansson are talented, charismatic performers, but their characters are essentially blank slates and not very interesting. You could do a pretty good movie just about the learning curve of these people thrust into an unfamiliar environment, but this just isn't it. The film does introduce some thought-provoking issues about morality and the use of humans for malevolent ends, but this thought is ultimately the last thing on The Island's mind. It's more interested in bang, boom, and multiple car chases. Mike Leonard December 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VMT89TCSF105.html">A2VMT89TCSF105</a><br/><p>SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING!<br /><br />"The Island" is one of the better science fiction movies I've seen. It has obvious similarities with "The Matrix", "The Village" and "The 6th Day".<br /><br />The year is 2019. Humanity has been forced underground, due to an environmental disaster that contaminated most of the Earth. The underground society is crowded and authoritarian, with overseers regulating every detail of the citizens' lives. A mysterious place known as The Island is the only place on the surface that hasn't been contaminated. The only way to leave the underground compounds is to win a free ticket to The Island in a special lottery.<br /><br />However, the main character of the movie, Lincoln Six Echo, starts to suspect that something is terribly wrong with this futuristic society. He discovers that the outside world isn't contaminated. He also sees how two of the lottery winners, rather than being taken to The Island, are gruesomely murdered by the overseers! Bizarre cloning experiments take place in a secret part of the underground facility.<br /><br />Lincoln and another inmate, Jordan Two Delta, manage to escape from the underground base. Chased by black helicopters, they pass several ghost towns, but finally make their way to Los Angeles, which turns out to be a thriving, hyper-modern city with no contamination problems whatsoever. More bizarre revelations follow, until Lincoln and Jordan decide to return to the underground facility (really a prison) to free their friends from the clutches of the overseers...<br /><br />"The Island" got pretty mixed reviews when released in the United States. I agree that the movie lacks the magic that makes "The Matrix", "Blade Runner" or even "Star Wars" so special. Instead, we get a combination of two or three over-worked Hollywood themes: futuristic prison break-out, chase with special effects and cool wheels, and (surprise) a bunch of clones. Still, I'd say "The Island" is above average. Somehow, the stereotypes seem to work, and the plot is pretty interesting.<br /><br />For that reason, I give it five stars. And guys, watch out for the clones! :-)</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>After watching "The Island" I could not for the life of me figure out why more people were not talking about it, I dont think it was the critics reveiws because they (for the most part) praised the film. It definatly was not the lack of big name stars (it had Ewan Mcgregor & Scarlett Johanson...) or the asumed work of an unknown director (it was directed by widley known Director, Micheal Bay) and there was no way the people didnt go see it because of a lack of suspence or action! (it had a budget of around 120 million, most of which was spent on special effects and/or action...). Overall though if you really take a look, it was not that the film did'nt do well, because it did (grossing 160 million) but I really cant figure out why the United States only contributed to 35 million of that? I think that it is just that the box office is completely up in the air and can even be somewhat random..., there have been some major Box-office bombers, the most recent being Poseidon which lost tons, there have also been some films that have a budget of near nothing that gross over 100 million (some recent ones being Saw 2, March Of the Penguins and Napolean Dynamite).<br /><br />"The Island", though somewhat confusing and slow at the get go, really starts to speed in what makes for an excellent big-budget action adventure. The leading roles starring McCgregor & Johanson are very well played and the supporting cast does a decent job as well. Though it can appear to be somewhat jumbled as well as puzzling at the beginning it really comes together well. I thought that there was some very clever ideas and some comic relief throughout.<br /><br />Though I am sure alot of you dont know alot about the film, it is actaully quite well done and very smart. It could compete with several others for the honor of Best action flick of the Summer.<br /><br />Not Flawless but definatly worth a look.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>What a waste. Just because you add F/X to story that's been done before, doesn't make mediocre good.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3M93RRLFQNJ.html">A2F3M93RRLFQNJ</a><br/><p>After watching The Island, I had the feeling that somewhere director Michael Bay and the writers had a cookbook.  Following the instructions, they took the ingredients - a bunch of old movies - half-baked them and came up with a confection that should be awful but actually is decent, although not very nutritious.<br /><br />The Island takes place in a near-future world where a biotech company clones wealthy people so the customers can have new organs available when needed.  The clones are developed as adults and still require intellectual stimulation to maintain viability.  As a result, the clones live a regimented life in a secret city, laboring under the belief that the rest of the world is contaminated.  Occasionally, a clone wins the lottery that allows them to go to the Island, the last uncontaminated place on Earth; in reality, the excursion is merely to an operating room where they are cut up and their organs gathered.<br /><br />Ewan MacGregor plays Lincoln, a clone who has begun to question what is going on around him.  Along with Scarlett Johannsen's Jordan, they escape to the real world, with all sorts of paramilitary folk chasing them.  Thus we go from sci-fi to standard action flick:  lots of chases, gunfire and explosions.  In other words, while the first part of this movie may be thought-provoking, the second half is turn-off-your-brain time.  Not that that's bad.<br /><br />The most obvious influence on this movie is Logan's Run (especially the end), but there are other clear influences including THX 1138, Blade Runner, Minority Report and even Return of the Jedi (with a motorcycle chase scene).  So, this may not be the most original of movies, but somehow it works.  MacGregor and Johannsen are skillful enough to make us care about their characters, and when that happens, most of the rest falls into place.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>Just returned from watching this jam-packed action movie and was completely enthralled with the whole thing, not one minute of the 2.5 hrs. was boring -- nothing.  Of course, the stars Ewan MacGregor and Scarlett Johansson carried this movie from beginning to end; they were marvelous, and so good-looking.<br /><br />There is way too much in this movie to go into detail.  You've just got to see it and enjoy being transported to the future of our world via Amerithiotech, which at first seems to be a super modernistic approach to longevity and healthcare.  But producing clones who can live as real people is beyond the stretch of my imagination.  "Grow old along with me; the best is yet to be --- the last of life, for which the first was made, our times are in His hand." Robert Browning.<br /><br />They were grown in symbiolic wombs (water bags) and evolve into adult size doubles of the original for organ replacement or even skin grafts, allowing the sponsors to live sixty to seventy years longer -- at the cost of the clone.  One poor mother-to-be is used to produce an adopted baby serving as surrogate mother andis thusly euthenized.  She never gets to hold 'her' baby, but the real parents take 'their' baby home.  "Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies."<br /><br />The Sarah Jordon clone gets to see her 'son' on the picture phone out in L. A.  That place is truly fantastic with antennea on all the buildings like the batman building in Nashville. The L. A. Metro undergraound garage looks exactly like the stage portal in the Tennessee Theatre here.<br /><br />There was a real Tom Lincoln and the Scotland billionnaire takes the place of Lincoln 6 Echo in his V12 08 Caddy like an MG, only bigger.  There is no island, it is an underground bunker out in the desert of California along Route 39W.  This is the original body farm, to the higgest bidder.  Even the President of the United States has a clone just waiting.  The good actor who was so perfect in "The Green Mile" played Starkweather whose liver was taken -- after a fight for his life.<br /><br />In a way, this was a lot like the movie, "NO Escape," with the beautiful Rock of Gilbratar as an entranceway along the water in the dreams of Echo.  They encounter a rattlesnake, a truly scary scene in the long, long movie.  This was considered to be the HOly Grail of Science, but was more like the concentration camps in Germany with the attempted mass extinction of the defective clones.  The chicanery, wits, bravery and ability to think made these two special when they came out of Silo 3 to see the beautiful Earth for the first time.<br /><br />The chase across the bridge was 'something to see.'  And surviving the fall of the Big "R" sign from seventy stories high was a trip as they were caught in the net.  The main theme is that people will do anything to survive and to live longer.  The music at the end matched the fast action and left you feeling "Hey, this is the best movie I've seen in a long time."</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>This was a great film. The acting was decent and the plot was pretty neat. The action scenes are amazing! Michael Bay actually made a decent movie next to PEARL HARBOR.

This film is more of a Sci-Fi/Drama than it is an all out action assault that Michael Bay is known for. The acting is good from Ewan McGregor and Steve Buscemi, while Scarlett Johansson just looks beyond lovely as she always does. The chase scene towards the middle of the film is the highlight by far. I am just glad that Bay made a film that actually provides some food for the brain rather than just a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Island" was supposed to be a big Summer 2005 action movie, but it flopped at U.S. box offices. That's too bad, because this is a better film than director Michael Bay's 1998 action blockbuster "Armageddon", and it's a lot easier on the ear drums too. "The Island" did well in overseas box office. It's failure in the U.S. is blamed on poor marketing. The ads emphasized the film's nebulous themes instead of trying to sell it as an action movie. Mistake. The film's premise is interesting, although not actually plausible, but this is an action-packed game of chase. Themes aside, "The Island" is about an innocent young couple being pursued by evil-doers with big guns. A moderately interesting story and a talented cast make it that much better.<br /><br />In the year 2019, brilliant geneticist Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) provides needy people with organs and tissues cloned from their own DNA. Those who can afford to pay can replace organs lost to illness or injury with perfect clones. Unbeknownst to the clients, Dr. Merrick has been unable to produce suitable organs in vegetative clones. He clones the entire person and then destroys the clone when the organs are harvested. Merrick's Institute keeps an entire population of clones in an underground city under the pretense that they are survivors of a massive contamination of the planet, so they can't go outside. The Island is a single remaining "pathogen-free zone", and people get the opportunity to move there by lottery. Unfortunately for Merrick, some of the clones have developed greater intellect than he supposed. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) has begun to question his surroundings and developed a friendship with a young woman named Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johanssen).<br /><br />Since "The Island" is set in 2019, it has more advanced technology that we do -some of the ideas came from Microsoft's think tank- but it's close enough to us to have immediacy. The audience just has to take the clones' plight at face value. It defies logic but is provocative enough to add interest. The Institute's underground city is visually captivating, and director Michael Bay put together an impressive cast: Ewan McGregor plays duel, and opposite, roles. Scarlett Johanssen makes her dumb-but-determined character sympathetic. Quirky Steve Buschemi has a pivotal supporting role. And Sean Bean gives Dr. Merrick, who is confident in the righteousness of his agenda, sufficient stature. The action sequences run a familiar gamut, including helicopters with skyscrapers and an extended car chase, but they have some creative twists. "The Island" is really a solid action film that will appeal to anyone looking for adrenaline-pumping entertainment.<br /><br />The DVD (Dreamworks 2005): There is one featurette and an audio commentary by director Michael Bay. "The Future In Action" (15 minutes) is a documentary about shooting the film's action sequences, in particular the car chase and the giant "R" falling from the building. It includes interviews with director Michael Bay, the stunt coordinator, visual effects supervisor, and special effects supervisor, among others. In the audio commentary, Michael Bay provides scene-by-scene commentary for most scenes, focusing mostly on technical aspects of the film, such as production design, sets, the film's technologies, and challenges. There is also some commentary on cast, characters, and the film's box office problems. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>A box office disappointment in its theatrical release, one has to wonder why THE ISLAND didn't catch on.  Certainly director Michael Bay's best film, it has a sleek look, some amazing action sequences and special effects and likeable performances from Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson.  Is it a case of bad word of mouth from critics that halted its ascent?  One doesn't know, but THE ISLAND is entertaining and involving.  Along with its leads, it has some nice support from villainous Sean Bean and although his role is small and underdeveloped, Steve Buscemi is enjoyable as the clones' doomed ally.  It poses the question of just how far a person will go to avoid dying, and how clones could be thought of merely as Products to sell.  At any rate, I enjoyed THE ISLAND and recommend it to those who like their action fast and furious.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>A few weeks ago I went and saw the Island, which stars Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor and is directed by Michael Bay.  It's a movie which examines cloning as a practice to make spare body parts for humans.<br /><br />Not so good, not so bad.<br /><br />There is a thoughtful set-up for the movie.  A lot of big and little details are handled well, and in detail.  There was an attempt here to make more than just an action movie.<br /><br />The two main actors do well with the material they're handed.<br /><br />The plot is a little predictable: figure out the setup, grab the girl and escape, and then run-run-run while trying to get a better handle on the situation.<br /><br />However, it's a Michael Bay movie.  There's his typical directing style, which he brings as baggage to every movie he directs.  Which means...he's got a terrific eye for cinematography and colour, and you could stop any scene at any time, and remark to yourself that it looks great, even artistic.  Let the film, run, though, and it's choppy action, running from scene to scene without a pause for thought.  It's like a music video--made for those who have very little in the way of attention spans.<br /><br />We must be getting a little tired of this type of directing style, non?<br /><br />This is about equal to the other big summer dud, for me at least: War of the Worlds.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>First off, like alot of the movies I've reviewed on here, I picked this movie up in a bargain bin for cheap. What made me purchase it was the fact that this was a Michael Bay film(you know, the guy who directed the Transformers movies, for chirssakes). Reading the back of the DVD case, I figured this movie would be kinda boring so I put it down. Then, thank Heaven, I saw Scarlett Johannson's name on the cover. It was then that I decided the movie couldn't be all THAT bad(now could it?) with her in it so I bought it.<br /><br />The Island is about a private society where humans are cultivated for spare parts, surrogate parenthood, and full-body replacements for the wealthy. Yet, when two of the clones (Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johanssen) begin to question their existence and the motives of their keepers, they escape into the real world to find answers.  Sadly, though, their keepers are determined to see that they don't get away alive and that's when the real fun begins.<br /><br />I was completely blown away with the movie. For a mix of Sci-fi and Action, The Island more than delivers it in spades. It goes to show why Michael Bay is one of Hollywood's most talented directors(this side of Steven Spielberg). With every movie the man makes, the films continue to get better and better and better. That's what is important, a director needs to learn and continue to grow as a director. It's easy to see that this is one of Bay's best films, besides The Transformers and Armageddon. Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlett Johansson(who looks breathtaking in this film, I might add) deliver great performances as Lincoln 6 Echo and  Jordan 2 Delta.  The Island also stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean(a stellar cast, for sure).<br /><br />Sci-fi and Action fans take note, you're missing out on one great movie if you miss taking a trip to The Island.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Lincoln Six-Echo leads a very organized life.  His sleep is monitored.  His urine is checked so his diet can be adjusted.  Even his clothing is put up in his cabinet in an orderly utilitarian fashion.<br /><br />So, why does Six-Echo want to win the lottery and go to the island?  He's been told all his life that this is the place where the human race will continue and survive.<br /><br />And that's not quite a lie.  Lincoln Six-Echo and the others like him are living to continue the human race.  They're 'property' (aka clones), bought and paid for by the richest and wealthiest as an insurance policy against damage to their own persons.<br /><br />Initially, clients buying into the insurance were told that their clones would be kept in a persistent vegetative state; however, by the E generation, the scientists realized they needed to give the donors memory and awareness.<br /><br />And that's where the problem comes in.  Lincoln Six-Echo is dreaming of boats, learning Latin phrases when his lessons are deliberately kept at only a barely functional level.  He's gaining awareness--and memory that's not his.<br /><br />When Lincoln Six-Echo stumbles across the truth, he stops his best friend Jordan Two-Delta from going to the island and they both escape into the real world.  Their challenge is to find their sponsors and convince them to help them.<br /><br />But, the corporation that developed them will do anything to keep their business and keep the secret of the clones quiet.  That includes hiring a crack team of Ex-Special Forces agents to hunt down and kill the escapees.<br /><br />Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) leads the squad. He puts the two ill-prepared clones through their paces.<br /><br />"The Island" is fast-paced and very well done.  Imagery is beautifully filmed.  I honestly wish I had not missed this film on the big screen.  One of the best futuristic chase scenes, including cars, trucks, and helos is here.<br /><br />I was especially impressed with Ewan McGregor's performance as both Lincoln Six-Echo and Tom Lincoln. Very subtle moves convey the differences between the original and the copy.<br /><br />Overall, "The Island" is well worth the time to watch.  My half-star deduction is for a somewhat slow start.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) are workers in a recovering society.  They mindlessly go about their tasks for the greater good.  All this is necessary because they have been told that they are all that remains from an event that contaminated the Earth.  They are two of a few thousand that live in the compound.  All have a dream of winning a daily lottery that would give them a trip to The Island, "nature's last remaining pathogen-free zone."<br /><br />Lincoln begins to think that The Island is not what it seems, and when his best friend Delta wins the lottery, he wisks her away to find out the secret.  Aided by a technician named McCord (Buscemi), they soon find themselves on the run from a mercenary named Laurent (Hounsou) who was hired by Merrick (Bean),the doctor that runs the compound.<br /><br />"The Island" takes an interesting idea, and executes it poorly.  Directed by Jerry Bruckheimer's long-time lackey, Michael Bay, this feels like a Bruckheimer production despite him having nothing to do with the film.  Bay has Bruckheimer's style down pat, and the less movies made in this fashion, the better.  An interesting idea is lost amongst the action and special effects.  Sure the effects are good, especially a later scene in the movie where McGregor gets to act against himself, but effects alone do not make a movie.  Bay brings the mindless moviemaking that he is known for, and that is what makes the movie less than it could be.<br /><br />Bay has gone on record saying that perhaps the fault of the movie's dismal opening is due to the lack of star power in McGregor and Johansson, but they are solid actors doing the best they can with what they were given.  Buscemi is his usual quirky self as McCord, providing some chuckles.  Bean and Hounsou fill the roles of bad guys adequately.<br /><br />Another large problem with the movie is that what should be a main plot twist is given away in most of the previews.  I'm sure that this is meant to make the movie seem more interesting, but when seeing the movie, this revelation lacks any punch.  The previews for "The Island" are prime examples of what not to do when promoting a movie.<br /><br />In the end, fans of Bruckheimer-style movies will probably be satisfied.  Those looking for a little more than an interesting idea that is dumbed down for the sake of action and effects will be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Island" is great!

I'd say that this is quite exceptional summer junk.<br /><br />The premise is a bit far-fetched, but only a bit. There's a farm where the livestock have happy, contented lives, right up to the day they trot cheerily off to the slaughter. The consumers never get a look behind the closed doors, and never deal with the true cost of the 'product' they buy. The livestock are human, though. One wakes up to what's behind the life they lead, and escapes with another.<br /><br />That plot covers about the first 20% and the last 10% of the movie. Everything in the middle is a wild chase, trying to recover (or at least cover up) the escape. That part is an effects-fest. It has great running around, lots of stuff blowing up, and helicopter gunships tearing around downtown LA. This was supposed to be a quiet operation, right? That's why the scriptwriters picked the one city where a shootup like a small war could be considered normal.<br /><br />The running gunbattles are good: cars, trucks, helicopters, and something that looks like a jet-ski with extra jet and no ski. A few things arent' so good, though. At one point, the evil board of directors decides to cull the herd, sending four generations (i.e. four year's worth of human clones) to the abbatoir, a $200M writeoff. We learn, however, that each clone has a $5M retail price. Ignoring retail markup, that's a loss of 40 'products', which I take to mean ten per year. It looked like a whole lot more people than that down in the farm. But hey, they're scriptwriters, not accountants.<br /><br />If you ignore all the implausible stuff and the adrenaline-rich chase scenes, there is a real point here. No sane human cloning proponent intends for thinking, feeling people to be slaughtered. No rational cloning opponent would object to discarding a smear of skin cells in a petri dish. Society as a whole has to work this one out, to draw lines between what's ethical and what's not, and to make room for different people to draw different lines. One purpose of art is to interpret science, and exaggeration is a valid tool for achieving that purpose.<br /><br />Mostly, though, it's summer SF adventure flick. Enjoy.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Mimicking ideas and plotlines exposed better in 1970s movies such as "Soylent Green", "Logan's Run" and "Planet of the Apes", "The Island" is an action sci-fi flick about an underclass of people (clones, really) that don't know their role until a hero follows a bug up a pipeline and finds out the truth.<br /><br />Then, in a series of scenes very much like those we saw in another 1970s flick, "Coma", our hero runs away with the beautiful lead female and eventually makes everyone aware of what's happening.<br /><br />This oversimplistic description nevertheless captures just about all the originality of this movie, which seems pretty good for about 40 minutes until all the flicks you saw earlier in your life that deal with these issues start to spring to memory. Perhaps "Logan's Run", where the underground underclass discovers the real world and runs away to it, is the principal motivation for this film, which is clearly a sequel to a number of earlier flicks.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor is pretty good here in a dual role, in one of which he actually sounds like himself. But he is a shell of the actor that played the lead in "Trainspotting", a truly original movie where McGregor was directed in a way that fulfilled nearly all his capacity.<br /><br />The female lead, played by Scarlet Johanson, is even less realistic or artful. She is mainly given over to smiling in the film's first hour and making outlandish surprise looks after she and the hero find out what's going on.<br /><br />The final verdict on this movie: I watched it Saturday night, thought about all the movies it copied, and didn't remember anything about it Sunday morning. A half-hour conversation with my wife and 18-year-old granddaughter helped me remember enough to write this review.<br /><br />Chalk this up as another episode in the 'oughts (or 2000s or new century) efforts as sequel-prequel making in the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>It isn't often that you find a movie that is purely science fiction.  But here is one of them.  This is basically Logan's Run with 21st century special effects.<br /><br />I was warned by a lot of people to avoid this movie.  But I figured I'd give it a shot on a rental.  And I'm really glad I did as I found this to be a great science fiction find.  If you like technology driven science fiction then this movie is most definitely for you.<br /><br />The acting is great, particularly from Ewan McGregor who gets to play two roles in this movie.  The story has some holes and questions left open but I actually found it to cover the bases better than most other sci-fi movies.  If you are into explosions, then this movie will most definitely supply what you are looking for.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the story and plot.  It does a wonderful job of creating a futuristic "world" that is both new and yet still familiar.  The story deals with a topic that is under much debate, which is cloning.  While this will in no way convince anybody one way or another (except the extremely gullible), it is still interesting to look at cloning as presented by this movie.<br /><br />My only disappointment in this movie was a completely unnecessary love scene between Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson.  Unnecessary because it didn't add to the story, but even worst, it was contradictory to what we knew about the characters.  It served as nothing more than a distraction from the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I loved this movie.

Each has left a profound impression on me. The only thing unimpressive about The Island was the title-and even that objection evaporated once the introduction sequences started rolling; for suddenly the apparently vapid title acquired context and meaning. But it wasn't the snazziest title they could have come up with to draw people into the theaters.<br /><br />I'm not going to summarize the plot, since it's been discussed at length before. Instead, here are some points that need to me mentioned in order to do the film justice.<br /><br />The Island, if one feels bound to refer to other movies, is basically Logan's Run meeting Bladerunner. It asks some of the same questions; most significantly one of profound philosophical import: how do you define a 'human being'?<br /><br />[Sidebar: The often-mentioned Gattaca, on the other hand-and I'm pointing this out this for the benefit of those reviewers still struggling with comprehension of the fundamental difference between the movies-asked if the value of human beings depends on their genetic makeup; just like one might ask if a handicapped person is of equal value as one who isn't.]<br /><br />Should a cloned ('replicated', 'copied') but conscious human being be accorded the same rights as one created and brought into this world in a more conventional manner? What is consciousness anyway? How do you detect it?<br /><br />How far will human beings go to preserve their lives? (There's a truly disturbing part in Michael Bay's commentary on the DVD regarding this. Truth apparently is even more sickening than the occasionally quite troubling fiction of The Island.)<br /><br />The Island deals with these issues in all seriousness; but not in a pretentious or 'arty' manner, or with the ponderous gravitas that might have eventuated in the hands of a 'serious' director. It also answers them; at least as much as it is possible-for, after all, who _can_ say what 'consciousness' actually 'is'? We all _know_ what it is, but try to _define_ it and you're instantly stepping on philosophical quicksand.<br /><br />All this is accomplished in the context for an 'action' movie, and one by Michael Bay at that. That instantly gets a lot of folks' hackles up; for Michael Bay can't possibly make a movie with depth, right? Well, think again, for this one is. An object lesson, if we need one, to teach us that not every action film has to be a one-dimensional Tom Cruise or Will Smith vehicle. The Island strikes an exquisite balance between the relief provided by humor and the physical-ness of some very well done action, moments of reflection, and a multi-layered plot with lots of hidden meanings and question marks, as well as a satisfying denouement.<br /><br />Above all-and unlike Gattaca, which was a very 'self centered' movie; with the protagonist really only interested in himself and his own plans and tribulations-The Island ultimately went beyond that and toward displaying a sense of social responsibility. One of the most touching moments of the movie occurs when Lincoln and Jordan spin dreams of what they would like to do, and how they could just go far away and live like 'real people'; and then he says "...but after...", meaning after having tried to help "all those people we left behind", who are about to be destroyed (well, 'killed' or 'murdered' would be more appropriate) as their makers try to 'start over' a new generation of clones with less troublesome predilections.<br /><br />The decision to risk their future for the sake of their fellow clones, is the ultimate proof of Lincoln's and Jordan's humanity; and in the process they help to redeem the one who has hunted them relentlessly, and who rediscovers his own humanity as a result of his interaction with them.<br /><br />One issue has raised justifiable questions: how did the clones 'know' all these things they knew? Or, how did not just they, but apparently another whole lot, become infected with apparently spontaneously-generated memories of their 'sponsors', that is the people they were cloned from?<br /><br />One possible answer is that memories are encoded in the DNA of a person-but that doesn't make much sense. There is nothing to suggest in current scientific research that this is either possible or that it happens. Another theory-and this is where 'speculation' enters the fray-is that (slightly extending theories such as those developed by the likes of Rupert Sheldrake or Roger Penrose) people with identical genetic makeup have a 'connection' that goes beyond mere genetics; that they are 'linked' (telepathically?) in some way. Maybe that's how their 'memories' seemed to have 'grown' spontaneously over the lifetimes of the clones. Maybe that's also why, in some ways, the clones-and especially Lincoln-seemed to have acquired certain characteristics of their 'sponsors'.<br /><br />I don't know and neither did the God-potentate Merrick, who was highly and unpleasantly surprised by this turn of events; though for a few moments he appeared to be genuinely stimulated by the notion, until he realized that it was interfering with his carefully laid-out plans and DOD funding. He never found the explanation, before he died at the hands of one of his creations.<br /><br />So, is there a suggestion here that there's more to life and humanity and the mind and every-damn-thing than is currently accepted by science? I know some people aren't comfortable with that notion, and, being an atheist myself, I'm not bringing God into this either-but is the notion that we haven't figured out the fundamentals of 'human nature' really so preposterous? Is it unreasonable for a movie, and especially one so unashamedly 'entertainment', to suggest that maybe we don't know everything, and that our ignorance, combined with the delusions of omniscience in some, is likely to come and bite us in the butt?<br /><br />I think not. This theme, by the way, is also picked up in that other cinematographic gem, Serenity, though from a slightly different angle.<br /><br />The Island's score by Steve Jablonsky is impressive and moving; showing (like Klaus Badelt's did for Pirates of the Caribbean) a close connection to Hans Zimmer, who may be the greatest and most influential film-score composer working today.<br /><br />Bottom line and in two words: great flick. Highly recommended for those who like to be entertained and think at the same time. The rest of you, depending on your inclinations, either go watch some DAMN (Deep-And-Meaningful-Nothing) movie instead, or spend quality time with and waste money on vapid Mission Impossible flicks (or anything by and with Tom Cruise, except possibly The Last Samurai) or maybe the silly, though mildly entertaining, I, Robot.<br /><br />The Island DVD is not exactly loaded with 'extras' (no space on a single DVD with a 2 hr movie for much extra stuff anyway); but I don't feel that, unless there's another cut of this movie, or unless they put in significant background material on cloning and associated issues, there's actually much more to add to what is a very complete film. Besides, personally I'm not really all that interested in the details of shooting 'action', and what there is seems more than enough. Maybe something about Steve Jablonsky might be nice, too. But basically I'm cool with the DVD as it is.<br /><br />Till Noever<br /><br />owlglass.com<br /><br />Author: Keaen, Continuity Slip, Seladi?nna</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>NOTE TO HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS: PLEASE STOP GIVING THESE GREAT MOVIES TO PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL BAY AND ROLAND EMMERICH!!!!<br /><br />Once again... what could have been a GREAT, memorable movie, is destroyed by a, I'm sorry, but a brainless director who thinks all the audience wants is destruction and chaos. I'm sorry, but it's true. We all love ACTION. We love it when a movie gets our adrenaline going and WE LOVE CHAOS... but THERE HAS TO BE SOME LOGIC TO IT. When you insult the audiences intelligence... you INSTANTLY LOSE THEM.<br /><br />THE ISLAND has it all. In fact, I watched this movie for quite awhile, wondering WHY I WAS ACTUALLY ENJOYING A MICHAEL BAY MOVIE. It had twists and mystery and INTELLIGENCE. It had a great premise and I won't give it away, because that's just not nice.<br /><br />But then, about halfway through the movie, all of the twists and mysteries were uncovered and revealed, and I thought... eewww, that's only the beginning... I wonder what other twists there will be. Well, I should have known better, because that must have been where the original script ended and Michael Bay took over.<br /><br />That was about the time that the main nemesis hired the WORST HITMEN in the world. And I say that jokingly because their actually supposed to be the best.  These hitmen have choppers and outnumber the two UNARMED and SOCIALLY RETARDED targets 12 to 2, and choose to go about their business destroying everything in sight, LOUDLY and CRAZILY. Not to mention, they're driving through a busy and crowded Los Angeles firing like maniacs and yelling things like "GET THEM!" and "THERE THEY ARE FIRE!"<br /><br />I think, later on, they were even told to do things quietly.<br /><br />Then there was the big giant letter hanging from the side of the building. Our two main stars are clinging for their lives to this huge letter that is teetering from falling for minutes while our 'HITMEN' fire into it wildly... it slowly begins to break away from the building... and just as it's about to fall.... creaking... falling... creaking... here it goes... the helicopter pilot decides to fly right underneath it so that it can get caught up in the carnage too and tumble to the ground in a firey ball of destructive wonder.<br /><br />Oh, and of course, our main stars get caught up in some harmless netting and fall to the ground with a slight scratch on one of their heads.<br /><br />Our two main stars climb aboard a semi-truck loaded with GIANT BARBELS and they eventually decide to dislodge them in order to stop their attackers. As these monsterous barbels destroy car after car and fall one after the other on the L.A. freeway, I kept wondering... WHY ISN'T THIS TRUCKER PULLING OVER? He just lost his entire frickin' load!!!<br /><br />I'm not gonna go on forever discussing all this junk. I love action movies, but YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT WITHIN THE REALM OF ACCEPTABILITY, STORYLINE and RIDICULOUSNESS. The action sequences in THE ISLAND seem like just what they are, THROWN IN to please the audience.<br /><br />Well, they didn't please me. Were they cool? You betcha! Were they ridiculous? You betcha. Were they necessary? Not at all.<br /><br />Bay actually had a good thing going. A great premise, a great idea... ruined by a Director who has this screwed up idea that audiences are stupid and just want destruction.<br /><br />We like destruction, but it better be logical and necessary. A perfect example: the action sequences in DIE HARD. They were over the top... but you know what, they kept them in the realm of acceptability... and they FIT WITH THE STORY!<br /><br />I reitterate, please!! Hollywood! Stop! Somehow... I'm not sure, but Michael Bay and Rolland Emmerich have been given this Willie Wonka golden ticket to make what ever movie they want in hollywood with whatever budget and they disappoint time after time... and yet... ???<br /><br />Whatever happened to the sensible directors that realized that audiences actually have brains, and don't like being insulted? I hate to tell them, but not everybody in the audience is a 13-20 year old video game playing boy. Some of us are 35-year-old video game playing boys.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>Warning:  possible spoilers below.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson both play their parts well. The visual effects are nice. The script is OK. Several scenes are completely ludicrous -- there is no way a human being could survive a few of the things that happen, particularly to walk away with only some dirty clothes and a scratch on the face -- but those scenes don't ruin the movie.<br /><br />Just beware that this story has been told many times before. It's Blade Runner w/a twist.<br /><br />Blade Runner -- Replicants, created to do human labor, realize they are "human" and fight to survive. The will to survive is, of course, a glitch in their design.<br /><br />I Robot -- Robots, created to do human labor, realize they are human and fight to survive. The will to be human is a glitch in their design.<br /><br />Bicentennial Man -- A robot, created to do human labor, realizes he is "human" and fights for his "rights". His humanity is a glitch in his design.<br /><br />The Island -- Clones ("Agnates"), created to supply human tissue to their original counterparts, have genetic memories and begin to realize the world around them is fake. Their real (not programmed) memory and human curiousity are glitches in their design. They fight to live and be recognized as real human beings, not just "product".<br /><br />The movie is enjoyable but ultimately hollow and unoriginal.  Don't expect anything original or challenging and you might enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Originality is not Michael Bay's strength, but having said that, I find his latest film 'The Island' fairly entertaining Sci-fi action.  You can call it a copycat of another films in the past -- 'Logan's Run''Blade Runner''The Sixth Day' etc. -- the list would be a very long one, but that doesn't mean that this film is not worth watching.  And surely Michale Bay knows how to make good actions.<br /><br />The film can be divided into two parts.  In the first, you see Ewan McGregor as "Lincoln Six-Echo" in tight white costume wake up from a bad dream.  Living in some big institute managed by wards in uniform, everyday Lincoln is medically checked, is told to do certain things like putting colored substances into tubes, and is curiously attracted to "Jordan Two-Delta," a beautiful blonde female played by Scarlett Johansson though it is strictly prohibited by the authority to touch each other.  But why these rules?<br /><br />The secrets are not really secrets to many of you, and you may find the first 30 minutes pretty dull -- I did -- but anyway, the inmates in this building believe that the world outside is 'contaminated,' and only a few selected ones can go to 'The Island' the ultimate paradise left on the earth.<br /><br />Of course, we know better, and Jordan and Lincoln, once outside the sanctuary after seeing the truths behind the place, have to survive the fight against the bounty hunters.  And in Bay's film, the survival means lots of actions -- chases involving cars, bikes, and choppers; shoot-outs, and hanging from the high building.<br /><br />The actors are all good, though typecast.  They include Michael Clarke Duncan (only in a few scenes), Sean Bean (in his typical villain mode), Djimon Hounsou, and Steve Buscemi who gives some good laughs when opening his closet in his home.<br /><br />The film's time is set in near future, about 15 years from now, but the production designs, collecton of pieces from another sfi-fi films, are not convincing enough to convey the touch of the futuristic world.  But you should know that it's a Michael Bay film, and in his films, like in 'Pearl Harbor,' accuracy means nothing.  It's actions that really count, and they are reasonably done.<br /><br />So is it good?  It depends.  'The Island' has good actions, thrills, and a few disturbing moments (thanks to the role of Michael Clarke Duncan), but it does not mean Michael Bay did something new.  But he knows what he is doing, and he did it better than before.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>For the summer of 2005, it will be known as the "summer of movie retreads, reruns and lack of an original thought". The movie The Island proves to be a pretty decent popcorn movie. There is nothing here that any movie fan haven't seen before. The cast were great and they were the reason why I enjoyed the movie to a certain level. Sean Bean, Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson and rest were quite good and they made the movie worthwhile. However, the script and the story proves to be quite a letdown. I don't think Michael Bay did a good job directing here and the action sequences seem to be bit too predictable and some what boring.<br /><br />This movie proves to be a direct take-off from the 1979 movie called the "Parts: Clonus Horror", an awful B level film that few ever saw. The story of that movie have people cloning themselves for spare parts. Gee, that sound just like The Island!<br /><br />This movie should provides some entertainment for the undemanding audience out there. The first part of the movie was actually quite good, reminded me of the Brave New World type of concept. But once the chase sequences began, its all alot of bullets flying around, hitting everyone but the two stars. It turned into a your typical shoot'em up type of film, losing it all for just cheap thrills. Personally speaking, I think this would make a decent DVD rental but its not worth real money to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This film gets off to an interesting and edgy start. The time is the not-so-distant future. The location is a strangely antiseptic and sterile world,  where humanity supposedly lives in a  protected, artificial environment. Men and woman are segregated in separate housing. They  work at assigned tasks, wear the clothes they are given to wear, eat what they are told to eat, and every move they make is controlled and choreographed by an unseen force. Presiding over their supposed well-being is Merrick (Sean Bean).<br /><br />This multitude of beings believe that they are where they are due to a contamination of the Earth's environment. There is, however, a place on Earth to which they all aspire to go: the island, a utopian paradise, free from the contamination that purportedly covers most of Earth. The only way to get to the island is via a lottery. The ostensibly lucky winner is told to pack his or her bags and is then whisked away, never again to be seen.<br /><br />This is the world of Lincoln Six Echo  (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson). They, too, wait for the day when they will win the lottery. There is, however,  something about Lincoln Six Echo that does not quite conform to what passes for the norm in this controlled environment. Consequently, he comes under the scrutiny of Merrick, who is really sort of a futuristic Dr. Mengele. Lincoln Six Echo's problem is his curiosity, which leads him on a voyage of discovery. What he discovers is shocking. So, when his best friend, Jordan Two Delta, wins the lottery and is scheduled to be transported to the island, he goes into action mode.<br /><br />It is no secret that this film is about clones and the harvesting of their body parts for well-heeled clients who keep the clones as a back-up in case something goes wrong with their own bodies. The movie starts off quite promisingly, with its cutting edge plot, which provides much food for thought, and the faintly creepy, highly stylized, futuristic world that they inhabit. The film, however,  begins its downward spiral the minute it goes into action mode. In fact, in one of the featurettes, the director, Michael Bay, basically says that at some point he told his special effects people just to load up the film with action scenes and he would work around it.  Consequently, the plot takes a turn for the totally ridiculous. The film also has a final twist that is just simply not believable. It is unfortunate that this director has not yet realized that less is sometimes more.<br /><br />Wonderful performances are given by the entire cast, with special kudos to Ewan McGregor who effectively plays a dual role (Lincoln Six Echo and Tom Lincoln). Scarlett Johansson brings a fresh faced naivete to her role as<br />Jordan Two Delta. Steve Buscemi plays McCord, a creepy little guy that Buscemi makes strangely disarming and likable. Sean Bean is coolly sinister as Merrick, the futuristic Dr. Mengele prototype. Dimon Hounsou is well-cast as Albert Laurent, the security expert hired to take care of the developing situation by any means necessary. Michael Clark Duncan gives an  especially poignant performance as Starkweather, one of the lottery winners, as does Ethan Phillips in the role of Jones Three Echo.<br /><br />Despite the film's intriguing premise, it ultimately fails in its execution. The director succumbs to a need for excess, leaving the intelligent storyline in the wake of a deep rooted need for excessive and unbelievable action scenes and a twist that no one with an ounce of brains would believe. It is too bad, as the director had all the ingredients for a gourmet feast, but, instead, chose to serve the viewer the equivalent of a fast food burger. Still, sci-fi junkies will find a modicum of enjoyment in this well-acted film, as will those who enjoy aggressive action sequences in their films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_The Island_ is a movie about a totalitarian system enslaving a group of clones.  This movie touches on many issues which face us in this very day and age.  To say nothing of the gross immorality of human cloning and the unethical disposal of human genetic material (very much endowed with the very breath of life from the Creator), this movie also has much to say about totalitarian forms of government.  In the movie, the clones live in a closed-in society ruled by their masters who have created a situation that pretty much robs life of all meaning.  However, like the crass materialistic culture we live in today which refuses to recognize the sanctity of unborn life, the society in _The Island_ does not recognize the sanctity of the life of the clones.  These clones are herded like cattle, eventually to serve as the unwitting organ donors for their ultra-rich owners.  When the time comes for one of the clones to "win the lottery", they are taken to up to the surface world and there are surgically operated upon against their will, often killed in the process.  The movie features two clones who manage to somehow miraculously discover that they are clones and to escape from this totalitarian dystopia.  They seek to liberate their fellow clones, but first they must find a means to notify their respective insurance policy holders of the true nature of their insurance policy.  However, along the way they encounter several snags which lead to an eventual confrontation with the owners of the cloning operation all under the auspices of the federal government.  This movie has much to say not only about the very unethical nature of human cloning but also about totalitarian systems in general.  It serves to signify precisely what the late Pope John Paul II meant when he referred to modern culture as a "culture of death".  May we heed this warning as we approach a truly brave new world which holds promise but also holds the potential for a total robbery of the sacredness of life!</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>I actually enjoyed this film.

This movie was good but will be forgoten fast and we'll watch it in 10 years thinking this was cheasey just like 70's sci fi films. The movie was a bomb in the box office and I can see why but the film is pretty good it's not great but it's good. The story is good and original but it's why to long. The acting is ok but not great and the chase/action scene's are why to long.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>I have mixed feelings about this movie.  First and foremost, the concept is sound. The idea that any potential cloned beings have human rights-life, liberty, property, self-determination, etc.-is a dark horse hot topic. We need to settle this issue right now before Brigitte Boisselier and the Raelians hold another press conference.<br /><br />The main problem with this film is the execution.  It looks too much like "THX-1138" with hair, and feels too much like "Logan's Run" on bullet bikes.  It seemed like I was watching a rerun, even to the point of seeing the commercials.<br /><br />This brings me to my second point: product placement. This film wins this year's "MAC and Me" award for the most obvious, annoying, distracting, and ham-handed product placement.<br /><br />Product placement is distracting because it is so obvious.  It does not fit in the flow and theme of the movies, and it destroys the Hollywood Magic and Illusion.  It is a crass commercial sell out, and it insults the viewers.  We are seeing a film about human rights, and they want to make a buck off of Puma Tennis Shoes.<br /><br />The worst offence is the scene with Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream.  It has no logical connection with the first hour and a half of the previous movie.  Lincoln and Jordan are on the run form the compound and the government assassin, hunkering down in Tom's house, and then we jump to Jordan giving out free Ben and Jerry's Subversive Ice Cream to Children. I felt like I was watching a Mormon "Family Night" Advertisement in the middle of a high-tension film.  Blech!<br /><br />Yes, it alerts the government assassin to their location, so it furthers the plot. But couldn't it have been done another way, and without the obvious advertising.<br /><br />Another distraction was the gag with the costumes in McCord's closet.  Yeah, we get the humor about what people do behind closed doors, and in the privacy of their own home. However, it was not humor, which involves moral irony, but a mindless gag. Once again people, we are watching a movie about human rights, not Beavis and I-don't-know-what-Head.<br /><br />The "ahem" scene was another area that could be improved.  As it was presented, it was just another form of product placement.<br /><br />This movie is salvageable, however.  It is a sound concept, but with a flawed execution.  I suggest the writers and director have a six hour "Twilight Zone" marathon, with four episodes of "Night Gallery" thrown in for variety.  If they rethink their execution, they could re-release this film in another form, and recoup their losses.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>As the king of big-budget Hollywood bombast, director Michael Bay has a reputation so commercially oriented that it's hard to view his films without some amount of visceral disdain. His latest venture is not an artistic breakthrough for him, by any means, but it is a diverting though overlong entertainment that seems to be an amalgam of John Frankenheimer's 1966 sleeper "Seconds", Ridley Scott's classically visionary 1982 "Blade Runner", Michael Anderson's comparatively cheesy 1976 "Logan's Run" and Philip Kaufman's 1979 savvy update of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" with plenty of references to Bay's previous blockbusters thrown in as well. Clocking in at 136 minutes, the result is a confusing shuffle, but he has certainly assembled a grade-A cast to inhabit the rather cartoonish roles headed up by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as two residents of a sterile, futuristic society. Their characters' names - Lincoln Six-Echo and Jordan Two-Delta - should give you fair warning of the world in which they inhabit with trepidation, and the first hour seems like it could lead to a more thoughtful analysis of the transience of identity at a time when it is not valued.<br /><br />The clich&eacute;-ridden screenplay (co-written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Caspian Tredwell-Owen) provides the derivative concept of a brilliant but greedy scientist who has figured out how to clone the rich and famous in order to allow them to take organs or even entire bodies when age and disease set in. The clones - unable to mature beyond the age of fifteen (how convenient) - are programmed to think they are humans living underground to avoid contamination unbeknownst to their ultimate fate. Alas, once Lincoln and Delta figure out what's going on, we enter Los Angeles in the year 2019 as envisioned by Bay as a series of skyward collisions and exploding buildings. This is when the movie either escalates into high gear for Bay aficionados or disintegrates into a morass of action set pieces, though granted, Bay's use of giant metal spools as terrorizing traffic devices is genuine good fun. Unfortunately though, I am still of the latter camp, and shame on me for having any higher expectation for this sort of popcorn filler. The overstylized cinematography of Mauro Fiore, which smacks of new millennium commercials on upscale product placement, is another dead giveaway.<br /><br />Out of his Obi-Wan Kenobi guise, McGregor can get rather unctuous as a leading man, especially when the clone confronts his Scottish-accented antecedent, an obviously direct cousin to his smarmy Catcher Block in Peyton Reed's "Down With Love". Johansson is certainly luscious enough for her part, though she is not called upon to use her penetrating intelligence by any means. It's also disheartening to see a scene where she reacts emotionally to her duplicate within the actress's famous Calvin Klein ad. Sean Bean and Djimon Hounsou play the parts of the scientist and his chief mercenary with predictable malice, though the latter has some unexplained epiphany toward the end. There is an extended cameo by Steve Buscemi, which is welcome at that point of the story though it's rather anachronistic and overly convenient. The ending is a bit of a bore given all that has come before, but it doesn't really matter, as Bay has concocted a movie that should please most of his fans and may even recruit a few new ones.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episode: Revenge Of The Sith, Robots) stars as Lincoln Six Echo who lives in a word in the future where the men and women are seperated from one another, they cant feel any emotions with each other because the too hot too trot meter will bust.

So, the 2 of them hop on out of into the real world in search of answers and the real Lincoln and Jordan. Interesting premise with Michael Bay on the gun and so you get a big summer block buster movie which is half story and half action with the lead cast running around screaming "Run" Go". Also starring Djimon Hounsou (Constantine, In America), Kim Coates (Hostage, Black Hawk Down), Michael Clarke Duncan (A Night At The Roxbury, Armageddon) and Steve Buscemi (Ghost World, 28 Days). Sean Bean is in another role that consists of Sean Bean here and he needs to stop for awhile picking these kind of roles. McGregor is always good and Scarlett Johansson is hot in this movie, I wouldnt mind going out with her. The action sometimes is good but it kinda gets boring after awhile. So say the least, it was a good try and effort for Bay to do but he kinda does the same pattern here like all the rest of his action movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>but like robert dinero?, mcgregor should do something quick about his several huge moles on his face, better remove them sooner than later. why? because i could not help focusing on those moles every time when i watch him played some good roles. he's a very talented actor, if he could remove his facial moles so far, he might be even greater if he could do some facial improvement. this movie has the most uptodate cinematographical achievements and progress in the movie industry and you would be amazed how computer could do in a futuristic movie. this movie makes a lot of other old sci-fi movies look so outdated if you re-watch them after you have watched this one. the screenplay is not quite up to the standard of the technique shown in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Michael Bay, one of the more despised directors in Hollywood tends to make what I call "fluff pieces". They're not meant to be anything more than big explosive entertainment while numbing our mind in the process. The Island is Michael's first attempt at being a bit intelligent(loose use on that word) and be a little question-posing but then it becomes a typical sterilized world where everything's shiny and cool-looking but no emotional connection.<br /><br />Imagine waking up at a precise time, your clothes already picked and if there's an imbalance in your body, they ban it from your food and go on a diet. It's a world of extreme control which echoes 1984. Only as usual, someone questions his existence. In this case it's Lincoln Six Echo and together with Jordan Three Delta they escape the facility and learn the truth of their place(I won't spoil it despite the fact reviews and the trailer probably already did it for me).<br /><br />The film's success, or should I say the lack of it, most likely caused Dreamworks Pictures to be bought by Paramount. The film essentially didn't know how to promote it. They showed the sterile sheen of the facility and the outside world and even spoiled what the place is used for. So it's an existential intrigue drama with typical Michael Bay boomness. So they promoted it as such, making it too bipolar for an audience I assume.<br /><br />And you can tell the film's in 2 halves: in the facility and off. When they're in, everything's with glass, bright lights, tons of white clothing and post-modern architecture. They leave it's gritty and tons of explosions and there's the problem. It's trying to be 2 things at once but without the finesse of it. Blame it on Michael Bay probably since he loves his smashyness of things although it's toned down since Jerry Bruckheimer didn't produce.<br /><br />Performances are nice although not very dynamic. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanssen play a nice couple while normal menacing Sean Bean isn't really that much of a threat. Even him on the phone in Don't Say a Word had more villainness than here. And of course Steve Buscemi is back although better than in Armageddon and Michael Clarke Duncan's back too, on screen for about 10 minutes and doesn't leave much of a mark(personally, it's like he tries to hard to show he can "act".)<br /><br />I'm going to predict this and say there's a 2 disc Criterion edition coming out since there's not much extras. So in 2 ways I'm recommending that you rent: one to save money and also it's not really much of a good purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episode: Revenge Of The Sith, Robots) stars as Lincoln Six Echo who lives in a word in the future where the men and women are seperated from one another, they cant feel any emotions with each other because the too hot too trot meter will bust.

Boy was he lucky he bailed on it.<br /><br />The Island is a really really badly done sci fi flick that would have you believe it is unique and new. It isn't. It is a very thinly (and poorly) veiled remake of Logan's Run (from the 1970's).<br /><br />The Island borrows heavily from films such as The Matrix (didn't you think the clones were houses similarly to the people under control by the Matrix?), Minority Report (that piss poor film starring The Scientologist), and then completely steals huge chunks from Logan's Run.<br /><br />The years is 2014 and Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen are perky little citizens of a utopian society in which the citizens have no independent thought. Suddenly McGregor gets it in his head that he's going to go out on his own. Why? He has bad dreams (but aren't these the same dreams everyone else is having? Yes. Later,we're even shown that the others have these same "memories" implants).<br /><br />He sneaks away and discovers that his civilization's life is all a big lie and that they are nothing more than the parts department for the rich and wealthy who can afford to have clones created for use as spares for when they are injured or dying.<br /><br />The rest is a chase film wherein the bad guys try to keep the clones from blowing the whistle.<br /><br />If you've ever seen Logan's Run, you'll remember all of this as well. However, Logan's Run did it far better - and surprisingly with better special effects.<br /><br />The mere premise of this film is silly and feeds into the mentality of the mindless millions of television viewers whose salacious appetite for Jerry Springer-like reality has given television networks latitude to further dumb down the television audience. Ooooooo, what if it really happened? Ooooooo what if I ran into my clone?<br /><br />The Island tells us that the rich are evil and should be stopped. Jerry Springer's core audience will eat that idea up.<br /><br />At least in Logan's Run, the blame was given to all society for being such sheep and believing whatever was being told to them.<br /><br />Are the rich evil for being wealthy and should they thus be punished or are those who want others to tell them what to think and do to blame for their lot in life? I think that's the difference between The Island and Logan's Run.<br /><br />I'll take the message from Logan's Run any day of the week over that of The Island. At least it means that I'm not so stupid that I'll do whatever someone else tells me to do.<br /><br />Don't bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Horrible.  Good premise, bad movie.  It had so much potential, but lost itself in the washed-up "old school wannabe" sci-fi theme.  Watching this movie is painful.  Any fan of sci-fi will wind up telling themselves that they've seen this before, and much better done.  A disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) lives in a futuristic society. He and many other civilians in an encased bubble-society are seemingly protected from the dangers of the outside world which has been ravaged by viruses and disease. Every facet of Lincoln Six-Echo's life is monitored (even his urine for high levels of protein, etc.) and his only hope is to win "the lottery" and be sent to "The Island", a paradise for the wealthy and successful. But Lincoln has been stuck in his sterile society so long that he starts questioning why he's there.<br /><br />He's also showing some affection toward another society member, the beautiful Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson), and when Lincoln discovers their real purpose, he must flee for his very life. And with him he takes Jordan who's just won the lottery, sparing her an undeniably horrible death.<br /><br />But what is it that threatens Lincoln and Jordan?<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Michael Bay (director of Armageddon and The Rock) pulls from several previously successful films and presents a modestly interesting premise: how far will humanity go in the science of cloning? Can you murder a creation of mankind? Or will it simply be seen as harvesting organs? What if humanity doesn't know how far some scientists have gone?<br /><br />Ewan McGregor pulls in an "okay" performance as a clone with a questioning conscious. He alone discovers the truth behind their existence: being "throw-away" people designed to replace the organs of those individuals from whom they were cloned.<br /><br />Borrowing heavily from one of my favorite cult classic SF films (Logan's Run), I was hoping that Michael Bay might update that film and put a new face on it. But no.<br /><br />The deep messages of this film are never resolved or explored. In their place are unbelievable chase scenes and convenient plot twists that will make many viewers groan with disbelief (How can Ewan McGregor ride a futuristic sky-bike if he's never even seen one? How can he and Scarlett Johansson supposedly survive a multi-story fall from a building?  etc.).<br /><br />There are, however, lots of interesting questions and concepts that are put forth from within the film's script. It's just too bad that the producers/screenwriters/directors didn't explore them and give us a great psychological impact rather than fancy motorbike rides through impossible situations.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>The movie was so bad that the projector was affronted enough to blur the last quarter.

No matter what trouble his characters get into, they're always pretty and unbruised, and for goodness sake man, you can predict his endings to such a degree that it gets redundant at some point to even watch the previews, they give away the whole plot, whatever that's worth in a Bay film.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />I'm Michael and I'm lookin' for the next summer box-office flick. So I find a studio and make them give me a script, the script I receive is the compelling story of a terrorist organization that captured governor's Island and are threatening to blow it up unless...whatever. The bad guy also happens to be the good guy's best friend. So the good guy gets to governor's Island, kills everyone, there's a huge fight, explosions, and a love story with a beatiful young, large breasted woman, the conclusion of this 2 hour epic? He kissed the young blonde, saved the world, which was obvious from beginning.<br /><br />The Island only made 12 million dollars it's opening week in the USA. Michael Bay throws together a bunch of car chases and edits them as if they are all part of a TV commercial. He can't stay on a subject for more than 7 seconds without cutting. His movies are so monopaced because of that and so boring. The majority of people don't like his films but because of teenagers who have more disposable income (no rent for most of them), he keeps making money. Michael Bay is pretty bad. I never understood how people use the blanket term "entertaining" to cover films that lack of logical storylines, coherent plots, well developed characters that you can care about, emotional content, etc. Just throw in the formulaic one liners, big explosions, cheesy dialogue and lots of people getting killed and that makes "entertainment"? That just doesn't cut it for me. The only Michael Bay movie I really liked was The Rock - everything else was horrible. By the middle of Armaggeddon, I wanted to put an axe through the TV. Might as well skip the movies and watch WWE Monday nights - it's just as entertaining and you save the $10 on the ticket.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about Michael Bay. "The Island" is becoming a huge disaster at the box office. It's opening day take was $4.2 Million. That is pretty damn bad for a big budget summer movie.<br /><br />How can someone enjoy this film? You'll have to leave your brain at the door, which, for some (such as myself), is the only way to enjoy a Bay movie. Bay movies, to be honest, don't require you to think. Sure, for most of the brain-dead clowny kids of today, that's terrific, which is how Bay's films rank in the big bucks. If Bay continues to make films like he usually does, he's sure to have money in his pocket always, supplied mostly by males in the 18-25 age demographic. This is the age bracket that frequents theaters nationwide, and these are usually the films that they pay to see. Yes, teens are a very powerful market in regards to Hollywood. The movie industry puts their power into a genre depending on the subject's popularity. They aren't going to put a lot of focus into a romance piece if shoot-em-up, hip-hopping action is the trend at the time. It's pretty sad.<br /><br />I give The Island 1 out of 5 stars. Definitely not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>2 stars is for DVD,NOT the movie!<br /><br />I love Michael bay Movies and he comes to action he ROCKS...I liked this movie MUCH; MUCH better an that stupid "STEATH".

His poplar of double disks or extended cut movies and loaded DVDS..Definitely not this DVD version!!. I KNOW for sure like the rest of them, he going to come out with another version this DVD with extras and extended cuts and loaded stuffs with DTS audio, in near soon.

The clones' purpose is to provide their human counterparts replacements for defective body parts. (Boy, I could use a few!)<br /><br />The only problem is that one of the clones (Ewan McGregor) starts to become human with feelings and emotions all his own. He is then joined by a female clone (Scarlett Johansson) and the two them try to escape their surroundings - a prison-like laboratory in the middle of the desert.<br /><br />The last half of the film is them on the run, trying to tell someone the truth.<br /><br />This turned out to be an Arnold Schwarzenegger-type action movie, which isn't all bad because Arnold's films were at least entertaining. It features the same stuff: outrageous scenes in which incredible things happen to the heroes....like assassins shooting at them from 30 feet away and never hitting them or falling from tall buildings....and never getting hurt! These two leads have nothing on Superman!  They are indestructible, apparently. It's lunacy....but it certainly has it's fun moments with some tremendous stunt work.<br /><br />To me, the best aspect of this film was the stylish camera-work. There are some really, really nice visuals in this presentation, and good sound. A good Blu-Ray disc of this movie would look and sound awesome. I see one is out, but it's unavailable for sale. I wonder what's up with that?</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p>Michael Bay's action packed sci-fi vehicle is sure worth every penny. Even though there are some similarities between this and the 6th day and many other science fiction movies of the past it still manages to bring in something new to the genre. The movie begins in a facility where supposedly the last humans are living, of course this is a lie, and they are in fact clones of rich industrialist who want either to live longer or need a new organ to live on. The interesting thing is that the clones don't know they are clones, and the real copies don't know there are clones of them living in a military bunker. without giving any more details this movie is worth buying, the action is very reminiscent to other Michael Bay's movies (Bad Boys II, Transformers) in my opinion this is probably bay's 2nd best movie (the first being transformers) if you liked the 6th day or enjoy high adrenaline action sequences with an interesting and intelligent plot then this movie is for you<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 ? OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>The old saying goes, "Nowadays even the future ain't what it used to be."  Indeed, as imagined by director Michael Bay in The Island, it's downright ghoulish.  Fans of sci-fi thrillers will notice many influences - The Matrix and Bladerunner are just two.  It has their visual style, brilliant art direction, and dazzling special effects.  Where it differs is the level of commitment to concept.  In Matrix and Bladerunner you have interesting philosophical puzzles examined with precision, in the Island an interesting moral puzzle is introduced and then dropped the way a child with ADD might drop a video game to spend a little while grinding marbles in the garbage disposal.<br /><br />If you've ever wondered about the ethical consequences of using stem cells, and speculated about the inevitable impact of this practice on society, this movie was supposed to be for you, but isn't.  For that matter, if you've ever thought about the difference between "important people" and "disposable people" - i.e., rich Americans vs. third world teenage kids working in slave labor conditions, meticulously crafting day-glow costumes for "Hip-Hop Barbie" - this movie could have been for you had it been written and directed by someone else.  As it stands, if you like snazzy visuals, bodacious chase scenes, and plot holes large enough for an armored car flipping end over end to pass through, sloppily wrapped in a pseudo-futuristic snack pack, this movie IS for you.<br /><br />All films are written in 3 acts; usually viewers don't notice the transitions.  Here it looks like the three acts were shot on different sets in different countries, written by different people, and directed by different people.  Act 1 is classic high sci-fi, visually convincing and intriguing.  Something is rotten in Denmark, we don't know what it is but it's cool, and we want to find out.  Act 2 is a chase scene on steroids.  Oddly, in the future some things are very different while some things haven't changed at all.  (Sadly, the Cadillac logo is the same, puzzling, since it looked old fashioned 50 years ago.)  In Act 3 many things blow up, the film even attempts a brief reconciliation with its basic premise.  Bay's chutzpah is such that he briefly reminds us of WWII death camps.  Had the film addressed its theme seriously, this might have been forgivable.<br /><br />If The Island has any enduring message at all it is this - whether we live underground in a controlled environment out of time, or above ground in a semi-futuristic kluge - one thing will always be constant - Steve Buscemi.  His brief appearance, (one assumes he was making a cameo in another mediocre movie nearby when this was being shot), is like everything else you've ever seen him do.  Even the bar he haunts and the bikers he drinks with are present day.  But, can we be sure it's him?  Is it even possible for Buscemi to be in so many movies at once?  Perhaps he was a prototype in the Echo series.  Now that is scary.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>One of the great untold tragedies of the 20th century was the prevalence of medical testing on unwitting subjects.  Some Americans have probably heard of the Tuskegee airmen, black American servicemen who became unwitting test subjects for medical experiments.  But how many people are aware of the medical testing performed on ignorant prisoners, on poor people on various Caribbean islands, or the large-scale testing of vaccines on African villagers throughout the latter half of the 20th century.  The latter tragedy was the background for the movie "The Constant Gardener" but it was kept in the background.  This movie takes medical experimentation and puts it front and center in the middle of America.<br /><br />The plot is simple; two clones discover that they were created to have their organs harvested.  They then fight to escape, and then to help others like them escape.  The story takes on the issues of cloning, genetic engineering, mind control, and even the power of corporations operating in the medical sphere.  Yes the story has the requisite action scenes and love scene needed for any Hollywood flick, but it also has enough scenes to explore the medical and moral issues involved.  We have Lincoln's real counterpart, a rich, spoiled yuppie who needs replacement organs because his are suffering from STD's he has picked up from various women.  Then there is the scene when Scarlett Johansson's character sees the son of her real counterpart.  And then there is the scene where Djimon Hounsou's character parallels the medical cloning with the atrocities he witnessed in his homeland in Africa.  All in all, this was a great action movie with heart and a meaning.  A great watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>One of the questions asked by Lincoln 6 Echo when he starts to question the post-contamination as he launches into a criticism of his surroundings. "The Island" is a movie that was something of a surprise to me, and a good one at that.<br /><br />The world has been largely wiped out by some contamination, and the only survivors live in a utopian compound where a lottery chooses some to go to the only uncontaminated place left on Earth: The Island. The inanity of the utopian life is poignant, made more so in Lincoln 6 Echo's concern over the loss of one of his white shoes, (another colour would be nice, he comments).<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are both surprising in the ways in which they adapt to the roles. McGregor, who usually comes across as a bit spineless in some roles, makes a good show of it later in this film. His change of character typing was excellently done. Johansson, perceived as somewhat more suited to the quiet, light comedy roles of "Lost in Translation", makes the jump to sci-fi actioner easily, becoming a definite action queen. Both of them did exceptionally well in this role.<br /><br />The special effects are awesome, making the film all the more realistic and impacting. The use of the natural light to bring across a warm and hazy glow of summer also added something to the overall feel of the movie. Among the sci-fi movies of recent times, I would rank "The Island" as among the best for technical quality.<br /><br />While the plot starts off with some surprises, keeping the viewers in suspense, the later parts descend into somewhat cliched and corny lines. The ending itself was somewhat overdone and superficial, which did not enhance the movie itself. However, the previous couple of hours were so good that I found myself not minding the film's plummet into predictable sentimentality so much.<br /><br />Bottom line, I really liked the movie, and enjoyed watching a well-executed film that entertained and threw up some nice ethical questions to ruminate on.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>The Island has an intriguing premise for the first half of the film, and I was reminded of some of the better parts of George Lucas' "THX 1138", The Matrix series, Orwell's "1984", Crichton's "Coma" and "Logan's Run". A group of adults live in a tightly controlled sci-fi high-rise wearing identical white jumpsuits.  Everything from their diet to their education is guided by other adults who seem to be at this commune to "care" for the inhabitants.  We are shown scenes where these inhabitants are told repeatedly that the ultimate experience is to win "The Lottery" where they are taken from the institute to "The Island".  The Island, they are told, is the last pathogen-free environment left in the world after an event that has contaminated the entire world.<br /><br />At this point you don't know exactly what the purpose of the place is, or what "The Island" actually means, but by the mid-point of the film Ewan McGregor's "Lincoln 6 Echo" has figured it out and brought along Scarlet Johansson's "Jordan 2 Delta". Sean Bean plays the Doctor who is the head of the entire operation and Djimon Hounsou plays a mercenary who is brought in with a team of tough-guys to corral Lincoln and Jordan and protect the secret of The Island.  Steve Buscemi steals his few scenes as an institute employee who is torn between his compassion for Lincoln and Jordan and the knowledge that doing anything actively against the institute is just asking for big trouble.  All other characters have dialogue that moves the story along while Buscemi's McCord has several lines that provide the only comic relief to the picture.  McCord befriends Lincoln early in the film and at the midway point is the character who gets to give Lincoln and Jordan a crash course in "being human".  Explaining about "God" he says: "Well, you know, when you want something really bad and you close your eyes and you wish for it? God's the guy that ignores you."<br /><br />Now - I haven't said hardly anything about the actual plot, because finding out the secrets with Lincoln and Jordan is most of the fun of the film.  If the film had stayed smart I'd likely have given 5 stars and might consider it one of the greatest of science fiction films.  Instead, Michael Bay uses the last half of the film to stage a series of absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic chase scenes.  Lincoln and Jordan, although only human, live through a few events that would leave other humans not only dead, but with mutilated, mangled corpses.  After one such event a building worker pulls them to safety saying "I KNOW Jesus is with you!"<br /><br />I felt like saying "Hey... what is this? I was using my brain back there..."  For the final half of the film - go ahead and turn your brain off.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>Not a bad movie really.  Nice sets and effects.....the camera was very shaky during action scenes, which was really annoying.

I think it will make some who are all for cloning and its attendant technologies a bit squeamish, but that is part of its purpose, just as the 1978 movie "Coma" raised similar questions for transplants.  The movie has basically two very different parts.  One is a kind of scifi mood piece and the other is an extremely hyper (even preposterous) action flick.  Does it work?  Well, as I say, I found it enjoyable, but not enlightening.<br /><br />If you think of the movie as opening with a kind of 1984 - Brave New World that then transitions with Coma and then finishes with an adrenaline fueled Logan's Run, well, that is about it.  It is well done for what it is and has a couple of touching moments.  However, they are hard to feel because they are small cupfuls within barrels of crashbangboom.<br /><br />So, if you just enjoy it for what it is and, sad to say, don't think too much, you can have fun with this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I wasn't very sure if I wanted to see "The Island" when it first came out.  Sure, it looked like a really cool action yarn, but something about it was holding me back.  Well, I finally got up the courage to check this film out and I have to admit that it was a rather good movie.  Directed by Michael Bay, who's directed such action fare as "Armageddon" and "The Rock," the viewer is insured that there will be plenty of explosions and gunplay.<br /><br />The story is rather compelling.  In the near future, a doctor (played sinisterly to perfection by Sean Bean) develops a way to create clones that match the age and makeup of an actual person.  These clones supply spare parts for their respective "clients."  Think of it as a sort of biological auto shop.  One of the clones, Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor), starts to question the alternate reality that he and his fellow clones are residing in.  As the days go by, clones win the "Lottery" and are sent to the Island.  In other words, lottery winners are sent to a medical unit where they are basically gutted for livers, hearts, kidneys, etc.  Some of the female clones are used for breeding so that their client won't have to go through child labor, nursing, or any of the other pains of motherhood.  McGregor's character is also drawn to Scarlett Johansson's character, Jordan Two-Delta.  When she wins the lottery, McGregor escapes with her to learn the ugly truth of what is actually going on.  Of course, in true Michael Bay style, explosions and countless chases ensue.<br /><br />With a cast packed full of stars such as Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Steve Buscemi, you expect solid acting.  You get that in this film.  McGregor and Johansson are a likeable pair, and McGregor takes on two roles as the film unfolds.  As stated before, Sean Bean is stellar as the doctor who is unrelenting in his attempt to capture the escaped clones and protect his investment. There are also some recognizable faces from televison with rather brief but valuable contributing roles.<br /><br />This film is really plot driven, which is a departure somewhat for Bay.  However, he really shines with the action sequences.  From heart-pounding car/jetbike(WASP) chases to good ol' shoot'em ups.  Bay covers all territories nicely.  Most of the action is flawless, though a few of the CGI sequences can be picked apart.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really good film worthy of multiple viewings.  If you enjoy films such as "Equilibrium" (also starred Sean Bean), "Minority Report," or "The Rock," you're sure to love this film.  If you like action films in general, this one will take your breath away.  Definitely a purchase for the sci-fi and action fan.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Some of the reviews were so bad I felt awkward on line, like my friends would come by, see me trying to get into THE ISLAND, and jeer at me.  However, this is America and we're allowed to see any old pap we want to, so I paid my money and took a chance on this film.  I'm glad I did because this was truly a spellbinding thriller that had me on the edge of my seat a good two hours.<br /><br />And yet I can see why some disliked it.  I'm of two minds about the  constant product placement.  To me it seemed to give some backing to the theory that Michael Bay, improbable as it may seem, was building a case against unbridled capitalism, by the mere thickness of the web of logos that the viewer must struggled through, like his clones have to struggle through phalanx after phalanx of black-garbed security men to find freedom.  I never really thought about it much beyond that, however, look at a book like Bret Easton Ellis' GLAMORAMA, in which much of the horror is in fact contingent on the relentless dropping of brand names, drop by drop like the so-called Chinese water torture.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson do just fine playing their parts.  I thought Scarlett more appealing in this film then in any other. I loved the part where Ewan approaches her, despite the limits on "proximity" and whispers something into her ear in a visual reminiscence of the final scene in LOST IN TRANSLATION, where Bill Murray tells her something the audience never hears, the import of which we try to guess by studying her reaction.<br /><br />People are wondering why this movie didn't do better upon opening.  I think it's because it's hard to understand!  Well, if you keep at it you get it, and there are some exposition scenes later on that manage to avoid tedium, but for the first half hours I was just one big "Huh?" scratching my head like Elmer Fudd.  There was plenty to look at, but I can see how it would be confusing for many, and word of mouth might have suffered.  Caspian Tredwell-Owen's screenplay was miles better than his last fil;m, BEYOND BORDERS with Angelina Jolie, and I look forward to seeing what comes out of his head next.<br /><br />We couldn't figure out how the women in the sector, many of whom are about to give birth, actually got pregnant!  I felt like a child again before I knew anything about sex.  How did the women understand what pregnancy was about?  I guess they were just told they had been inseminated for the good of the race.<br /><br />In fact, as we walked away from the tremendous ball of excitement that is THE ISLAND, loose ends began piling around our feet ike seaweed.  Picking our way around them, we went home happy as idiots.  Haven't had as fun a time in the movies all summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I have seen Star Wars III, Batman Begins, War of the Worlds, and The Fantastic Four.  While all those movies were excellent, The Island outshines them all.  Scarlett Johansen and Euwene MacGregor are excellent as clones who have lived in an enclosed city with the promise of an ultimate trip to "The Island."  This is supposed to be the ultimate reward for their service and those that get chosen to go, do so via a lottery.<br /><br />MacGregor starts to get haunted by a dream where he is on a boat and being drowned.  He tells this dream to the city doctor who appears to be more than intrigued by it, in fact he has a mechanical table violently take hold of MacGregor and inject robot mini probes into the sides of his eyes.<br /><br />MacGregor's curiousity makes him start to question everything and it is sparked more by a maintenance man (Steve Busemi) who lives outside the enclosed city.  (The people are told that the outside was contaminated from a great castrophe).  This curiousity continues to increase when he finds a rather large insect.  MacGregor starts to learn the real truth behind the "lottery" and save his lady friend (Johansen) who has won the lottery and is scheduled to go to the supposed island.<br /><br />The rest of the movie plays out like a super high tech version of Logan's Run.  The special effects are amazing especially the futurastic Los Angeles.  Even though you can kind of figure what will happen, the movie is compelling mostly due to the excellent acting of the two stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Don't get me wrong. The Island is as stark a reminder as any of Hollywood's target demographic, teenagers, but it takes an intriguing premise based on the ethics of stem cell research and sets up a clever ruse of a human assembly line in the not very distant future.<br /><br />We open with squeaky-clean hordes in their white jogging suits (and matching Puma shoes; the marketing machine behind this movie could do with a lesson in subtlety) as they carry lipstick traces of a whole array of movies from years past -- Gattaca, Logan's Run, 1984, The Matrix series, a healthy mix of Star Wars episodes -- and bustle around in icy, postmodern vistas.<br /><br />Except for this one inevitable outlier who begins to, oh no, wonder, ask pesky questions of his surroundings. The techno bunkum is semi-believable but then my popcorn was impeccably salted.<br /><br />And then, boom! We kick into full throttle as the snazzy posters had screamed. The CGI team earns its keep, some of the action is superbly executed, even if the camerawork is needlessly jerky. Certain road chase sequences for instance are reminiscent of Matrix Reloaded from very recent memory, but Matrix had handled it with a poise that didn't leave my pupils somersaulting. The bikes are cooler on the Island though.<br /><br />As airheaded as the plot twists are (an aberrant scientist who befriends one of the clones in the dungeons and ultimately....no, watch it yourself) they add a dash of humor to the proceedings. Much of this comic respite comes from Steve Buscemi and his goofball nonchalance, pitting human follies against the impish innocence of these machin..er..CC humans. Scarlet Johannsen looks Nivea soft when appropriate but oh can those legs run and clamber! Ewan McGregor hardly conjures up images of an action superstar but his pimple-forehead charm is infectious.<br /><br />Sadly, with all this going for it, the last quarter falls prey to some dopey chase sequences and a hail of product placements (MSN, Nokia, Puma, Chrysler...long winding list). Then there are sudden exalted messages of slavery that build into an unsatisfying segue - one of our clone buddies was a US president's lookalike, what happened to these freed folks?<br /><br />Well, as they say, suspend your disbelief, leave your Oscar hat at home, lean back with a big cup of Coke, no ice. The soundtrack is fabulous and it props some well paced eye candy so relish it for what it is. Recommended if you can catch it in a theatre with Dolby and the whole shebang.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"The Island" is the only box-office disaster of director Michael Bay's career.  It's also his best film.<br /><br />It includes all the Bay cinematic standards - dramatic slow-motions, incoherent close-ups of screaming faces, camera swishes and pans, a Eurotrash villain, a carnage-ridden car chase. And yet it works this time - the script isn't completely stupid or amoral, like the "Bad Boys" series, and Bay has found a movie where he doesn't have the need to endlessly objectify women.<br /><br />Unlike Steven Spielberg's "Artificial Intelligence" or "Minority Report," "The Island" isn't precisely a thinkpiece. It's more thoughtful than a superhero movie, though. "Batman Begins," for its many strengths, is ultimately forgettable. "The Island" will have a little more staying power with me.<br /><br />The movie opens in the near future, at a giant complex housing the last living humans to survive the nuclear contamination outside, although, strangely, they keep finding survivors. The people work on assembly lines injecting vitamins into tubes leading through the walls. Then - who knows where they go?<br /><br />All of the workers await their invitation to the island, the last remaining contamination free zone in the world.<br /><br />One of the survivors, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), has questions. Why must he always wear white? Why can't he have bacon at breakfast instead of oatmeal? Why isn't he allowed to have "too much proximity" to women, specifically Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johannson). What are these dreams he has of a boat? And dreams he has of being strangled?<br /><br />There are answers, and they involve the real nature of the "people" living in the complex: They're clones waiting to be used by their owners out in the real world, should they ever need them. The owners have been told by the doctor (Sean Bean) who runs the complex the clones live in amniotic fluid, and never reach consciousness. But when their organs were harvested, they failed. Thus the clones must eat, breathe, run around, live. Thus the illusion. An invite to the island is really the clone's death, revealed in a graphic scene involving a recent winner (Michael Clarke Duncan) whose liver is needed for his football-star owner in the real world.<br /><br />Lincoln Six Echo finds out, hatches an escape with Jordan Two Delta, and the second act of "The Island" shifts into a action movie, about 45 minutes of top-shelf mayhem.  The car chase involves a bounty hunter (Djimon Hounsou) and his crew,  a semi truck, an armored truck, about  ten futuristic Pontiacs and two hovercraft motorcycles out of "Return of the Jedi." It's the best of its kind since "The Matrix Reloaded." Act three involves finding the owner of Lincoln Six Echo, also played by McGregor, and returning to the underground complex.<br /><br />The logic of "The Island" is a bit creaky - given what we know about the clones at the end of the film, it seems unlikely that just one would have his doubts about the whole system. Mixing the genders seems pointless, too - since it's unimportant for to mix for medical purposes. But you can deconstruct most science fiction flicks. "The Island" passes the essential action test: Does it work in the moment? Is it cool? Is it loud and burly? Does it have a little bit of humor?<br /><br />McGregor and Johansson - who has never and probably never will again look this good - aren't A-list stars, and that may have dimmed the box office returns, but they make the transition from mildly content clones to fear-for-their-life to passionate rebels about as well as could be expected. Bean is appropriately smarmy and English and Hounsou, tabbed to be cooler than everyone in the movie, is.<br /><br />Bay shows what, for Bay, is restraint. After the absolute nightmare that was "Bad Boys II" - that nihilistic, racist junk made $200 million - and the equally brutal, Bay-produced "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," this is a surprise. And, given the returns, a disappointment. That "The Island" fell flat with critics proves some of them are getting a little tough to please; that it fell flat with audiences proves there is something the 2005 moviegoing water.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Another sad example of an outright fantastic initial concept that's spoiled by attempts to shoehorn it into a stiff, static action movie formula. Like Paycheck and I am Legend, this works very, very well for as long as it sticks near the premise, but then bursts into a flaming wreck somewhere in the second act and cartwheels absurdly to the finish line. While the getting's good, it's the most I've enjoyed a Michael Bay movie since The Rock - its high production values make for a convincing, well-structured vision of an elegant futuristic lifestyle. Never one for nuance, Bay actually manages to imply something (an unshakable sense that something's just not right) without spelling it out in bright, bold letters for the audience. It's tough not to embrace a vision so seamless, complete and beautiful. But then the other shoe drops, and it lands with a startling thud. Suddenly we've left behind the intellectually challenging modern Logan's Run atmosphere and we're mindlessly running from a faceless gun-toting enemy, a path of fireballs and demolished automobiles in our wake. Bay takes that as a cue to fall back into his old form and trots out an endless supply of jump cuts, violent action sequences, clunky character moments and bold, excessive product placements. The picture straight-up jumps the tracks, bowls over a herd of buffalo, sails off a cliff and erupts before it can hit the ground. A major disappointment, it's worth watching for roughly the first hour.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>The story is a hodgepodge that resembles"Logan's Run," "Running Out of Time," "Anna to the Infinite Power," and a tad of "Coma." I am sure you can think of others.<br /><br />Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) leads a sterile life and hope to win the lottery and go to the only pathogen free island. Unfortunately he has a propensity for snooping as all Six Echo's do. This will lead him to find an insidious secret and must escape his environment with his girlfriend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) if he wants her to live.

I think this was a remake of a movie that I saw back in the 1970s or so, maybe early 1980s, but I can't remember the title.  I finally tracked it down, that movie was 1978's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790743671">Coma</a>,starring Geniveve Bujold and Michael Douglas.  If it wasn't a remake, it at least has some strong similarities.  Now that I think of it, I see that there are significant differences, but if you've seen COMA and THE ISLAND you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Well, I finally had a chance to take a look at this film, and I was, frankly, quite impressed.  Scarlett Johansson, Ewan MacGregor, and Sean Bean headline the cast.  Let's see...who will we make the protagonist and who will we make the antagonist in the main plot?  I wonder, I wonder...<br /><br />Anyway, McGregor and Johansson live in a highly controlled, closed environment habitat to protect them and many others from a dreadful plague that has affected the world sometime in the future.  Yep, this is a futuristic Sci-Fi flick...and I tend to like these.  So, their lives are safe, but bland, and there is a strong component of "Big Brother is watching" to their existence.  People wait, work, and watch to see who will win the ocassional lottery to go to "The Island", a paradisiacal place where people live in complete luxury.<br /><br />MacGregor starts to wonder about their existence and starts asking questions.  Then, one day he finds a large moth that somehow made its way in from the outside, and this starts him wondering whether there really is a plague out there.<br /><br />If you like unexpected plot twists, plenty of action, a sci-fi slant, and. you know, car chase scenes, gunfire, and guys dressed in black chasing the heroes, you'll like this film.<br /><br />It's good, but probably won't be a classic, though I'd be happy to watch it again sometime.<br /><br />4 solid stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In the year 2019, scientists have created a special underground science facility where people have been cloned are made for research. Fellow clone Lincoln (Ewan Mcgregor) is lonely and feels like a mindless slave to work for genetics, he falls in love with a lovely clone named Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johannson) and feels like he needs to escape. They have led to believe that the outside world is a mess and one of the only places accessible is an Island through lottery by lives of any slave. After one of the clones gets ill, Lincoln finds out his life was fake as he decides to escape with Jordan into the outside world on the lamb to find the truth, they would later become fugitives.<br /><br />Co-starring Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Sean Bean and Ethan Philips, this is a spectacular and underrated action/Sci-fi drama thrill ride of a movie. The film is inspired by "The Clonus Horror" with a bit of Philip K. Dick and the Aeon Flux animated series, Michael Bay and producer Spielberg know to make crowdpleasing entertainment and this is something different for Bay for once. This represents a chilling idea of what if cloning like this happened in the future of being a person who doesn't know that his or her real self is there in the real world.<br /><br />This DVD only has 2 extras which are audio commentary from Bay and featurette.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Blade Runner", "Akira", "Ghost in The Shell 1 & 2", "The Matrix Trilogy", "Daybreakers", "Metropolis (1927 and 2001)", "Inception", "Transformers (2007) and 2", "Avatar", "Moon", "Pandorum", "Gattaca", "Aeon Flux", "1983", "Children of Men", "12 Monkeys", "Total Recall", "Soylent Green", "Terminator Saga", "Equilibrium", "THX-1138", "Heavy Metal", "I Robot", "Dark City", "The Fifth Element", "Scanners", "Next", "AI Artifical Intelligence", "Surrogates", "Ultraviolet", "The Running Man", "Gamer", "V For Vendetta", "District 9", "Existenz", "6th Day", "Death Race 2000 and Death Race 2008" and "Fahernheit 451".</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>THE ISLAND<br /><br />I don't know but I kinda like Michael Bay, at least the man knows how to deliver on the action even though he is not known for great story telling. But I think he is a pretty good director and he hires Steve Buscemi [probably my favorite actor] a lot so at least he can recognize talented actors. But regardless of the over all assumption that he can't really tell a story I would say to those people to check out this flick right here, it may not be your favorite movie but it may turn out to be your favorite Bay film. There is a quote on the back of the case that states "great story, great action, great film" and I could not agree more.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson star as two people who live their day to day lives as told by the government, eating when told, working when told, sleeping and waking when told basically everything when told. Still they are fine and awaiting their turn to be chosen to go to the last place on Earth not affected by a plague that wiped out humanity almost, The Island. But Ewan's character is suspicious about what is really going on and his suspicions are only heightened by Steve Buscemi who some how has all these things that he should not have. It turns out that they along with every one else down there are clones inside an underground bunker, they are clones of rich people who want fresh matching organs when they need them. So they make an escape that sends the owner and employees into a panic because this thing is far from legal. So as they make their way through a world they do not know on the surface and come to terms with what they are and that there is no island they are being hunted by the best money can buy. They are out to find the people they are cloned from and try to convince them they are just as alive as them.<br /><br />Producer/director Michael Bay really did a great job with this film and deserves to be recognized for doing so, I think for a director who was only known for action really did a good job with a story as well. The fact is that the first half of this movie and that includes the escape from the underground prison is very un Bay like, he gives the characters time to develop and lets them interact on a level he had yet to do. Still credit needs to go to the writers as well; Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci wrote a great story that while not the greatest thing ever is still very entertaining. Mauro Fiore did a great job shooting this movie and made it look like an epic.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor was great in the lead role and played it with a kind childish charm in the way that everything was new and exciting to him, he really felt he was learning. Of course he was going crazy and scarred as well and that shows just as much. Scarlett Johansson was excellent as his partner in crime so to speak but of course that is expected, she is always one of the show stealers no matter what film it is. Djimon Hounsou is great as the lead hunter going after these two who has a change of heart, and Sean Bean is brilliant as well. But it is of course Steve Buscemi who steals the show in my opinion as the only friend that these two have on the outside since it is him that got Ewan thinking. He is the reason I went to see this and also the reason I wanted to buy it when it came out but luckily the entire movie going experience was great.<br /><br />Of course this film does have a flaw but it is not a big one at all, in fact it still was enjoyable. The last half of the film seems to lean a little too much on the action and kinda forgets the story a little bit, so I guess Bay falls a little on what he knows but that is not a bad thing. So with that said this is actually a really good movie that most people should enjoy, I know I did. I recommend this as a purchase just skip the rental; I think it is worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>This is a good film by Michael Bay that obviously has some story to it dealing with some important ethical and morailty issues on cloaning.  This is not the first time a movie has been made on such issues, though its an improvement over such films such as The 6th Day.  With a great cast, excellent use of cgi action in a futuristic setting, and a fine plot - one would think it is an overall success.  It is enjoybale in the end, but the three main elements seem to clash along the lines too often to keep it from perfection.<br /><br />The movie begins with the enclosed lifestyles of the clones, though we don't know that they are clones quite yet.  It brings up many questions as to what exactly is going on, and though a bit slow at times, it doesn't really matter cause it makes you want to keep watching to figure all this out.  Once we discover the meaning of what is exactly going on, the thrills of the chase and action begins, and that's where it gets exciting yet the story gets a bit crumbled down.  Then comes the question of if this is exactly right, what people are doing to these clones, and it comes to the point that even bad guys will do good when the line is pushed too far in their field of work (you'll know what I mean when you see the Djimon Hounsou character).<br /><br />If the moral/ethical point of view is tiresome or doesn't interest you, there is still plenty of sci-fi thrill to entertain, as well as plenty of humor thrown into the mix.  Again, the cast list is impressive, and even the smaller roles seem to play an interesting part in this film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine movie that is good but not great.  Things don't flow too smoothly altogether, but this is still a movie sure to entertain and make a great comment about ethics and morality about longlivety.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>"The Island", the combination of Action / Sci-Fi/ Thriller and more is quite enjoyable (it is always fun to see not just one but two Ewan Mcgregors on the screen; Scarlett has become a real beauty, and Steve Buscemi makes any film watchable) but easily forgettable summer blockbuster. "The Island" takes place in the near future and tells the story of a world where the cloning have became a reality and the wealthy citizens can and do order the clones in order to successfully treat their present or future health problems. The clones are living human beings with the feelings and dreams that have no idea about their destination which is to become the source for matching body parts, blood, and organ of the ones who paid for them. The movie raises very interesting, serious, and important ethical questions but does not have time to stop and to contemplate on them - it is too busy with the non-stoppable fast and furious action sequences.  It had the potentials of 'The Matrix" (first one) or "Minority Report" - it just did not happen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>Great premise - the Minority Report meets Soylent Green meets the Matrix with a heap of current ethical issues tossed in to boot.  Perhaps the execution failed because there were conflicting goals - was this a morality play or an action flick?  Either way, the premise was an interesting one.  You just keep wondering, "We get the joke, now when's it going to end?"  It's like hearing the punchline halfway through the set-up.  Could've easily been a 90 minute movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>This is one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time.  It is certainly the best Michael Bay movie since THE ROCK.  It's also the most "cerebral" film I've ever seen Bay do.  The ensemble cast is fantastic, featuring Steve Buscemi, Sean Bean, Ewan McGregor and the stunningly gorgeous Scarlett Johannson.  Djimon Hounsou proves that he is much more than an impressive physique (although I've always thought him a good actor in movies like AMISTAD and GLADIATOR, anyway).<br /><br />In addition to the cast and direction, the story itself is captivating and it's very, very relevant to our times.  It examines the consequences of taking the extreme end of one side of medical ethics.  What this movie reminded me was of a cross between LOGAN'S RUN and BRAVE NEW WORLD, with a science fiction twist in the plot.<br /><br />As such, there is a wider & deeper theme of social engineering / manipulation that has nothing to do with medical ethics & everything to do with how much we can trust our government.  How much of what our politicians say is true actually IS true?  How worthy are the people in Washington of our trust?  This is a trenchant question in this day & age of world chaos and corrupt politicians.<br /><br />Of course, there is also a subtle satire on the concept of religion buried in the tapestry of the story.  In this respect it is much like LOGAN'S RUN.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a good action movie that is also a science fiction movie that has a great cast & is well done, this one is for you.

Why did the credits NOT read "Special Appearance BY Michael Clarke Duncan"?<br /><br />Liked Ewan in the film.<br /><br />Over all an enjoyable action film.<br /><br />DVD package-I HATE, HATE, HATE, these packages with the little flip down openings.  THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the Island but when you come right down to it, it really IS just a retread of Logan's Run (with a dash of Fortress thrown in).  Didn't have to be; in 2 hours, 20 minutes there could have been some fabulous interactions between the uneducated clones and the outside world.  Instead, its running, chasing, digital compositing and showing how much they let Michael Bay spend.<br /><br />Speaking of Mr. Bay, his commentary shows he has no need to work on his self-confidence and its not very interesting.  Talking about one of the better scenes--the abandoned train station--he says "I'm not gonna tell you where it is".  Took exactly one click in Google to find out.<br /><br />One thing Bay's right about is that it was difficult to market "The Island".  It forced them to tell you in the trailer, that there was no island so what else do you need to know?</p></br></body></html>

The acting is unconvincing, and the direction is sloppy, but all elements of production design are first-rate. Mark Isham's score is appropriate, but a little too much like Jerry Goldsmith's "Chinatown" music, especially the use of the solo trumpet. Mr. de Palma missed on this one, and his cast seemed uninterested in their material. James Ellroy can be given brilliant film adaptation ("L.A. Confidential"), but not this one. What a bummer. I was hoping for so much more.  The DVD extras are more entertaining and informative than the film itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>This wasn't a bad movie just wasn't what everyone thought it would be. It is hard to follow if you don't watch too carefully.<br /><br />Wish it would have been more about the Black Dahlia than this storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Wow, I can't believe how much I disliked this film, especially with the presence of such attractive actresses as Hilary Swank, Scarlett Johansson and Mia Kirshner. There's simply nothing entertaining or engaging about this movie. It's admittedly stylish, but so slow. Making matters worse, there's no sympathetic figure to care about.<br /><br />Ranging from the amoral police practices of officers Bleichert and Blanchard to the rich, perverse and disgusting Linscott family, the storyline drifts through the seedier bars and nightspots of Los Angeles circa late `40's. The only one to muster a spark of interest is Mia Kirshner in the ill-fated role of Elizabeth Short (Black Dahlia) but her part is so short and interspersed so infrequently through the film it's virtually impossible to maintain your connection with the character. I recommend you pass on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>I have no idea why there has to be yet another take on the Black Dahlia, and Brian De Palma seems to have completely lost any ability to make remotely interesting anything anymore.<br /><br />To top it off, I don't know what Hollywood sees in Hilary Swank at all. First of all, are they all blind. This is not a sexy attractive woman and yet she plays a femme fatale in this.<br /><br />Throw in the whole Scarlett Johansson, Josh Harnett, Aaron Eckhart what is the deal with them? Are they living a polyamorous lifestyle? It's never fully revealed and I couldn't figure out if it was implied or what it had to do with anything. She's wasted in this role and she should have played the femme fatale character.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a complete mess and looks as flat as a made-for-TV movie.<br /><br />Could we put to rest any more Black Dahlia movies. Wasn't the 1975 movie Who Is The Black Dahlia starring Efrem "FBI" Zimbalist Jr. enough?</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>De Palma made a long time expected tribute to Noir genre but making a straightforward approach than the previous Scarface, The untouchables or Carlito's way, for instance. His intention was to mirror the elusive and hypnotic atmosphere that featured L.A. in the forties. Of course, films such as Set up, Nightmare Alley, Sunset Boulevard or Murder my sweet had approached some of the different issues dealt in this film,, corruption, easy money goal, sphere of influences and above all lack of self esteem for the sake of figure as a simple extra, or on the contrary to occupy a prominent status in the show business. But the corruption in the police departament and the way some people made easy money through ilicit movements made me remind the central nerve of Chinatown.<br /><br />Maybe the lack of a narrative pulse or the excessive preciosity by this renowned director made the dramatic spinal column would suffer of sclerosis too soon.<br /><br />Josh Harnett and Hillary Swank made top notch performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>I like crime dramas, they are a very sophisticated form of film and most of them have been compelling and rather interesting and they really know how to deliver plots and twists. This film however, squanders the potential it has by not taking its interesting ideas anywhere. Scenes go back and forth and really don't have much to do with the Black Dahlia murder most of the time, but rather it feels like a chronicle of the life of a cop and his sexcapades while supposedly investigating a murder.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The time is 1947, and a young fledgling star named Elizabeth Short is found dead, cut in half and her face mutilated. Two detectives Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard are assigned to the case and uncover a plethora of of buried secrets and lies about the murders, all while having relationship problems and threats of being kicked off the investigation for numerous reasons, and sleeping with every chick that comes their way.<br />STORY: SCORE- 5.5 OUT OF 10- The story presents a lot of interesting ideas, but never properly implements them into the fabric of the plot. Randomly cramming in scenes of sexuality and girl-on-girl scenes is not going to make a compelling crime drama, but rather it is a bit of annoyance, it's more of something that should be kept in the privacy of the bedroom. I'm fine with maybe one or two scenes of that nature, but it cannot be a major component of the damn plot.<br />MUSIC: SCORE- 8 OUT OF 10- I've always enjoyed the jazzy cop noir themes of this kind of music and it is present and accounted for in here, but it's not the best music for these kinds of themes.<br />COMPELLING FACTOR: SCORE- 6 OUT OF 10- The story is fairly enjoyable, but the plot twists really aren't things you haven't seen or heard before, so basically it's the same old song and dance of age-old plot twists.<br />PORN FACTOR: SCORE- 8.5 OUT OF 10- There sure are a lot of scenes of sexuality, and why have these girl-on-girl scenes been added?<br />PLOT TWISTS: SCORE- 5.5 OUT OF 10- There is basically nothing shocking, nothing surprising, or for that matter, anything you haven't seen already, go get your fix elsewhere. Go, just walk away and go find another crime drama.<br />OVERALL: SCORE- 6 OUT OF 10- This film's mediocrity is shocking, especially since it was made by the director of Scarface, a much better crime drama. What makes this film all the more sad is the fact the short film; Detective Story from the Animatrix; had a more compelling plot than this... and it was nine minutes long. You're better going and getting your fix from films like Pulp Fiction, Scarface, The Godfather, The Departed, or the superbly crafted animated film Renaissance, or perhaps Sin City. Whatever your preference, you're not missing anything if you don't watch this movie.<br />THE GOOD: Interesting story ideas, good music, some okay plot twists.<br />THE BAD: Good ideas don't go anywhere, it's more focused on the sexcapades of a detective and boring relationship problems.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>It had all the ingredients of a great movie -- sex, corruption, murder and a noir atmosphere.<br /><br />So how, how HOW did it go wrong? Instead of the real-life murder thriller of the year, "The Black Dahlia" ended up being a turgid, incomprehensible mess that flops madly around like an epileptic fish. "LA Confidential," this ain't -- it's more of a flaccid stagger into the real-life story of a gruesome murder, without much to make us care what happens.<br /><br />Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Leland "Lee" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are boxer/cops, and are on a stakeout when the dismembered, disfigured body of a young woman is found -- blood drained, chopped in half, and mutilated all over. The public becomes increasingly obsessed with who killed the starlet, nicknamed the "Black Dahlia."<br /><br />So Bucky and Lee start investigating who killed the Black Dahlia, prowling through lesbian bars and learning the seedy details of what happened to the girl, with tragic results for the partners. Who killed the Black Dahlia, and why? The answers are even more shocking.<br /><br />And boring. "The Black Dahlia" is crammed with stuff to titillate and shock -- stag films, incest, lesbian pairings (for a pretty silly reason, actually), and Scarlett Johansson in 1940s lingerie. But it ends up doing the exact reverse -- it stupefies. Like a beautiful painting, it doesn't actually move or show anything really happening -- it just sits there, looking pretty.<br /><br />The first half is a pretty ordinary murder thriller, a la "L.A. Confidential" -- it's all very glitzy and grimy, and fairly easy to understand. Serial killer, pretty girl killed gruesomely, and two cops out to find out whodunnit. Right, that's fine. But when the guys start prowling through lesbian bars, the plot ties itself into a snarly knot, and gets more and more incomprehensible as Harnett rattles through the staggery storylines.<br /><br />Admittedly Brian De Palma juices this up with beautiful vintage costumes, sets and other stunning visuals. But by the ending, nothing makes sense -- and along the way, we have to deal with tepid subplots like the boxing (what?) and Bucky gallantly rejecting Lee's girlfriend's advances. It only complicates an incomprehensible plot, with turgid, forgettable dialogue (" I don't get modern art." "I doubt modern art gets you, either" -- what?).<br /><br />Harnett looks wooden and confused, as if he's just been told to "play it like Bogart" and he has no idea who that is. Eckhart tries his best, and he's an excellent actor even in a bad movie -- but Lee is a character with no logical thought processes, and Johansson basically is there to look busty and have sex with Harnett.<br /><br />Lame neo-noir with a twist of tepidity, "The Black Dahlia" takes what could have been a promising movie, and turns it into a Gordian knot of absurd subplots and horrible twists.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Black Dahlia is hideous and I'm being kind here. I can't believe this movie is directed by Brian De Plama (Carrie, Dressed to Kill). He must have been desperate to direct this crap. Hilary Swank's acting is actually worse than Jost Hartnett's. The plot goes nowhere, the nude scenes are embarrassing, and the movie is shot in complete blackness, I could hardly make out a scene. I couldn't find one person who enjoyed this filth. The Black Dahlia is one of the worst films of 2006, now I know why this movie did horrible in the theaters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>I'd really like to see the uncut version in this case because it's impossible to summarize this novel with all its subplots in just two hours. The characters's behaviour isn't logical at all here and, unfortunately, the movie never creates the so peculiar mood found in every book written by James Ellroy. As it is, The Black Dahlia is a promising fim seriously ill.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>"The Black Dahlia" is a mess.  Everything's impressive and nothing is right.  It seems like Aaron Eckhart's character should be played with more darkness, like Josh Hartnett's character should be played with less boyishness, like Scarlett Johannson's character should be more emotionally complex.  The story is convoluted and the storytelling is awkward.  I can explain the film's core storylines, but to tie everything together is a task beyond me.  There is one person involved who deserves praise: Mia Kirshner, who portrays the thin, secondary character of Elizabeth Short with surprising emotional depth.  Brian De Palma's original three-hour cut supposedly was a horse of a different color.  The cut with which we're presented is boring, absurd, and unpleasant.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This movie should have been good. It had a great concept and back story to work off of. It had a good cast, except for Josh Hartnett who is the blackhole of movies, and Scarlett Johansen is good in cutey roles and has nice assets but she is not a good dramatic actress in this kind of role. This movie just misses the mark on about every level. The only good thing is that the costumes and the portrayal of the period are both good.

"Dahlia" is actually several different types of film rolled into one: a buddy-cop movie, period LA Noir flick and a based-on-a-true-story movie - all being types that Hollywood has tackled with decided ineptitude on their own, and now Hollywood has added another painful reminder of that failure.  (Only "LA Confidential" managed to rise above the pack, even as an imperfect masterpiece that easily outstrips "Dahlia".)<br /><br />The flick follows the "Dahlia" legend through the story of Blanchard (Eckhardt) and Bleichert (Hartnett), both ambitious but scandal-tinged LA cops of the immediate post-war City of Angels.  Sharing a love of boxing and Scarlett Johannsen, the two are only apparently two of a kind, but in reality represent polar opposites.  The unusually prescient media call them "Fire and Ice", and when the "Dahlia" story breaks, they are an odious DA's natural choice.  Instead, the case soon begins to break the two star cops, unhinging Blanchard and driving his wife into Bleichert's arms.  Bleichert himself begins to doubt the case is solvable and counsels his good friend to drop it, even as he continues to follow leads.  Instead of returning to his normal duties of pulling in dangerous felons at large, Bleichert pieces together threads that point to a rich Hollywood land developer, the underground pornography industry, and a rich bisexual heiress played by Hilary Swank.<br /><br />You know how you can sit through a bad movie and not realize how you've been taken until the credits roll?  I saw "Dahlia" last night, and even before that mid-movie haze wore off, I realized the painful botch I'd gotten myself into.  "Dahlia" probably appealed to its studio as one of those movies that makes no sense but looked like something that could survive on style, but the flick is short on style and long on nonsense.  Style-wise, DePalma looked to out-Noir "LA Confidential", but his touches just come off as a Noir parody, with all the expected gags: the hero cops are both morally suspect, and even Bleichert dangles the possibility that he might conceal evidence against Swank's character once the two of them hop in the sack; Swank's over-the-top performance as a spoiled and sexually ambiguous heiress is built around an impression of Katherine Hepburn (if Hepburn had played "The Philadelphia Story" with a potty-mouth, Swanks performance would have been dead-on); last-minute, implausible confessions will solve everything.<br /><br />The least believable thing about "The Black Dahlia" is that despite this being fiction (which would have given the script a free reign to shock us) and also that Brian DePalma is at the helm, this is an incredibly boring movie, lacking any suspense and short on surprises.  There is only a single sequence that does the legend justice - when Bleichert discovers the scene of the crime: the pacing and lighting are so perfectly paced that the story comes closest to realizing the dark dread that the rest of the story has been insulating us from.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>LAPD detectives Bucky Bleichert (Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Eckhart) are partners.  They are working a child rape case when their path intersects with the murder of Elizabeth Shore (Kirshner).  Lee becomes obsessed with that case, and drags Bucky along for the ride.  The investigation leads Bucky to Madeline Linscott (Swank), and soon he is in a relationship he shouldn't be with a possible witness.  At the same time, sparks are flying with Lee's girlfriend, Kay (Johansson), but going down that path would be disastrous for his relationship with his partner.  As Bucky and Lee get closer to the truth, things get dangerous, and neither of them might have long left to live.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" is based on the novel by James Ellroy, and not the real-life unsolved mystery.  This gives the movie free reign to actually solve the case, but perhaps their treatment of the solution was better left unknown.  "The Black Dahlia" is a bit of a confusing mess.  Add to that poor acting, for the most part all around, and this is a film that does not live up to expectations.  Sure, it looks great, but that only goes so far.  I cannot recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>Weird screenplay fulfilment of the novel.<br /><br />Hokey noir effort.<br /><br />Acting: None of the actors were at their best. Aaron Eckhart was perhaps the best, followed closely by Fiona Shaw as Mrs. Lindscott. From there the movie disappointed.<br /><br />The dialogue was very difficult to hear, we kept having to put the volume all the way up.<br /><br />The plot was confusing, especially at the beginning and end (when it's most important).<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson was almost likeable, but looked horrible and almost unattractive. She looked as if she were ill and didn't fit the part at all. Swank tried her best, but did not fully pull off Madeline Lindscott. And Josh Hartness, whose performance I enjoyed in "LUCKY NUMBER SLEVEN" seemed to sleepwalk through this one. I think he was too young or lacked character of facial expressions for the boring slow plotline. Mia Kirschner was entertaining as the murder victim herself, in those screentests which were hilarious.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Supposedly the studio removed about a third out of Brian de Palma's three-hour cut of this film, rendering what we have here exceptionally confusing even if you've read the James Ellroy novel on which it's based (as I have). Bizarrely, the true stories of the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short (Mia Kershner), her murder, and the reaction to it wind up getting the least attention of the plot's many strands: you wind up feeling as if its the annoying bother everyone wishes were out of the way rather than the original story's raison d'etre (and the selling point of the film). Instead we are given full attention to the uninteresting erotic triangle of the two detectives investigating the case (Aaron Eckhardt and Josh Hartnett) and the blonde they both love (Scarlett Johansson), which is far too much anyway like the central dynamic of the three main characters in LA CONFIDENTIAL, a film also based on another novel by Ellroy. Things are not helped by the acting of the main characters: though Johansson comes off best of the three, she doesn't have nearly enough to do, and Hartnett seems a handsome ghost (as always) and Eckhardt, always a capable actor, is more of a character actor than a star and doesn't have the required presence for his role. Hilary Swank, who is on the other hand, indubitably a star, is bizarrely miscast as the Dahlia's  supposed "lookalike" friend, even though she looks absolutely nothing like either Mia Kershner or the real Elizabeth Short. She seems to be whooping it up with her outlandish role and affects for it what Charles Busch has called "American theatrical received pronuniciation"; the producers would have been better off casting him in Swank's role. There are a few nicely executed sequences by Brian de Palma (including two of his signature sequences where several different things happen in one small space at once on many levels vertical, horizontal, and diagonal), and the cinematography deserved its Oscar nomination, but those caveats can't hide the fact that this film is really a bummer. Don't try to get too attached to figuring out whodunnit: the mystery's resolution is absurdly and inadequately explained away in about fifteen seconds by the killer in the most ridiculous scene in the entire film.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Almost every film I see, I know everything about it before I see it. I know what it's about, I know who is in it, and I know what critics and audiences think of it. I saw "The Black Dahlia" in the theatre the day it came out and enjoyed it. Then I began reading the reviews for it and I was like "what the hell?" Nobody likes this movie, for various reasons. It's not as good as the book, it tries to be a film-noir and fails, the acting is bad, and, my favorite reason for hating it, Scarlett Johansson is in it. I've seen the movie three times now...This last time after reading the book and, yes, granted the book is a lot better. This film is not half as bad as it's made out to be though. First off, yes it's not just trying to pay homage to film-noir. It's trying to be a film-noir and it's not. The acting isn't bad, but some of it is campy. And Scarlett Johansson is a very talented and very hot actress. First off, the dialogue in the film is pretty close to the dialogue in the book. It worked very well in the book, but has its ups-and-downs in the movie for several reasons. No one in the movie truly seems comfortable with the dialogue. It's 40s-esque dialogue and you got people who have been in movies like Erin Brockovich, Lost in Translation, and Dumb & Dumber reciting it. The story is one of two films released in 2006 that are fictional stories built on the foundation of a true-life crime story (the other being "Hollywoodland" a superior film). Josh Hartnett plays Dwight<br /><br />"Bucky" Bleichert, a boxer turned LAPD detective dubbed Mr. Ice. Aaron Eckhart plays Lee Blanchard, also a boxer turned LAPD detective dubbed Mr. Fire. To get a proposition passed and score a spot in the Warrants division, Blanchard and Bleichert duke it out and become local celebrities. Soon, they're both working Warrants and find themselves partners. Soon, their duo becomes a trio when Kay Lake (Johansson), Blanchard's girlfriend comes into the mix. But then their lives change forever when a mutilated corpse is found in a vacant lot. The corpse is of a woman, who has been cut in half at the waist, disemboweled, and has had a grisly smile carved onto her face ear-to-ear. The body is Elizabeth Short, dubbed "The Black Dahlia" because of her tendency to wear all black. This is an unsolved murder that really occurred, but almost everything in the movie involving her murder is fictitious. The woman's murder sets Blanchard off and causes him to alienate his friends and family while he obsessively searches for her killer. Bleichert, meanwhile, does his own investigation which leads him to meet Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), the daughter of a rich construction tycoon who bares a remarkable resemblance to The Dahlia. The last 20 minutes of the film weren't handled very well. Many of these scenes are creepy and well filmed, while others are campy. Especially the long-winded monologue delivered by Madeleine's mother Ramona (Fiona Shaw). The acting is really the weak point of the film, but not all of it is bad. Hartnett, Johansson, and Eckhart aren't terrible. Oddly enough, the weakest link is two-time Oscar winner Swank, who looks good for the part but gives a weak performance. Listen closely (maybe not too closely) and you'll hear her trying on a rich-uppity kind of accent. Then you'll hear that accent fade and then suddenly return. In the book, it mentions the character tries to sound like The Black Dahlia (which would be a Boston accent). But what Swank is doing is not a Boston accent. Was it supposed to be? Whatever...The movie scored an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, which I think it deserves. It does catch the atmosphere James Ellroy had in his novel pretty well, but it just doesn't roll with it as far as plot. You have to realize, also, how far the movie differed from the book. It took over a hundred pages before they find the body of Elizabeth Short. In the movie, it takes twenty minutes. The movie is good though and I'm surprised so many people hate it. I think if you were to walk into it with an open mind and no preconceived notion (like I did), you'll enjoy it. It's certainly better than two stars...There's people on Amazon who like "Date Movie" more than this. I think this movie is a lot better than some more acclaimed Brian De Palma films. Even if you didn't like this film the first time, I beg you to give it another chance.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></br><a href="../users/A82R4WKX62LEK.html">A82R4WKX62LEK</a><br/><p>THE MOVIE STARTS OUT PRETTY GOOD. THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES OR SO ARE DECENT. THEN IT DIVES STRAIGHT DOWN LIKE A NUCLEAR MISSLE. BUT CRASHES MUCH LOUDER. THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>For any filmgoers who remember the brilliant works of Brian De Palma back in the 70s and 80s, `The Black Dahlia' a crime novel inspired by true case of a horrible murder of Elizabeth Short in 1947, should have been great opportunity for the maestro to come back. Unfortunately, he misses it, and though you can still enjoy his signature bravura camera, like its frequent vertical movement, you feel he has lost touch.<br /><br />Many people would find the story of `The Black Dahlia' very complicated, but that really doesn't bother me as far as it constantly offers something intriguing. While watching the first 30 minutes of `The Black Dahlia,' my first and only impression was boredom. We meet two cops Bucky (Josh Hartnett) and Lee (Aaron Eckhart); we see their boxing match, we are informed that they are called `Mr. Ice' and `Mr. Fire', and so on. Frankly, we don't care, and the film seems not to care either.<br /><br />The mutilated body of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) is found, but as the investigation goes on, the situation surrounding her death gets far more sinister than her dead body suggested at first. Unfortunately, these lurid aspects of the story seem not to have been treated with enough attention from the actors or director, who failed to understand that obsession of these characters for the darker side of humans (represented by stag film, for example) is exactly the point of James Ellroy or any noir films. Bucky gets involved with three ladies, all doomed in different ways - Kay (Scarlett Johansson) marked with B.D., Madeline (Hilary Swank) daughter of rich family, and of course, Elizabeth - but the portrait of the detective is not credible enough, failing to convince us of his intense emotions.<br /><br />Same thing can be said about Lee trying to hide something from his partner and us, something very important as to which we are not given enough clues, and which Brian De Palma suddenly starts to explain hurriedly in the last 20 minutes. By the time you fully grasp what is going on here, the film is almost over, leaving us far behind. `L. A. Confidential' (based on Ellroy's novel) has also a fairly complicated story, but it never leaves us behind. Its intense characters, all obsessed for something dark, grab your heart from the very beginning.<br /><br />However, you don't see such driving force in the so-so acting of the entire cast of `The Black Dahlia' except Mia Kirshner playing the titular character. What was impressive in other noirs like `Laura' turns into something (unwittingly) silly and campy. We must see boxer-turned-cop Bucky is fatally attracted to the gorgeous ladies both miscast, and Fiona Shaw gives us one of the most embarrassing acting in this decade. Is her overacting really intentional? If so, what's the intention?<br /><br />Thankfully we have atmospheric photography of Vilmos Zsigmond, superb costume design of Jenny Beavan, and first-rate production design of Dante Ferretti. But for all their fine works, all I can say about `The Black Dahlia' is `mess.' Beautiful, but still a mess.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>What. A. Bust. "The Black Dahlia" is a disaster of campy melodrama and grim exploitation and a collision of competing genres, performances and moods, all fueled by director Brian DePalma's goofy peccadilloes and obsessions. It's like huffing angel dust while unmanned blimps crash into Lake Huron. Just wait until the scene at the lesbian cabaret.<br /><br />DePalma ("Scarface, "The Untouchables") and screenwriter Josh Friedman ("War Of The Worlds") adapt the James Ellroy novel that established him as this generation's Raymond Chandler. Ellroy retold the 1947 Los Angeles murder of Elizabeth Ann Short, an aspiring actress cut in half and disemboweled, a clown's smile carved in her mouth. The papers named Short "Black Dahlia" for her habit of walking up and down Sunset Boulevard in mourning clothes. The case remains unsolved.<br /><br />The book and movie "close" it through the work of two detectives - controlled Bucky (Josh Hartnett), and more volatile Lee (Aaron Eckhart) - a couple of ex-boxers of average investigative skills (and poorer ethics) who more or less stumble into a bizarre conspiracy beyond their pay grade. They also share a strange, mostly-platonic relationship Kay Lake (Scarlett Johannson) who cooks them big dinners, uses a cigarette holder and has the letters of a gangster carved into her back.<br /><br />Where do we start with this deranged bit of cinema? How about here: The casting stinks. Eckhart's too manic as the terse Lee, while Hartnett's is his usual study in out-of-depth confusion. And Ms. Scarlett? Crash. Burn. Cringe.<br /><br />At 21, she's far too young - Kim Basinger was 43 when for her Oscar-winning role in the adaptation of Ellroy's "LA Confidential" - and too tongue-tied for the rat-a-tat dialogue of film noirs. Worst, she is saddled with DePalma's habit of casting blonde women as sex idols, like when Johannson straddles the toilet in an open nightgown, wordlessly challenging Bucky to bolt up the stairs and take her. He shakes his head, and she slams the door, her loins denied.<br /><br />It gets steamier! DePalma's take on post-war lesbianism is a raucous piano bar of kissing-girl chorus lines and k.d. lang crooning "Time For Love." The camera swoops about as Bucky casually asks if anybody ever knew the disemboweled girl. Into this absurdity walks Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank), a socialite who bills herself as a Dahlia lookalike. Bucky sure thinks so. The last half of the movie settles in with Madeline and her certifiable family. They know where the bodies are buried and who put them there.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" is probably at its craziest, and maybe its best, in these scenes. The Linscott clan unravels while Madeline tries to balance her repulsion with psychotic loyalty. Swank doesn't resemble the real Dahlia, or Mia Kirshner, who plays her in the movie. But with the Hepburn accent and theatrical eyes,  she seems to be the only lead actor in on DePalma's joke.<br /><br />The final act is faithful to Ellroy's novel, but it seems far more ridiculous here, because of the movie's already scattershot plot and endlessly shifting moods.<br /><br />Elizabeth Short is only seen through screen tests and a stag film, but Kirshner makes a tragic impression as a street urchin so hungry for stardom - for anything - that she's beautiful in her self-delusions. A couple scenes later, Bucky and Kay are pushing aside a Cornish game hen to make it on the dining table. We see Elizabeth humiliated in the porno. Then Bucky's striding over to Madeline's for a romp.<br /><br />There's so much insipid, unbridled passion between Bucky, Kay and Madeline that you sense DePalma's mocking it - the last scene scoffs at the idea of a truly happy ending - but these jabs at convention are thrown on top of a novel lurid enough for three movies. "The Black Dahlia" boldly goes, and goes, and goes. And go-go-go-goes.  It's the freakiest duckling of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>horror...I watched this...movie (?) open-mouthed, literally, waiting (in vain) for some MENTION of Elizabeth Short (remember her, gentlemen???? You did title this fiasco BLACK DAHLIA; did you not?) but instead was treated to a fight, the relationship between two cops and the girlfriend, the constant mention of Fire and Ice (big Revlon lipstick campaign in the 1950s) and an assortment of peripheral characters I was supposed to be intrigued by. Well, don't know about anyone else, but I was under the impression this movie, titled BLACK DAHLIA, was actually ABOUT THE ELIZABETH SHORT MURDER CASE.<br /><br />Was I WRONG! The most laborious, dull boring, contrived, self-centered piece of garbage I have ever suffered through. Why did I watch the whole thing? Two reasons: One, I could not believe at some point the movie would turn a corner and actually address the TITLE CHARACTER and two, I couldn't believe anything this bad actually got made and released to an unsuspecting public!!!!<br /><br />Gentlemen, you DID title this movie BLACK DAHLIA, did you not? Why, then, was she relegated to BACKGROUND for two of the dullest cops to ever come down the pike?????<br /><br />Who CARES about the cops and the g/f? At least if you have believed in truth in advertising and titled the moive (for lack of a better word) Two Cops and the Girlfriend I could have understood and would not have made the mistake of BUYING this...movie.<br /><br />I am appalled. Utter dreck from start to finish, the one semi-redeeming scene was the one with k.d. Lang (sp) singing in the lesbian palace.<br /><br />I saw a Robert Stack TV show re: Elliot Ness covering the Cleveland Torso slayings and the theory (a rather strong and credible one, BTW) that a rich society man, totally deranged, had committed these atrocities but voluntarily admitted himself to a mental health facility. Of course, he just as easily signed himself out and it was rumored traveled to Hollywood about the same time as the Dahlia slaying. After this man committed himself, the Cleveland Torso slayings abruptly stopped. Ness, famous for his inability to be corrupted, went to his grave with the name of the killer never to be revealed. (Did the family's incredible wealth buy Ness's silence this one time?) This TV show was light years more compelling and more interesting than this entire...movie.<br /><br />So blaring trumpets, sepia tints and horrendous dialogue do not a classic movie make, and this one tries hard and fails totally on ever level.<br /><br />I am embarrassed FOR the moviemakers...not one redeeming quality; not even good camp. Plan Nine from Outer Space is an Academy Award winner compared to his!<br /><br />Hopefully someday someone will come along and actually make a movie titled Black Dahlia that EXPLAINS and SHOWS the Black Dahlia instead of using the name to promote this...movie.<br /><br />It is impossible to imgaine anyone taking this fascinating subject and making such a horrible...movie, but that is exactly what happened here.<br /><br />God save us from any more collaborations between De Palma (who really should retire after this...movie) and Ellroy, who should know better.<br /><br />This atmosphere was far better realized in Chinatown and L.A. Confidential, to name two vastly superior films. The frantic "love" scene on the table was also vastly superior in The Postman Always Rings Twice with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. You could FEEL the heat in that one; this was a BAD comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>We had heard all the criticism of this film, but being lovers of 1930-1940 era stories, we decided to give it our own try.<br /><br />During the first 30 minutes, we were saying to ourselves....

Unexpectedly, a clip showing Bart, at about age 2, getting potty trained by Marge shows up. In the clip, Bart says "I'm a big boy now". In the present, Bart is shocked and shouts "Ay caramba." "The Black Dahlia" is Josh Hartnett's attempt at telling the world "I'm a big boy now". But in reality, I suspect he will look back on the film in a few years and shout "Ay caramba."<br /><br />Officer Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert (Hartnett) and Sgt. Leland "Lee" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) meet in the early 40s, as each is trying to protect a small neighborhood in Los Angeles from riots between returning servicemen and zoot suiters. Then, someone in the department learns that each has a background in boxing; Los Angeles is set to vote on a bond measure that will increase the pay for all police officers and the fight will be good publicity. Bucky bets against himself, to earn some money to put his aging German immigrant father in a nice nursing home, but puts up a good fight before losing. The fight generates the required publicity, the bond passes, and each of the men is promoted to the Warrants division of the Detective Squad. Soon, Bucky meets Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), Lee's girlfriend, who likes to attend his fights, sketch the action and say titillating things to both men. Soon, the three are sharing a lot of time together and Kay clutches both of their hands during a scary moment in a silent film. As the two men stake out a warrant, a man opens fire and a shootout begins. Throughout, there is some question about an old arrest Lee was involved in; the convict was Kay's former pimp and a bank robbery was pinned on him. Bucky meets Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank), a woman who comes from a rich family, and they begin a hot and torrid affair. Oh, and a young struggling actress named Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirschner) is murdered in a particularly gruesome fashion and becomes known as "The Black Dahlia".<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia", directed by Brian DePalma, written by Josh Friedman, and based on a James Ellroy book, is a completely fictionalized account of what might have happened. Yet, everyone involved seems to go to great pains to skirt the most interesting part of the film, the mystery of the Black Dahlia, and we get lengthy bits about boxing, the love affair between Kay and Lee, Bucky's attraction to Lee, Bucky's relationship with Madeline, an old bank robbery, and much, much more. And only one of these story threads is even remotely related to the mystery of "The Black Dahlia". I am a big fan of learning a lot about a character's background, but it has to have some bearing on or connect to the main story. In "The Black Dahlia", no one seems to know what the main story is.<br /><br />Like any attempt at Film Noir, "The Black Dahlia" has a voice over and in this case, the voice over is provided by Hartnett, who plays the main character, a police office named "Bucky". Throughout the voice over, Hartnett mumbles this and that, trying to evoke a certain mood, but he is incapable of doing so. Film Noir voice over requires a voice evoking experience, hard knocks, a challenged life. Hartnett is too young and inexperienced to pull this off.<br /><br />Then, there is his acting. Hartnett is one of those actors who have basically one facial expression. Through any and all situations, the same face. It doesn't matter whether he is unhappy, overjoyed, morose, at death's door, whatever the situation he always seems glum. It is really incomprehensible to me why he continues to work in multimillion dollar films. There are many pretty women who have had shorter careers because they are unable to act as well. Yet Hartnett continues to get work.<br /><br />Because he is unable to change his facial expression, Bucky becomes a cardboard character and we simply don't care for him as he tries to work through this complicated mystery.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart fares a little better. As Lee, he has the looks and the acting ability to make us believe in his character. But the character seems to be a retread of the same troubled sole Russell Crowe played so well in "L.A. Confidential", which is also based on a book by James Ellroy. But as acceptable as Eckhart is, his character is marred by problems. He is obsessed with a case, but it isn't really the Black Dahlia. He has a haunted past, but it isn't connected with the Black Dahlia. Lee also seems to be providing comic relief at points, joking around and mugging for the camera as he realizes Bucky and Kay are growing closer.<br /><br />Scarlett Johannson's Kay Lake is in the same boat as Josh Hartnett's Bucky. They are both too young and can't exude enough life experience for these roles. Sure they both look great, but this role is the type of thing Barbara Stanwyck, Gene Tierney, Lauren Bacall and other great actresses would take on and sink their teeth into. Johansson just isn't in their league, at least not yet. Her performance is more evocative of a teenager in a high school play, trying to get their mouth used to all of the big people words and speech patterns. At the middle of a love triangle, she is clearly doing her best to appear sexually attractive, but her expression almost never changes. When she is upset, her face is blank. When she is trying to sexually tease Bucky, her face is blank. Not a very interesting performance.<br /><br />Hillary Swank appears in her most sexual role to date. Perhaps after playing transgenders and women who want to be championship boxers, she was ready for a change. She certainly appears glamorous and fares the best of all the actors, but during the last few moments of the film, her character just completely falls apart. I can't really reveal why, because to do so would spoil any surprises the film holds for those of you who choose to not heed my advice.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" contains a couple of signature Brian DePalma set pieces. Yet, even these seem like retreads from his more interesting, better films. But the last few minutes of the film are so ludicrous it completely disintegrates any technical expertise these exhibit. This is the type of film where everyone even remotely connected to Bucky is involved in one of the two mysteries he is involved in. Yet throughout, he seems to have no idea. When he finally starts to realize this, he confronts them and demands "Tell me the truth" at which point, they break down and begin a long confession. Occasionally, DePalma decides to show us a bit of a flashback, to break the monotony of a long monologue. But that happens only occasionally, and usually to help explain the more incredulous connections.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" would be, perhaps, an acceptable film, but the last twenty minutes completely erase any good will the film may have generated. Attempting to wrap the story up, and provide some resolution to the mystery of the Black Dahlia, DePalma and Friedman create a patchwork of unbelievable and bad performances, clues that didn't exist and outlandish story ideas. What happens when you combine all of this? You have a mess.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" is a big disappointment. Go and see "Hollywoodland" instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>The Black Dahlia is a great book but a bad movie.  The actors in this film are going to take a lot of heat, but that is unfair; when all the performances are bad, it's the fault of the director.  Some people are calling for Brian DePalma to retire and, on the basis of this film, they may have a point.  It's not just that it's bad, it's aggressively bad - the kind of bad that takes real work.  The audience I saw this with was laughing through the whole thing.  Indeed, it is the type of film that Mystery Science Theater 3000 would appreciate.  The only thing I can think of was that DePalma was trying to parody the conventions of noir: the tough guy detective lead, the voice-over narration, the over-the top acting and dialogue.  The trouble is, it doesn't come off as tongue-in-cheek - it just comes off as bad.  The only actor who really does a good job with her part is Hilary Swank - because she does play it for laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>What on earth were these people thinking?

De Palma tries way to hard to make this movie stylish.  It just doesn't work.  The actors are very flat, which is suprising considering the all star talent.  The story itself is a jumble, which is confusing and boring throughout the movie and then tries to pull itself together at the end for the big reveal.  But this is no Usual Suspects.  You leave this movie feeling like you've been cheated of 2 hours of your life.  I wouldn't even bother with a rental of this one.  Wait for cable.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>All one has to do is read the first few chapters of a pulp detective novel to understand what Brian De Palma's "The Black Dahlia" is like. The trailers and television ads are in no way accurate in terms of conveying the kind of movie it is. They led me to believe that it was a realistic and incredibly dark period piece. In reality, it's a heavily stylized reinterpretation of Film Noir classics, so much so that it almost comes off as campy. A fictionalized world is represented, one in which every character smokes and speaks in overly dramatic tones. I should have known it would be like this; it's based on a novel by James Ellroy, the same man who wrote the equally stylized "L.A. Confidential." But the fact that "The Black Dahlia" is commercially misrepresented doesn't make it bad. Quite the opposite; it's incredibly well made--so stylish and engaging that it refuses to let the audience off easy.<br /><br />The story is a carefully crafted mystery, mixing a real event with fictional characters and circumstances. This real event is the murder of Elizabeth Short, a young aspiring actress (played in the film by Mia Kirshner). Her body was found in the vacant lot of a Los Angeles neighborhood in January of 1947. Not only was her mouth sliced open from ear to ear (making her look like an insane clown), her body was also severed in two at the waist. On top of all that, her blood was drained and a couple of her vital organs were removed. Such a disturbing crime has remained unsolved to this day, a fact that made the film's story that much more interesting. This is in spite of the fact that the actual murder is just one piece of the puzzle. Again, the ads sell this movie short; the Elizabeth Short case is not the sole focus of the plot, despite being prominently alluded to. The truth is that many mysteries are interwoven.<br /><br />I suppose this may not suit those of you expecting a purely factual experience. It won't much help that the story is maddeningly complicated, pretty much to the point of utter confusion. It's not the kind of film you can passively experience. It demands your full attention right from the get go, with one crucial point after another piling up until it becomes a massive heap. This is problematic for me, a humble viewer; describing the plot will be very difficult, not only because it's loaded with details and twists that I can't give away, but also because I'm not sure I caught every detail and twist.<br /><br />It begins with a voiceover narration, specifically that of Officer Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett). Already the tone of the film is set; specific shots are encased in shadow and smoke, and the music is heavy with smooth saxophone solos. In terms of dialogue, his pacing is as deliberate and colloquial as that of a classic private eye detective (I half expected to hear him say, "That's when five-feet, seven-inches of trouble walked in"). When not on duty, he spends his spare time as a boxer, as does Sergeant Leland "Lee" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). While the two are fierce competitors in the ring, their everyday relationship hints at a close friendship. At least, it's close enough for Lee to trust Bucky around Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), a former prostitute who's now Lee's girlfriend. Eventually, Bucky begins to suspect that he does have feelings for her.<br /><br />The two cops initially focus on the impending release of Bobby DeWitt (Richard Brake), Kay's severely abusive ex-pimp (look for his initials on her backside). As the film progresses, the audience will come to understand that DeWitt is but one of the many contributors to a tangled web of circumstances, all of which interconnect in some form or another. What makes the situation even more complicated is that many--if not all--of the characters are duplicitous, some more than others. As the film winds up, many of these characters are exposed during a replay of key scenes. Here's an example: there's an early scene of a shootout, one that initially seems straightforward. While I can't get too specific about it, I will say that it's replayed at the end, and at that point, some of the most important figures are shown in a different light.<br /><br />Everything comes to a head when Elizabeth Short's body is discovered. Lee and Bucky are assigned to the case despite their concern over both Kay and the release of the dastardly Bobby DeWitt. It ultimately proves too much for Lee, who's obsessive need to bring Elizabeth's killer(s) to justice is all-consuming. He stares at her photos with horrifying intensity, as if he believes doing so will actually point to a solution. Not only does this put extra strain on Kay, it also puts extra strain on Bucky; he now has to continue the case alone, and with little to go on. Questioning a handful of other aspiring actresses is all he initially has.<br /><br />But after a while, his investigating yields to some possible leads. For one, he discovers Elizabeth's screen test-footage as well as her underground nudie film (both of which are effectively uncomfortable to watch). But more importantly, he discovers a high-class lesbian nightclub. Here enters Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank), an edgy Hollywood socialite who once had a pretty intimate encounter with Elizabeth Short (heightened by the fact that one looks very similar to the other). Linscott is portrayed as a sultry femme fatale caricature: over the top, yet completely appropriate, especially since the character has more than a couple of skeletons in her closet (as does everyone else in this film).<br /><br />She predictably gets close with Bucky as he attempts to extract information. He eventually meets the rest of her family during an interestingly choreographed dinner scene. Her father, Emmet (John Kavanagh), is a wealthy construction tycoon. Her teenage sister, Martha (Rachel Miner), enjoys drawing (and wait until you see what she makes for Bucky). Her mother, Ramona (Fiona Shaw) is perpetually loaded with medication and alcohol, so much so that every word out of her mouth is a slurred rambling. It's this character in particular that adds an unexpected dimension to the film. At first, the audience sees her as mere comedy relief. But as the crucial details gradually reveal themselves, her role veers further and further away from humorous. It gets worse when some shocking family secrets are brought to light.<br /><br />How does this all connect with Lee? With Bucky? With Kay? With Elizabeth Short? I'm still asking myself these questions, despite the fact that a solution is given. With so many subplots, it's easy to understand why "The Black Dahlia" is difficult to fully absorb. But a film of such style and precision has to be given credit; it's a fascinating story that delves into the deepest, most disturbed recesses of the human mind. All the while, it maintains the best elements of Film Noir and paperback detective stories without unintentionally becoming a parody. I can't say whether or not this film in any way, shape, or form accurately reinterprets the facts of the Elizabeth Short murder, but to be perfectly honest, I don't really care. The story was made to stand on its own, much like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "The Amityville Horror," or "An American Haunting" (all of which are said to be inspired by "true" events). If all you historical purists out there find this unacceptable, then I'm sorry I wasted your time with this review.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Rarely indeed do so many movie stars (and an acclaimed director) come together to make a movie as atrociously bad as The Black Dahlia.  As if Elizabeth Short didn't suffer enough in life and death, now Hollywood comes along and exploits her memory as a hook to draw viewers in to a laughably awful film that, on its own, doesn't even have a single led to stand on.  The film tries to project itself as some kind of modern-day film noir - it fails miserably.<br /><br />I always thought Scarlett Johansson was a talented actress, but seeing her really weak performance in this putrid film on the heels of her deer-in-the-headlights acting in A Good Woman, I'm definitely rethinking that opinion.  One thing is for sure: Johansson does not do well in films set in pre-modern times and places.  Then you have the team of Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett, Fire and Ice as they're labeled in the story: the fiery Eckhart throwing crazy fits one after the other while Hartnett struggles to let any hint of emotion (or life) make it past his wooden fa?ade - especially during his big romantic scene with Johansson (it may well be the most unromantic romantic scene I've ever seen).  Hillary Swank, to her credit, wasn't bad at all in her role, but unfortunately for her that role was wrapped up so tightly in the film's ludicrous plot that her performance is tainted by association.  As for Fiona Shaw, I certainly wouldn't want to be the one trying to pick up the pieces of her career after her climactic speech toward the end - that scene sets the young twenty-first century standard for laughably ridiculous, deeply embarrassing acting.  Thank the cinematic gods for the always-alluring and charismatic Mia Kirshner, though, as she is the only thing this movie has going for it.  Playing the role of the ill-fated Elizabeth Short, we only get to see her in screen tests and part of a stag film, but she is mesmerizing.<br /><br />I'm not even going to talk about the plot because it's just hopelessly convoluted and patently ridiculous.  Apparently realizing the whole premise of the story made no sense, the writers kept adding dead ends, stairs to nowhere, and further oddities in the same vein as Sarah Winchester continuing construction on the Winchester Mystery House.  You try to stay with the story for the first hour or so, but by the 90-minute mark I for one gave up completely.  It was like different writers just kept throwing their own scenes in to the mix, with no knowledge of what happened before or after those moments.<br /><br />Finally, I couldn't help but notice how unusually small all of the end credits were.  Obviously, just about everyone connected to this film knew how bad the movie was and didn't want their names associated with it.  I know I wouldn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Well, not to beat a dead horse, but... eh, why not?<br /><br />My hopes for this movie were high. I love murder mysteries, fiction or non-fiction. What better murder case to do a movie about then the BLACK DAHLIA? This is one of the most notorious and high profile yet to be solved murders in history. The suspects. The crime scene. The girl. The whys. Who was she? Why was she there and how did she end up neatly and surgically severed in half on the side of the road?<br /><br />Well, if you watch this movie, you'll still be wondering because Elizabeth Short i.e. THE BLACK DAHLIA, is a SIDE STORY! That's right. There is so little time spent on the murder mystery and the evidence of the crime that my wife and I joked, "no wonder the crime has never been solved."<br /><br />I'm not sure of the exact time, but it was at least 40 minutes into the film before they even found the body.<br /><br />In short, the movie should not have been called THE BLACK DAHLIA. The Black Dahlia is just a ploy to get you into the theatre in order to watch a movie about two ex-boxers and friends who are in love with the same girl and smoke a lot of cigarettes. They stumble across the very minimal clues that lead to the ridiculous and fictionalized ending.<br /><br />This was a hugely disappointing and boring waste of a potentially great premise for a film.<br /><br />I'm a fan of James Elroy, but in the special features he says that he's paying homage to Elizabeth Short with this film. I think they call it CAPITALIZING, because that's what this is. It doesn't explore the murder at all. It doesn't explore the whys. We don't even get to know who Elizabeth Short was. Then to make matters worse, they came up with a fictionalized ending that doesn't do anybody any justice, especially not the viewer... who's most likely asleep by the that time anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I can't remember the last time I was this bored.  The Black Dahlia is the kind of 2 hour movie you wanna see when you have trouble falling asleep but need to watch moving objects on a television screen.  There was no suspense in this crime drama, and honestly, the best part of the film was the boxing segments in the beginning of the film which truly showed some graphic violence and excitement.  Otherwise, I was totally bored and recommend avoiding this movie at ALL costs.  The only thing nice about the film was the scenery presentatation which truly looked like something from the 1940's.  The suspense came in the way of slowly-moving scenes that bordered on old-fashioned romance segments and soft-soften romance bits.  Yuck.  A film you need to NEVER watch under any circumstances.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>You may ask yourself immediately into The Black Dahlia, why you are watching an intense promotional boxing match, that goes on for several minutes, between two L.A. police officers. What does it possibly have to do with the real-life murder of a young Hollywood hopeful in the 1940's? Well, nothing really. The movie is overloaded with information, the least of which is sometimes the murder of Elizabeth Short, whose mutilated body was found like a decrepit piece of sculptured artwork in Los Angeles in 1947. The filmmakers deny it in the bonus features, but it's film noir, with shadowy lighting, intriguing characters, and haunting jazz trumpet score, and on this level, it's an almost restful and enjoyable film to watch, as characters clearly pay homage to the tough talking guys and alluring exotic femme fatales of '40's film noir. It's central theme, however, something concerning Hollywood decadence, gets muddled in what seems a conventional and complicated police story, and the emergence of plot lines that rival the main story. It's pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey resolution is estranged, and it's multi-storylines collide more than they mesh. Director Brian De Palma's Hitchcockian style works well in seperate entities as opposed to the entirety of the film, and the cast, for the most part, are forever inviting you farther into the film with evolving characterizations, even when you can't possibly take on another police bulletin of worthless information. I was never bored for a moment, the film is that sensually stylized, but it is finally grossly unsatisfying, like a Playboy magazine without a centerfold, or indeed, an unsolved murder.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Brian DePalma has crafted a film that is all style with very little substance. The Black Dahlia murder was one of the great unsolved mysteries and this film does little to shed any light on those events of 1947. Based on James Ellroy's novel of the same name the film follws the exploits of two Los Angeles policeman who are drawn into the investigation of the murder.<br /><br />This sounds like an interesting premise but what the viewer gets is an overly complicated (unintelligible) story line that involves corrupt cops an bizarre love triangle and a murky bisexual look a like of the dead girl from one of the strangest Hollywood families you will ever witness.<br /><br />The film as mentioned above looks great the Oscar nod for its photography was on the mark. The set design is also fantastic but the praise stops there. The acting by both Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart is wooden. Scarlett Johansson who seems to be near perfect in everything she does is horrible here as the love interest of both leads. And Hilary Swank gives a wierd performance as the bisexual look a like of the murder victim.<br /><br />If you were looking for greatness from DePalma look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>My actual review is 3 stars - but i would like to balance out some of the unjustifiable 1 and 2 star ratings. This is nowhere near De Palma's best film.. Compare it to 'Dressed to kill' for example (one of the great masterpieces of cinema) - both films are visually stunning - but 'Dressed to kill' is not nearly as plot heavy it is so natural in its combination of images and sound.. by this very nature we are able to probe the conciousness of the characters in a way that is seldom done in film - 'Black Dahlia' , it is a shame to say, cannot live up to the enormity of the plot - and becomes a victim to it.. Such a shame as it is probably the most beautifuly photographed film of the year.. the interiors, the lighting and shadows just scream with beauty.. the acting, surprisingly is pretty good too.. It is a shame that this is all wasted by a story line that just tries too hard to be interesting.. A more natural approach would have made this a fine film..<br /><br />P.s. watch 'dressed to kill'</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Brian de Palma made an odd decision in creating this apparently very expensive, very strange and confusing version of a film, a movie less about the grisly/twisted unsolved murder (grossly illustrated ad infinitum here) of a wannabe 1940s actress of the title and more about two boxer cops (bland Josh Hartnett as 'Mr. Ice' and over the top Aaron Eckhart as 'Mr. Fire') and their bizarre m&eacute;nage a trois with unfocused Scarlett Johansson.  The film as written by Josh Friedman attempts to follow the novel by James Ellroy, itself a strange riff on the Black Dahlia murder.  What results is an over produced, over directed, under realized recreation of the 1940s complete with slicky costumes and very loud music by (surprisingly!) Mark Isham.<br /><br />There are so many subplots filled with walk on characters that keeping the story understandable is almost impossible - certainly not worth an attempt to capsulize for a review.  There are some terrific little performances by Fiona Shaw as the druggie mad woman whose role becomes significant only at film's end, Hilary Swank as the copycat Dahlia who dallies in cops and soldiers and lesbians (convincingly so), and Mia Kirshner who presence as the true Black Dahlia is shown only in black and white film clips that indeed focus the unwieldy script while she is on!<br /><br />Odd to see actors with the credentials of this cast wandering around in la-la land seemingly looking for a script that makes sense.  But it is a pretty period piece to look at despite the lack of reasonable storyline.  Grady Harp, December 06</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Brian De Palma's "The Black Dahlia" is like a beautiful sports car with no engine under the hood: it sits there looking mighty pretty, but it never actually goes anywhere.<br /><br />The movie is based on the James Ellroy novel of the same name, a highly fictionalized telling of Hollywood's most notorious unsolved murder case. On January 15, 1947, a young woman named Beth Short was found brutally slain - her body gruesomely dismembered and gutted - in a field in Los Angeles. The case became a cause celebre around the nation, with speculation rife as to the background of the victim and the identity of the perpetrator, but the actual killer was never found. The movie focuses on two fictional homicide detectives, played by Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart, who, to varying degrees, become obsessed with the case. Their investigation leads them into the heart of a film noir maelstrom comprised almost exclusively of twisted psychosexual perverts and Tinsel Town sickos.<br /><br />Thanks to Vilmos Zsigmond's fine cinematography and all the spiffy 1940's paraphernalia with which the costume designer and art directors have decked out the movie, "The Black Dahlia" is never anything but dazzling to look at, but in almost every other respect, the film is a monumental disappointment. Although the first half is relatively straightforward in its approach and style, by about the midway point, De Palma's trademark cinematic excesses - stilted dialogue, floridly staged action scenes, campy performances, and overemphatic music - begin to take over and the film becomes an incoherent mess.<br /><br />It becomes virtually impossible to keep all the characters straight without a program, and poor Fiona Shaw - so wonderful in "Mountains of the Moon" - is required to overact so outrageously that audiences the world over will be doubled over in laughter at her scenery-chewing histrionics. Her climactic speech - in which she names names and blurts out all the details of the crime, of course - will surely go down in movie history as one of those classic it's-so-bad-it's-good moments that movie lovers everywhere will be mimicking and howling over for years to come.<br /><br />Not that the other actors fare much better. Hartnett gives his all to the role of Bucky Bleichert but, as an actor, he lacks the gravitas necessary to make the character interesting. Eckhart is forced to thrash around inside a character whose motivations are never convincingly spelled out for either the actor or the audience, and Scarlet Johansson and Hilary Swank seem to be doing parodies of crime thriller vixens rather than serious interpretations of believable, three-dimensional characters.<br /><br />It pains me to have to say this, but no one comes out smelling like a rose with this "Dahlia."</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Despite his impressive visual style, Brian De Palma remains a hit-or-miss filmmaker. For every "Dressed to Kill" or "The Untouchables," there's a half-dozen misfires such as "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "Snake Eyes." Unfortunately, "The Black Dahlia" (2006) belongs in the latter category. This deliriously incoherent James Ellroy adaptation suffers from flat acting and lack of narrative focus. However, the Los Angeles period detail is spot on and film buffs will enjoy the references to director Paul Leni's 1928 classic "The Man Who Laughs." It's a shame this watchable mess didn't work out better.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>This movie is a serious snooze-fest. It has a well-known cast but they all seemed wrong for the part. Even the most talented actors would not have been able to save this awful script. The movie has a weak, fragmented plot which is a shame because the Black Dahlia murder is a fascinating case and there were some interesting historical events going on at that time. The movie fails to bring any excitement to the story or the time period.  I didn't feel like I was "transported" to 1947. I felt like I was watching dressed up actors playing parts on phony sets. The 1947 ambiance wasn't there and neither was the look.<br /><br />The movie is also very slow paced. We don't even get to Elizabeth Short's story until almost a half hour into the movie. There are also a lot of pointless side stories about boxers, love triangles, adultery, prostitutes, crime, lesbians and whatnot...to the degree that the original point of the movie is lost. This movie is trying to be too many things at once and in doing this a very sad but interesting story is only half told. About 25 minutes of the movie is devoted to the Black Dahlia. The rest of the movie is pretty much made up of fictional characters and invented stories.<br /><br />It seems like this movie was trying to be a film noir. It really missed the mark. It seemed really modern and `glossy' and had none of the shadows or the dark creepy feel that a film noir should have. Everything seemed too bright, too fake and too pretty. This wasn't a movie about a murdered woman. It was a movie about cops, criminals and sex. In spite of this, there isn't any emphasis on the fact that this was a very shocking crime at the time. In 1947 things like this didn't happen. It was never solved. This could have given the story some great film noir elements but unfortunately the people responsible for this mess didn't understand true film noir.<br /><br />The movie failed to capture the feel of the 40's era on other levels. Some of the costumes were cool to look at but they didn't have the right look when you compare them to actual movies made in that decade. The actors didn't seem like they ever watched a 1940's movie. The cast was good looking in more a 2000's way than a 1940's way. Beauty trends have changed. The look wasn't there, the accents weren't there. The acting wasn't there and the contrast between glamor and grit wasn't there either...something crucial to good noir...<br /><br />There is a lot of smoking in the movie and apparently actors of today can't smoke a cigarette and act at the same time! It didn't seem natural. In film noir the lighting is such that it captures the cigarette smoke and creates contrast and an air of mystery. In 40's movies they had a smoking scene strategically placed...usually when things got intense, just like in real life. In this movie everyone is just running around puffing away and it isn't adding to the movie. Unless smoking is used to capture lighting, a mood or make an intense scene more believable, it is a waste. I have no issue with smoking in movies but the actors looked like they were faking it and it wasn't adding to the ambiance or the visuals.<br /><br />I also didn't like the lack of respect the movie had for the victim Elizabeth Short. The movie was totally insensitive to the fact that she was a real human being and probably had people who loved her. There was nothing in the movie to humanize her. Even her 'father' in the movie doesn't have any remorse or sadness. This doesn't seem believable. Instead of telling us who Elizabeth was as a person, the movie basically portrays her as a tramp that deserved her fate. The real Elizabeth may not have been innocent but no matter what she did wrong in her life, no human being deserves such a horrible death. The movie was delivered more like a glossy, fabricated drama rather than a real life event. The writers added so much "filler" to the story trying to beef it up that they lose the point and they lose the audience. The movie goes overboard with cheap thrills and too many sex scenes. The movie doesn't build sympathy for any of the characters. In the end there really is no message.<br /><br />Even though we already know the story of The Black Dahlia there was a lot about her and the case that were left out. The movie goes off in another direction and forgets one crucial fact: The case is STILL a mystery! A great movie could have been made about this story but this movie failed miserably. Hopefully, one day there will be a movie that honors the life and probes the real mystery of Elizabeth. Until then, we are stuck with this dreck of a movie. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it! Elizabeth was someone's daughter. If she was mine I would want a movie which better represents who she really was...not this exploitive pile of garbage movie which is written like a cheap novel. I hear the book is better but after seeing this movie, that doesn't seem hard to do. If I want to know more about this case, I think I will stick with the documentaries!</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Don't waste your time on this movie inspired by the worst unsolved murder in California history. Two cops investigate the murder. I thought it could've been a lot better.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>Based on the true story of the gruesome murder of Elizabeth Short in 1947, THE BLACK DAHLIA is no homage to the young lady. It isn't even historically accurate.<br /><br />Film noir really should be restricted to black and white. Director Brian DePalma (who has created a very uneven body of work over the years)  knows this, and so he tries to create atmospherics in THE BLACK DAHLIA by switching between B & W and color. It doesn't help.<br /><br />Baby-faced Josh Hartnett, who still looks like he should be doing teen fare, is hideously miscast as a cop in 1940s LA who is trying to unravel the truth behind the gruesome murder-mutilation of the young would-be starlet. Hartnett's role cries out for granite-faced grit and toughness (think Sam Spade) but instead we get Mr. John Q. Sensitivity. Aaron Eckert, who plays his partner, is similarly fresh-faced. Neither of these guys even has stubble on their chins. I doubt they shave, even in real life.<br /><br />Scarlett Johanssen plays their shared girlfriend. Johanssen, who usually gives it her all onscreen, starts out strong, but, realizing this film is a turkey, decides to save her energy for a better day.<br /><br />The best performance of the film belongs to Hilary Swank, who is lush, lustful and convincing, not to mention Ava Gardner gorgeous, in her uninhibited role as a sex kitten. But even the presence of the two-time Oscar winner does not redeem this film which meanders unevenly and oft-times pointlessly through its dim, confused storyline, which includes outre sex, drugs, murder, family scandal, money, multiple betrayals, and not one character worth saving.<br /><br />While all of the above are de riguer for film noir, merely flinging all these elements together in a heap and adding a few fedoras for flavor does not a movie make. Motive is missing, as is real tension, hence the real darkness that makes a film truly noir. Without a clear-cut story, and with just too many subplots, THE BLACK DAHLIA becomes a waste of time. In the end, you just don't give a damn whodunit.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>Brian De Plma was one of my favorites. his Scarface was a masterpiese and his previous film "Femme Fatal" Although had some problems in scenario, but was wery intresting and enjoyable till the end. But here we have a superflat, super boring movie! I watched it cause i taught maybe it got better or had a surprise end. but it got worse and worse. Also the production had problems. God, Brian is getting old!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I'm simply amazed at the reviews this film has received so far; 2 stars???  You gotta be kidding!<br /><br />The Black Dahlia was a bit of a disappointment due to the fact that it's too complicated and too confusing at times (actually most of the time), though by no means is it a bad movie.  It's one of those films where you cannot afford to let your guard down or else you're completely lost.<br /><br />The setting is Hollywood right after the end of WWII and a series of murders has two boxers-turned-cops looking for clues to solve the mystery.  Things, however, are not what they seem in the City of Angels...<br /><br />Josh Hartnett, Hilary Swank, Scarlett Johansson, Mia Kirshner, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br /><br />In short, the acting, the setting, the dialogues, and the music are all very good, while the plot would have been great if it wasn't so darn confusing.<br /><br />The film does bring L.A. Confidential to mind and even though it's not as good, it will provide for an evening's entertainment as long as you make sure you've taken care of anything and everything that might distract you prior to viewing the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Based on a true unsolved murder in the 40s, the fragmented pieces of the plot are truly difficult to follow. 2 murders were eventually solved but the ending was weak and unsatisfying. One big flaw is the lack of depth, substance and character development of Kay (Scalett Johansson) and the wealthy socialite Madeleine (Hilary Swank). With strong actresses like these, they could have achieved something. Instead, Kay was a homemaker who sat at home helplessly waiting for bad news. Madeleine seemed to have nothing else to do but plot evil. To make it worse, they threw themselves at Bucky (Josh Hartnett) for no apparent reasons. Here is the irony - the harder these intelligent looking actresses tried to follow their parts, the more ridiculous the characters looked. Even a good cast could not pull this one off.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>Brian De Palma's THE BLACK DAHLIA is the movie of the year so far for me, and the almost unanimous negative reviews baffle me.  Yes, the film dares to solve Hollywood's most legendary unsolved crime, but it is based on a novel by James Ellroy (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) and not on strict fact.  I have not had the pleasure of reading Ellroy's book because it seems long out of print at Amazon.com.  The fact is that a beautiful raven-haired aspiring actress named Elizabeth "Betty" Short was found savagely murdered in a vacant Hollywood weed field in early 1947, her body cut in half and her mouth cut from ear to ear.  Her killer was never found.  The case was never closed and may, in fact, still be open.<br /><br />The De Palma fiction is convincing:  boxing detective rivals  Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett tie the case to lesbian actress Hilary Swank and the filmmaker who directed sleazy 16mm black-and-white films starring Elizabeth Short.  De Palma wisely never shows the crime; as in real life, detectives find the dead body the next day in a vacant lot.  And we only see slivers of the corpse.  Ingeniously, and you may need to be a film scholar to pick up on this, the slashed mouth is made to look like Conrad Veidt in a 1928 silent called THE MAN WHO LAUGHS, which is screened often during THE BLACK DAHLIA.  And both Ellroy's novel and De Palma's movie take their name, in turn, from a 1946 Alan Ladd film noir called THE BLUE DAHLIA.<br /><br />The movie dares to have a romantic happy ending, which I may be alone in finding satisfying.  Hartnett wraps up the case, then goes home to his sweetie, yet another actress (Scarlett Johansson).  As with everyone in THE BLACK DAHLIA, Johansson smokes endless cigarettes, including in fancy black holders.  (Actually, I am getting tired of seeing her smoking in every movie.)  This movie is blessed with superb actors and, contrary to the critics, actors whom I personally found comfortable playing film noir and chain-smoking.  The performances are all excellent.<br /><br />And, oh man, the style here!  Working all over Hollywood and, of all places, Bulgaria, De Palma and production designer Dante Ferretti truly capture the very look and smell of 1947 Los Angeles down to the slightest detail.  For a movie filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, the great Vilmos Zsigmond (THE DEER HUNTER, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND) creates a dusty sepia look that is just right.  Costumer Jenny Beavan, working heavily in browns and olives and blacks in dresses and blouses and sweaters and suits, has done costumes for James Ivory.  And the trumpet sound of Mark Isham's score evokes nothing less than the towering score by Jerry Goldsmith for CHINATOWN.  These people and everyone else are working at peak form.<br /><br />But at the helm is Brian De Palma, whose direction is just perfection.  I adore THE BLACK DAHLIA and highly recommend it, now in a theater or soon on letterboxed DVD--hopefully with an excellent and chilling 1970's TV movie with Lucie Arnaz called WHO IS THE BLACK DAHLIA? as a bonus.  De Palma's movie has a hard "R" rating for strong violence, strong sexual content, strong language, and heavy smoking.  122 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I'm used to convoluted and cluttered storylines in Brian DePalma films.  Take another look at "Femme Fatale" to see what I mean.  An entire diamond hiest appears to revolve around two hot chicks making it in a toilet stall during a film premiere--and that's the part that's easiest to follow.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" was supposed to be about the grotesque butchering of Elizabeth Short in 1940's L.A.  I mean, that is the title.  And the poster artwork.  And the trailers.<br /><br />But the Black Dahlia appears late in the movie--after a boxing match between rival buddies and scenes ripped off from "L.A. Confidential"--and barely becomes the focus until the wordy and unconvincing finale.  In fact, the discovery of her body takes place in the background of the movie that's well under way when she's found.<br /><br />I watched the extras and was surprised to see an interview with the screenwriter who adapted the original novel where he admits to showing an early draft of the script to friends--and they said there wasn't enough about the Dahlia in it!  So he rewrote it and added the screen test scenes.  That must mean that the Dahlia wasn't in the script at all before shooting began!<br /><br />The interview with the novelist also reveals that he piled everything about L.A. in the 1940's into his story...and it shows.<br /><br />The movie has interesting visual moments and the cast tries hard but it feels like it's all over the place.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The Black Dahlia often looks good (some of its scenes are in fact spectacular) but it's so unbelievably over the top and convoluted that it has to be seen to beleived; a colossal waste of talent and money, the film is only recommended to those who enjoy watching cinematic train wrecks.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>In the interest of full disclosure, I have never been a Brian DePalma fan.  I have always considered DePalma to be very much a "style over substance" director.  I have also not read Ellroy's novel, so I cannot speak to the faithfulness of the adaptation.  With all of this in mind, this is not a movie which I normally would have seen, but the impassioned advocacy of a few fervent Amazon reviewers persuaded me to ignore the multitudes of people who bashed this movie, and give it a try.<br /><br />To be fair, it isn't as bad a movie as some have said, but it can see bad from where it's standing.  Also, the point that this is a roughly 3-hour movie edited down to 2 hours is a point well taken, but I would point out that DePalma surely must have known that there was no way he could get the studio's blessing for a 3-hour movie & should have proceeded accordingly.<br /><br />Nonetheless, one has to take the movie as it is, not for what it could have been.  As it is, there seem to be a nearly infinite number of plot lines, which meander around in search of a sustained narrative for 100 minutes, only to be frantically resolved by a series of monologues in the last 20 minutes...ie, "This is what I did, this is how I did it, and this is why I did it," repeated several times during the race to the finish.  The monologues are only slightly less goofy than most of the dialogue that is found throughout the movie.  Many of these characters seem to have a penchant for repeating themselves.  "How could this happen?  How could this happen?"<br /><br />Some of this might have been improved with better casting.  Aaron Eckhart's twitchy antics grow tiresome quickly and almost seem to border on caricature.  Josh Hartnett seems so impossibly bland that one has to wonder how he could possibly have made his character even remotely compelling.  As it is, he makes Bucky Bleichert dull & uninteresting, to the point that I really didn't care what happened to him towards the end.  Scarlett Johansson & Hilary Swank are adequate, but Johansson (whom I normally like) seemed uncomfortable in this role.  Other performances (in particular that of Fiona Shaw's) simply seemed cartoonish.<br /><br />Looming over all of this is Brian DePalma's determination to show us how great he is with the use of shadows, camera angles and the like, but he simply beats the viewer over the head with it.  Some people may not get the comparison, but it reminds me of how Leonard Bernstein used to conduct Mahler...it always seemed to be more about Lennie than about the music, and he was always trying to make the point of what a great Mahler interpreter he was rather than letting the music simply speak for itself.  So it is with this movie, where it almost seems as though DePalma is leaning over your shoulder, saying "OK, look at how I use the lighting and the backdrop here," and "Look at how I rotate the camera 180 degrees to create this transitional moment."  He is so preoccupied with making this movie as "noirish" as can be, that he forgot to make it sure that it was at least coherent.<br /><br />As I said earlier, not as bad as some might describe, but definitely not good at all.  I should have listened to the nay-saying multitudes after all.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Over the years I have admired the work of director Brian DePalma, even if he patterned many of his films in the shadow of Alfred Hitchcock.  CARRIE, DRESSED TO KILL and BODY DOUBLE are some of my favorite thrillers.  But there is little of DePalma's visionary direction in this tepid thriller.  In fact, so much time is spent on the rivalry between the two detectives that little focus is actually on the murder itself.  The script is contrived and puzzling; the performances are far from what you would expect:  Josh Hartnett is way out of his league in the role of the heroic cop; the usually dependable Aaron Eckhart doesn't seem to want to be in the movie; Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank perform as if they were mimicking Lauren Bscall or Rita Hayworth.  It's all dull in the long run and a missed opportunity for all involved.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>THIS MOVIE WAS NOT THAT BAD GUYS!!!!

Bucky (Josh Hartnett) is the young cop who believes in his job.  Lee (Aaron Eckhart) is the cop who plays both sides of the law and has shady connections with local mobsters.  Bucky and Lee become partners and spend lots of time together along with Lee's girlfriend, Kay (Scarlett Johanssen), who has a shady past characterized by ritual violence.  When the woman immortalized as the Black Dahlia is found tortured to death, Lee becomes obsessed with solving the crime.<br /><br />In the process of the murder investigation Bucky becomes involved with Madeline (Hilary Swank), a femme fatale from a rich, corrupt family.  Her mother Ramona (Fiona Shaw) is a drug addict and her father a real estate swindler.  Bucky is in over his head but struggles valiantly to solve the murder and to save Lee and Kay from the miasma of corruption swirling up from the shady past.<br /><br />The film is beautiful and takes advantage of well known Los Angeles landmarks to create a believable Hollywood in which the mood of the 1940's is successfully evoked.  The script uses the pessimistic noir convention of revealing layer after layer of evil and betrayal to the hapless hero who can only keep following the trail to its end.<br /><br />Yet Black Dahlia is a film without shadows, an unflinching stare into the seamy underbelly of corruption, madness and incest.  The scenes of girl-on-girl action, lurid crime scene photos and flashbacks to the murder are more evocative of "Hollywood Babylon" than Chandler.  Not only is the film without the visual noir convention of shadow as a living presence, but when the mystery is finally solved it is nakedly revealed in all its grisly psychopathic ugliness---more suited to a horror film.  For some the final portion will be a little too violent and sensational.  Some cooling and obscuring shadow was much needed.<br /><br />Overall, The Black Dahlia is a good film with some excellent moments.  Hartnett plays the hero who loses his innocence quite well.  Swank is fabulous as always.  Fiona Shaw is amazingly good--frighteningly unbalanced, and in certain lights looks eerily like Mary Astor in the Maltese Falcon.  The rest of the cast performs well with a quibble about Aaron Eckhart's hair--it looks too layered and dry to be 1940's hair.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>I've only seen 16 movies released in 2006 and I think that "The Black Dahlia" (2006) directed by Brian De Palma is one of the most enjoyable. The way it walks, talks, sounds, and feels truly captivated me. It is a fantastic cinematic achievement. It is shocking, dark, very clever, and enormously beautiful. It is over the top but how would you make a movie about the investigation of the most notorious and gruesome never solved murder in Hollywood differently? I like this exploitative, overplayed, smoldering, overwhelming, cheesy, campy Crime / Drama / Mystery / Thriller (my favorite genres) with the evident elements of black comedy (the most favorite genre when it's done well). I don't deny that it has its problems but I still believe it is worth watching and rewatching, especially on DVD when you can stop it and return to the earlier scene to see what you might've missed the first time. 'The Black Dahlia' is one of the rare films that make you forget all their flaws. I am still puzzled with the ending but I LOVE the movie; I could not take my eyes off the screen. The way De Palma uses light, shadows, his combination of colors, black and gold - my favorite, his use of stairways, and the way we first are allowed to notice the body - it is Art, noir film made by an Artist. Besides, I simply can't be indifferent to a movie that uses Cole Porter `s song "Love for Sale" which I adore as performed by k.d. lang.<br /><br />The movie grabbed me with its visual grandeur, heated atmosphere of danger, dark, desperate mood and that's why I like it so much. I don't like it for its story - after all, it is one of the myriads of versions of what had actually happened 60 years ago, I don't admire it for the acting, even though, Mia Krishner as unfortunate Betty Short was heartbreaking and I did like Hillary Swank for the first time in my life (yes, I know that she is two times Oscar winner but I liked her here, when she said to herself, "Bucky...I'll try to remember... that" - it was a good acting, irony which I've never seen in her before.) I also believe that Fiona Shaw was wonderful in her role - it simply could not be played any differently and to make her character so over the top was an artistic achievement and not the lack of acting abilities as many viewers seem to believe.<br /><br />I respect the movies that entertain me, excite me, and stay with me even if I see their weakness very well. "Black Dahlia" is one of these movies. I am perhaps one of very few viewers in the whole world who actually was satisfied with the ending and the big revelation before it. Yes, it is bizarre, and it is grotesque, but it fits the whole movie perfectly and when I mentioned earlier how clever the movie was, I meant, how well its creators explored just one of the evidences and using the works of literature, art, and earlier cinema, built the whole possible story behind the murder based on it. Once again, "The Black Dahlia" is IMO one of the best and most entertaining movies of last year which I enjoyed enormously.<br /><br />Directed by the Artist with a unique vision and talent, "The Black Dahlia" will be appreciated as time goes by.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>The Black Dahlia was a famous murder of a young lady named Elizabeth Short, Betty, that occurred in Hollywood in the 1940s.  The case remains unsolved, and spawned multiple books, one of which is the basis for this movie.  The movie itself uses the murder and the ensuing investigation to explore multiple facets of LA society at that time; a corrupt LAPD, the criminal underworld, the rich and famous, the ultra-rich and secretive, and the various women who migrated to LA hoping for stardom but ending up with less admirable fates.  Several themes from the real life case show up in this movie as sub-themes that control events.  These include the power of the press and the hidden but common intersections between police officers and criminals.  The plot of the movie is quite intricate, and offers many twists and turns that are totally unexpected.  All the main characters are portrayed as corruptible or corrupted, and personal loyalties are often abused, if not outright betrayed.  Unlike real life, the murder is solved here, and nobody could have possibly guessed who it was until the murderer reveals him/her self.<br /><br />This movie is set to look and feel like LA Confidential, with the gorgeous babes and everyone smoking, but does not come across quite the same.  First and foremost, the violence here occurs in many forms, while it was mainly gun play in LA Confidential.  Second, the girls are really wicked here.  Third, no one seems to really know what everyone else is up to.  DVD's now come with special features as a given.  For this DVD, I was hoping for an  in-depth comparison between the movie, the book it was based on, and actual events.  This is not provided; we only get a superficial comparison of the movie to actual events that is narrated by the book's author.  Overall, an OK movie that is worth the time to watch, but not the movie to buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: This was supposed to be the big Oscar contender of the year. People sit up and take notice when De Palma takes the director's chair. De Palma directed The Untouchables, one of my favorite movies of all time. However, The Black Dahlia is probably his biggest dud ever, even more so than Mission To Mars. Rarely do you see a film with so much potential go absolutely nowhere. The trailer would lead you to believe that the movie was about the murder of actress Elizabeth Short and the entire process of uncovering the mystery. The movie is more about the characters and the murder sort of serves as a backdrop to the central plot. That's where the problem of the film lies. There is no focus in the plot as to what the movie is actually about, and it doesn't help that it moves at an incredibly slow pace. The film is centered around three main characters: Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett), Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). Two buddy detectives fall upon the case of Elizabeth Short during a routine bust, and we slowly move away from the case and just see how it affects their relationship with their female friend. What follows is a mess of film noir that uses the case merely as a backdrop. There was also one aspect of the film that just sort of took me out of the whole experience, and that was the use of the POV (point of view) shot. It was used sparingly for Hartnett's character with absolutely no dramatic effect. The reason why you don't see POV shots that much out of horror films is that a camera does not mimick human vision. If we saw the way a camera saw then our eyeballs would not be able to move, so when POV is used in film it has to be used for a real purpose. Here, De Palma uses it with no purpose to it and it was just frustrating. The only thing it did do was take me out of the movie. There was a distance between me as an audience member from the story being told on screen, and when you lose that emotional connection then the film becomes boring. Let me state right now what the trailer tried to trick you with. The movie is based on a book by James Ellroy who is the author of the novel L.A Confidential, not the screenwriter of either films. The screenwriter of L.A Confidential and this film are two different people. Josh Friedman wrote the screenplay for The Black Dahlia, and his previous work only consists of Chain Reaction and War Of The Worlds (2005). So, you can see we have a novice screenwriter on our hands, and that is where I point my finger to blame.<br /><br />ACTING: While there are no Academy Award winning actors in the film, we do have a pretty great selection of talent. Josh Hartnett fits the role and does a mighty fine job of playing it. Aaron Eckhart was pretty good too, his character was what really made the film a film noir. Scarlett Johansson is one of my favorite actresses, and she does a great job here. She plays the counterpart to Hilary Swank's character (look for the black/white contrast in the characters' appearance), but Hilary Swank may I say was quite awful in this. I just didn't like her acting in the movie, which is strange because I loved her in Million Dollar Baby and Insomnia. She doesn't add any depth to her character and she merely serves as a plot device who will end up helping you easily figure out who the murdere is. Anyway, the acting can't hide the fact that the script is in disarray.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Brian De Palma doesn't give the film any style, Mark Isham's weak score didn't help either. There was a real lack of atmosphere despite great sets and costumes, and I blame the score for that. The lack of focus lies in the script's flaws, and don't look for the acting to save it. The movie swung hard and missed the target completely. Universal spent $60 million on the production, and with the recent release of Hollywoodland I figure that someone stole from someone. If you want less cheesy film noir and a great movie experience then go see Hollywoodland.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Except for about a ? hour about half way through Brian De Palma's "The Black Dahlia" when Hillary Swank arrives on the scene there is a bit of hope that all is not lost. But alas, Swank merely provides a short respite from the unrelenting boredom of this film...as it is way too long and not particularly about the sensational, gruesome and surgical-like, real-life murder of Elizabeth Short (a sad and quite effective Mia Kirschner) in 1947 Los Angeles, the Black Dahlia of the title because she always dressed in black.<br /><br />If De Palma had decided to concentrate on just the murder and the investigation (which still goes on now some 60 years later) he would have had the makings of a, if not great, at least an intriguing film: the basic, true-life  story is rife with mystery, sex, prostitution, kink and white slavery. But instead he has mucked up the film with added elements that do nothing but stray from the basic story and add nothing but silly detail.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson continues her decline (at 20, no less), Josh Hartnett tries his best in a thankless role and Aaron Eckhart chews the scenery not with relish but with a kind of grim, ugly anger that leads you to believe that Eckhart  sensed early on in the filming that he was in a turkey.<br /><br />"The Black Dahlia" is just a mistake: a bloated, gassy mess of a film. If only David Fincher, once rumored to have been attached to this project, had stuck around we might have had a new Millennium "Chinatown" or "LA Confidential." What we get instead is this embarrassing bore of a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>Make no mistake: THE BLACK DAHLIA, directed by Brian De Palma, one of history's very worst successful directors, is one of the WORST FILMS EVER MADE. I'm not terribly prone to hyperbole, but I can honestly say that this is a film where the whole thing should have ended up on the cutting-room floor... scratch that... this film should have been BURNED. I'm not going to bore you with the details, but I am going to say a few things.<br /><br />De Palma returns to the glory of films like WISE GUYS, SNAKE EYES, BODY DOUBLE, and MISSION TO MARS and creates yet another feature film that is absolutely bereft of anything resembling talent, style, or depth.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart is wasted, Josh Hartnett is dead-eyed and pathetic, Scarlett Johansson is suffering from Actor's Block, and Hilary Swank... hmm... what can I say about a film where Hilary Swank, a woman who has won Oscars for playing a woman pretending to be a man and a butch female boxer, plays the 'alluring, sensual femme fatale'?!?!?!?!??!!?!?<br /><br />De Palma has one great film and one good film to his resume: THE UNTOUCHABLES (Great, but it has little to do with him, but with the great performances and the David Mamet script) and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (Good, but he got the right group of talented people around him). SCARFACE works only as a comedy. Yes, I said it. The film that so many alpha-males worship is GARBAGE as a straight-up drama. But if you take it like SHOWGIRLS and refuse to take it seriously, you will be very amused. But THE BLACK DAHLIA isn't even in the "so bad, it's good" category. It's just very very very very bad.<br /><br />But that's about all I can say on a family-oriented website about this film. If you buy this film, or even enjoy it, you may need serious help, and I'm sure there's an 800 number you can call.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"The Black Dahlia" deals with the murder of a beautiful Hollywood starlet at a time when Tinsel Town was an innocent and thriving community. The movie was based on the actual death of Elizabeth Short. This murder is investigated by two hunky police detectives, played by studs Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart, who find their lives twisted and turned upside down as they try to find answers as to why anyone would want to kill a beautiful woman. Both will also not be satisfied until they find the culprit. Both Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson give outstanding supporting performances. There are over 40 minutes of bonus features that deal with the actual death of the Black Dahlia. Brian DePalma, the film's director, is interviewed.

Since nobody knows who killed Elizabeth Short, and since nothing in this film will change that, it's a waste of your lifespan to view. I hoped for some new, unrevealed info, but found the covers done by A&E and even Unsolved Mysteries to be far more factual and interesting, without the seaminess.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Most of you probably know that this review will be about as far from objective as you can get. I love Brian De Palma. I don't think that I could hate anything he makes. That being said, I don't absolutely love everything he does either. So when I go see a De Palma film, I basically expect to either love it more than anything or just think it was pretty good. The Black Dahlia, fortunately, applies to the former. This movie is amazing on so many levels, that it really should get an entire post of its own. But since I don't have the time, I am going to make this short and amazingly sweet. The actors in the film are amazing (exception with Josh Hartnett, who isn't bad, but he isn't great, either). Scarlett Johannson and Hilary Swank both portray women in the 50s on totally opposite ends of the spectrum on every level. Aaron Eckhart is great in a sadly under-utilized role as the detective who becomes obsessed with the Dahlia case and is also dealing with extremely dangerous events from his past coming back to haunt him. The film looks amazing too. You would never know that this entire movie was shot in Bulgaria, but now I just told you, so you do know. They recreated 40s L.A. like you couldn't imagine. And to top it all off, Brian De Palma puts his ultimate stamp on the film. What else could I ask for? By far the best scene of the film is the "De Palma set piece" of the movie. A huge marble staircase in the lobby of a skyscraper is the background for one of the most intense, heart-stopping sequences that I can remember in recent memory. And to make it even more excruciating for the viewer, De Palma trademarks it by shooting it all in total slow motion. Unbelievable. I won't go into the details on the plot, because it is a little tough to describe what's going on without revealing some twists that happen about halfway through. But trust me, The Black Dahlia is a ride worth taking.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Black Dahlia" is excellent! Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart, and Hilary Swank are excellent and lead an impressive cast. Brian De Palma's (one of the best directors of our time and one of the underlooked directors, Oscar-wise and Golden Globe-wise), who has directed movies like "Scarface" (1983), "The Untouchables" (1987), & "Blow Out" (1981) directing is excellent, as usual, as is his visual style and impressive camerawork, as usual. The screenplay by Josh Friedman (who adapted the H.G. Wells' novel & the Steven Spielberg film "War Of The Worlds" (2005) to the screen) is excellent! The music by Mark Isham (who also did the music to "Invincible" (2006), "Eight Below" (2006), "Running Scared" (2006), the upcoming "Bobby" (2006) & "Crash" (2005) is excellent! The cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond (who won an Oscar for his work on Spielberg's "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind" (1977) and also has worked on De Palma's "Bonfire Of The Vanties" (1990), "Obsession" (1976) & "Blow Out") is excellent and impressive! The film editing by Bill Pankow (who worked on 10 of De Palma's films, such as, "Scarface" & "The Untouchables") is excellent! The casting by Lucy Boulting & Johanna Ray is excellent! The production design by Dante Ferretti (who won an Oscar for his work on Martin Scorsese's "The Aviator" (2004) is excellent! The art direction by Pier-Luigi Basile & Christopher Tandon is excellent! The set decoration by Elli Griff, Bruce L. Luizzi, & Rick Simpson is excellent! The costume design by Jenny Beavan (who won an Oscar for her work on "A Room With A View" (1986) is excellent! The visual look is impressive, the sets are impressive, the costumes are impressive, the look of the film is impressive.

The two men are desperate to find the reason for this senseless death, so much so that they let other brutal murders happening in the city take a back seat.

She was engaged to Major Matthew Gordon Jr, but he died before he could returned to the United States.  She returned to Southern California in July 1946 to see an old boyfriend she knew in Florida. She lived in at least a dozen homes during those six months. She was last seen on January 9, 1947 and had been missing until they found her body January 15, 1947. Laying in an empty lot at the 3800 block of S. Norton Avenue, Los Angeles, her nude body mutilated, cut in half at the waist separated apart, blood drained and body washed, slashed breasts, cigarette burns, bashed head, mouth cut, deep triangular gouge in her thigh to remove a rose tatto she had. Rope burns on wrists. She was tortured.<br />There were 22 District Attorney suspects investigated. Hundreds of people interviewed. The case is still unsolved.<br />  If the killer or killers are still alive, he or she would be a very old person now.<br />  Brian DePalma (Body Double) along with writer James Ellroy and Universal Pictures offer their version of The Black Dahlia murder mystery.<br />  DVD has option of English, Spanish, French and English, Spanish, French subtitles. 3 featurettes.<br />  In the Kenneth Anger book, "Hollywood Babylon II", are 3 pages of the real, very graphic, close-up photographs of Elizabeth Short's mutilated body at the crime scene.<br />  In the film, all of the murder photographs have been remade fake by the studio, expect for one photograph that Josh Hartnett looks through.

For one thing, it fails to focus on the Elizabeth Short story.<br /><br />For all the rich texture of the monochromatic cinematography (so we'd know we're watching a modern film noir), all the posturing of SCARLETT JOHANSSON with her long cigarette holder, all the fake glamor of HILARY SWANK, and all the convoluted plot lines, it's hard to find a trace of the Elizabeth Short story here. And that's the film's main problem. Her story is really just background filler for some very complicated fictional characters and situations that exist outside the story of THE BLACK DAHLIA, a murder never actually solved.<br /><br />While watching it unfold, I couldn't help thinking how much better this would have been as a gritty film noir back in the '40s in the sort of shimmering B&W photography that Michael Curtiz used for THE UNSUSPECTED--and with an actor like Humphrey Bogart as the lead detective with either Lauren Bacall or Lizabeth Scott as the femme fatale. And if they needed a brunette siren they could always use Marie Windsor. Hilary Swank really has done much better work elsewhere.<br /><br />Furthermore, the story chosen from the James Elroy novel which does give a solution to the crime, is an absurd one that is not made even remotely believable by the creation of the Fiona Shaw character who seems to be existing in another movie--a farce. Nor is the narration spoken by Josh Hartnett--in a monotone that I found alienating--any help in explaining the twisted course of events.<br /><br />DePalma missed the opportunity in bringing the Elizabeth Short story to the screen as stark drama in any way that makes sense. Because of its assured style, it's a very watchable film despite all the flaws--and you keep hoping something better will happen in the last thirty minutes to explain motives and to close in on the final chapter of Short's life, but no--no such luck. It fizzles to an artificial conclusion dreamed up by author Elroy. Alas, even Mark Isham's bombastic score doesn't work although it sounds good over the closing credits.<br /><br />It's a classic example of style over substance, but this time the style can't hide the fact that the script is largely incomprehensible and goes far astray of its subject matter instead of keeping a narrow focus on the actual story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>This historical drama is inspired by a true crime from 1947, the murder of Elizabeth Short. The film opens with a riot in 1945 Los Angeles. Sailors were attacking the "zoot suiters" because of a prior attack on sailors. There is a plan to stage some boxing matches to help pass a municipal bond issue. There is a domestic scene that is supposed to mean something. Some of those hats don't have the wide brims of that era. Was the fight realistic? Do those scenes of entertainment have a meaning? There is a sudden shoot-out. Next police cars arrive where a body was found. [Do those scenes inside a home look too upscale?] The internal organs of that body were removed by the killer!<br /><br />The police investigate the death of Elizabeth Short. [Does the film drag here?] Does that girl's family seem strange? "I'm really so sorry." That family is strange! Can anyone make a fortune by building cheap housing? Does the drama go downhill? The story just stumbles along from scene to scene. Does the ending seem believable? Will this movie never end? Finally there is a surprise at the end. Does it make sense? Any of them? Is that family really crazy? Will there be another cover-up? Will this movie never end? Was it the worst film of the year?<br /><br />The credits say it was based on the James Ellroy novel. The tiny lettering for the credits suggests they were ashamed to be named for this film. I'll bet the Bulgarians turn out better films for their people. This film could have benefitted from a lower budget and a better script. Was the book better than this film?</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>There's much to like in THE BLACK DAHLIA, the 2006 filming of author James Ellroy best-selling novel that was inspired by Los Angeles' most infamous unsolved murder case.<br /><br />Director Brian DePalma has not only recreated Los Angeles of the 1940s to perfection, but he has also filled the film with several memorable sequences.<br /><br />These include the discovery of Elizabeth Short's severed body at the same time that a police shoot-out is taking place on the next block, and, later, a triple murder on a three-story open staircase in an office building.<br /><br />On the other hand, Ellroy's novel and Josh Friedman's screenplay adaptation are both very complex, with multiple storylines continually criss-crossing to the point where the picture is sometimes difficult to follow.<br /><br />An audience can only assimilate so much exposition at one time.  Thus, this is that rare movie that would have benefited from a longer running time, so that these storylines could have been better developed.<br /><br />The principal plot revolves around the relationship between two Los Angeles police detectives, both former boxers who are now partnered.  Josh Hartnett is the younger, more idealistic of the pair, while Aaron Eckhart has the experience, but is also plagued by demons from his past that are stirred up by The Black Dahlia case.  Indeed, he becomes obsessed with Ms. Short's grisly murder.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson is Eckhart's platonic girl friend, who is attracted to Hartnett.  She also has a dark secret, as does Hilary Swank, the bi-sexual, nymphomaniac spoiled daughter of a wealthy contractor who Hartnett ultimately discovers is the key to the Dahlia mystery.<br /><br />There are some fine performances in THE BLACK DAHLIA.  I was most impressed with Mia Kirshner as Ms. Short, Mike Starr as a police detective and, although some critics have disagreed, Ms. Swank as the femme fatale.<br /><br />The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment contains three excellent "Making of" documentaries, the most interesting of which has Ellroy discussing the facts of the actual The Black Dahlia case and revealing the personal tragedy (i.e. the murder of his mother when he was ten-years-old) that compelled him to write his novel.<br /><br />?

I'm glad I read the book a few years ago. At least it held my attention more than this movie.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett, as "Bucky - ICE" the L.A. Detective is a real boring and stiff. Aaron Eckhardt, as "Lee - FIRE," his partner was intense, but average. Scarlett Johannson, "Kay" and Hilary Swank, "Madeleine" were also big bores, and they showed it with their acting.<br /><br />It was almost like watching a stage play; with the dinner at Madeleine's house being excruciatingly painful to watch. As was the "love scene" with Hartnett and Swank, which looked like a "Carol Burnett Show" or "Saturday Night Live" parody of a classic movie. Some of these scenes will make you or snicker or laugh; which in effect, will wake you up and out of your boredom enough to finish the movie.<br /><br />At 53 minutes into the movie, I checked the timing display to find that the movie is 121 minutes long. As Doctor Smith from "Lost In Space" used to say: "The pain. Oh, the pain."</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>I've read the other reviews and they are right.<br /><br />I was greatly disappointed in this movie. Mostly because I expect so much more from De Palma. He has turned out such classics in the genre as 'Dressed to Kill', 'Body Double' and 'Snake Eye' that I was eager to see how he handled the case of the Black Dahlia.<br /><br />In the end he does pull it all together and packages it up for you. However, this movie meanders and actually avoids the subject of the murder. It became so far from the point that I was actually considering turning it off. But I kept going out of curiosity.<br /><br />The plot of this movie grows so many branches it becomes difficult to track so you need to pay very close attention .... even during the boring parts.<br /><br />This movie is based in the true story of Betty Short. Therefore liberties are limited. It would appear that works of fiction play out better for De Palma.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>First off let me say I have never thought Mr. De Palma was that great a director. He has made some good films(Carrie, the Untouchables, and even Mission Impossible), but for the most part he seems to borrow (read steal) shots and ideas from Alfred Hitchcock(at least he steals from the best) and also likes to have a fluid moving camera to cover his lack of originality. Even with my feelings on him I felt he might be able to pull this compelling true murder case off and make it interesting. WRONG!!!!!!<br />  The film is lazy film making, he even allows the camera to just sit there for long stretches of time and builds absolutely no suspense to this tale. The actors seem to be trying hard but no one is able to raise above the weak and meandering script. The only one who turns in a great performance is the young woman playing the "Dahlia".  Seen in flashbacks and some sordid films, she brings more life to this movie than the others combined.<br />  I know this is based on a novel, but the thing i find the most unforgivable is they way they use Miss Short's horrible death as the foundation for the movie and then trash the poor woman's name by painting her out as a borderline Hooker/stag film star. Nowhere in the real facts was that ever found and in fact the true facts seem to be of little importance to the film makers. Miss Short died in a most gruesome way, why should she have her name pulled through the mud after the fact. This more than any of the other reasons is why I find the movie to be an insult to her, her family, and finally us. Look up the real tale and enlighten yourself about the case and see how they have done a disservice to her.<br />  I also find it iresponsable that they chose to "solve" this unsolved case, which is what Hollywood does best, Watch the film "The Zodiac(2007)" and see how a story about and unsolved crime can and should be handled.<br />  Once again Holly2wood rewrites history for it's own gain and lets a young woman, who may have been less than a saint, be turned into a "stag film" star instead of the real person she was.<br />  NOT EVEN CLOSE TO A GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!<br />  If you like it, well I'm happy for you and guess you will hate this review,, but this is how the movie came across to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Anybody expecting to get a great account of the Black Dahlia case, even fictional, will be disappointed going in to this movie. Of course, I knew that it was a fictionalization of the case, but I had no idea the movie would present its own evidence and draw its own conclusions.<br /><br />They obviously didn't intend to make this a serious movie, but rather it was a cheap attempt to imitate a Film Noir sometimes, a TV mystery sometimes and then other times I don't think they knew what they actually wanted to do.<br /><br />Although the film brings a clearcut finale rather than a vague puzzle, too many loose threads come together too neatly and rather than bringing the film to a satisfactory conclusion, it leaves you scratching your head, is this what I spent the last 2 hours waiting to hear? Overall, there is too much plot, too little character development and a wildly uneven tone. The movie has its moments but it's a blinding mess all together.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>The film fails primarily for the reasons most bad films do- no screenplay of quality, and not because it is fictional and not about its titular subject, although a bit of fidelity to the real case could not have hurt. That said, even had the film been well acted, it is so convoluted and off subject that it bores, despite a plethora of needless narrative convolutions (see above), bad attempts at symbolism (Blanchard and Bleichert are known as Fire and Ice), shocking twists (when Blanchard is killed, his body is cremated in the building he died in by a gangster- why?), dull and pointless subplots (too many to enumerate), red herrings (again, too numerous), camp (Bleichert laying Kay on the kitchen table, after ripping away the tablecloth and dishes, or wearing his fedora in bed with Madeleine), loose ends (as if his shooting of Madeleine- a socialite, would not generate more press than the Dahlia's murder ever did), and `unexpected' revelations (again, too many). What part of this mess lies with Ellroy's book (whose earlier book, L.A. Confidential, was turned into a truly great film ten years ago, by Curtis Hanson), and how much blame belong to Friedman and De Palma, is unclear, but one wonders how De Palma (always a lightweight compared to contemporaries like Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola) ever even got tagged with the label that he was Alfred Hitchcock's heir apparent (at best) and imitator (at worst). Regardless, after an atrocity like this, the dead fat man may be rising out of his grave to smite De Palma- that would make for a better film, actually!<br /><br />  His most famous films- Scarface, Carrie, Body Double, The Untouchables, Carlito's Way- are all either campy messes, imitations of his better peers and classic films noir, or films that try to be noirish mysteries, and while The Black Dahlia is not as bad as Johnny Depp's Jack The Ripper film, From Hell, it's close. Too many details without relevance, payoff, or purpose sink the movie, and its insistence on imitating 1940s films rather than reality (which includes a focus on its titular subject matter) buries it even more deeply. Yes, Scarlett Johansson looks good, but other than her piece of eye candy (Swank, by contrast, has always looked butch), the film has little else going for it, so move over, The Bonfire Of The Vanities, there's a new contender in De Palma's pantheon of bad films, and this one's....oh, to hell with it.

Throw in money, sexual desire, sexual perversion, some stolen scenes from other noir films and you have "Black Dahlia". No, not Chandler's "Blue Dahlia" there is too much visual, up-front violence, too little worthy dialogue, and too little character development for that but all the other elements are there to produce an some what entertaining mystery that will keep you guessing a little, if you can keep your eyes off those "dishy" dames, Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson, (or, depending on your preference, those "dishy" guys ). That in the end is probably the reason to see this thing.  It does have that great `40s background music to set the mood, though. You know, if you are a noir fan what I mean.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Actually this movie has some good points..like Hillary Swank..although i honestly, she needs a new agent if this is the best he can do for her.  As for Josh Hartlet, he ought to kiss the ground everyday for his career, because he is bar none the WORST actor in Hollywood, i think he has sold his soul to the devil, which is all fine and good, but i didnt,  so why do i have to endure the torture of watching him..he and Scarlet Johansen have NO chemistry and frankly she is as bad as him in this..what is with all the stareing, what the f is she looking at?...i guess she's just so gobsmacked that she's in this film, she's gone into shock.  I give this film two stars instead of none because of the great Fiona Shaw, she is worth watching this for: she is hilarious.  Frankly, this film in better hands could have been watchable, but as it is, id say, dont walk away from this movie if you see it for rent...RUNNNN Forest, RUNNNNNNNNNNNN.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>Rich in initial promise, De Palma's plush period drama is ultimately notable only for its utterly unfocused execution and the mostly squandered potential of an A-list cast.<br /><br />Set against the backdrop of LA in the 1940's, the film revolves alternately around the odd love triangle between its three lead stars, the murder of a young aspiring actress (the titular "Dahlia") and socio-political commentary on the corrupt origins of the home of America's film industry. If this wasn't ambitious enough, a vague whisper of the ongoing war in Europe, a subplot about boxing, another about a robbery/blackmail/vendetta, and a host of ancillary characters and events are thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The film stutters awkwardly from one event to the next and often fails, throughout its 2 hour course, to address or explain the significance of what is occurring. Even the final "unmasking" of the mystery is not convincing enough to illuminate the meaning of the previous 120 minutes. This leaves the viewer with the distinct impression of having watched a very finely polished turd, but a turd none the less.<br /><br />One gets the impression that De Palma is trying to outdo a film of similar ambition and setting: LA Confidential. Unfortunately De Palma is unable to recreate the balance of character study, ambiance, and cohesive plot that made Confidential a success, not to mention, a movie actually worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In 1946, the former boxers Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert and Lee Blanchard are policemen in Los Angeles. Lee has a good relationship with his chief and uses a box fight between them to promote the department and get a raise to the police force. They succeed and are promoted to homicide detectives, working together. Bucky becomes a close friend of Lee and his girlfriend Kay Lake, forming a triangle of love. When the corpse of the aspirant actress Elizabeth Short is found mutilated, Lee becomes obsessed to solve the case called by the press Black Dahlia. Meanwhile, Bucky's investigation leads him to a Madeleine Linscott, the daughter of a powerful and wealthy constructor that resembles the Black Dahlia. In an environment of corruption and lies, Bucky discloses hidden truths. This movie brings a clear cut finale rather than a vague puzzle, too many loose threads come together too neatly and rather than bringing the movie to a satisfactory conclusion, it leaves you scratching your head.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>The first 45 minutes of this was a very, very pleasant surprise. That's probably because I read so many negative things about this film, I was expecting the worst. I was enthused, even heading into the second hour but as time went on I began to become less involved with the story. That's probably because none of the characters are likable people that I would care about. With no one to really root for, after awhile the movie loses its appeal.<br /><br />The worst part was the last 20 minutes. It was so sordid, it got absurd. It's too much corruption, sick people, ugly violence and nasty overall attitude. The "Linscott" family is so bad I could do little but just shake my head in disgust. The whole thing wound up too depressing. When it's over, you want to take a shower.<br /><br />I loved the cinematography and overall 1940s film noir atmosphere. On that aspect alone, this movie almost was a keeper until they went overboard on the seedy stuff in the last 20 minutes. What a shame.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This movie is 2 hours and two minutes long, and it really leads to a bland ending.  The story is long and thin, and by the time it gets to the end, I forgot what the significance was supposed to be.  The camera work was very stylistic and artsy, but that does not make up for just a plain poor story.  This is supposed to be a story about two ex boxers who make detective rank, and then become obscessed with horrific murder of a young woman. That ends up being one of many sub plots which just tie this story into one giant tangle of weak, uniteresting plots that I did not care to find out one way or another about.  Save your money, let others watch this for you, and give you a synopsis later</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Brian de Palma probably has one of the most frustrating filmographies I've seen. Sure he has Scarface, Carrie, the Untouchables and the successful Mission:Impossible but then again he has Snake Eyes which fell apart after 20 minutes, Mission to Mars and let's not forget the Bonfire of the Vanities. The Black Dahlia's story, setting and mood seem perfect de Palma yet the film feels so lifeless, incoherent and even at times unintentionally funny. The actual murder case was shocking and incredibly disturbing but here it almost seems like the backdrop for the "real" issue which is basically nothing interesting.<br /><br />2  L.A cops, Bleichart and Blanchard, are tracking down a criminal but as they're dealing with it, a grisly discovery is found in the park: a young woman has been cut in half, drained of blood and organs moved with one last touch: her mouth has been extended ear to ear, forming an eerie grin. Elizabeth Short, nicknamed the Black Dahlia by the press, is still one of the most famous unsolved murders in California history so you would think that much attention would be paid to this but instead we focus on a fixation with someone who did a terrible thing to Blanchard's woman Kay while Bleichart gets involved with a Elizabeth look-alike.<br /><br />On more than one occasion I kept thinking they bring up the case and the woman simply because they realized that they were making a movie called the Black Dahlia so they had to mention the case and show one of the cop's obsession with solving it. It's really a shame since author James Ellroy's other novel, L.A Confidential, was a great film while this just feels a mess from start to finish. Worse still is the acting where normally good actors just seem completely off and almost unsure of the performances. The only one that even comes off as a bit good is Josh Hartnett who has what I call the "William Hurt syndrome", named since both actors can be good but their mannerisms or voice suggest they sound bored. The other notable is the L Word's Mia Kirshner, playing Smart in test screening footage and an old movie. That piercing stare she has creates a memorable character that you never even met in the film.<br /><br />Now there's at least a couple of trademark "de Palma"-isms throughout the film including an awesome crane shot that starts off the whole Dahlia case and a scene involving the staircase feels vintage for him but the rest of the film suggests either he's totally awful now and even the fact he made Scarface won't save him now, or simply the often used "the studio made me do it". Unlike James Cameron's underperforming-but-underrated the Abyss, especially the director's cut, this just feels completely off.<br /><br />Is this just a rough patch and he'll get better or is he just bad now. Beats me, but this certainly wasn't a strong case that he can still deliver. Too bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>I love this type of movie and I've seen them all, from the greats, like Out Of The Past to bombs like Mullholland Falls.  But this, this, is really something.  Slow, convoluted, miscast, dull and completely lacking in suspense.  It doesn't even have that much to do with Elizabeth Short.<br /><br />Except for Aaron Eckhart all the major characters look like kids who got into mom and dad's closet, trying to ape the style of the great 1940s actors.  None are convincing.  Aaron Eckhart is (surprisingly) even worse.<br /><br />The story is terribly convoluted and as if to make up for it, just when you think its over, there is an attempt to tie things up (pun possibly intended).  But this really isn't necessary for a case that was never solved.<br /><br />There are a few bright spots.  You get to see the inside of one of the Kessling houses in Silverlake (how they got their movie equipment on that street would make for a good supplement).  They also put together a beautiful diner set.  Mark Isham's score is the only other thing that doesn't come off as phony.<br /><br />This type of film always makes me think of The Two Jakes.  I know everybody hates The Two Jakes because its complicated but it gets L.A. in the 40s just right, great dialog from Robert Towne and of course Nicholson who looks more like a crime investigator than a male model.<br /><br />The book, by the way, is really something.  How Brian De Palma turned it into this, I can't imagine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"Brian De Palma doesn't just know how to make a camera move; he can seduce it to do a sinuous dance. So The Black Dahlia looks and flows great, dripping with the 1940s crime-thriller atmosphere that James Ellroy described in his 1987 novel. On other levels -- plot (overstuffed), suspense (muted), acting (Hilary Swank as a femme fatale? Please!), posing (Scarlett Johansson plays dress-up as a mini Lana Turner), sex (it's all before and after) -- the movie is a bust. The setup is this: Two cops -- Lee Blanchard (a strong Aaron Eckhart) and Bucky Bleichert (a hopeless Josh Hartnett) -- become obsessed with the mutilation and murder of a starlet (Mia Kirshner). De Palma throws everything at the screen, but almost nothing sticks." Peter Travers<br /><br />Like most of you I read James Ellroy's 'The Black Dahlia' and this movie was a totally different experience. Not a good experience, I might add. Elizabeth "Betty" Short, a 22-year-old aspiring actress from New York who was many things to many people. A beloved friend all the way to prostitute. On January 15, 1947, she was discovered dead in a vacant lot Los Angeles.  Two new homicide partners are instructed to investigate this case. The entire city is drawn into the lurid world of the Dahlia's L.A.  "Black Dahlia takes its name and its inspiration both from the murder of Elizabeth Short (known as the Black Dahlia) in Los Angeles in 1947 and from the equally infamous Cleveland Torso Murders that were investigated by Eliot Ness and ceased just prior to the Second World War. Of course, both cases remain unsolved and it has been speculated that they may have been perpetrated by the same killer. Black Dahlia builds on this speculation and weaves in notions of occult rituals based on Norse mythology and of Nazi involvement via a shadowy fifth column at work in the USA."reports Elizabeth Young. The book was so wonderfully written that this movie was a bigger disappointment than it otherwise might be.<br /><br />"Determined to be famous, destined to be infamous, Betty Short affected more lives dead than she could possibly alive. She dreamed of being photographed for the big screen but wound up the pin-up girl of tabloid autopsy photos." Yahoo.<br /><br />This was a movie of mysteries, quandaries and suspense. It never lived up to its potential, and the acting left me feeling 'unfulfilled' and bored. Read 'The Black Dahlia' by James Ellroy but this movie is....<br />Not recommended.  prisrob 2-19-07</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>It is hard to believe that Brian DePalma directed this film. The best thing that you can say about the film is that the period sets, clothes and language are well done. Unfortunately, the film is grossly miscast, terribly confusing and the title is misleading. The Black Dahlia murder is almost a mere footnote in this film. Most of the story focuses on the lives of 2 cops that stumble into the Dahlia crime scene. Josh Hartnett just wanders through the film and Hilary Swank is horribly miscast as a femme fatale. The plot is so confusing that, by the end of the film, you just want all the characters to die. This film makes your brain hurt. Sorry, Brian.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>The Black Dahlia may be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  Brian De Palma's directing is among the worst in Hollywood (at least Michael Bay is entertaining).  De Palma makes such an abysmal mess of this story that I wonder if he wasn't sued for purposely train-wrecking James Ellroy's novel by the same name.  Since there's nothing much positive to say about the movie, let's spend some time ridiculing its many faults.<br /><br />First, De Palma manages to preempt every actor's attempt to dramatize the incoherent script and stock noir dialogue.  Scarlett Johansson is given absolutely nothing to do, and De Palma films her doing nothing.  Her character comes off as entirely irrelevant.  She wears the same color outfits throughout the entire movie.  She looks like a throw pillow designed to accent the wallpaper and sofa rather than a character in a movie.<br /><br />The royal pool boy, Josh Hartnett, is miscast as the brooding Dwight "Bucky" "Mr. Ice" Bleichert (yes, he has three first names).  Hartnett is too pretty to be moody and too young to be a believable noir male lead.  The noir male has seen everything.  He doesn't cry.  He looks rough, has a cold stare, and says tough things.  Hartnett does none of these convincingly until the very end of the film, when most sane people have already taken the movie back to the store to rent Beerfest to get the bad taste out of their mouths.<br /><br />While most of the cast is comprised of character actors and miscast noir stock, the only actor who comes away unscathed is Mia Kirshner (who plays Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia herself).  She understands that her character is a corpse, and she engages the audience's sympathy directly.  And she manages this with bad dialogue from a screen test for a porno film.  The other lead actors fail to create believable characters, and her fine performance seems wasted.<br /><br />The earth tone palette of everything in the movie (costumes, furniture, buildings, lighting, etc.) fails as a 1940s fa?ade.  Why must films from the era of the American gangster be compulsively drenched in sepia and silhouetted by smoky shadows?<br /><br />De Palma and his editor, Bill Pankow, really need to quit working together.  Neither is able to piece the story together in a convincing manner.  Three stories are lined up side-by-side: The Black Dahlia's death, a troubled cop and his reformed prostitute and her pimp, and an incestuous Hollywood family.  It sounds crazy, and it should have been, but De Palma and Pankow manage to make it utterly boring.  They rest the movie's success on Josh Harnett's weak narration and clunky acting.<br /><br />But maybe it was just a stupid story from the get go.  The screenwriter, Josh Friedman, certainly deserves to be mocked incessantly for writing such nonsense, but being that De Palma's films are generally terrible, I can't assign blame to Friedman solely.<br /><br />The movie desperately wants to be L.A. Confidential, but it lacks the directing, acting, compelling story, editing, and overall polished production value one should expect from a feature film.  Skip this one.  There are better neo-noir films out there: Chinatown, Road to Perdition, Red Rock West, to name a few.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>First of all, it is SLOW, very SLOW.  I thought it was about 6 hours long - which gave me plenty of time to think.  Did DaPalma think he was taking Chinatown and and L.A. Confidential and throwing them in a blender with a real-life hollywood mystery tacked on?  Not a good move.  This is as tedious as they come.  H. Swank should be forced to return her two Oscars.  Her over-the-top (unintentionally hillarious) performance makes Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest look subtle.  Nobody else fares any better.  I think they brought back Gloria Swanson to play Swank's mother! Save your time and money.  Or put it on when you need a good long nap!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Black Dahlia (Brian de Palma, 2006)<br /><br />What surprised me most about The Black Dahlia was not that Brian DePlama phoned it in, since he's done that with the majority of the movies he's made in his career, and certainly everything he's done since Raising Cain. It was also not that most of the principals in this movie were at best miscast. It wasn't even that the movie ended up not really being about the Black Dahlia case in any more than a subplot. No, upon reflection, I can't even say that the thing that most surprised me about it was that we had to have a twenty-minute "and so I have you all gathered in the room, and I shall now reveal who the killer is!" sequence. No, the thing that most surprised me about The Black Dahlia was that the crew who made this movie could, consciously or not, attempt a straight remake of L. A. Confidential and come up so hideously, horribly short.<br /><br />And yes, this might as well have been a remake of L. A. Confidential. All the same basic fetishes are there (though whether one can blame James Ellroy for this or those who adapt his books to the screen choosing to emphasize some points of his writing I don't know, as I've never read James Ellroy). The movie unfolds in the same manner, and the basic premise is so similar you could put Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe in Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett's roles and no one would know the difference. In fact, you'd probably have come up with a better movie; Josh Hartnett brings all the weight of obsession to this role that Jack Nicholson did to his in Sean Penn's woefully ineffective adaptation of The Pledge five years previous. Aaron Eckhart does a better job with the obsession angle, but he seems to have a problem getting anything else to work. There's the celebrity-lookalike angle, though Mia Kirshner and Hilary Swank, as has been commented on by, I believe, everyone who has reviewed this movie to date, look about as much alike as do a great dane and a haddock. (You decide which is which.) And, of course, there's the claustrophobic thirties cinematography. But where L. A. Confidential fires on every cylinder, The Black Dahlia is still trying to get out of the gate. Everything about it says it's a cheaper, low-rent knockoff. And then, of course, you get the "oh, this is how I solved the crime" phase, which should be outlawed in movies, and that just puts the cap on it.<br /><br />Could've been such a good movie. And ended up so mediocre. * ?</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Brian De Palma is one of the most frustrating working directors.  Though prolific, he's yet to make a great movie and has many disasters to his name.  His particular specialty is reverse alchemy, De Palma takes movies that might have been great and snatches failure from the jaws of victory.  He came closest to excellence in The Untouchables, but if you remove Sean Connery from that film what you have left is Kevin Costner doing his best to impersonate a petrified oak.  Performances that bad are always the director's fault.  You simply cannot strike the set until you have what you need in the can.  The Black Dahlia is a virtual primer on the inadequacies that have dogged De Palma's career.<br /><br />Instead of a coherent, interesting screenplay with characters worth caring about, what you have is the empty artifice of cinema - period clothing, architecture, cars, and idiomatic speech.  For a while that's all engaging enough to help you overlook the lack of story.  When you do start wondering what's going on, what you discover is a handful of unrelated plotlets tossed into a blender and reassembled.  Police corruption, two friends who boxed, a romantic triangle, the unfortunate aspiring starlet known as The Black Dahlia, K.D. Lang, and a fabulously rich family so absurdly eccentric it's over the top even by Hollywood standards.  Since it's De Palma, naturally there is grotesque, gratuitous violence, but because we never know anything about the perpetrators even that fails to generate a jolt.  What happened to the real life Elizabeth Short is horrifying beyond all reason; only De Palma's tepid detachment could make such extreme cruelty dull.<br /><br />As Detective Lee Blanchard, Aaron Eckhart comes closest to delivering an actual performance.  By contrast, Josh Hartnett, as his partner, is both dreadfully miscast and downright difficult to watch.  Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank - both highly skilled in their craft - seem to be sleepwalking through caricatures rather than playing actual people.  In numerous scenes they are out-acted by what they're wearing.  This appalling waste of talent must be blamed entirely on De Palma.  Only Mia Kirshner saves the day, appearing posthumously in short B&W audition films where she is speaking directly to the camera.  As Elizabeth Short - The Black Dahlia - she is the film's tragic heart.  In better hands, a script, and a movie, could have been built out from this center - then perhaps it would have been about a person, instead of being a dog's breakfast of Hollywood stereotypes and cliches.<br /><br />As a final note.  You simply haven't experienced bad directing until you see Fiona Shaw's swansong, she makes Al Pacino look like Marcel Marceau.  De Palma's ability to find funding time and again does make one wonder if he has extremely incriminating photos in a safe deposit box.  Should have called it The Black Dullia.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Beany, my beloved friend, is going to hate me for this.<br /><br />`The Black Dahlia' fuses a lot of things I really love about the movies.  First, you have the film noir.  This is a genre that is VERY hard to get right, especially in this generation.  All too often directors want to be super literal when attempting this fare and it becomes a technically proficient but emotionally stunted work.  The era thing is a deterrent because the 30's and 40's were so rich with this coolness that aided in fleshing out rather stagnant approaches to filmmaking.  That is hard to come by today because the approach to acting is so different.  When you take actors used to heavy emoting and make them scale backwards they lose the cool and come across dull and empty.  But, there have been successful takes on the genre, even in recent years.  Second, you have James Ellroy, who has written some of the best crime novels ever and when you factor in the adaptation of `L.A. Confidential' (a beautiful harmony of modern flare and nostalgic noir techniques over a canvas of brilliant performances) I was really excited to see this unfold.  Then you have Brian de Palma.  I'm not the biggest fan, but fear is an ally of his and he has worked some magic in creating tense situations that simmer just right; and this premise was in dire need of a hand adept at creating the right mood.  Fourth, and not least, is the Scarlett Johansson effect.  I'm drawn to her, not just because she is gorgeous but because her actorly antics are alluring in themselves.<br /><br />So I had four very promising reasons to see this film.  Sadly, none of them worked; like, at all.<br /><br />First, I'll start with the obvious.  Like many a critic has noted, Scarlett Johansson probably puts in her worst performance to date here.  She is atrociously out of her comfort zone and while she tries really, really hard, it is embarrassing to note how poorly she attempts to emote so quietly.  UGH, this is coming from the same girl who should have won an Oscar for subtle emoting in `Lost in Translation' and yet she was so caught up in trying to find the style in this genre that she fell on her face; hard.  That leads me to the rest of the cast, who were uniformly terrible (aside from Mia Kirshner and Fiona Shaw).  Hartnett is an actor I often defend because I like him, but by god was he boring as all get out here.  Eckhart had some nice moments but he flew so far over the top in scenes it was hard to take him seriously. And don't even get me started on Hilary Swank.  The idea that she looks like Kirshner was hard enough to swallow (let alone the fact that she was trying so hard to skew young and yet she has old man hands that are mugging up the whole screen) but she just couldn't get the seductive angle right to save her life.  Why didn't they get Jennifer Connelly for this part?  The whole movie I was thinking "that dead actress looks just like Jennifer Connelly".  I never once said "wow, she and Swank could be sisters".  That brings me to the script.  As some have already mentioned, this veers to far from the initial murder storyline and becomes a soap opera of sorts (and uninteresting one at that, since the actors are so disgustingly inept at being remotely convincing), which takes away from the feel of a James Ellroy novel.<br /><br />True, there is some mood here, but it is ultimately sacrificed by the poor handling of the script and the terrible work with these actors, which I do blame de Palma for.  I mean, a director needs to work with his cast to find a niche, and de Palma basically left these fish out of water to muddle through this nightmare all on their own.  When I said earlier about this genre being taken too literally, yeah, that happened here and to devastating effect.<br /><br />I wanted to love this Beany, I really did, but the best I can say is that the film was pretty, the costumes were authentic and the makeup department went all out with that corpse (truly terrifying).  I can't even praise the score, which was so clich&eacute;d and uninspired I was rolling my eyes during the predictable rise and fall.<br /><br />Oh, but Kirshner was sincerely na?ve and Shaw was deliciously demented; so there is that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The style and the camera movement of the movie is very good. However, the plot is nigh incomprehensible. The main character keeps get flashbacks and has a miracously ability to put all the pieces together with the small pieces of information. I kept thinking, "Yes, but how in the world did he figure out where ...?" Some mysteries like the "Big Sleep" can overcome incomprehensible plots, but these mysteries need a strong lead like Bogart. Unfortunately, Hartnett does not carry the film. He's ok, but he can't carry all the deadweight of the plot. Swank seems to be channeling both Bette Davis and Harlowe at the same time. Johanssen has a very strange character.<br /><br />The movie was disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>Based on James Ellroy's book of the same name.<br />1940s. Los Angeles. Two cops, Bleichert aka Mr Ice (Hartnett) and Blanchard aka Mr Fire (Eckhart) investigate the brutal murder of a would-be actress, Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirschner).<br /><br />Unfortunately this film just didn't do anything right - except the the setting and costumes which were rather fine.<br /><br />Being badly directed is its weakest point. Brian De Palma had all the good aspects of a great film: detectives, murder, guns, boxing match, violence, money, and women.<br />Then the script just went all over the place, everything was quite confusing and simply not well explained. The lack of factual detail doesn't help and muddled the story further. The actors have difficulty mastering the year's style and give uneasy and uncomfortable performances, even Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank. Having virtually no character development doesn't help either.<br />The result was an imitation Film Noir.<br />Advertised as a crime / drama / thriller / mystery movie, it is *also* a comedy.<br /><br />This is just another bad film... that bores and disappoints the viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Elizabeth Short's death was the sensational centerpiece that attracted viewer's attention but wow, it amazes me what people are saying about this film. I didn't know how to begin with this review and before writing this I read lots who have been misled by the title assuming that the Black Dahlia murder itself was to be the main focus, probably any true McEllroy and De Palma fans will tell you its not and was not ever the case. After viewing this I thought it wasn't bad and it caught my attention rather well. The plot of course centers on LAPD Officers Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichart( Josh Harnett) and Leland 'Lee' Blanchard( Aaron Eckhart) aka Mr.Ice and Mr.Fire respectively due to their boxing skills and the tale is told by Bucky ( in voice-overs) The film's backdrop is the horrific and now infamous murder rising star Elizabeth'Beth'Shortt ( Mia Kershner) aka 'The Black Dahlia'. Our two protagonists are called in to investigate the crime which was so horrible that all the details were kept from the public. While Lee and Bucky go all out to solve the heinous crime each is also dealing with his personal issues. Lee's growing obsession with the case threatens his relationship with his girlfriend Kay (Scarlett Johanssen). Added to the strain is the eminent release of Bobby De Witt whom Lee had previously put behind bars for numerous crimes including some close to home. Bucky meanwhile finds himself entwined in a love-affair with wealthy if rebellious Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank) who bears an uncanny resemblance to Beth Shortt.<br /><br />In this day and age, classic film-noir style walks the very fine line of parody and sincerity. And "Dahlia" went back and forth. The entire cast, really, handled the somewhat archaic style of acting without making it seem too goofy. I have to give special mention to Fiona Shaw who gave an over the top performance as Ramona Linscott. Every moment she was on screen you couldn't help but to listen to her because some of the things she would say or how she says it was amazing. Aaron Eckhart's pitiful obsessed yet tragic portrayal of Blanchard whose dedication to the case proves his undoing. Josh Harnett is on top form as the narrator Bucky and portrays Bucky's struggles and angst perfectly. One of his best traits is being able to read his facial features. Through Hartnett's expressions, one can almost read his mind to foreshadow events before he does.  Scarlett Johanssen is currently the sweetheart of Hollywood and it's easy to see why. She plays the old beauty 40s sirens pretty well but at times I would hear her switch on and off her accent to the point I was hoping that it remain consistent. Her role is both headstrong and lost through out the film. Hilary Swank done her role fairly well and at times looks awkward in certain scenes. Mia Kershner as the doomed `Dahlia' played her role nicely and convincing enough in this story.<br /><br />Shadows- is part of De Palma's main focus of this film and you'll see why. Along with side plots and twists also keep a viewer on their toes. Base on the interview that I have seen on this disc, De Palma did stated that he kept faithful to McEllroy's excellent novel while also giving the story an energy and intense emotional drive that can only be given on screen. This film might be a big disappointment to a lot of viewers but remember that the 'Dahlia 'herself is not the main focus of the film, since it says on Ellroy's book it was not focused solely on her. Rather she is the catalyst for the all the events following the murder. Just keep an open mind and rather than being put off by the focus of the story think it through logically and you won't have a problem understanding anything. I recommend this to De Palma's entire fan base and to those who are curios of this man work.</p></br></body></html>

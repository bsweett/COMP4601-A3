What makes this so much better than the sequels and recent movies that feature killer sharks (and I know other people have said this but not me) is that they don't show the shark until the movie's almost over! I mean, you know what's killing these people but you have no idea of the size of this thing until it pops up out of the water when Schieder's throwing the chum. I think all the horror/slasher films need to take a lesson from this; don't show the monster all the time because the people will never get scared. People are afraid of the unknown, so if you show people getting killed off but don't show who or what's doing it, then you'll get a bigger scare out of them when you do finally show it. Anyway, enough prattling on how good suspense should be done. Roy Schieder gives a great performance as Chief Brody. He's an average person thrust into this extraordinary situation. Robert Shaw is off his is rocker as Quint (a complete opposite compared to his role in From Russia with Love). And Richard Dreyfuss is down to Earth and believable as Hooper. All three actors have great chemistry together when they're on the boat. The shark, while not sleek looking by today's standards of special effects (God awful CGI would probably replace the model if this film gets remade and we'd probably see the shark every waking moment), is very believeable in its few moments on screen. And I think the shark roars or makes some weird sound when it busts through the boat right before Brody thrusts the air tank in its mouth. I might be wrong though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In the island resort town of Amity, there has been reports of deaths nearby the water. Police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) suspects it's the work of a deadly shark as the mayor (Murray Hamilton) wants to keep his island resort town to be tourist friendly including safe for the 4th of july as possible, so Brody teams up with ichthylogist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and expert sea-man Quint (Richard Shaw) whom are the only ones to stop this powerful killing machine of a shark.<br /><br />One of the greatest movies of all time! this awesome action-packed horror thriller originally started as a bestselling novel by Peter Benchley whom also wrote the screenplay including doing a cameo in this movie. The film is nicely directed by Steven Spielberg and offers an awesome script with great acting, remarkable special effects that gives the viewers a convincing shark and of course thrills with chills that made this remarkable movie a favorite among people for many ages as it became one of the most critically accalimed box-office hits of all time that is a must see movie.<br /><br />This DVD offers brilliant picture and sound quality with great extras like featurette, Deleted scenes, outtakes, Trivia game, production photos and storyboards stills, screensaver, bios, and Trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>I waited a long time to watch the classic film JAWS because I always heard it was so scary and full of gore.  I finally watched it this week and though the movie did make me jump a couple of times  the images of blood and guts are about the same if not milder than what you would see on a typical CSI episode.  The film is a true landmark in the horror genre  mostly because the three main characters (the marine biologist, the police chief and the shark hunter) are so well developed with complete back stories and very well portrayed by fine actors.  The plot of the story is rich in themes that go well beyond the man vs giant toothy sea monster we usually think of when someone mentions the film JAWS or hums the trademark theme song.  JAWS has truly earned a lasting position in our popular culture.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>I saw Jaws when it debuted in 1975 and we were late getting in because of parking issues; however, we made it to the interior and couldn't see to find a seat having just come out of sunlight into dark so we waited and while we were waiting, the opening credits ran, accompanied by that MUSIC.<br />We stood there until the girl had her nighttime encounter with the shark and our knees turned to rubber (sorry, buit the cliche fits) and were thankful when the scene changed to daylight and we could grope our way to our seats.<br />The audience was blown away as were we, and the biggest shocker came when Hooper (Dreyfuss) is taking the tooth off Ben Gardner's boat and that HEAD comes out; everyone shot out of their chairs and screamed; it was and is a truly shocking moment, We are expecting the shark to come from behind Dreyfuss, not for something to pop out of the BOAT so this was brilliant (TY SSpielberg)and the actors are all so good. LOVE Robert Shaw, but as Quint he excels himself and turns in a great performance, esp the relating of the story of the USS Indianapolis. I had never heard of it before and subsuquent research was not only enlightening, it was appalling.<br />Roy Scheider was solid as Brody, a vastly different interpretation from that in the book, thankfully, and Lorraine Gary was wonderful as Mrs Brody.<br />The quality is superb, better than I've ever seen, but the real value here is the extras, notably the Making of, which is the best I have ever seen on any disc of any moive; this was almost as riveting as the movie itself. It is quite lengthy and provides many fascinating factoids and gives a new light and dimension to the movie. HIGHLY recommend.<br />God Bless and RIP Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw, and TY for so many excellent performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>Jaws is not really a favorite of mine, I first saw it on a date that didn't go all that well, and I was too angry too get the jump factor that the rest of the audience did. However, my family will all watch Jaws over and over at least once a year, so go figure.<br /><br />My cool anecdote about Jaws is from a couple of weeks after it came out, I was skin diving near Newport Beach, and as we swam out from shore, the sea weed was swaying in the water, my friend and I both looked at each other at the same time and through our snorkels, we sang "Doo, doo, doo-doo" That day they caught a baby Great White between where we were and Catalina Island, the next day a world record Great White off of Catalina. It did keep us out of the water the rest of the week!<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is a scary movie, but don't look too close at the special effects, as they are pretty cheesy by today's standards, and on a side note, Myth Busters tried to re- create the Blow Up scene... Myth busted!</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>Just goes to show that they just don't make horror movies the way they used to in Hollywood.  The thing about Jaws is that it goes beyond a horror film....it is a masterpiece.  While today's horror films continue to pour on the blood and guts and sacrificing B-actors and a poor story/script, Jaws shows us that a horror film can be big, directed well, contain a tight story and feature top A-list actors in Hollywood.  Chances are you have seen this film by now, if not, jump on in...the water's fine.<br /><br />If there is one negative surrounding Jaws is that it eventually produced some embarassing sequals.  If there is one negative thing about the first Jaws, its that the shark can look fake.  Ironically, it looked better to me than any of the sequals, and we don't really see much of the shark until the films end.  That's the beauty of the horror surounding this film.  We see helpless people swimming in the water, and then out of nowhere the screaming and panic begins, without even seeing the shark.  That is the real scare to this film.  In its day, there were definetly some intense scenes of blood (not so much gore except for a guy's leg falling off).  One scene still compete's today with any blood-filled horror film and that is near the end of Jaws, when the shark jumps on the boat and Quint (Robert Shaw) falls into its mouth, wrestling for about 20 seconds with his lower torso being chomped.<br /><br />What makes the film so accomplished in the end is much more than the horror.  The characters are superb, and the wonderfully written script is used so well by the actors.  Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw share incredible chemistry in this film, with scene after scene of frustrations, anger, joy and cooperation.  Watching these three in action is a show in itself.  Though not known for its comedy aspects, I found little lines and scenes here and there to be extremely funny, given the nature of things.<br /><br />What bugs me the most about the dvd, is when I have watched Jaws on television there are several extended scenes (not deleted scenes) that are not included on dvd.  I actually like these scenes too and miss them when I watch my dvd.<br /><br />Jaws is a 5 star classic - easily.  It has gone down as one of the greatest horror film accomplishments of all time.  It certainly is not the scariest movie you will see today, but it is an A+ in every regard.  Don't watch this in the bathtub.<br /><br />Acting - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Horror - 4.5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>I was 3 years old when this movie came out.<br />I remember goin to see Jaws 2 with my Dad & my brother.<br />I had the hardest time just swimming in our pool in our<br />back yard for about a year after seeing Jaws 2.<br />Ever since seeing Jaws I've had a interest in sharks.<br />I would say Jaws 1 & 2 are the best out of the series,<br />3 & 4 are kinda corny & stupid.<br />I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Before Jaws, Steven Spielberg had only directed two movies.  The first was a made for TV movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR5">Duel (Collector's Edition)</a>, ad the other was the low budget, comedic Goldie Hawn true story <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HBIE">The Sugarland Express</a>.  So you could understand why no one expected Jaws to be a hit.<br /><br />But it was, becoming the first movie to gross more than $100 million at the box office and firmly cementing Speilberg's place as a filmmaker.  Not only did he create an effective and terrifying tale.  He created a movie that still gives some goosebumps 30 years later.<br /><br />Still as refreshing as the day it was first shown, Jaws is a classic.  The DVD features a two hour making of feature and a few deleted scenes.  It also has a documentary and a few other fun things.  The big draw will be the 60 page Commemorative Booklet.  Full of Jaws facts from here to there.<br /><br />Definitely a must for all Spielberg and Jaws fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Still under age 30 when released, wunderkind director Spielberg hit the big time with this runaway box-office hit, based on Peter Benchley's novel. John Williams's unforgettable score and Spielberg's clever mounting of suspense recall the best of Hitchcock, and Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw make up an unlikely but appealing trio of protagonists. What "Psycho" did for the shower, "Jaws" does for the ocean. Be sure to get the new 30th Anniversary edition- the movie looks flawless.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>No, I didn't just watch Jaws for the first time but I'm new to writing online reviews and I just had to review this movie. Jaws is a movie that no one will ever forget. For a 1975 movie, Jaws still remains a classic. What a great movie for the decade. As many times as I've seen Jaws, if I see it playing on t.v., I can't help but watch it again. Great acting, great special effects, great writing, great everything. There are not many movies that people talk about 31 years later, but Jaws is one of them! There are sequels to this classic but none of them can beat the original Jaws....... the movie that made you scared to go into the water!!! Excellent movie!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg's breakout film, Jaws is the quintessential summer blockbuster, creating all the horror, thrills, suspense, and special effects you would expect from such a film. Not excessively violent or gruesome like traditional horror films, Jaws nonetheless manages to create an icy frost in every viewer's veins. Based on the true story of a great white shark which terrorized the shores of New Jersey in the summer of 1916, Jaws is an ingenious adaptation of Peter Benchley's best-selling novel inspired by the incident. Jaws tells the story of man's eternal struggle against nature, a story so compelling it captures the imagination of every generation who hears it - from 1916 to 1975 to the present day...<br /><br />Jaws takes place in the small New England beach resort of Amity Island, the perfect summer getaway for Northeastern tourists. But this Normal Rockwell community paradise is about to be turned upside down. Late one night, a young couple decides to go swimming. But when the woman's mangled body is washed ashore the next morning, it's clear to local authorities that she isn't a typical drowning victim. The medical examiner informs Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) that the woman could have been the victim of a shark attack, but Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) refuses to speculate, fearing that public knowledge of a shark attack would kill the local economy.<br /><br />When another shark attacks occurs, this time is broad daylight, the incident draws shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to the area. Working with Chief Brody, Hooper postulates that a great white shark is responsible for the attacks, and the swimming population is in great danger. Meanwhile, a shark hunter named Quint offers to find and kill the shark for $10,000, but Mayor Vaughn believes that price is too high. More and more beach combers will have to be slaughtered before he'll agree to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem, and when the authorities finally decide to go after the great white, the really danger is only beginning...<br /><br />With brilliant direction and state-of-the-art special effects (satisfactory even by today's standards), Jaws is a true edge-of-your-seat thriller wrought with suspense. The unknown is masterfully woven throughout the movie with a crescendo effect that keeps the audience guessing until the end. Like any good story, the shark is never shown in the opening scenes. Instead, the movie begins with an attack in near darkness. The shark is alluded to... Even when someone is attacked in daylight, the audience is only privy to an exposed fin and the blood of the victim as it spreads across the water. This approach effectively combines fear of the unknown with the already present fear of the shark to create a chilling atmosphere for movie goers. Is it any wonder then that Jaws was a blockbuster hit?<br /><br />It's this high level of suspense that I like most about Jaws. Like a fine murder novel, the scenes draw the audience into the setting, forcing you to identify with the characters. In due time, you begin to fear for your own life. After watching Jaws, you may not swim at the beach ever again... And any movie that can have that type of effect must be good! That's why Jaws ranks as a definite must-see film...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>&quot;Jaws&quot; is literally the original blockbuster movie. Spielberg did a good job in building the suspense by not overtly showing the shark in the first half of the movie, only its victims (or remnants of them). In this regard it is as good or better than any Hitchcock movie. There is no big message in the movie, no big concept. It's pure entertainment.<p>As a one-time surfer in Hawaii, I remember being creeped out for a week or two after seeing the movie.<p>All the actors did a tremendous job. Roy Scheider (police chief), Richard Dreyfuss (shark expert) and Robert Shaw (boat owner) are stand outs, but the supporting actors, such as Murray Hamilton (mayor) are good, too.<p>Famous for the line &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat&quot; and the cello-based score that only requires 2 notes to define it.<p>The reasonably-priced DVD has the widescreen movie, a good &quot;making of&quot; documentary, deleted scenes and out-takes, and some other minor extras. The movie is currently #83 on the IMDB list.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>In 1975 "Jaws" was a phenomenon.  The one theater in Colorado Springs that was playing "Jaws" had lines for every showing for weeks, and the movie was in the theater for months.<p>The opening moments of this movie became the standard for hosts of low-budget gore-fests to follow, completely missing the style and drama of this movie.  Our introductory characters are doing what all young adults do, partying and having fun, never imagining the menace lurking, just, below, the water.  The music begins, with the characteristic sequence used by millions to enhance completely unrelated water-cooler conversations, menacing, sending chills up your spine, it's that SHARK MUSIC!  Dozens of cheap horror movies have tried without success to copy the opening, yearning to set the stage for the supposed horror to come.<p>In its own way, this movie combines the drama of "The Old Man and the Sea," with far more action, and the thrill of a well-done monster movie.  This movie, while involving a host of protagonists, is ultimately a battle between Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and a great white shark, which represents not only itself, but all Brody's personal demons.<p>It's amazing that a mechanical shark could generate such terror.  Watching how the movie was made, it's relatively easy to see that the shark was mechanical.  Stephen Spielberg used clever camera work in combination with the intensity of each shark appearance to keep your focus on the story and being held in suspense, completely ignoring whatever flaws there may have been in his excellent mechanical monster.  Furthermore, the shark inspires fear not by crude use of blood and entrails being swallowed or floating in the water, but by frothy water and its sudden, yet anticipated, appearances, with a bit of red-coloring to bring out your worst fears.<p>What enhances the terror of the shark attacks is that they occur at a public beach, where millions journey each year.  Shark experts Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) provide all sorts of true information regarding sharks to give you the picture that they are mindless killing machines (though that is an extreme exaggeration).  The audience knows what's coming, and yet the innocents on the beach insist on throwing themselves into harm's way.<p>The final sequence in the movie is excellent, and provides an inexorable buildup to the climax, fast yet slow.  This sequence also provides what is probably the goriest portion of the movie.  In the end, as in many dramas, the battle is between Chief Brody and the antagonist, the shark.  Can Chief Brody conquer his fears?  How will he do it?  The suspense is just killing me!  Here comes the SHARK!!!  LOOK OUT!!!<p>This movie is still suspenseful and well worth watching more than 25 years after its release.  One of the best monster movies ever, and just enough basis in reality to be considered a drama as well.  Five stars for a movie you can watch over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>What can one say of the movie Jaws?  It is an icon--as much as the Statue of Liberty or The Empire State Building.  I've noticed some people dump on the special effects as &quot;pre-CGI&quot;.  This movie is the argument AGAINST CGI.  Don't believe me?  Watch &quot;The Deep Blue Sea.&quot;<p>As for the DVD itself, a lot of the material was all ready included on the 20th Anniversary VHS--notably, the Spielberg interviews.  However, that was just VHS.  This also contains many of the deleted scenes which (although clearly left out for a reason) are still quite enjoyable to watch.  This DVD sounds like no other broadcast version I've heard; compare this whale-song to the one on VHS.  Also, this is a completely different movie seen in widescreen format.  If you're a Jaws fan, you have to own this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>This DVD has everything if you love Jaws!  The extra footage is massive!  All of the inner workings - or malfunctions - of the shark are presented here.  <p>The movie itself is classic.  I remember being so scared of the water after seeing this movie.  The acting/directing here is superb, and the shark itself is terrifying.  Now, I know there are those that will say that the shark looks too fake or that it doesn't show up enough.  However, have you ever seen &quot;Deep Blue Sea?&quot;  Jaws is everything that &quot;sea&quot;  isn't.  The absence of the shark actually builds the suspense in the movie.  This movie is incredible and the extra features make this an incredible DVD purchase!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>This 1983 VHS is a collectible as it was the movie's first home tape release. However, the full screen dub doesn't have Hi-Fi audio, only a linear mono track of lesser fidelity.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's first and perhaps greatest masterpiece (of many) also epitomizes the summer blockbuster. His screen realization of JAWS (1975), Peter Benchley's bubblegum novel of a giant shark lurking in the waters off a fictional Massachusetts resort island, occurs during a July 4th holiday weekend.<br /><br />The three main characters are somewhat clich&eacute;d, but the talented actors portraying them manage to keep these men from being laughably cartoonish. Roy Scheider plays a transplant from NYC, the sheriff of an island town surrounded by water who's terrified of the ocean. Richard Dreyfuss is a boy genius icthyologist whose family wealth allows him to turn a hobby, the study of sharks, into a career. Robert Ryan is the crusty sea salt with a tragic past that comes closest to caricature; comparisons to Captain Ahab are apt.<br /><br />By story's conclusion, Ryan joins his prototype in death, the boy has become a man nearly eaten by the Great White he tried to poison, and Scheider learns he actually likes the sea. But what brings them to these ends is unforgettable cinema, and the reason this film was the blockbuster of 1975, a phenomenon that has yet to be equalled in public hysteria and popularity.<br /><br />John Williams' famous score is one of his best, subsequently imitated yet never topped. His music enhances on-screen action and helps turn what could've been an average monster movie into a screen classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"Jaws" was really the first Hollywood film that started the tradition of Hollywood releasing blockbuster movies during the summer. The film, as many know, is about a great white shark terrorizing a seaside community in Cape Cod, and its up to the police chief, Sheriff Brody, played by Roy Scheider, to stop the killings and destroy the shark.<br /> I first saw this movie on television in the late '70s, and it terrified me to the point of not be able to sleep for nights, so I wouldn't recommend it to children under 12 because the film is extremely graphic for its time. It is however an excellent film in the horror genre.<br /> Steven Speilberg had his first hit as a director of this film, and it would be his work on "Jaws" that brought him to the attention of other movie studios. The haunting theme music, composed by John Willimas, still remains the most chilling movie theme in history, and it won Williams an Oscar for Best Original Music for a film.<br /> "Jaws" is also one of those rare Hollywood films that made the cover of "Time" magazine in 1975. It became a worldwide phenomenon and made millions at the boxoffice. It stayed in the Top 10 of the highest making films until 1997, when "Titanic" became the biggest grosser.<br /> There have been many sequels to this blockbuster, but only one is worth watching and buying: "Jaws 2", released in 1978. Nowhere near as great as the original, "Jaws 2" is a worthy sequel, also starring Scheider. Forget about all the other "Jaws" films out there: they are cheaply produced and horribly written and directed.<br /> This DVD comes with a ton of bonuses, but the jewel here is the documentary on the film, with neat info and great anecdotes.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Jaws" is a tremendously entertaining action/adventure film. It's not really a horror film although it contains horror elements. Director Spielberg draws superlative performances from his main characters played by Robert Shaw (old sea dog), Roy Scheider (local police chief), and Richard Dreyfuss (shark expert) and it's their interplay which is particularly memorable. Brilliantly directed and conceived by Spielberg and featuring the iconic John Willams theme - this is a film classic. Don't bother with any of the sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>JAWS was one of the few movies I saw in the theater that literally had me white-knuckling the arms of my seat.  (Which meant the popcorn and pop tumbled out of my lap and onto the floor.)  What a great time I had, all those years ago in the cinema, as watching this thriller was one whale (shark?) of a gasp-fest; I remember walking out of the lobby thinking, "This Spielberg guy might have a future in filmmaking."<br /><br />Duh. . .<br /><br />But aside from all the obvious plusses (great story, suspense, characters, timing, musical score, dialogue, etc.) that make watching this film, over the years, such a delight, I tend to marvel at two noteworthy components of this instant classic.  The first is the interaction of the Big Three (Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss); the way they play off one another, while rubbing elbows on that tiny boat, is a marvel to behold.  And Shaw's monologue--as his character relives his experiences as a survivor of the USS Indianapolis--is perhaps the most riveting monologue in all of cinema.<br /><br />The other component involves the mechanics of making the movie itself.  Just think of it:  The difficulties of simulating the power of a giant shark tearing apart a boat in the open ocean (with the limited technology at the time) must have been extraordinary, yet Spielberg and crew accomplish the insurmountable--and make it look totally believable.  Accordingly, JAWS is the product of filmmakers at the pinnacle of their craft, which makes it as much fun to watch today as the first time I spilled my soda.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>Peter Benchley's best selling novel comes to life in Jaws. The novel was based on the Jersey Shore shark attacks in 1916. Jaws helps to re-image what happened on the beaches. Basically all caos.<br /><br />Are the waters safe? The answer to that question on Amity Island is NO. Martin Brody is convinced of that when Christine Watkins's torn up body washes ashore. To fix the problem he has to do one thing. Kill the Shark. Easier said than done. And, better yet, the beaches have to remain open for the Fourth of July celebration. In other words, Brody has to do something about it, and fast. Can he kill the maneating Great White Shark before it kills the people on the beach?<br /><br />So continues Jaws. The whole idea of a shark rampaging public beaches and eating everybody it sees can get a little boring after a while. But the whole plot and storyline is very well laid out. I haven't read the book Jaws, but I'm guessing it's pretty similar to the movie.<br /><br />The acting is really good in Jaws. Roy Scheider does a great job of portraying Martin Brody. Everyone else does a great job too. Also, the movie is pretty good for being filmed in 1975. But I must say that this movie does have blood and is probably not suitable for kids under 12-13. However, you can be the judge of that as the movie itself is only rated PG. Still just be cautious about that.<br /><br />Now for the effects. I guess for a '75 film, they aren't that bad. But you can easily tell the shark is nowhere close to being realistic. It swims like a robot to me. You can be the judge on the shark. I guess you can give them a break for a '75 movie.<br /><br />So the bottomline for Jaws is that it's a good movie. It's not a sci-fi movie either. So if you hate watching sci-fi movies, you're in luck. If you enjoy this movie, you're in for a lot more Jaws movies. There's actually 3 more Jaws movies. So I recommend Jaws to you!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>"You're going to need a Bigger Boat..."<br />On February 11,2008, more than a month ago, Roy Scheider, the actor who said the famous line in this enduring classic monster film passed on to the next life. What better way to wrap up my horror "reviewing streak" than to pay tribute to one of the lead actors in the best monster film ever made. I will review this as a film made in 1975 and not in 2000, it would be unfair to review a classic as modern one.<br /><br />JAWS (1975) is the first film to reach the $ 100 million dollar mark, surpassing "The Exorcist" and even "The Omen". I've always said that the best horror films are the ones that hit close to home, with factors anyone can relate to. "Jaws" made a lot of people so afraid to go into the water. Masterfully directed by Steven Spielberg, based on Peter Benchley's novel which was inspired by the New Jersey Shark attacks of 1916 dubbed; "The Summer of Fear". The film is truly an enduring classic and such a phenomenon. It proves once again that you don't need demons, vampires, werewolves and boogeymen to induce a good scare.<br /><br />Amity Island is an isolated place where tourism is the townsfolk's bread and butter. Families on summer vacation go to Amity (means friendship?) to have a great time. A series of deaths that could have been committed by a huge shark threatens lives and the town's well-being alike. Chief Brody (Roy Scheider), with the aid of marine biologist; Matt Hooper ( Richard Dreyfuss) and a shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw) has to overcome bureaucracy, and their emotions to bring the 25 ft. monster down.<br /><br />Everyone knows the film's plot and premise, honestly, I've seen "Jaws" countless times. I first saw the film on television back in 1980 (too bad I was too young to see it in theaters); I was a child then. I can tell you that the film is so well-directed and effective that even an 8 year old could feel the chills and excitement. So what made "Jaws" so great? The haunting music, the feel of the unknown in the beginning, the well-rounded and interesting characters, and of course, the giant Great White Shark. The film was fated to be in the annals (yes, Chris, I said it again LOL) of excellent film-making; some of the awesome ingredients weren't done by intention. The shark wasn't seen in the first half because the mechanical model wouldn't work, who would think that this setback would prove to be the film's strongest gimmick? Thankfully, the filmmakers didn't give up and kept on with the production. Spielberg was in his twenties when he made the film, who knew that he would become one of the most renowned directors of our time? "Jaws" had the hand of fate working for it.<br /><br />The characters in "Jaws" are actually the ones who really carried the film. The performances by its cast headed by the trio of Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw "clicked" so well; viewers can easily form an attachment to them. Scheider is a cop who left the city for a small town to avoid the dangers of urban cop life; he hates the water and who figured that he'd come face to face with a 25 ft. shark? Dreyfuss is a marine biologist with a passion for sharks; he loves them and studies them relentlessly. He uses his own money to fund his research most of the time. The most interesting character for me is Quint, played by Robert Shaw; he's a shark hunter who seems loosely based on Moby Dick's Captain Ahab. Quint apparently had a traumatizing experience involving sharks during his tenure in the USS Indianapolis. All the lead characters have a link to the star of the film: "Bruce" the mechanical shark. Although "Bruce" may be a bit dated by today's standards, but trust me, this film is timeless, not because of its special effects, but the excellent script, direction and well-developed characters. Gosh, even the boat called "Orca" is a character in itself.<br /><br />Add the award-winning musical score by John Williams, the film definitely exudes intimidation. Obviously, Spielberg and Benchley had some disagreements on the script but everything worked so well that even though the film had major differences from the original book, I would easily forgive its differences from the source material. I truly thought that the film was made with care and creativity. There is no wasted moment in its proceedings, even the supporting characters carry a lot of depth.<br /><br />"JAWS" was so successful that it spawned 3 sequels and a lot of knock-offs such as "Orca The Killer Whale", the Italian spin-off; "Great White" a.k.a. "The Last Jaws", Tentacles, Piranha and many others. The film is definitely one of the most brilliant, defining moments in film. It is a timeless masterpiece, which will undoubtedly endure forever and make future generations afraid to go back in the water.<br /><br />It will forever be the measuring stick for all future monster films. `nuff said.<br /><br />HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION! [5 stars]<br /><br />This review is dedicated to Roy Scheider....</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I remember when I first saw Jaws and what an exciting experience it was.  The now all familiar pounding theme music, the head popping out of the hole in the boat, the shark cage attack, the spectacular demise of the shark, and always Quint!  What had dimmed after all these years was the wonderful first half of the movie on Amity Island.  Seeing the family sequences again, and the struggle that the Islanders had in coming to terms with the reality of this predatory shark and what it meant to their financial survival is really quite touching and painful.<br /><br />In the fine feature on the making of Jaws on the disk, Spielberg discusses how not showing the shark adds to the drama, but he also admits that the barrels had to substitute for the shark because the mechanical shark wasn?t working very well.  Frankly, I am glad it didn?t.  We see the shark just enough.  Implying the shark is supremely effective.<br /><br />While the main three characters, Brody (Scheider), Quint (Shaw), and Hooper (Dreyfuss), are so brilliantly played they have become immortal roles, there are many other fine performances that are overshadowed.  Lorraine Gary adds a wonderful reality to Brody family trying to fit in as newcomers to Amity Island trying to fit in.  I am glad they changed the character from the book.  Murray Hamilton as the small town mayor Larry Vaughn who is simply trying to keep the Island?s economy afloat and doesn?t grasp what is really happening until disaster has finally struck full force.<br /><br />The character roles of the fishermen and would-be fishermen are wonderful splashes of color on the film canvas and add humor to relieve tension and set up the second half confrontation so well.<br /><br />This is a superior film that has been imitated so often that we forget how good the original actually is.  This is a good disk with a good copy of the film and extras that help us appreciate how the film came to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg's second feature film (and one of his most challenging projects), Jaws was THE blockbuster event of 1975. Based on Peter Benchley's novel, this very effective thriller set box office records higher than any previous film....and made beachgoers ask themselves if that dip in the ocean was really necessary.<p>Screenwriters Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb (who also have roles in the movie) wisely jettison the melodramatic aspects of the source novel and focus on the core of the story. <p>It's summer in Amity, a sleepy Long Island town that depends on "summer dollars" from thousands of tourists who come to stay in seaside cottages (the summer dinks, they are called). When a young girl goes skinny dipping in the nearby sea and is fatally attacked by a shark, Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is coerced by the mayor and town council to keep the incident under wraps. He reluctantly does so, though he will regret it, for a few days later, the shark claims another victim, a young boy named Alex Kintner.<p>Finally convinced that there is a shark out there, Amity's politicians and citizens take action...but not wisely. When shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) bids for a contract to catch and kill the shark, the town elders "take it under advisement" and the shark hunt becomes a wild free-for-all seagoing circus.<p>When shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), called in by Chief Brody to help in the investigation and shark hunt, arrives and sees the shark (which he identifies as a tiger shark) caught by local fishermen, he examines the remains of the first victim. What he deduces is chilling: the deadly creature prowling out to sea is a great white shark.<p>Jaws is one of those rare movie adaptations that is better than its source novel. The screenplay is crisp and taut, yet with enough light moments and scenes of sometimes wry humor that ease the ever increasing tension, particular when Brody, Hooper and Quint set out to hunt the great white shark....becoming the hunted in the process. Spielberg, only 27 at the time, overcame the difficulties of shooting a movie on the water and dealing with a balky mechanical shark (nicknamed "Bruce"). Jaws also put composer John Williams on the map with movie audiences with his now-famous "shark motif" and would earn him his second Oscar for Best Score. <p>The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD is excellent. The movie is presented in letterbox format, and the sound and image are above average. The documentary on the making of the film is also first-rate. All in all, a must-get for Spielberg (and action film) fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Jaws was Stephen Spielberg's first hit and after his initial reluctance to release his movies on DVD, it finally makes its DVD debut.  We all know the story, a great white shark terrorizes the waters off of Amity Island. The  movie is based on Peter Benchey's best-selling novel.  This is one of the  rare instances where a movie is actually better than the book it was based  on.  In Mr. Benchey's novel, there is are some extraneous sections such as  an affair between Ellen Brody and Hooper that really don't add to the  story.  The movie streamlines the book and the changes made bringing it to  the screen actually improve on the book. The performances of three stars  are superb.  Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody as an everyman.  We can all  relate with him as he is just trying do his job and the right thing but is  caught in the middle.  He wants to close the beaches to catch the shark,  but the people he is protecting want them opened as the water is the source  of their livelihoods.  Richard Dreyfus adds some comic relief to the film  as the wise-cracking oceanographer, Matt Hooper.  The late Robert Shaw  takes what could have been a cartoonish role of the shark boat captain  Quint and turns him into an obessive, vengeful man in the mold of Captain  Ahab.  The real star of the film could be its score by John Williams.  The  music adds tension and fear to the suspense much like the music from  Psycho.  The DVD contains some extra material including deleted scences,  trailers and best of all a documentary on the making of the movie.  This is  a must see for all fans of the film.  We learn of all the problems the crew  experienced while filming on Martha's Vineyard, some original casting  choices and other behind-the-scences tidbits.  These are nice bonuses, but  the movie's first appearance on the DVD format is reason enough to buy it.  After 25 years, this movie remains a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>This movie is a credit to everyone associated with it, from the stellar  cast of actors and actresses to the direction by Steven Speilberg to the  original story (a novel) and screenwriting by Peter Benchley. This is a  riviting tale superbly told, with excellent cinematography and special  effects, and a scary soundtrack that builds the edge of mystery to a  crescendo each time it musically announces the shark's appearence.  <p>The idea for the movie is deceptively simple; a great white shark with a  fond taste for the sweet taste of human flesh is patrolling the water off  Amity Island (read Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard)and terrorizing the  summer tourist population. Inject into this some interesting and novel  subplots regarding a burned-out city cop and unlikely undersung hero, a  brainy, affable but basically misunderstood young marine biologist, and a  wonderfully crusty old mariner turned professional shark fisherman and you  have the recipe for an entertaining rollercoaster ride. <p>This movie is a  modern classic, one with a young Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and the  late  Robert Shaw. Watching their characters interact is an afternoon's  entertainment well deserved, one that is durable and repeatable. It also is  one that translates very well into the DVD mode. One caution; don't view it  anytime before going for your summer vacation. You may really be afraid to  go back into the water!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JDYUSI2RILEB.html">A2JDYUSI2RILEB</a><br/><p>The original summer blockbuster, Steven Spielberg's JAWS quickly became my favorite film growing up, having devoured it on VHS and on ABC's Sunday Night Movie presentation (the one with the added footage) so many times I could recite dialogue before I was out of grade school. Over the years I've been able to see it on the big screen (thanks to a visit with Lukas on Martha's Vineyard back in `96 or so), but despite that - and having reviewed numerous laserdisc and DVD releases over the years - only now with Universal's Blu-Ray edition do I feel like I've really, completely seen "Jaws." This is a spectacular HD presentation on every level and is sure to thrill fans of this classic 1975 screen adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestseller.<br /><br />There's not much I can say about the movie that hasn't been written or documented - from behind-the-scenes books to countless documentaries - since the film's 1975 release date. Spielberg's miraculous direction took advantage of every difficult production situation to create an all-time film masterwork that's always been as satisfying for its unforgettable characterizations, surprising humor and memorable atmosphere as it is a white-knuckle thriller about a great white marauding swimmers off the shores of Amity Island. As I write in my review of the terrific "Jaws: Memories From Martha's Vineyard" book a year ago, "Jaws" itself was a collaborative success, one that saw actors from Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw down to extras improvising their lines, giving the film a real, human center that we seldom see in modern filmmaking. The daily shooting schedule couldn't be mapped out all that far in advance since screenwriter Carl Gottlieb spent most nights working on the script with Spielberg - combined with our unpredictable and ever-changing weather here in southern New England, "Jaws" relied on the people making it so much that it's because of their efforts - as well as Spielberg who marshaled them all together - that the movie overcame its physical production struggles. In fact, had the movie not endured such a tumultous shoot, it's likely that "Jaws" never would've become the classic it did.<br /><br />Universal has produced a number of "100th Anniversary" Blu-Rays this year with remastered transfers - the results have ranged from superb to mediocre, but none have looked as brilliantly detailed as "Jaws." Restored from high-res 35mm original film elements, this is one of the most satisfying catalog releases the studio has produced on Blu-Ray to date: Bill Butler's cinematography is richly textured down to the finest detail, with warm colors and just a dazzling appearance that, even though I've watched the movie dozens of times, brings new background details to light with a clarity that I've never seen before in any format (there's also, thankfully, been no attempt here at "tweaking" the movie's color scheme like we've seen on too many BD releases over the years). The water has more depth, the Martha's Vineyard locations come into sharper focus, and just the faintest hint of some filtering is apparent on a transfer that is content to let the movie's natural cinematography speak for itself. It just looks phenomenal. On the audio side, viewers can select from the movie's original mono soundtrack as well as another, "rethought" 7.1 DTS MA stereo remix, both of which are more full-bodied than their DVD counterparts, though purists may still object to some of the alterations in the latter (i.e. the "new" gunshots at the end still sound closer to the controversial 5.1 DVD remix from a decade ago than they do the original mono recording; in other instances, though, the newer effects are much closer to the mono mix than the 2001 version. It's at least a noticeable improvement in that regard).<br /><br />Extra features are something of a letdown, mainly because they're almost all in non-anamorphic, 4:3 standard-definition and suffer from low bit-rates. The "Jaws Archives," for example, is comprised of direct screen captures from the laserdisc, many of which look blurry and should've been cleaned up for high-def. Ditto for the deleted scenes, which appear to be filtered and ported straight off the LD (and the DVD). The eight-minute "From The Set" segment includes candid footage of the production's first few days on-location in Martha's Vineyard. Included here is priceless footage of Carl Gottlieb falling overboard and into the icy, early May waters of the Atlantic -- all for the abandoned first attempt Spielberg made at showing the discovery of Ben Gardner's boat. It's a wonderful segment and it's a shame it doesn't go on longer than it does.<br /><br />Laurent Bouzereau's dry but essential two-hour documentary from the `90s Signature Collection laserdisc is back, and it's been complemented by "The Shark is Still Working," a 2007 labor of love doc from James Gelet, Jake Gove, Erik Hollander, and James-Michael Roddy that treads over ground previously traveled by numerous other behind-the-scenes docs, as well as profiles other aspects glossed over by them (such as an interview with Percy Rodriguez, who performed the voice over for the film's classic theatrical trailer). Unfortunately, the inferior visual presentation does no favors to the program, with heavy compression and "jaggies" present throughout its 103 minutes. Finally, the movie's original, primary theatrical trailer is also on-hand here, in a likewise poor, non-anamorphic standard-def presentation that's worse than its laserdisc appearance from years ago. Of course, given that the prior DVD didn't have trailers of any kind, it's at least an improvement in that regard (the movie's original teaser is a regrettable omission yet again).<br /><br />The sole new addition is an eight-minute look at Universal's restoration efforts on the picture, presented in HD, plus a digital copy and Ultraviolet copy. The disc is housed in a standard two-disc Elite case with one of Universal's nice 100 Years slipcovers; fans looking for more deluxe packaging ought to check out Best Buy's exclusive (though pricier) Digibook release, or the UK's Steelbook edition, which arrives in early September.<br /><br />Ultimately, Universal has done one of their crown jewels proud with a Blu-Ray that boasts one of the format's finest catalog transfers - not just from Universal, but any label. Spectacular! (</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Have you seen the film? If so, you'll recognize that line. This guy is scooping chum into the water to attract the shark, talking over his shoulder, and when he turns back to face the sea, the open maw of a giant white shark is all he sees, and the critter is about to take his arm off. He gives it that significant silent pause, then says, "Hey, guys? We're gonna need a bigger boat."<br /><br />It's SO PERFECT.<br /><br />I loved this film when I first saw it a billion yrs ago, back when the earth was cooling, and I love it still. It's about a big shark that these guys are stalking so their peaceful little tourist town can resume business as usual. But then things turn hairy and scary when they realize that, actually, the shark is stalking them. Benchley's original book is pretty faithfully rendered in Spielberg's screen version. Especially well done are the scenes that pit the scientists and level headed sheriff against the politicians who just want all this nonsense downplayed so they can start making money again.<br /><br />I slept just fine after watching it, but my husband had nightmares about sharks coming thru the bedroom walls all night for the next several nights, so...viewing discretion advised for those of tender sensibilities.

Bad idea!<br /><br />The excellent music composed by John Williams will always make me think of JAWS.<br /><br />The police chief, played by Roy Scheider is suspicious that it is a GWS but the mayor, of course doesn't want to believe him until it conclusive, which it is fairly soon.  The police chief wants to close the beaches, but that would costs too much in economic terms so he is vetoed.<br /><br />All-in-all an enjoyable movie, but not right before you go on vacation at the beach.<br /><br />Throughout the movie the GWS is anthropomorphized so that we / the movie makers give him almost human intelligence.<br /><br />Not recommended for anyone who wants to swim in the ocean.

Thus is one of the lines in this classic film with Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and others, in what has to be the best terror film of modern times.  Not in the slasher sense, but in the visceral sense, as this is all too real, and it still plays out on certain beaches of the world every year.  Of course now we have to watch out for crocodiles and their ilk, but overall, this is one of the best.  So hold on to your seat, and get the popcorn popping, and belt in for quite a ride.  You won't be disappointed!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>In the pantheon of all-time great horror and suspense films, JAWS is not merely a quarter-billion dollar box office blockbuster, but excellent cinema to boot.  From a popular novel by Peter Benchley, this quickly became a legendary film--and it's not hard to see why.  With Steven Spielberg as director, and a trio of leading men who give high-caliber performances, it's no wonder that this remains one of the top movies of its kind.<p>The film's plot is well known: Amity Island is beset by a series of attacks carried out by a mysterious Great White shark, and the powers-that-be don't want to cause a panic and destroy the summer tourism season.  Roy Scheider is Amity's police chief Martin Brody, whose calls to temporarily shut down the beaches until the shark can be killed are thwarted by a mayor (Murray Hamilton) and a town council more concerned with making bucks than saving people's lives.  Richard Dreyfuss is the shark expert who confirms the presence of a Great White in the local waters.  Robert Shaw is Quint, the local fisherman who is half-crazy from the start and just itching to have his own Moby Dick-like showdown.<p>When the shark causes a total panic on the beach on the 4th of July, it is up to these three men to hunt down the elusive fish.  But once out on the open water, these three hunters also become the hunted; at one point, the shark jumps out from the water, and frightens Scheider so much that he tells Shaw, famously: &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot;<p>After taking an endless pounding from the shark, Shaw's boat the &quot;Orca&quot; begins to flounder.  Shaw is eventually eaten whole by the shark, and Dreyfuss is temporarily lost under water.  It is up to Scheider, a man with a severe case of hydrophobia, to kill the shark.  He shoves a scuba tank into the fish's mouth, aims, fires, and blows the shark into a million pieces.<p>The making of JAWS was extremely arduous and difficult.  Spielberg was faced day after day with problems involving the mechanical shark that was used on location; the thing refused to function properly half the time.  The budget and schedule swelled to the point that Spielberg almost got fired.  Ironically, even though the shark was to be seen throughout the film, because of the technical problems, Spielberg resorted to the tried-and-true method of mere suggestion.<p>This turned out to be the smartest thing.  Now JAWS was no longer a standard-issue monster movie.  Like Spielberg's 1971 suspense masterpiece DUEL, it was now very much in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, specifically the Master's 1963 film THE BIRDS.  Spielberg's use of Hitchcock's suspense-building techniques, combined with the fine performances of Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfyss, helped to drive JAWS to the top of the box office charts and onto three Oscar wins: editing, sound, and John Williams' now-legendary, cello-driven score.<p>Although followed by three vastly inferior sequels and a lot of lousy imitations, JAWS has lost none of its gut-grabbing power.  It is essential viewing to this very day, especially for horror and suspense film buffs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just bought this DVD yesturday and I am very impressed.

Face it, few other  movies can match the intensity of the narrative, or the credibility of the  characters.  The shark, when it is finally seen, looks rather fake, but the  characters seem real and that is what sells this movie and makes it surpass  the likes of Armageddon. The scene where Brody (played by Roy Scheider) is  being mimicked at the dinner table by his youngest son, the scene where his  wife calms him down about yelling at his older son to get out of a boat,  only to change her mind after looking at a picture in a book Brody was  reading, the scene where 2 fishermen hook a roast &amp; throw it off a dock  to get more than they bargained for, all are strong examples of the  verissimiltude that this movie carries with it.<p>But along with the  characters this movie also boasts scientific accuracy, at least as much as  will be permitted to let the plot function.  Territoriality, for example,  is a theory that has been applied to sharks, but there has also been  evidence to suggest that it is inaccurate.  In general, sharks do not  develop a taste for human flesh.  However, the anecdotes of the shark  experts ring true, &amp; provides insights of their different  personalities--Hooper chuckling over how a shark ripped apart his first  boat &amp; how it fascinated him vs. Quint's chilling narrative of The  Indianapolis.  <p>The picture has never been clearer than on this dvd (I  keep odd hours &amp; have roommates, so I must keep the volume down &amp;  therefore will not rate the audio quality)  The documentary is likewise  terrific &amp; makes up for the lack of audio commentary.  Some of the  deleted scenes were used in network broadcasts of the movie, others look  like alternate takes of scenes.  All in all, the only thing I found mildly  disapointing about this movie were the bloopers.  We only get 2.<p>But  still, it's Jaws, the most exciting movie released this year (excepting  North-by-Northwest) whether it be the movie theater or video. And a  quintessential popcorn muncher.  See it before you go into the water.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Steven Spielberg<br /><br />Cast:  Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton, Carl Gottlieb, Jeffrey Kramer, Susan Backlinie.<br /><br />Running Time:  124 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<br /><br />"Jaws" is the original summer blockbuster, setting the standard by which all others are measured. It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another "Jaws", simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.  Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, "Jaws" centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody (Roy Scheider in the most underrated performance of his career); a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins (Susan Backlinie) are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack (Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.  Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an ichthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.<br /><br />Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure. Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis, where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds, is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film.<br /><br />'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character.  That said the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.  The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark; by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.  "Jaws" succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>My favorite all time movie with an incredible DVD presentation !

But Spielberg was there first with Jaws, an exciting adventure film about a great white shark terrorizing a small, seaside town that scared the crap out of millions of people the year it came out. The movie was a bonafide phenomenon, becoming the first one to ever surpass $100 million at the box office.<br /><br />Jaws holds up today because it is an adventure film that doesn't rely solely on exciting action sequences. Its foundation is a strong story and engaging characters with memorable dialogue (most notably the famous monologue that Quint delivers with chilling intensity). More importantly, we care about what happens to these characters and that is something a lot of Jaws imitators failed to copy successfully. Spielberg and co. essentially created a contemporary monster movie that works so well because it plays on a primary fear of being in the water and not having control of one's environment (i.e. drowning). As a result, Jaws has aged well over three decades while its numerous sequels and imitators have not.<br /><br />When Jaws was released on DVD to commemorate its 25th anniversary it was heavily criticized for including a truncated version Laurent Bouzereau's excellent feature-length Making Of documentary. For the 30th anniversary they've rectified this situation but unless you're a devotee it's not really worth the double-dip. Gone from the previous version is the trivia game, the Shark World documentary, the trailers and the screen saver so completists might want to hold on to their old discs.<br /><br />On the first DVD are 13 minutes worth of deleted scenes and outtakes. There is more footage of the crime scene of the first shark attack and a nice bit where Quint playfully mocks some poor kid for playing a clarinet in a music store.<br /><br />New to this edition is "From the Set," a profile on the movie done on location. A British film crew follows a young Spielberg around and interviews him, providing an interesting snapshot of the then up-and-coming filmmaker.<br /><br />The second DVD features the real reason to purchase this edition (aside from the excellent movie, of course), a two-hour retrospective documentary restored to its full glory. It covers all the usual bits: the mechanical shark that rarely worked, the mercurial presence of Robert Shaw, the source of Quint's famous monologue, and so on. This is a fascinating, in-depth look at how Jaws came together, the challenges that a young Spielberg faced and the eventual phenomenon that developed as the film thrilled audiences all over the world.<br /><br />Also included are galleries of storyboards by Tom Wright, production photos taken on location, and movie posters and ads from all over the world.<br /><br />Finally, there is an attractive 60-page photo journal with glossy stills and quotes from cast, crew and the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>No need to review this amazing 37 year old movie. What I will touch on is the Blu-ray video and sound quality. In a word, "amazing." Folks, this Jaws Blu-ray release is what Blu-ray is all about. The *only* way you would know this is a 37 year old movie is by the outfits and hair styles, because the picture quality really is that stunning. This transfer was obviously a labor of love, as it's perfect. If only every older Blu-ray release had that kind of attention to detail for their Blu-ray transfers. The restoration is so amazing, that it is almost like watching the movie for the first time again. My equipment is pretty low tech (Panasonic DMP-BDT220 and Vizio E371VL) and the movie looks and sounds absolutely incredible. I can't imagine how much more incredible it would look on a high-end plasma or LED large screen tv, through a 7.1 sound system. Someday when I decide to spend the money, I will upgrade my tv and purchase a 7.1 sound system, and when I do, this version of Jaws will be the first movie I play through it.<br /><br />I purchased my copy at Fry's Electronics for $17.99, lower than Amazon's price. The movie is well worth the asking price, but in addition to the best looking/sounding Jaws ever, you also get some really wonderful extras, with one of the most interesting (in my opinion) being Jaws: The Restoration, which is an in-depth look at the time consuming process of restoring the movie to Blu-ray quality. Really neat stuff. The Making of Jaws 2-hour documentary is also wonderful.<br /><br />Really, Universal and all involved in the Blu-ray release of Jaws deserve major accolades for making sure the transfer was done right. As important a movie Jaws is in the lexicon of motion pictures, it deserved no less than a perfect transfer, and that's what it got. Buy it today, and behold the power of Blu-ray!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>Okay, here we have a film released in 1975 that scared the pants off of me and made me jump out of my seat, completely blowing my cool in front of a 1st date.  Amazed that she hung around for a 2nd date.  I have the previously released Jaws on Standard Def with DTS 5.1 audio which I thought was pretty decent.<br /><br />I guess I didn't know what I was missing and though it went against my frugal nature, I paid full pop for this new Blu Ray release.  The video transfer to Blu Ray is just about the best you can or will find anywhere and is completely demo worthy.  The details in each frame, the coloration of the entire movie are totally outstanding.  Even the extra which documents the reproduction of Jaws onto Blu Ray was interesting and informative.  Deleted scenes, outtakes, making of and many more extras are included.  A DVD SD copy is included which I haven't viewed and probably will not though I am sure the color correction and clarity are probably amazing for Standard Def fans.<br /><br />The audio is now DTS 7.1 and though some might disagree,  I would not say that the audio is demo worthy for anything other than excellent clarity and a broad soundstage across the front 3 channels.  Except for the underwater scenes and a few other foley effects, the rear surrounds are not really used very much as discreet channels.  The chaos on the beach could have easily used the rear channels some more,  Never the less, Universal wanted to stay true to the original release and I understand why the rears were not employed very often.  I am just saying that if I want to show off the audio section of my home theater, I would not use this release.  My home theater is fairly esoteric and hi end and audio is something I am always aware of.<br /><br />In some ways, Universal has cut its own throat.  If they can reproduce such an old movie resulting in a film better seen on this release than they saw originally in the theaters, then there is no excuse for such sloppy releases of old movies that are being  transferred to Blu Ray.  Universal.....if you can do it here, you can do it for any of your films.<br /><br />A great release, a must release.<br />Hopefully, this review has been helpful, and if so, click on that help button so I know I am on the right track.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>I was reluctant to watch "Jaws" at first, due to the fact that most movies made prior to the nineties are pure cheese and corn.  I was happily surprised with Jaws, however, which was consistently entertaining.  The characters were likable and the dialogue was rich and humorous, heavy in sea-captain lingo.  Much of the dialogue may be hard to understand without a prior understanding of marine life, but all in all it's an easy movie to follow.<br /><br />There was more gore in the movie than I expected, but it made everything realistic.  Many of the scenes from this movie have, rightfully, become famous and have been repeated (and/or parodied) many times.  This movie does everything it's supposed to.  You root for the good guys, and boo the shark (and the mayor).<br /><br />On a side note, the Amazon Editorial Review got a significant detail wrong:  They mistakenly think the movie takes place is Long Island, but it truly occurs in Massachusetts, close to Boston.  The town is called Amity Island and it takes place by the water, so it's easy to see how that can be confused, but there are multiple references to living by Boston in the movie and how badly the family misses New York.<br /><br />All in all, the three main characters are different, memorable, likable, and have everything that it takes to make a trio of flawed but stalwart heroes.  Bravo.<br /><br />9/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>It's interesting to watch how the career of Steven Spielberg, arguably the greatest director working today, has evolved.  In his second feature film, Spielberg seems to have taken his cues from the master, Alfred Hitchcock, most notably "The Birds".  On what was probably a limited budget and limited technology of the time, Spielberg elicits enough scares to put today's CGI driven film-makers to shame.  Spielberg utilizes cinematography, film-editing, and most effectively a great John Williams score to maximum effect.  Spielberg was also blessed with the perfect cast in Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfus.  Murray Hamilton even gives a good performance as the mayor who would sacrifice vacationers for the all-mighty dollar.  One of the more effective scenes in the film is the one where Robert Shaw as Quint, the shark-hunter, relates the story of the crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis.  I never read the book on which this was based but it was my understanding that it was kind of trashy.  If that's the case then Spielberg has elevated trash into gold.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Nearly perfect movie, preserved to perfection on DVD for your collection!  The bonus features have some nifty moments, altho' no great revelations for afficiandoes.<br /><br />Definitely a must-own for film buffs; like you need an excuse to watch it again!<br /><br />My only regret is that there is no commentary track...  I can't believe with all this film gave to those involved that they didn't want to contribute more to the DVD than release the usual EPK interviews.  Too bad!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AY3EV2MFRFGG.html">A3AY3EV2MFRFGG</a><br/><p>Nothing else has had quite the effect on me as this movie.  To me it is nearly perfect, a well crafted monster movie that seems to effortlessly invoke a sense of phobic terror whenever anyone gets anywhere near, much less in, the water.  Although Roy Scheider is a delight as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss engaging as Matt Hooper, it is the larger than life characterization of Quint by Robert Shaw that owns the movie.  Mattey's Mechanical Shark isn't half bad either, although it's constant malfunctions kept it off camera for most of the movie.  A happy accident that only served to increase the film's already considerable power.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, by all means do so asap.  They just do not make monster movies better than this.  An essential action/monster movie for any film buff's library.<p>The disc is nearly as good as the movie.  It contains numerous deleted scenes, outtakes, storyboards, and trailers.  Too bad the incredible making of documentary has been cut to about an hour in length from its original two hour running time.  Perhaps some day MCA will do another box set special edition for the DVD release and offer the restored documentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>Who doesn't know that all too familiar theme music? You could be in a shopping mall somewhere and you hear that low-pitched string instrument playing its evil lament... Images of a ravenous shark devouring unsuspecting swimmers are going to be evoked.<br /><br />The movie is timeless and is a prime example of a good scare without being TOO bloody. For its time, of course, this was a rather gory film, but by today's standards (With Scream and Saw and all those movies) this one is tame by comparison.<br /><br />But blood and guts aside, this movie is just downright frightening!<br /><br />Like the tagline says... "Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water..."<br /><br />There's nothing like the feeling of helplessness and JAWS plays on that feeling of helplessness all too well!<br /><br />Not really sure there is anything on this disk that makes it worth a "special edition" but the movie itself is worth the price I paid!</p></br><a href="../users/A1B8HI3VREI1H3.html">A1B8HI3VREI1H3</a><br/><p>Jaws(1975) is a classic Steven Spielberg movie based on the suspense novel by Peter Benchley. Sheriff Brody(Roy Scheider), shark hunter Quint(Robert Shaw), and marine biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) hunt a shark that's preying on people near Amity Island. Jaws was a critical and commercial success and it spawned three sequels. The filmmakers put most of the emphasis on the shark while the novel had many subplots. Hooper had an affair with Martin Brody's wife in the novel. In the Jaws movies, Ellen Brody is a more sympathetic character. The scene where "Chrissie" is killed by a shark while swimming was spoofed in Steven Spielberg's 1941(1979)! Jaws has been spoofed in movies and TV shows. There's a Jaws spoof in the 1976 Hong Kong comedy Mr. Funny Bone(Lo Fu Ji). A boy wears a Jaws T-shirt in Picardia Mexicana(1978). Jaws was ripped off in Great White(1981) and Shark Attack 3(2001). John Williams' music score for Jaws is a classic in itself. Jaws(1975) is a classic Hollywood movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>I needn't evaluate the merits of the first great summer blockbuster; Jaws is a tremendous film, far superior to most of the extravagant productions that Hollywood studios produce for general audiences these days. I'm happy to see that this edition looks and sounds so good. Its print is clean, but by no discharge of grain - it looks like film, and not as though it were shot yesterday. Colors are vibrant and the contrast is distinguished by those lovely natural hues that only good film stock can reproduce. The soundtrack is fine, also: I played this through tiny television speakers, my estimable stereo and a friend's absurdly expensive surround sound array, and it sounds great on all.<br /><br />The ominous expanse of the ocean - and the clanging buoy that marks the location of the story's first feeding - serve as the background of the main menu. Scene selections via menu are what you'd expect, nothing more or less. Captions for the hearing impaired are available in English, as are French subtitles. However, no Spanish subtitles are available, which seems a rather severe omission in my opinion.<br /><br />Spotlight on Location featurettes are produced for inclusion on many of Universal's DVDs, but they're rarely as long or detailed as this one. Interviews with the principle cast and crew, exclusive footage of deleted scenes and a wealth of photographs all yield more than a few intriguing stories pertaining to Benchley's book, the trials involved with the film's grueling and technically demanding shoot and its record-breaking reception. One of the most interesting aspects of the screenwriting process involved Quint's unforgettable U.S.S. Indianapolis monologue, which was first scripted by Howard Sackler as a short paragraph, extended by John Milius and finally revised extensively by Robert Shaw shortly before he performed it. I usually don't care for behind-the-scenes featurettes, but this one is so well-edited and provided so much substantial information that I found myself enjoying it.<br /><br />Despite a few embarrassing exceptions, most of the deleted and alternate scenes are as ably shot and acted as anything retained for the theatrical cut. In a particularly humorous sequence, Robert Shaw harasses a young musician in an instrument retailer with the most overbearing variety of encouragement. As good as many of them are (a few provide some new perspective), the lot are ultimately extraneous, especially considering how lean the movie is at just over two hours. A couple of inadvertently amusing outtakes from two crucial scenes are also included.<br /><br />Absolutely enormous, this disc's production photo gallery is comprised of literally hundreds of photos of the cast and crew, equipment, settings and boats, as well as film stills, promotional photographs, advertisements, movie posters, lobby cards, book covers, articles concerning the film and quite a lot more. Most of these pictures are interesting, but their gallery's lack of navigational controls is a major flaw. That viewers can't scroll back and forth as they please is annoying, but we're also prohibited from fast-forwarding or rewinding through the selections. The gallery proceeds at a sluggish pace and will loop infinitely until the 'menu' button on your remote control is pressed. With a flexible interface, this feature could have been so much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Negligible though they are, the rest of this edition's features are pleasant enough. A cute trivia game allows the player to view footage from the film to aid them in selecting multiple-choice answers, and Shark World serves as a primer for basic information about the species. Oddly enough, the special features listed on the keep case's paper sleeve include theatrical trailers and a screen saver, both of which are absent.<br /><br /> Overall, this is quite a good DVD. I'd like to think that its few flaws were attended to for the production of the 30th Anniversary disc, but I haven't seen it. If not, maybe they'll get around to that when they release a 40th Anniversary Deluxe Edition. I'm not really joking.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>The New England island community of Amity is gearing up for the summer tourist season with high hopes.  The 4th of July weekend is rapidly approaching and the businesses are all eager for the dollars that will get them through another year.  And then a young woman goes swimming and gets ravaged by a shark.  The series of events that follows leads to police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) closing the beach and calling in oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to supply information that could help deal with the problem.  Finally, the two of them join the grizzled Captain Quint (John Shaw) on his boat to hunt the great white shark... but the hunters become the hunted.<br /><br />Jaws was a major blockbuster in its day and still holds up pretty well.  The acting is strong whether talking about the stars or the supporting cast.  John Shaw attacks his role with particularly gusto and the script offers him many of the best lines.  The story is a touch slow in some respects during the first half, but once Quint and company go out on the water, the tension builds quickly.<br /><br />The plot has its weaknesses, primarily the extreme stupidity of the nearly every human in the story.  The mayor and town council willfully ignore sign after sign that the beaches need to be closed turning the situation into a true bloodbath.  Yes, they were worried about money but setting up tourists to be slaughtered wouldn't do the community any good in either the long or short term.  Even Quint, largely shown to be savvy and shrewd, allows several feet of water to swamp his boat and does nothing to pump it out.  Then he recklessly, seemingly purposely, burns out his engines leaving the boat to founder helplessly.<br /><br />Jaws isn't perfect, but it is an enjoyable film.  It was one of the films that created the whole concept of summer blockbusters and those who haven't seen it should check it out just for its historical significance.  Beyond that, it's second half provides a suspenseful thrill ride as the struggle of man vs. shark unfolds.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This film invented the Summer blockbuster, however unlike some that have followed this is a classic movie. Directed by Spielberg and with a fantastic cast, how could it go wrong? What we tend to forget now, is that Spielberg in 1975 hadn't had a blockbuster yet, so this was not a dead cert for success. However I think word of mouth and the quality of the film soon guarenteed its place in history.<br /><br />Roy Scheider is the Police Chief who's convinced there is something in the water, but is confronted by town officials only interested in not spoiling the tourist season. Scheider gives us a quietly determined man, whereas Robert Shaw's performance as Quint, a grizzled fisherman, is loud, aggresive and energetic. Richard Dreyfuss completes a great trio of leading actors. The mixed chemistry between them is perhaps the strongest point in the film.<br /><br />The film won 3 Oscars, most noteably of course for John Williams evocative music score (which also won a BAFTA as well). If you weren't born in the 70's, the DVD gives you the chance to see a great film in widescreen 2.35:1 with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, which will be somewhat better than seeing the panned and scanned version frequently shown by many channels. A great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Who could even dip a toe in the water without thinking of Jaws? This movie will endure generations of action/suspense movies no matter how advanced the special effects, and the film is still talked about on beaches by people of all ages. I still get chills when Quint relates the story of being surrounded by sharks and his buddies being taken, one by one, explaining his hatred of sharks. I've watched many scenes over and over and they just get better. There is a scene they cut out that I loved too where Quint torments a kid playing the clarinet. Buy the Anniversary edition and watch some of the features that had to be cut; there's some good stuff there. I watch this DVD at least once every three months...<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>In 1975 "Jaws" was a phenomenon. The one theater in Colorado Springs that was playing "Jaws" had lines for every showing for weeks and the movie was in the theater for months.<br /><br />The opening moments of this movie became the standard for hosts of low-budget gore-fests to follow, completely missing the style and drama of this movie. Our introductory characters are doing what all young adults do, partying and having fun, never imagining the menace lurking...just...below...the water. The music begins, with the characteristic sequence used by millions to enhance completely unrelated water-cooler conversations; menacing, sending chills up your spine, it's that SHARK MUSIC! Dozens of cheap horror movies have tried without success to copy the opening, yearning to set the stage for the supposed horror to come.<br /><br />In its own way, this movie combines the drama of "The Old Man and the Sea," with far more action, and the thrill of a well-done monster movie. This movie, while involving a host of protagonists, is ultimately a battle between Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and a great white shark, which represents not only itself, but all Brody's personal demons.<br /><br />It is amazing that a mechanical shark could generate such terror. Watching how the movie was made, it's relatively easy to see that the shark was mechanical. Stephen Spielberg used clever camera work in combination with the intensity of each shark appearance to keep your focus on the story and being held in suspense, completely ignoring whatever flaws there may have been in his excellent mechanical monster. Furthermore, the shark inspires fear not by crude use of blood and entrails being swallowed or floating in the water, but by frothy water and its sudden, yet anticipated, appearances, with a bit of red-coloring to bring out your worst fears.<br /><br />What enhances the terror of the shark attacks is that they occur at a public beach where millions journey each year. Shark experts Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) provide all sorts of true information regarding sharks to give you the picture that they are mindless killing machines (though that is an extreme exaggeration). The audience knows what is coming and yet the innocents on the beach insist on throwing themselves into harm's way.<br /><br />The final sequence in the movie is excellent and provides an inexorable buildup to the climax, fast yet slow. This sequence also provides what is probably the goriest portion of the movie. In the end, as in many dramas, the battle is between Chief Brody and the antagonist, the shark. Can Chief Brody conquer his fears? How will he do it? The suspense is just killing me! Here comes the SHARK!!! LOOK OUT!!!<br /><br />This movie is still suspenseful and well worth watching more than 30 years after its release. One of the best monster movies ever, and just enough basis in reality to be considered a drama as well. Five stars for a movie you can watch over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>Jaws is one of those instant classics that affect anyone who watches it in any new generation. Just watch, 20 years from now people are going to be just as scared as they were 31 years ago. The movie is what TRUE horror movies are, with the Alfred Hitchcock style of not really seeing the blood and gore during most of the movie, as well as terror and suspense at an all time high.<br /><br />When a young woman's remains wash up on a beach by a Long Island town named Amity, the only person who suspects something more sinister than a boating accident is the chief of police [played by Roy Scheider. He thinks it was a shark, and the only person who believes him is a shark expert [played by Richard Dreyfuss]who concludes that it is a Great White who is responsible.<br /><br />Instead of listening to the warnings to shut the beaches down, the mayor of the town continues to hold them open. After all, the next day is the Fourth of July, and they really can't shut the beaches down on the biggest tourist attraction event of the year can they?<br /><br />So the beaches remain open and the worst happens. A young boy is attacked by a shark and killed. After several decisions and arguments on what to do, the one thing agreed on is that an expedition needs to hunt the shark down and kill it. In enters an old mariner named Quint [played by Robert Shaw] who leads the Sheriff and Shark Specialist in a hunt for the shark to kill it.<br /><br />The sequence on the boat during the second half of the movie is worth the price of the DVD alone. The three men realize that the shark is hunting them, instead of the other way around. Despite shooting at it, harpooning it, and even trying to drag it home, what happens in the end is what made people respect horror films for what real movie making is.<br /><br />As far as this "Speical Edition" goes, you're better off buying the normal DVD set because you're not missing much. A second disk with a 2 hour making of documentary is the same as countless TV specials I've seen over the years. Also the only thing worth checking out is the 40 page commemorative photo journal of the movie and the documentary.<br /><br />Besides that, if you havent seen the movie you have no idea what you are missing. Just be sure to go on that beach trip BEFORE watching the film, trust me...</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>Top-notch filmaker Stephen Spielberg spins a tale about a shark that is stalking the waters of Amity Island, a vaction spot for tourists. And this shark is HUNGRY!  It's up to a policeman and his friends to defeat this giant shark! Brilliant acting, lots of action, and a great musical score [ who could forget the "do-do-do-do" of the shark theme?] makes Jaws a pure classic. The bloopers are funny, too. [There's a blooper about a gun. The actor actually says the F-word!]<br /><br /> After you watch this film, you may never go into the water again, not even to take a bath! :)<br /><br />PS: For a funny Jaws parody, check this out: http://www.angryalien.com/0804/jawsbunnies.asp</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>This is another classic from my childhood, it was scary then, and so it is now. Perfect actors were cast for this movie, in fact I doubt the movie Jaws would have been as good as it actually is if it hadn't been for the "dreamtheme" Spielberg, Shaw, Scheider and the wonderful Dreyfuss. I adore these three actors in Jaws, and Spielbergs' directions is the early work of a genious in progress, you know, I find Jaws among Spielbergs' best work ever - the best before Schindlers' List (though very uncomparable) - and the hard work he and his collegues had to put themselves through making the movie (see "The making of..." : Special feautures) was definetively worth all their frustrations until the movie were finally ready for the theatres back in 1975, and in the years after on vcr and then finally on dvd.<br /><br />Jaws is a movie with soul. Unless it would have been old-fashioned long ago. But the action-adventure-thriller-elements behind the story captured on screen are so facinating and impressive and unlike anything else ever made, the effects are "simple" (like the barrels) but function extremely well, and still today - now that we have got all sorts of computer-animated-effect-monsters (call it whatever you want) - what I mean is that "Deep blue sea" (the movie) could never be compared to "Jaws". In my opinion it is too simple, though perhaps twice as expensive as Jaws ever was. And that probably because is a movie much more than just a horror movie about a great white shark. It is more "realistic" - and about a small Island-society turned upside dow and against eachother when the tragedy strikes their usually tourist-season-based beaches, and how the tragedy splits the towns' inhabitans in two sides when the question lingers on wether they should close their beaches and risk their tourist-reputations, or keep them open just for the sake of earning money. Anyway, the movie is still impressive, just as entertaining and loveable.<br /><br />I think Robert Shaw earned an Academy Award for his role in this project, a great actor.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>One of the legendary and most terrifying thrillers ever made, from the future director legend Steven Speilberg, is the first summer blockbuster.

I recently purchased this movie and watched it for the first time in years just to see if Speilberg's movie still had as intense effect on the screen as it did almost 30 years ago. The answer is: definitely. <p>This was the first in the line of &quot;blockbuster&quot; movies, and, unlike many that flop today, this is a movie that has stood the test of time. The story of a Long Island town that is terrorized by an enormous great white shark is done with great direction.It is a simple story really, but the action and acting are not overdone, and even for it's time, the movie is still has great quality.  There is not too much of the mystery surrounding the shark given away in the first half of the movie, and this creates a good build up of tension and suspense that this genre of movie needs. <p>The camera angles that are created add to the overall quality of the film. For instance, while Brody is on the boat we first get a glimpse of the sea from an overhead angle, and then a glimpse of the boat underneath. The suspense comes in waiting for the great white. Jaws is still a classic, and the kind of movie that you think about when you go to the beach and take your first step into the water.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8AO9XASQ15C.html">A1R8AO9XASQ15C</a><br/><p>Here is Steven Spielberg's best film, not surprising since it is also one of his earliest, a movie that reflects not only commercial savvy but artistic passion and a true love for the moviemaking process. This is Spielberg displaying as much virtuosity as Quentin Tarantino would later show in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill.&quot;<p>&quot;Jaws&quot; is quite simply one of my favorite films, probably among the top 5. I just picked up a copy of the DVD and watched the movie again for the 40th or 50th time. It is staggering, the quality of this film. Spielberg's direction has done more than withstand the test of time; it shames the work by today's less-talented studio hacks like Stephen Sommers, Michael Bay, et al. Framing, pacing, camera placement, and every other tool in the director's toybox works to tell the story and give us information, not only about the shark's whereabouts, but the characters themselves.<p>The characters, and the actors who play them, are the real magic of &quot;Jaws.&quot; The shark is a wonderful special effect, to be sure, one of the most effective movie villains ever, but Brody, Quint and Hooper are the real stars. Their conflicted interrelationships hold the story together -- after all, there is a lot of screen time given over to the dialogue among these three men, when the shark isn't even a blip on the radar. Spielberg had a lot of faith in the ability of his actors to compete with the special effects, a faith he does not display today (&quot;A.I.,&quot; anyone?). This is just one reason why &quot;Jaws&quot; continues to work so well after 30 years.<p>A masterpiece of blood and guts (Quint's death scene is still hard to watch), &quot;Jaws&quot; is also underrated as a character piece. What a great movie this is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>Where do you start? Benchley writes a bestseller. Young, relatively  unknown, mastermind director Spielberg directs. Support from a wonderful  cast: Roy Scheider (the town sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (the out of town  shark expert), and the late great Robert Shaw (the fisherman &amp; his  boat). This movie follows the book for the most part with the exception of  Hooper (Dreyfuss' character) living and not being a statistic at the  movie's end. Some memorable scenes... The opening scene of the first victim  taking a skinny dip at night, 2. a mother dressed in black talking to the  sheriff after her son fell prey to the shark, 3. Hooper almost gets eaten  while diving in the cage, 4. Quint (Shaw) meets his demise, and 5. Brody  kills the shark. Some memorable lines... Mayor Vaughn: &quot;We have caught  and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers.&quot;  Brody: &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot; Quint: &quot;The thing  about a shark, it's got lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When  it comes at you it doesn't seem to be livin'... until he bites you, and  those black eyes roll over white.&quot; Some tongue &amp; cheek humor mixed  in with high drama and suspense. The only drawback I saw with this movie  was the ending. I thought it was a bit corny at first. But after watching  the movie for about the 50th time I noticed that the book on sharks that  Brody is flicking through features a shark with a diver's tank in its  mouth. This movie is tied together very well - from beginning to end.  Awesome &amp; ahead of it's time. Essential in any movie buff's library.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>JAWS. No other name in Horror inspires more fear. Over thirty years later, JAWS has proven to be one of the most terrifying film-going experiences of all-time, leaving behind a profound social impact and a permanent imprint on pop culture. It has become cliche for film fans to claim JAWS as being the scariest movie they have ever seen, but few other entries have ever come close to generating the same levels of tension, gut-wrenching horror, and suspense. JAWS is a masterpiece in the cinematic medium that reshaped the Horror genre for decades to follow.<br /><br />"You yell 'Barracuda,' everyone says 'Huh? What?' You yell shark... we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July." -Mayor Larry Vaugh<br /><br />JAWS taps into a raw, primordial fear of the unknown. The endless depths of the ocean hidden under its glassy surface could conceal any number of unseen horrors. Unlike in THE WOLF MAN or DRACULA, where victims came face to face with the monsters in some far away village set apart from reality by time and space, JAWS brings terror to the surface in our daily lives. As we find out in two of the earliest sequences, a trip to the beach can turn into a nightmare in seconds, as nature's apex predator strikes without warning or provocation. The viewers, much like Amity's beach-going vacationers, are given no hints as to the horrors they are about to experience, but for an arrangement of strings that are enough to send anyone's heart racing.<br /><br />"Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies. Farewell and adieu you ladies of Spain." -Quint<br /><br />If any single example had to be chosen to prove the importance of a musical score on the overall effectiveness of a film, it is John Williams' award-winning work in JAWS. No other film score has resonated so powerfully with audiences. From the exhilarating "One Barrel Chase" during the high-seas game of cat-and-mouse, to the ominous strings of the title theme, the music in JAWS accounts for half of the film's success, driving an emotional response from the audience in each of the most vital sequences.<br /><br />"You know those eight guys in the fantail launch out there? Well, none of 'em are gonna make it out of the harbor alive." -Hooper<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw, and Roy Scheider provide the defining performances of their collective careers, while establishing three of the most iconic film heroes in the genre. They are honest portrayals of rounded and fundamentally human characters, complete with a wide range of emotions and flaws. Even the noble and selfless Chief Brody suffers from his personal struggle with alcohol throughout the film, while Quint's crass conduct has kept him ostracized from the people of Amity. The supporting characters and nameless beach-goers each contribute infinitely to the film's impact as well, adding small but memorable movie moments attributable to individuals that don't even share a line of dialog. What dialog and exchanges that do carry through from the script are simply brilliant, leaving behind an endless supply of quotable lines that have had a lasting effect on pop culture to this very day.<br /><br />"You're gonna need a bigger boat." -Chief Brody<br /><br />JAWS moves far beyond the boundaries of any one genre, combining elements of action, adventure, drama, and horror, with light touches of humor to offset the otherwise frightening mood. It is not a proven classic because of a few scary scenes with a man-eating shark, but for the exceptional acting and filmmaking that went in to the production. Commenting on the physical direction and cinematography of the picture would literally require a master's thesis to fully examine the work that went in to making this film a success.<br /><br />Spielberg is not unlike a magician with the camera, a master illusionist who frequently uses misdirection to set up each of the most terrifying moments. What sets him apart from so many other directors is his close attention to detail and the subtle nuances he instills in his films. A key example of this can be found in a brief but highly effective shot taken in the police station, where Chief Brody is filling out the Death Certificate for Christine Watkins. Spielberg cuts close, focusing on the typewriter, as Brody hammers in the the death tolls that spell out "Shark Attack" under the cause of death.<br /><br />"This shark, swallow you whole." -Quint<br /><br />Through creative framing and dialog, Spielberg drops many hints as to the final outcome of the film. As Quint, Hooper, and Brody depart on their gallant quest, the camera trails the Orca through a set of shark jaws Quint has hanging in an upstairs window of his workshop. This clearly signifies that our heroes are venturing out into the jaws of the beast, and foreshadows what is to come. Watching closely, a meteor shower can also be seen aboard the Orca in one of the night scenes, a wonderful touch that also proves that this is a fateful journey. For Quint, fate may not have worked in his favor, but it is only fitting that he should be taken in the same manner as his fallen friends and fellow soldiers aboard the USS Indianapolis.<br /><br />"Cage goes in the water, you go in the water. Shark's in the water. Our shark." -Quint<br /><br />What would JAWS be without a 25-foot Great White shark hungrily prowling the beaches of Amity Isle? The shark (aptly named 'Bruce' after Spielberg's lawyer) actually plays a comparatively small (though pivotal) role in the overall scope of the picture, as its presence remains implied for the majority of the run time. And yet, the shark tends to be the one thing for which the film is most fondly remembered. This isn't hard to imagine, as the shark's jarring arrival late in the film has shocked new viewers since its original theatrical release. Its stiff, rubbery appearance is completely forgotten due to the effectiveness in which the giant puppet is used. Though the shark may not resemble the exact features of a Great White, its stylized design, prominent dorsal fin, and gaping jaws are what most people think of when they hear "Shark!"<br /><br />"Smile you son of a bitch!" -Chief Brody<br /><br />JAWS is a study in film and storytelling, of character archetypes, of modern myth. It is a triumphant achievement that will be looked upon for centuries to come by creating fear in its purest form through the lens of the camera. Its influences on Horror cinema in the decades that followed are unmistakable, spawning countless imitations and sequels. One thing is for sure: JAWS kept people out of the water.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>With JAWS, Steven Spielberg burst upon the Hollywood scene, coincidentally inventing the summer blockbuster (for a while it was the highest-grossing film in history, breaking the $100 million mark), and laying the predicate for a whole series of wildly successful science fiction/adventure films that dominated the late 1970s and early 1980s, films like the STAR WARS trilogy, the STAR TREK series, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, E.T., RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and its sequels, a slew of uneven remakes of 1950s classics, and a host of less-than-memorable gadget-monster knock-offs.<br /><br />Lest you wonder, JAWS is sci-fi: A trio of intrepid explorers/monster hunters (Quint, Hooper and the Chief) travel to an alien world (the ocean) to take on a supernormal sentient beast (the shark) which has been threatening Earth (in this case, the fictional Amity Island).<br /><br />Just as trivia: JAWS the novel takes place on the South Shore of Long Island in a town called Amity; this brought notoriety to the real South Shore town of Amityville, notoriety which was confirmed with THE AMITYVILLE HORROR a few years later.<br /><br />Luckily for Spielberg, JAWS was and still is a wonderful entertainment experience, belieing its history of horrendous cost overruns and production problems, a history which would have sunk Spielberg's career before it ever started, had JAWS been less successful.<br /><br />We never get to see the shark until the third reel; however, John Williams' classic "Da-dum da-dum da-dum" theme is familiar enough a part of popular culture to make swimmers look around nervously 'til today. It's a character in itself.<br /><br />Robert Shaw turns in a masterful performance as Quint, the salty, snarly, obscene Ancient Mariner come to life. Richard Dreyfus plays Matt Hooper, a college-boy ichyologist caught up in a hilarious contest of machismo with the barnacled Quint, in which the two crush beer cans (Quint) and styrofoam cups (Hooper), trade barbs (literally and figuratively) as the hunt goes on, and eventually bond in their shared Ahabian quest against the shark. The Buddy Film quality of JAWS is immortal.<br /><br />Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody, the seafearing New York cop who always wants a bigger boat. Every sailor knows the scat dialogue, "Get away from that radio!" never actually shouted by Quint as he smashes his marine radio to bits after the nervous, completely-out-of-his-element Brody calls mayday after just seeing the shark for the first time.<br /><br />Murray Hamilton turns in the best performance of his career as the gregarious, disbelieving Mayor Larry Vaughan, who refuses to accept that his town has become a seafood buffet, albeit from the wet side of the tide line. His doubt nearly consumes him. It DOES consume several of his constituents.<br /><br />Quite possibly one of the ten best films of all time, JAWS entertains immensely even a third of a century later.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>This review is not a critique of Universal's questionable DVD marketing strategies.  I only bought this summer's "Special Collector's 5th Anniversary Edition of the Last DVD Release" version of "Jaws" because... well, five years ago, I bought the 25th anniversary edition of "Jaws" on VHS.<br /><br />*crickets chirp*<br /><br />At any rate, having previously seen most of the specials features on this set courtesy of the electronic miracle of the video cassette player, I didn't spend a lot of time on the added extras.  I bought "Jaws" on DVD because it's "Jaws".  On DVD.  And I didn't have it before.  True, I'd have preferred some sort of text trivia track, or a cast and production crew commentary, even if Spielberg wasn't going to contribute.  Surely there were some audio interviews with Robert Shaw that could have been located and incorporated?<br /><br />The movie itself remains one of my enduring favorites, even though I discovered it relatively late, through repeat airings on Turner basic cable in the mid to late '90s.  "Jaws" is atypical for a blockbuster in that the second half of the movie is basically a stage play with a cast of two scenery-chewing masters, a mechanical shark, and Roy Scheider.  Witness (several times) the nine-minute sequence set in the cabin of the Orca, which begins with Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw comparing scars... then transitions to Shaw's captivating speech about the U.S.S. Indianapolis (which he reportedly wrote himself)... followed by a slightly drunken sing-along... interrupted by a shark attack in mid-chorus.  Spielberg was only 26 when he filmed this, and it's easy to see why he stuck around.<br /><br />The first half of the movie has almost no relation to the last, but even in different tempo, Spielberg captures the bucolic intensity of Amity Island with a master's attention to detail.  In any other film, Murray Hamilton would have stolen the show as the earnest, buffoonish, soon-to-be-deflated mayor who insists on keeping the beach open even after two people are dead.  And even in the midst of the comic actions of the islanders, Spielberg still pushes Ben Gardner's disembodied head through a boat hull when the audience least expected it (and repeated the trick 20 years later with Samuel L. Jackson's arm in "Jurassic Park").<br /><br />While Lorraine Gary is given a bit of a thankless role, and drops out of the movie halfway through, it's amazing that she had time to make an impression at all, what with Shaw and Dreyfuss trying to outdo each other in every scene -- both successfully.  And even though the nominal hero, Roy Scheider, seems to be lagging 15 seconds behind Shaw and Dreyfuss (watch the cabin sequence again and see how passive he makes Chief Brody), he still saves the day when Shaw's working-class fisherman act and Dreyfuss's hi-tech gadgetry both fail to stop the great white.<br /><br />It's great to see "Jaws" still kicking hard 30 years later, in the way that "War of the Worlds" probably won't do in 2035.  From the recent "MythBusters" special on "Jaws", which even took time to debunk the deleted scene with Shaw buying piano wire... to Bryan Singer's effortless rehabilitation of Scheider's nonsense line, "That's some bad hat, Harry", I would find myself watching "Jaws" on DVD even if the Special Edition had nothing on it but the movie.<br /><br />Even so, put together that audio commentary so I can buy the Commemorative 5th Anniversary Edition of this current release in 2010.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>What an awesome movie.  The music, the cinamatography, the acting, and the effects.  This film is a movie unlike no other.  It is not an all out horror film, not a all out drama, and not even an all out comedy, it's just &quot;Jaws.&quot; A fair adaption from Peter Benchley's terrifying best seller, Jaws was the first of the summer blockbusters, earning $100,000,000 at the box office.  Okay, the effects may not be Lord of the Rings worth, but let's face it, it was 1973.  Other movies previously before Jaws delivered the shock horror value without brilliant effects (example: The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) The film is definately a cinematic classic, with a eye-popping opening, and a edge of your seat ending.  See this film!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>JAWS was not just another summer release in 1975. It was a phenomenon! I remember the absolute mania surrounding this Spielberg classic. People were suddenly terrified to swim in the ocean or even in lakes. You couldn't go anywhere without getting into a conversation about this movie. I saw it at the theater and was mesmerized. Here was Moby Dick for the modern age. A monster shark, intent on feasting on the inhabitants of tiny Amity island has begun snacking on swimmers. A local sherrif named Brody (Roy Scheider) slowly realizes that it's a much bigger problem than just a few random shark attacks. Enter Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) the marine expert, who first shows the seriousness of what they are dealing with. Meanwhile, the mayor has decided that there's nothing to worry about. He's more concerned with the thousands of tourists who will be arriving at the beaches for Labor Day weekend, and the money they will spend. Several deaths later, a local fisherman named Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to hunt down and kill the beast for a price. This brings Brody, Hooper, and Quint together for the greatest water adventure filmed to that point. It's man vs. Great white in a struggle for survival and supremacy. Not to mention the battle of wills between our three unlikely heroes. JAWS is a genuine masterpiece of suspense and horror. Please, steer clear of the godawful sequels, as they stinketh like so much chum...</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>This movie is a classic and the mother of all sea animals vs. humans.  Sure there has been movies about killer whales, big snakes and other movies with sharks and also other &quot;JAWS&quot; movies but the first movie will always be regarded as the best out there right now.  <p>This 25th Anniversary DVD was one of the most highly anticipated DVD's out there.  Of course, there was a debate because although the movie won an Academy for best sound, purists cried foul when they heard the movie would be released in DTS and Digital Dolby instead of Mono.  Well, I prefer to watch my DVD's in the best sound as possible including this movie and thus the DTS version is the way to go.  You literally feel that you are swimming in the beach with the splashes heard all around you.  It's awesome!  So, the audio is great and the movie looks pretty good despite the fact that it has been 25 years.<p>Also, this DVD is packed!  You get the documentary of &quot;The Making of Jaws&quot;, deleted scenes, outtakes, storyboards and so much more that this DVD will keep you busy for the weekend.<p>A highly recommended DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A17NFLRFTMYXF5.html">A17NFLRFTMYXF5</a><br/><p>Roy thinks of the shark:<p>&quot;We will need a bigger boat&quot;<p>An A-bomb might help</p></br><a href="../users/A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1.html">A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1</a><br/><p>** This is a review of the BD/DVD 100th anniversary edition **<br /><br />I don't know where to start.<br /><br />The digital restoration is amazing, especially in regards to Bruce (the shark). The feature AND most of the extras are all in 7.1 sound. The BD is slammed full of special features covering everything from the musical score, extras, interviews, and all sorts of chum in the waters. There are more than two HOURS of bonus material, but alas: no commentary. Dollar for dollar, quote for quote, this is the version a true JAWS fan wants. Everything else is left wanting.<br /><br />The Shark Still Works, and it looks great!</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>A few years ago, I and a few thousand other laserdisc fans plopped down  $150.00 and change for the super duper Signature Collection version of JAWS  on laserdisc.  It came with all the extras: -- bonus footage, outtakes,  interviews, marketing goodies, the CD soundtrack, novelization, and a few  other bells and whistles.  Now, some 4 or 5 years later, you lucky DVD  owners can get basically the same thing, minus the soundtrack and  paperback, for a fraction of the cost.  AND IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!  If this isn't your favorite movie, I'd be rather curious to know what IS!  The TNT network has run this film many times over the last few years, and  the copy they show has been beautifully restored and the color  &quot;tweaked&quot; a bit.  So just think of how great the DVD version is  gonna look!  And sound! Granted, and by Spielberg's own admission in the  laser's and DVD's accompanying interview footage, JAWS turned out as well  as it did almost by happy accident.  Spielberg initially was counting on  getting a great deal more footage of the mechanical sharks in the film, but  it was not to be (as a few humorous production stories in the interviews  will attest).  So JAWS had to take on a rather Hitchcock-ian feel instead  --  &quot;less is more&quot;, if you will.  Precious little shark footage  until the third act, and virtually every usable piece of mechanical shark  footage that was shot wound up in the film.  So it begs the question:  Is  JAWS as great a film as it is IN SPITE of itself?  Probably.  But who  cares?  Even if you are only a casual fan of this film, you owe it to  yourself to check out all the bonus features that come with this 25th  Anniversary set.  While not boasting as much bonus material as many other  DVDs have (THE ABYSS, ALIEN, the upcoming TERMINATOR 2 COLLECTOR'S  EDITION),  JAWS does have the advantage of being a very big part of  American pop culture, and the insight you can gain to this film from the  DVD extras actually draws you further into an already exciting movie  experience.  Now if we can only convince Universal Pictures to re-release  this film to theatres for this 25th Anniversary year. Even with the bonus  DVD and laserdisc features, this film will always play best in a big, dark,  crowded theater.  We should be able to let our kids experience it that way,  much like George Lucas did when he re-released his trilogy a few years ago.  There is at least one generation of people who never got to see JAWS 20  feet high and 48 feet across. And I challenge you to play this DVD will  full THX or  DTS Surround and NOT GET GOOSEBUMPS when John Williams' score  kicks in!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>"Jaws" is simply the best nature-gone-awry horror movie ever made. I read the novel and was marginally stirred by it, but the cinematic adaptation brought the true horror potential of a giant rogue shark home is a primal way that other films have sought to imitate, but could never duplicate.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg was unarguably the genius behind the execution of the film, but everyone from the excellent cast, to the special effects gurus (remember this was done before digital special effects were even dreamed of), to the editors and sound effects people coalesced to produce an amazing film.<br /><br />I am sure that everyone knows that the film is about a giant rogue shark terrorizing a resort community, and the man-versus-beast battle which ensues, but to me the real genius here is in the development of the lead characters into real, believable people thrust together in a very trying situation. I personally believe that Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider are the true stars here. Shaw's "USS Indianapolis" monologue is one of the most effective in film history (the "Making of" feature discusses this at length in an interesting segment), and Roy Scheider's "bigger boat" adlib is possibly the best line in the entire film.<br /><br />There are many extras, including an interesting "Making of" feature, which is highly recommended viewing, even if you normally don't enjoy such things.<br /><br />Although this film has been repackaged many times (and undoubtedly will be again), to me that doesn't detract from the film itself: buy the cheapest version of "Jaws" you can find on DVD. Forget the extras if you wish: this is a film worthy of being called a true cinematic legend.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>28 years ago this summer, an almost-unknown director named Steven Spielberg, at the ripe old age of 25, released a film that caused a stampede at the box office and single-handedly started the phenomenon of the summer blockbuster with "legs", the movie you had to see again and again and again.  Even after all this time, the ominous opening music from "Jaws" still sends a delicious tingle down the spine.  Spielberg's genius lay in turning Peter Benchley's mediocre novel into a well-acted, well-directed, terrifying classic horror movie.  He omitted all the boring side dramas that cluttered up the book and stuck to the bare bones; i.e., the primeval battle between man and a monster fish packing two hundred teeth and an attitude.<p>"Jaws" has more than a little in common with "Moby Dick", especially in Quint's fatal error in making his battle with the shark a personal vendetta, as Ahab did in his hunt for the white whale.  Just as the whale does in "Moby Dick", the shark turns the tables on its hunters and begins hunting them.  We see all of Quint's hubris brought low from the time he swaggers onto the deck of his own boat, monarch of all he surveys, until he ends up being relentlessly chewed up and swallowed by his nemesis.  Spielberg brings all this to us in vivid detail and reminds us that, after all, sharks will be sharks.<p>Spielberg has a gift for humorous touches as well, and he's a master at contrast.  I still crack up over the scene where the two boys scared the bejesus out of several hundred people in fake shark outfits; the laughter turns to horrified gasps immediately in the next scene, in which a hysterical girl points out the real shark only a few hundred feet upstream, ready to chow down on an unsuspecting guy in a rowboat.  The scene with the boneheaded mayor goggle-eyed in outrage at a defaced beach poster, blind to the reality of the threat out in the water, is a howler.  And the scene in which Quint smashes the boat's radio with a stick, effectively cutting off their communication with the outside world, is a masterpiece; the dawning terror in Quint's eyes, when he realizes that it's just them alone with the shark, and he finally realizes what an unequal contest it is, underlines all the folly of setting himself up against a power so much stronger than he is, that he can't hope to understand it, let alone defeat it.<p>So how has this film stood up over the past quarter-century?  Leave the mechanics of the shark's workings out of it; sure, they can do it better now with better technology.  The film still delivers on its premise; it's still one helluva horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Jaws is a movie that needs no introduction. It has set the standard for creature horror movies for decades. I only recently saw it and have to say even after all these years it holds up extremely well. The movie creates compelling, realistic characters whom you actually find yourself caring about. This was (and is) a novelty for a horror movie. More importantly, the movie is subtle, partly be design and partly because of limitations in the special effects of the era. Viewers never really see the shark until the end of the movie, but the film does a brilliant job playing on the audience's suspense. Even when you know the shark is going to attack soon, you never quite know whom it's going to attack next. Overall, it's Spielberg at his finest and is a wonderful example of how a good script and careful editing can go a long way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>After the sad death of Roy Schneider, there was a special screening of this, on Easter Sunday, strangely enough. Shockingly, the cinema was only just half full I would have said. I've only seen Jaws once, and that was many years ago, and my friend and me spent the entire time talking throughout it. And it was shown on TV. Hardly great quality. My mum loves the movie, and she owns the sequels, but I've just never got round to watching it.<br /><br />The print we watched wasn't the greatest quality. It was grainy, and jumpy at times, and one important bit was completely missing (the bit where the shark comes out the water for the meat, and Brody says "We'll need a bigger boat.") The famous line was kept in, but it completely skipped the shark, so one of the most important scares of the movie wasn't there. Disappointed, slightly, but the rest of the movie was still good.<br /><br />I am not going to go into the plot of Jaws. Duh, it's perfectly obvious. Yes, it was 1975, and it was a Steven Spielberg movie (I haven't seen many, I really need to educate myself), but it hasn't dated that badly. Not as badly as I was expecting. Brody, played by Roy Schneider, was excellent, as was the supporting cast, although I didn't know any of them. It did start off, in my opinion, like a really bad slasher movie, with the two teenagers stripping off, and going skinny dipping, but it did get better.<br /><br />The shots from the shark's view were really creepy. I think that's what made the film for me, as it would have ruined the film more, if the shark had been shown more than it was. There was only a couple of very brief glimpses here and there of the shark, towards the end it was shown more. It's good when horror etc movies do that, cos I do have the impression it ruins it otherwise. Predator for example, is a lot more scarier, than if we'd actually seen the Predator more. The thing with Jaws is it's scarier/creepier what you don't see - I tell you, my imagination was making up some awful images when Hooper was looking at the first girl's remains. Bleurgh.<br /><br />Jaws has held its own, against many other contendors/spoofs over the years, and has proved to be very successful. I wasn't even around (never mind thought of) when it was first released, and I enjoyed it. Jaws will always be loved by generations old and new. It shows with me.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is an awesome scary classic movie! It has awesome shark sequences, and awesome characters.

If you love horror and classics, you'll love JAWS!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>How can you hate JAWS? It's a classic.<br /><br />STORY: 3 people go on a fishing trip in the ocean. While on the trip, their boat keeps rocking randomly up and down... and all of a sudden, the discover it's because of a great white shark! They keep doing all they can to kill the shark, but everything fails. Finally, they find a plan to kill the shark, but everything goes wrong, and one gets killed... only two people left!<br /><br />THOUGHTS: CLASSIC! This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. Plus, the part where it's silent for 4 minutes, then BAM made me jump!<br /><br />RECCOMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>There have been a lot of people griping. Why release a 30th anniversary edition of Jaws when there was a 25th anniversary edition? Okay, so there have been multiple releases but this release is the grand daddy of them all and fans of the classic shark tale will be pleased. The two disc set is Jaws overload and a must have for the classic film collector. Jaws was director Stephen Spielberg's first huge blockbuster movie. It was the first movie to hit the $100 million dollar mark. This was a big deal back in the mid 70's. The film spawned sequels and even a amusement park attraction at Universal Studios in the mid 80's. The film also did wonders for Martha's Vineyard's tourism industry.<br /><br />Okay...you know what the movie is about. Big scary shark terrorizes people, man says, "You're going to need a bigger boat," on to the extras. The best thing I like about the set is that it includes a full color booklet. Not a little mini book but a thick little black photo journal. The booklet includes pictures and details from the film. I like the book a lot. There are movie quotes and facts about the film in the book.<br /><br />The extras are what sets this release apart from previous releases. You have the choice between Dobly Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1 Aufio and Original Theatrical Mono Audio track. The set includes deleted scenes and out takes and a never before seen interview with director Stephen Spielberg. Disc 2 equally impressive. It includes a 2 hour documentary about the film. The documentary is amazing. Another feature on the disc is the Jaws Archive which includes production photo's, storyboards, and more. You will be ultra pleased with this purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>- - BECAUSE WE ARE ALL AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER!<br /><br />IT BEGINS WHEN -----<br /><br />It begins when a "summer girl" goes for a midnight swim and, after being reported missing, is later discovered on the beach --in pieces. Is it a shark attack, a boating accident, or what? After all, all we saw were a few tugs and screams. But was there something hidden in the water? Or was it as the mayor suggested, a simple drowning followed by a collsion with a boat's propeller for the "summer girl"?<br /><br />BUT THEN ---<br /><br />After a short and sweet coverup by the business-oriented mayor and town council, more swimmers and fisherman get mangled at sea and there are witnesses to some of these slayings, ending the chance of both a continued coverup and a lucrative summer business for Amity Island [flimed at Martha's Vineyard].<br /><br />During the Amity versus Jaws segment, we see more and more of the shark and more graphic depictions of the shark and its dining habits.<br /><br />AH --- BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING ---<br /><br />Then, the second and primary theme develops. Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, a scientist from the "Oceanographic Institute", and Robert Shaw as Captain Quint, an off-the-wall sailor set sail to kill the "Great White" that is turning the water red around the seaside community of Amity Island.<br /><br />YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER!<br /><br />This part of the movie is a combination wild buddy adventure and monster movie. However, the basic theme that has induced fear into audiences and all swimmers afterward is pervasive now aboard ship, during the hunt for Jaws. You see, no one sees Jaws until it is too late, if at all. The crew of three now simply wait for something to come up, out of the dark waters below, and literally crash onto their small fishing boat. Therein lies the charm of Jaws -- it can come out without warning and simply tear you or your loved ones to shreds. Even on a boat, a dock, or within shallow, patrolled beaches, we are all at risk of becoming a meal for a monster. When the film is over the risk still remains. If and when we return to the beach at the ocean, we will find ourselves suddenly reminded that we are not at the top of the food chain. This is what makes propaganda so effective, and here it is at its best -- YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER! Wherever did we get that idea from?<br /><br />IN THE END: [plot spoilers below]<br /><br />Spielberg gives us a very satisfying end which does differ somewhat from the book. Quint goes the way of Captain Ahab, right into the beast's mouth, still kicking, stabbing, shouting and fighting. Next, as the ship is sinking, Chief Brody, after repeated shots with a rifle does get the oxygen tank to explode in Jaws' mouth for a dramatic end to this bad fish. Afterward, Hooper makes a surprise return from what we assumed was a sure death within a mangled anti-shark cage. The film closes with the two buddies paddling toward the distant shore using two of the floating shark barrels to float on as they kick their way away from the camera and toward home.<br /><br />BUT ITS NEVER REALLY OVER BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT JAWS IS STILL OUT THERE!<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD: [TOP PICK: 30TH ANNIVERSARY WIDESCREEN]<br /><br />There are at least 5 releases on DVD that I know of. In all cases, the film appears about the same, the differences being in the features and whether it is a Widescreen or Full-Frame Format. The last release is the 30th Anniversary Edition which differs from the Anniversary Edition [25th Anniversary in small print] only in the featurettes. One is longer and is touted as being new and improved over the last release. Both Anniversary releases have some deleted scenes. Again, the biggest extra feature on the 30th Anniversary edition is "From The Set: An insider's look at life on the set of Jaws" which features a "never-before-available interview with Steven Spielberg". Okay, that is about the biggest difference, but though I have seen both Anniversary editions, I am staying with the "Anniversary Edition" in Widescreen from 2000. However, if I were now in the market for Jaws on DVD, I would buy the new "30th Anniversary Edition" from 2005.<br /><br />CAST - CREW - AWARDS !!!!<br /><br />----- CAST<br /><br />Roy Scheider - Chief Martin Brody<br /><br />Robert Shaw - Quint<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss - Matt Hooper<br /><br />Lorraine Gary - Ellen Brody<br /><br />Murray Hamilton - Mayor Larry Vaughn<br /><br />Carl Gottlieb - Editor Meadows<br /><br />----- CREW<br /><br />Steven Spielberg - Director<br /><br />David Brown - Producer<br /><br />Richard D.

Summer was always thought of as a waste land for the movie industry.  No films of substance were released during the summer because no one went to the films during the summer because they were on vacation.  That is until Jaws came through and broke Sound of Music boxoffice record.<br /><br />That is the importance of Jaws, not that it is a great film. Everyone knows the story.  Big shark terrorizes little beach resort but the big wigs don't want to cancel the big holiday event.<br /><br />Spielberg is a technical director.  He is best at scenes that do not involve words and emotion.  He is best at minipulating the audience through camera angles, editing and music.  But when it comes to the acting, these scenes are only as good as the actors in it.  And in this we have the great Robert Shaw who steals the movie as the rustic shark hunter.  The rest of the actors flounder in the mediocrity of the script.<br /><br />You might ask why am I writing this review, it was on my recomended by Amazon list and I am just warning people like me that it would be better to invest in Alfred Hitchcock films than this.<br /><br />With that said, this is a film to watch when you want something mindless.  This is not a film classic but a fun classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>Alright, if you've never got around to adding Jaws to your dvd collection then now is as good a time as any with this edition. But if you shelled out for the "25th Anniversary" disc, then STAY AWAY from this scam. It comes with the unabridged documentary that was found on laser. But does it have a commentary track? Are you kidding? What else is Universal and $pielberg going to lure you into buying this again when its released on HDVD? These people didn't even see fit to remaster the print with the latest digital technology. This is a shameful, worthless edition. Univeral / $pielberg deserve nothing less than your enmity and contempt for failing dvddom AGAIN.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Jaws tells the story of a bunch of beachgoers, on Amity Island, who get attacked by a giant man-eating Great White shark. This causes the local police chief to round up a marine biologist and a professional shark hunter to go on the hunt for the thing. What happens during the course of that hunt is going to surprise you.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws was directed by Stephen Spielberg(as you all know) and, after viewing the movie, I believe it is one of Spielberg's biggest achievements in filmmaking. Even though, when you watch The Making of Jaws featurette, he expresses the fact that it was very difficult to make the picture. Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production(mostly dealing with the mechanical shark for the film), going over budget and past schedule. The movie itself was well-recieved by critics and fans alike. It was the highest grossing film of its' time, in 1975.  The film stars Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint(my favorite character out of the whole movie), Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. It spawned  three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley, with varying success. It's been imitated many, many times through the years in different movies about sharks but not with as much success as Jaws.<br /><br />Honestly, I've always been more interested in Spielberg's Science-Fiction movies(like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extraterrestrial, Jurassic Park, and War of the Worlds) but this movie has me looking up his older movies no matter what genre of movie to watch. Jaws is a great movie and one that should be viewed by everyone at some point. It truly is worthy of its' accolades.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>This is definitely one of my top 10 favorite movies. Never gets old. Wouldn't recommend it for young kids, though. There is a LOT of blood. Still, this is a great movie. Good acting for its time, good suspense, good plot, good evrything.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In the beautiful quaint beach resort of Amity Island, something hideous, something so deliciously evil has vanquished the tranquility and shattered the peace. First, it violently took the life of a young girl, leaving her mangled remains rotting on the beach, her echoed screams cursing the night skies. Next, it moved its attention to the children, ripping and tearing as blood turned the calm waters red. Then, just when they thought it was safe to go back in the water, it struck again, mercilessly rampaging in the estuary and attacking the piers where the fisherman unknowingly sat waiting for a catch. Now, something must be done, before it returns to feed. With the Amity tourist board and town Mayor Larry Vaugn determined to keep the beaches open for the Summer Season, its up to Police Chief Brody, marine biologist Matt Hooper and colorful fisherman Quint to hunt down the 200 Pound White Death and put an end to the bloodshed. 'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>Movie that terrified the entire country over 30 years ago is logically flawed from the start. 3 people are killed by shark attacks before the mayor and chamber of coommerce assent to closing off the waters of Amity Island to swimmers. National news reporters are on the scene,yet no request for Coast Guard intervention takes place.Finding and killing this stupendous shark is farmed out to Shaw, using his own boat, probably not safe in a swimming pool.Police chief Schneider and shark expert Dreyfus hop sboard to help save lives and the movie's credibility. They succeed thanks to terrific acting, frighteningly good photography, a lightning pace, and great background music by John Williams. Ironically, it's Shaw who's consumed by pride and stubborness, while the novices reap the joy of victory. The film is timeless and will still give viewers of all ages all that they can swallow.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Before tampering with prehistoric predators, Spielberg gave us a giant fish.  That giant fish proves to this day to be one of the most horrifying and successfully bone chilling creatures in movie history.  I stand by the belief that `Jaws' is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It has all the components of a good thriller and satisfies the moviegoer from start to finish.<br /><br />The plot is simple.  Amity Island is being terrorized by a great white shark.  The new police chief Martin Brody is working very hard, despite the contempt from the town's mayor, to keep the beaches empty and the body count minimal.  After some heavy persuasion and a few lost lives the mayor, Larry Vaughn, finally agrees to hire Quint, a shark hunter, to kill this great white.  Accompanying Quint on his hunt is Brody as well as shark expert Matt Hooper.  The film really takes a turn for the superb as these men soon realize that they are indeed being hunted by the shark.  The madness sets in slowly and the film's finale is jaw dropping.<br /><br />I think that everyone who has ever seen `Jaws' can attest to the fact that the opening sequence with young Chrissie Watkins decides to skinny dip in the dangerous waters stands alone as one of the most heart racing and all around gut wrenching scenes in motion picture history.  I was a young boy the first time I saw `Jaws' and for what felt like years I was unable to swim in the deep end of my pool, always fearing I'd be tugged under in the same manor as young Watkins was.  This is the reason that `Jaws' is a classic.  It stays with you.  Sure, the shark looks fake when we finally have the chance to see it full on, but to be completely honest it's not the shark that scared us in the first place.  It was the idea of the shark, the undeniable knowledge that he was on his way to devour you.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is a masterful director and he turns out yet another brilliant picture in `Jaws'.  The mood created by the lighting, the music and the camera angles (I know the whole `shooting from the sharks perspective' was done on account of the mechanical shark being `out of order' half the time, but it was brilliant) helps terrify the audience.  While not technically a `horror' film, `Jaws' sends more chills, more realistic and meaningful chills, than many quote-unquote `horror' films that litter our cinemas today.<br /><br />The cast is all at the top of their games here.  Roy Scheider manages to make Martin Brody relatable and real to the audience, and Murray Hamilton captures the pompous selfishness surrounding Larry Vaughn perfectly.  It's Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss though who take the cake so-to-speak in regards to electric performances.  Shaw is magnificent as Quint and Dreyfuss breathes so much life into Hooper.  I just love Dreyfuss and this performance is yet another reason why.<br /><br />`Jaws' may not be your favorite film but there is no denying its powerful presence.  Anyone who has ever seen this film must admit that it had a huge impact on how they viewed a leisure swim.  And who can forget that commanding score.  I still hear that fear inspiring composition every time I get in the water.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Amity is a small beach town that thrives on summer tourists, where the Chief of Police's biggest worry are kids practicing karate on neighbourhood fences.  Until a great-white shark arrives and starts killing beach-goers.  His new worry is how to get rid of a man-eating shark.  That's the basic premise of Peter Benchley's famous novel, brought to screen by Steven Spielberg with some major changes to the plot.  The plot consists of two halves: the first half describing the shark threat, and the second half describing the shark hunt.  The first half is the most enjoyable, as director Spielberg evokes a sense of fear from the outset with the gruesome discovery of the remains of a shark victim.  There is a constant and strong sense of impending doom: "who will be next?"  <p>Unlike most modern movies, the fear that "Jaws" creates is not produced by graphic displays of blood and gore, which are reserved for the conclusion of the shark hunt in the closing stages of the movie.  In fact you don't even see the details of the first attack or the body of the first victim, and very little of the shark or its victims is seen in the first half of the movie.  Rather, splendid directing creates an emotional fear with small and brilliant touches throughout.  After a few false alarms on the beach, we as viewers start seeing the beach-goers as "shark bait" through the eyes of the Chief of Police and share his fear.  A most memorable scene occurs as the camera pans between him and the swimmers in the surf, and as he reacts first to an apparent shark which turns out to be an elderly swimmer, and then to the screams of a young couple which turn out to be innocent screams of fun.  Similarly, there are other scenes where his wife surprises him as he is looking at a book with pictures of sharks; and where the camera zooms in on a shark attack and pans out to show it is just a killer-shark video game.  Creating chilling fear in this emotional manner by suggestion rather than by sight of explicit gore is a skill that has largely been lost by modern movie-makers.  Fear is evoked more by what you don't see than what you do see.  John Williams impressive score with its recurring shark theme turns up the chills all the higher.<p>The second half of the movie does not quite live up to the promise of the first half, as the shark hunt gets underway, complete with the memorable line "You're going to need a bigger boat."  But here two wonderful characters come to the forefront to join the police chief in the quest for the shark: the kooky shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), and the eccentric shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is humorously and completely impersonal in his passion for sharks.  The conclusion is rather more graphic than a PG rating would suggest, but is quite satisfying.  (The PG rating is overly generous by today's standards, considering the incidences of blasphemy and graphic violence, particularly in the latter half).<p>It's not hard to see why this is a landmark movie continues to stand out more than 25 years after it was made.  It's dated only in that it pictures people with 70s clothes and hair, and an artificial shark produced by 70s technology.  But there is certainly nothing old-fashioned about the sense of terror and suspense it evokes.  It is this spine-tingling atmosphere that has made the chilling story of "Jaws" an unforgettable classic that will continue to grab viewers by the teeth in years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>This 1975 blockbuster by Steven Spielberg became the first real summer blockbuster film. Having grossed about $260 million at the box office, it opened the doors for the epic summer film. Not<br />many of the films in years since, has been able to equal the sheer brilliance of Jaws. Roy Scheider stars as a local sheriff who's quaint little coastal/tourist town is suddenly in terror as a great white shark begins attacking swimmers at the beach. In<br />comes Richard Dreyfuss, who plays a shark specialist, who tries to help the sheriff. Robert Shaw is also on hand as a local fisherman who wants to hunt the killer down and kill it once and for all. There are numerous scenes that are classic and incredibly memorable. The shark itself looks undeniably real and is scary as hell. There are scenes that are destined to make your heart beat faster and your pulse to race. Spielberg executes it so well, and gets his actors to deliver such real performances, that it all comes off as very real and believeable. There is nothing more scarier than when it's real and hits close to home. Know what I mean?. This is one of the finest thrillers ever made hands down. It spawned a pretty decent sequel, but then went downhill(fast)with Parts 3 and 4. Jaws is still one of the best movies ever made. Nothing can match the terrifying theme music either. A classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Jaws (1975)<br />Thriller, 124 minutes<br />Directed by Steven Spielberg<br />Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw<br /><br />As I continue working on this 100 movies project, I am realizing that my tastes are all over the map. It ranges from 50's black and white dramas set in one room, to foreign language films, to recent blockbusters. In a way, I'm happy to find that I'm open to all types of film. Today's entry falls into the blockbuster category and was the highest-grossing movie ever made in its day.<br /><br />I remember a conversation with friends when I was 13 telling me that I had to see Jaws. They talked about the shark more than anything, and people being torn apart. I caved and ended up seeing the movie and then I read the book. There are plenty of people who have never lost that fascination for deadly creatures. Would we have Shark Week without Jaws? Why do we want to watch such a creature?<br /><br />Actually, that's not why I like Jaws.<br /><br />Jaws works for me because of the quality of the acting and the suspense created by wondering where the shark will strike next. The first hour of the movie sets everything up. Although there's nothing particularly bad about the first half, it's far from remarkable. We see a few attacks and meet the main characters.<br /><br />Chief Brody (Scheider) is my favorite character. He's intelligent, sensible, practical and calm under pressure. Hooper (Dreyfuss) is a marine biologist who thinks the problem can be solved through the use of modern equipment. The most colorful character is Quint (Shaw), who is experienced and outspoken. This group ends up tracking the shark on Quint's boat and it's here that the movie really takes off.<br /><br />The movie was made at a time when special effects had to be created by using models and machines rather than CGI, so the shark doesn't look at all realistic by modern standards. Spielberg did his best to overcome those limitations by showing the creature as little as possible. We are shown the attacks, but the camera focuses on the victim rather than dwelling on the shark itself. The fear exists in our minds and we fill in the gaps.<br /><br />The best scene in the movie takes place on the boat. All three men are drinking. Hooper and Quint begin showing each other their scars. It's a moment of release and humor while they wait for the shark to appear. Brody looks bemused by the whole exchange, but it's clear that the group is bonding. In a lesser movie, all we would see is action and more frequent and bloodier attacks.<br /><br />Another thing which should be mentioned is the music. John Williams created such a simple score, and yet we will never forget those two notes every time the shark is poised to attack. How often has it been used over the years, I wonder? The movie picked up two Oscars in the technical categories, and also won for Best Original Score.<br /><br />Jaws deserves its place in movie history. I hope nobody ever suggests remaking it to update the effects. The plot is simple and predictable, but the execution is superb.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>"Jaws," which debuted on DVD five years ago in a silver anniversary edition, circles back with a 30th-year effort that chums the marketplace with upgraded extras and packaging. There are no noticeable improvements in audio or video quality.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg, as usual, provides no commentary. But the director has plenty to say in Laurent Bouzereau's fine documentary "The Making of Jaws," created for the 1995 laserdisc. In 2000, Universal gutted the 125-minute docu to under an hour, so it remains basically unseen. The film launched Bouzereau's triple-threat career as a making-of specialist, now with more than 130 titles to his credit.<br /><br />The hard-luck shoot's history gets a full review, including the myriad problems with mechanical sharks. Spielberg recalls "Jaws" as a "fun movie to watch, but not a fun movie to make."<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider vie for camera time, spinning terrific stories. For the record: Scheider insists he never referred to the great white as Bruce, and never will. (Spielberg named the killing machine after his lawyer.)<br /><br />New to DVD is "From the Set," a 9-minute British TV piece hailing from 1974. The 26-year-old Spielberg, hot off "The Sugarland Express," is interviewed in the waters off Martha's Vineyard. He looks like a pop star but talks like a savvy pro. ("Young, courageous and stupid," he later calls himself.) The high concept was "Duel" at sea.<br /><br />The anamorphic widescreen video (2.35:1) comes ported over from the older DVD, not really a bad thing. Images are reasonably bright and enjoyable, but typical of the era they're soft and grainy. Minor speckling surfaces throughout, a defect that will have to wait for the 35th year, apparently.<br /><br />Universal released two "Jaws" DVDs in 2000, one with Dolby Digital 5.1 and the other with DTS. The new DVD features both formats as well as mono for old salts yearning for the bad old days of 1970s movie audio. The surround tracks sound great, especially John Williams' thumping shark theme, its menace amplified by watery-grave lows from the subwoofer. Go with DTS if you have it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Jaws is not only the first blockbuster to gross over one hundred million dollars, a visceral thriller that showcases the art and craft of moviemaking at its finest, and a film that probably made millions of families rethink their summer vacation plans over the past quarter of a century plus, it is a cultural phenomenon that has become a permanent part of pop culture.  John Williams' theme to Jaws is immediately recognizable on both an intellectual and emotional level, whether you've seen the movie or not.  Major and minor problems alike are still met with the words, &quot;You're [or we're] going to need a bigger boat.&quot;  This twenty-fifth anniversary DVD release only furthers and adds to the legend, tossing extra features into the waters of our consciousness like so much delectable chum, and we are drawn to this aromatic feast of bloody entertainment the same way the star of this movie (which isn't Dreyfus, Scheider, or Shaw) is drawn to the smell of blood and the necessity of constant feeding as it slips through the oceans of our planet and, thanks to Peter Benchley, Stephen Spielberg, and others, the oceans of our very thoughts and fears.<p>This movie works on so many levels.  First, we have Amity police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a New York City transplantee who now polices an island despite his fear of water.  When a young lady is killed in the movie's memorable opening scene, pretty obviously by a shark, he allows himself to be dissuaded from closing the beaches by a slimy mayor who cares more for the holiday tourist season than the lives of the men, women, and children vacationing there.  When a boy is killed soon thereafter in front of basically everyone, Brody is rightly racked with a guilt that the mayor still doesn't understand.  A bounty on the shark brings all kinds of crazy people to the harbor, fighting each other in piddling little boats in a race to catch the killer.  It also brings shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and self-proclaimed shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) to town.  A shark is captured, but it soon becomes clear that this tiger shark is not the rogue killer terrorizing the island; Brody's son is in fact lucky to survive the ultimate proof of this fact.  Eventually, Hooper and Brody go out on the Orca with the eccentric, roguish Quint determined to find and kill the great white shark whom we finally get a close-up view of well over halfway through the movie.  This first real look at the mammoth twenty-six footer is brilliantly shot; having been conditioned to expect the shark only after Williams' incredible theme song begins, Jaws decides to make his first close-up a memorable surprise to the audience and, most especially, Brody.  The hunters soon become the hunted, leading to an increasingly suspenseful, riveting conclusion.<p>Many would view the shark as a monster, but if there is a monster in this film it is the mayor and local businessmen who sacrifice lives in the name of money.  The shark is just doing what he does naturally, feeding, and I cannot do anything but respect this remarkable creature.  The shark is nature's perfect killing machine, perhaps the most magnificent and certainly the most efficient animal on this planet.  This particular shark is as smart as he is huge, making him the most formidable of opponents for the Ahab-like Quint.  Certainly, such a rogue killer has to be either starved out or killed in the interest of human life, but I mourn the eventual defeat of this magnificent animal.  <p>This film was released in 1975, and the great white shark does not look terribly real today, but this takes nothing away from its magnificence and visceral impact on the viewer.  Spielberg shows his genius early on in his directing career by holding back our first look at the shark for so long; the early deaths are quite memorable and pack quite a punch as it is, with levels of blood and panic that make this a film that probably haunted the dreams of many younger viewers and a fair share of adults for many a night.  The final leg of the film is particularly extreme, making me wonder how this film got a PG rating.  One of the most compelling scenes of the film, however, does not involve the shark at all; Quint's absorbing account of his experience after the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis stands as one of the most emotionally enthralling scenes ever filmed.<p>The anniversary DVD edition of Jaws is simply loaded with extras, featuring 75 minutes of bonus footage, including several deleted scenes and outtakes.  The main attraction, though, is the feature Spotlight on Location: The Making of Jaws, which delivers incredible insight on the making of the film.  After watching these interviews with important cast and crew members and behind-the-scenes looks at the grueling, exceedingly challenging making of the film, this viewer's respect for the cinematic wonder that was created here grew by leaps and bounds.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>You simply have got to admire Steven Spielberg's tenacity while mired in this seemingly endless project.  He just wouldn't quit until he had created the classic known as "Jaws".  And he pulled it off.  We hear in the making-of documentaries of how the mechanical shark would always be on the fritz!  And of the actors waiting for hours, or days, to complete a given scene!  It must have been hell!  Especially considering the locales!  But this, in the final analysis of this landmark picture, actually proved to ADD to the suspense of the final cut!  Because the darn maneater refused to eat, Steven was forced to shoot many a scene (intended to include the predator) without the shark...proving once more the theory: the scariest things are the things we CAN'T see!  And when we finally see those huge jaws opened for the first time....WOW! What an impact!  I still jump when I see it!<br /><br />This film has all elements that make up a classic thriller: tension beyond belief, suspense, great acting, and the occasional "Oh Jesus!" surprise shocks.  I wonder how many people who have seen this movie were scared to death at the very end when the camera follows Brody & Hooper toward the shore...thinking, just maybe, another "bite" was coming!  (I know I did!) Ever wonder what Jaws would look like if made today featuring all the advanced computer imaging??  Might have been interesting. But it certainly would NOT have had as much suspense as the 1975 Jaws, because no doubt the shark would have popped his head out of the water much earlier in the film.  Nah....You can't improve on a Classic anyway!  And Jaws is definitely that!<br /><br />The Universal Home Video DVD has some very nice Bonus Features on it too -- a great "Making-Of" feature, some deleted scenes and outtakes, trailers, and more.<br /><br />The Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer on the "25th Anniversary" DVD Edition is first-rate as well. Rock solid. The Dolby 5.1 audio is of high quality too.<br /><br />DVD Recommendation Of The First Order!<br /><br />"Hooper!! Ya idiot!!"</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>Say what you will about Steven Spielberg, but a lesser filmmaker would have been far less gutsy about this film. <p>Can you imagine a film being made today about a killer shark...and having the filmmaker resolutely  refuse to show you the shark until the film was 2/3 done?<p>That's what  makes &quot;Jaws&quot; so effective - we don't know anything about the  shark at all. It's a complete mystery. That makes it a true protagonist in  a dramatic sense...and a great counterpoint to today's action films, in  which silly one-liners and overacting count as great villainy.<p>It shows  great faith in the intelligence of the moviegoer on Spielberg's  part.<p>&quot;Jaws&quot; has other charms as well. The performances are  excellent, especially Robert Shaw's turn as the crusty, slightly crazy and  ultimately very likeable Quint. The scene in which he describes his  experience with the sinking of the USS Indianapolis is absolutely  riveting.<p>The John Williams score is a classic, and it's a tribute to the  craft of the filmmakers that very few of the film's special effects  (including the shark) look the least bit dated today.<p>All in all, this is  a classic, but I don't need to tell you that...you've probably already seen  it a few dozen times yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>When future generations examine the Steven Spielberg canon, three motion pictures will stand out: "Schindler's List" (1993), "E.T." (1982) and "Jaws" (1975), the director's breakthrough thriller. More than 30 years later, the film remains a textbook example of storytelling and characterization - somehow managing to transcend Peter Benchley's source material. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss make a formidable ensemble while Spielberg keeps a tight grip on the watery suspense. No matter how many times you see it, "Jaws" still packs a powerful cinematic punch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I can still smell the salt and anticipation in the air as my friend and I waited in line to see Jaws on opening night! We were first in a very long line,the film would not disappoint anyone there that night! We were so impressed we went back the next night, with a few more friends in tow. We just wanted to see our unsuspecting friends and the audience lose there precious popcorn every time Bruce the shark would briefly appear. The famous head scene is the biggest jolt and it scared the you know what out of everyone in the theater! Living in Wildwood N.J. one block from the ocean, made the film all the more real and it kept most of us from enjoying the ocean for quite some time. To this day, over 30 years later! I do not feel completely at ease when I'm in the ocean and my feet leave the ocean floor! That is some impact for a film to have over a man who has watched so many really scary movies.<br /><br />I own both the 25th and the 30th anniversary editions and I watch one of them almost on a yearly basis. I have a 10 foot screen in my home theater and it is almost like opening night every time I watch it! One of the best films ever made and probably the scariest. The 30th anniversay edition is the better edition with original mono soundtrack and complete documentary, but beware!... the 30th ann. edition does not include the theatrical trailer! This is inexcusable! Even so, the extra length of the documentary and the original and DTS soundtrack make this a worthy upgrade. If you don't own the 25th ann. then the 30th ann. You might want to keep your 25th ann. for the trailer :-( .....da....dum.......da dum.....</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>funny at times<br /><br />moving<br /><br />scary as hell<br /><br />saw this as a kid many times on tv<br /><br />glad I saw it<br /><br />truly a shocking horror movie<br /><br />that shark is truly terrifying<br /><br />glad I got this on dvd<br /><br />the extras are fabulous too<br /><br />I could watch this one again and again and not not be scared<br /><br />it really boiled my blood the first time I saw it<br /><br />especially the scene where Quint gets devoured by the shark<br /><br />OUch that really has to hurt</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>Jaws is an amazing story which, even decades later, has the power to suck us in. I've seen this movie more times than I can count, and I watched it again fresh for this review. Yes, on one hand it's a "thriller" about a giant monster. However, there is so much more here. The interplay of the characters. The amazingly quotable dialogue. The sense of balancing a community's needs against what - at first - seems to be a vague threat.<br /><br />The movie is definitely a "much lighter" version of the book, and it's well worth reading the book to see just how much more there was in the original story. Still, the movie richly deserves its #48 spot on the AFI top 100 - and it goes up against many heavy hitting dramas to earn that rank.<br /><br />The pacing is perfect, the music draws the atmosphere into focus. And there are all sorts of fascinating facts about sharks sprinkled in and around.<br /><br />I also love the landscapes. I grew up in New England and have visited Cape Cod many times. It's a gorgeous area of the world, and it's great to get immersed in that beach-side world atmosphere with the quiet streets and seaside homes.<br /><br />One thing I was curious about was how Jaws would fare on the Bechdel test. This test is simply to see if there are two named female characters who talk with each other about something other than a man. Even with all the times I've seen this movie, it was hard to remember any meaningful female characters here. There's the police chief's wife. The bereaved mother of the chomped-on kid. The secretary at the police station. And really, that's it.<br /><br />On my rewatching, the only scene I spotted with two women talking was when a random woman teased the captain's wife about never being a "real" islander because she wasn't born on-island. But since the random woman wasn't named, it doesn't count.<br /><br />Still, despite that minor complaint, this is great from start to finish. The characters are amazing. The dialogue is great fun. The story hooks you from the start and has you enthralled until the very end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>"Gore" is the least interesting thing about this film.

This is the first time I've downloaded a digital copy that's include the HD version of the movie.

Yeah yeah, everyone knows that not all sharks are dangerous (we scare them more than they scare us), but this is a MOVIE. And boy is it a movie! It's not only the classic scares that make the film, but the characters Brody and Quint and Hooper are all equally interesting. It's almost a spectacle when these men of different backgrounds try to take down the big one in the second half of the film. Plus, the dialogue is easily recognizable ("I got no spit."). The one thing that bothers me about this film is that the shark kills my favorite character near the end. What a shame.<br /><br />But other than that, this classic remains a classic.

Upon its theatrical release Jaws quickly became a cultural phenomenon, embraced by critics and audiences alike. It's hard to believe, but it's been over thirty years since the film debuted and Jaws still keeps people away from the water. The film's brilliant exploitation (or exploration, depending on how you look at it) of our primal fears of drowning and of being eaten alive by a natural predator is still stunningly effective. And though the mechanical shark in the film may look artificial or quaint when compared to today's advanced CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery), the film remains a chilling and exhilarating adventure/thriller.<br /><br />When a Great White shark begins stalking the waters of Amity, a New England coastal town, and kills a teenage girl, Police Chief Martin Brody (who suffers from a fear of the water) wants to close down the beaches, but he is overruled by Mayor Vaughn. After two more fatal shark attacks Brody hires Matt Hooper, a wealthy ichthyologist from the Oceanographic Institute and an eccentric local fisherman named Quint, to hunt down and exterminate the shark. Brody says good-bye to his wife, Ellen and their two children, and he joins Hooper and Quint on a small, dilapidated fishing vessel called the Orca. It doesn't take this mismatched trio long before they encounter the deadly 26-foot shark, which repeatedly attacks their boat. Soon it becomes apparent that the hunters are the hunted and that this predator can, not only outsmart them, but outrun them as well. Even after numerous attempts to stop the shark, their efforts are thwarted time and time again. When the shark strikes their boat, creating a large leak, Brody, Hooper, and Quint realize that they are ill equipped to face this natural wonder of evolution, this perfect killing machine.<br /><br />The film features a superb cast including Roy Scheider as the neurotic Police Chief, Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as the charmingly sarcastic Hooper, Robert Shaw as the stubborn Quint, Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen, and Murray Hamilton as the persistently unwise Mayor Vaughn. The entire cast gives multi-faceted performances and Robert Shaw, in particular, is wonderful as the salty, cynical, and fiercely competitive Quint.<br />Without minimalizing the talents of the fantastic cast, the film's greatest stars are those behind the camera. Steven Spielberg was aided by special effects expert Robert A. Mattey, experienced shark photographers Ron and Valerie Taylor, production designer Joe Alves, and director of photography Bill Butler. The film's screenplay was written by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb and benefited from unaccredited contributions by Howard Sackler, Steven Spielberg, and John Milius. As far as adaptations go, it's unusual for a film's screenplay to live up to the expectations of the fans of the source material. Often an adaptation of a book is disappointing, to put it mildly, but Jaws proved to be an exception. The film, in many ways, is superior to the novel, which at times drifts into the realm of pretentious melodrama.<br />Jaws was also given a tremendous boost by renowned film composer, John William's brilliant score, which has become instantly recognizable.<br />The original Jaws film was so successful that it spawned three sequels: the adequate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005A8XX">Jaws 2</a>, the regrettable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WFU4">Jaws 3</a>, and the abysmal <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008WFU5">Jaws: The Revenge</a>. Apparently you can't keep a good shark down. With all of these indestructible sharks out there, it's no wonder that people are still afraid of going into the water.<br /><br />The 30th Anniversary Edition DVD includes the following bonus materials: the excellent two-hour documentary The Making of Jaws, deleted scenes and outtakes, From the Set vintage featurette, storyboards, production photos, Marketing Jaws, and Jaws Phenomenon image galleries.<br />Now the film itself is worth the price and with the addition of the bonus material, having this DVD in your collection is a no-brainer.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECAD0">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9Q">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004U8KV">Jurassic Park: The Collection</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>Normally I try to review just the content, but I'm sure everyone who visits this page knows what Jaws is about by now, and if you're looking at this release you presumably like it.  And the restored version *is* beautiful, with nary a nick or scratch and rich color.  It looks better than ever, especially compared to washed-out VHS incarnations.  It's hard to believe this film is 30 years old.<br /><br />But this ripping off of the viewers has got to stop, or, as others here have pointed out, loyal customers will stop being loyal customers.  It would be different if the studio had unearthed something new to genuinely justify a 30th anniversary release.<br /><br />But this DVD contains virtually nothing new* except a complete documentary that existed already on the laser disc edition of this film.  (A commentary track would have been a nice new addition and more of a justification for this release.) In other words, there is no reason they could not have put the whole "Making of" documentary on the previous 25th anniversary edition DVD, because it already exited in this form.  In fact, they had to go to the trouble of *editing it down* for the previous DVD release in the first place, withholding something they already had and could have included for no extra cost (whereas editing it down *did* in fact involve extra cost).  If that's not a cynical and contemptuous view of the consumer, I don't know what is. *And,* as others have pointed out, the trailers are now missing.  --Oh, I know: the 35th Anniversary Edition will have the trailers *and* the full-length documentary together for the first time.  Woo-hoo.<br /><br />Shame on Universal.  I'm not blaming Spielberg here, because Universal and not he have control over Jaws (which means at least we are safe from him re-doing it to include a digital shark, a rainbow and a spaceship at the end).  But the studio--and all studios--had better quit the obvious money-grubbing to make a couple extra bucks on classics, just because their current crop of films is awful.  You just know the HDVD version is coming next--first just the movie, then the movie plus the one-hour documentary, then the movie with the whole documentary, each release separated by about two years.<br /><br />The movie gets 5 stars, the DVD release gets 0 stars.  Hollywood execs get my fondest wishes for bankruptcy and consumer revolt.<br /><br />*Hooray, at least the original sound mix has been restored, alongside the stereo mix from the 25th anniversary edition.  That mix, with some strange new sound effects added and old ones left out, was a travesty.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>It almost feels pointless to review the movie here: unless you've been living on Neptune for the past 25 years you've probably seen it, probably can quote lines from it, probably know it inside-out. And that's why I'm partly annoyed by this new DVD release. The music and sound effects have been reworked for modern home stereo systems, which is not bad in itself, but while John Williams' justly famous score is greatly enhanced (in gorgeously clear stereo; the theatrical mastering was rather murky and of course in mono) some of the sound effects have been re-recorded or re-created. (Few movie viewers realize how many sound effects--door slamming, footsteps, even background voices--are overdubbed long after the scenes are shot) I assume this re-recording was because the sound elements had to be be remixed to give us stereo, but with a film this old it's probably impossible to find all the original bits of sound after all this time. So many of the sounds are new to this release. To someone who's not that familiar with the film it's probably not a big deal, but some of the new sounds are oddly chosen--the shark doesn't explode with much of a bang now but with a dull thud; there's a bright side, though: the bullet no longer ricochets!) The sound as the shark smashes through the glass window of the boat near the end is closer to a coke bottle breaking than a large window shattering. Some sound effects are missing completely: a car door in Mrs. Kintner's second scene, the gun being cocked as Brody's about to fire on the shark at the end of the film. The whale sound they hear inside the Orca at night has been *completely* changed--they didn't even try to find something that sounded like the original whale! The splashing and thudding as the shark is ripping the cleats out of the boat has been toned down considerably, and the ripping sound as the cleats give way is absent. We hear the dialogue in the scene better--something I never could do either in the theater or on VHS--but it also makes the event less ferocious. Some of the music cues are actually different takes than those used in the original mix, with slightly altered orchestrations and entry-points. (It's not unusual for composers to rework orchestrations on the spot while they're recording the soundtrack.) Some sound effects have been added that enhance nothing and seem to be there just as stereo effects to make the movie feel more contemporary.  The most annoying to me personally is the scene where Mrs. Brody is quietly trying to clear the table after dinner while her husband sits deep in thought and troubled.  She's obviously trying to not make noise, yet they've added loud stereo &quot;scraping&quot; of plates being lifted off the dining room table.  Spoils the wonderfully pensive mood of Williams' music at that point and is completely unnecessary.  It feels like they just have to remind you every moment that can that this is a STEREO remastering.  Woo-hoo.<p>This may seem picky, and many won't notice or care, but at the same time I don't appreciate them messing with a classic, especially when they don't offer a choice of a second audio channel with the original Dolby mix, as is given with many DVDs. And I don't hold with the trend when remastering movies today of making ordinary gunshots sound like cannon fire.  (And one of the new gunshots is actually not synched with the smoke that comes from Brody's gun.)<p>If I've harped too much on the negative, I should say the video part looks beauiful (a cinematographer's small gaff with the aperture has even been fixed--I assume digitally--for this version) and the music has been, as I said, superbly restored. (This is particularly effective in the underwater music when they find Ben Gardner's boat.) But some key sound effects were dealt with poorly, and I'm surprised 1) the film received such cavalier treatment, and 2) nobody but me seems to have noticed.<p>The disc also includes several theatrical and TV trailers, a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary, and the usual goodies--production photos, storyboards, etc. There are outtakes (just a few and I know there were far more than this in the film) and deleted scenes, including three scenes that *were* included when the film was shown on network TV to add extra running time. But even one of these scenes is not complete on this DVD. I'm referring to Quint's original introduction, where he hums the Ode to Joy while a schoolboy plays it on a clarinet. That scene starts not where the DVD begins but with a shot of Quint exiting his truck, which has his name painted in big letters on the door. This is shown on the DVD as a production still but not in the deleted scenes themselves, for some odd reason. I just wonder why they give you *some* of a deleted scene but not all.<p>As for the story itself, a few things stand out: this film had some terrific dialogue and insightful scenes of family life, throwaway bits that show Spielberg once had a heart and soul. He'd never direct the film like this today, with 2/3 of it over before we get any real action and with endless pages of character exposition. Perhaps this is why I haven't been interested in a Spielberg movie in 20 years. The shark looks very fake in some scenes, but somehow we never seem to care--it still works. There are the usual maddeningly irrational plot points in a Spielberg film: why does the police chief go out with Hooper to look for the shark (when they discover Ben Gardner's boat)? Why does the mayor make such a big deal out of the fact that Hooper can't produce the giant tooth when there's a boat that's clearly had the crap chewed out of it by something? Why does the chief go out with Hooper and Quint at all in a town filled with professional fisherman who cold serve as deckhands? And once on the boat with an increasingly mad and unreasonable Quint, who is endangering everyone, why doesn't Brody put Quint under arrest and with the help of Hooper guide the Orca safely back to shore before Quint trashes it? Would a law enforcement officer really be so passive in that situation?<p>Well, the answer to all of these is because otherwise we'd have a far shorter film and less fun with the shark. Most people will just be thrilled to have Jaws in widescreen (this was the first VHS cassette I ever bought, many years ago, and the dub was horrible), and in larger-than-life sound. So am I, but I wish they'd preserved the original soundtrack mixdown as well. (Note: Watch for quick cameos by author Peter Benchley as a TV reporter and &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; director John Landis as a skinny denim-shirted fisherman who's one of those trying to win Mrs. Kintner's bounty.) (This review refers to the Widescreen 20th Anniversary stereo edition, NOT the DTS edition, which I have not heard and have no knowledge about.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>What can I say. This movie is not only stupid, but also insensitive. Along with the fact that the acting was terrible, and the music was cheesy, I need to add something else. I am, along with being a big cat, hyena, and wolf lover, also a shark lover. Sharks are both cool and beautiful. This piece of trash shows sharks as something they are not-bloodthirsty, sadistic killers who kill for fun and destroy anything they please. Hey, humans. How about the fact that over 1,000,000 sharks died because of humans, but only 100 humans died because of sharks? How about the fact that sharks have difficulties and feelings just like we do? How about the fact that this movie is an attempt to make people hate sharks, when they should be helping them? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who likes this movie is insensitive to the cruelties sharks have had to go through. A message to the director Steven Speilberg-YOU MAKE ME SICK!!!!!!!!!! If it were up to me, every copy of this movie and any other movie meant to make hate to any cool predator would be rocketed into space forever. And I don't give a (BEEP)that many people liked this movie. They just don't see what I see. I can't believe I ever watched this stupid s--t. If you are a shark lover, or an animal lover of any sort, do not see this movie. It is just another way to represent sharks as evil. And Steven Spielberg is a jerk. A very big jerk. Boy, how he makes me PUKE! Anyway, nuff said. Don't see this work of insensitivity.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Jaws is one of the few films that surpasses the novel from which it sprang.  Jaws is a very simple film, without the convoluted side-stories of the book.  A man-eating shark lurks off the beaches of a small island that depends on tourist dollars.  Three men set off in a boat to hunt down and kill the shark, but the sheer size of the animal makes it a struggle for survival.  The film works wonderfully, and is filled with great performances, great filming, and sure direction from Steven Spielberg.  <p>The film doesn't get the credit it deserves, in my opinion.  This is likely because it spawned a number of cut-rate sequels and imitators.  The filming and effects are superb, even by today's standards.  It is well-known that the mechanical shark did not work for most of the shoot, forcing Spielberg to film as a thriller where the shark is only glimpsed most of the time.  In fact, the film benefits from this method because by the time you actually see the shark, you are so immersed in the story that you don't notice the effect.<p>The human performances are consistently good.  The trio at the heart of the action are well cast and have great on-screen chemistry.  The supporting actors are also good.  The photography, much of it on the sea, gives a feeling of menace (beneath the waves) and isolation (one ship on the vast ocean).  And, of course, John William's Oscar-winning soundtrack is a masterpiece of mood.<p>Unfortunately, this DVD is not enough!  The picture and sound are as good as expected.  There is an hour-long documentary on the making of Jaws that is fun and informative.  However....  where's the director's commentary?  A film with as storied a history as this surely deserves a commentary from Spielberg and/or the producers.  There are a couple of cut scenes and outtakes on the disc, but they only fuel a desire for more, especially since the documentary has a number of clips that are not in the film or in the extra material on the DVD.  Therefore, I look forward to an even better DVD sometime in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>Steven Spielberg's first and perhaps greatest masterpiece (of many) also epitomizes the summer blockbuster. His screen realization of JAWS (1975), Peter Benchley's bubblegum novel of a giant shark lurking in the waters off a fictional Massachusetts resort island, occurs during a July 4th holiday weekend.<br /><br />The three main characters are somewhat clich&eacute;d, but the talented actors portraying them manage to keep these men from being laughably cartoonish. Roy Scheider plays a transplant from NYC, the sheriff of an island town surrounded by water who's terrified of the ocean. Richard Dreyfuss is a boy genius icthyologist whose family wealth allows him to turn a hobby, the study of sharks, into a career. Robert Ryan is the crusty sea salt with a tragic past that comes closest to caricature; comparisons to Captain Ahab are apt.<br /><br />By story's conclusion, Ryan joins his prototype in death, the boy has become a man nearly eaten by the Great White he tried to poison, and Scheider learns he actually likes the sea. But what brings them to these ends is unforgettable cinema, and the reason this film was the blockbuster of 1975, a phenomenon that has yet to be equalled in public hysteria and popularity.<br /><br />John Williams' famous score is one of his best, subsequently imitated yet never topped. His music enhances on-screen action and helps turn what could've been an average monster movie into a screen classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Jaws An instant classic,waters would never be safe again or so they say( I love sharks and water).Rod Steiger is excellent and so is dreyfuss and who can forget the captain and Jaws!I still dislike Spielberg but love this movie.</p></br></body></html>

You'd be mostly wrong. Hugo is, instead, at its heart, a film that's about films and the people who love them.<br /><br />The main character is a boy named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who, like most of the French people in this movie, speaks with an English accent. He's been living at the train station ever since his father (a clockmaker), died, leaving him an orphan in the care of his drunken uncle, who maintains all the clocks at the station.<br /><br />Young Hugo takes over the job after his uncle disappears, though this is a secret that isn't known to the station denizens, including the local police chief (Sasha Baron Cohen). He spends his spare time stealing food and occasionally swiping bits of clockwork from an old toy maker (Ben Kingsley). This goes well for him until one day when the toy maker catches him in the act, and finds a notebook on Hugo detailing a clockwork automaton that his father was working on repairing.<br /><br />The toy maker goes a bit bonkers over this, and confiscates it, telling Hugo he's going to burn it. Then his young goddaughter (Chloe Grace Moretz, who thankfully doesn't kill anyone in this film), takes pity on the boy and tries to help him out. They're both surprised to realize that a key she wears around her neck fits into a keyhole on Hugo's clockwork man. They're even more surprised when the image the automaton draws is one of the Man in the Moon with a rocket sticking into his eye. That the girl's godfather is named Georges might start to give some in the audience pause for thought.<br /><br />I loved this film from start to finish, and it's by far the best film I've seen this year. It really does have everything, and oozes a love of film like nothing I've seen in a long time. The power of film to move the audience is explored here in ways I've never seen before, and like any good movie, it does an excellent job of showing me things I've never seen before.<br /><br />I also greatly enjoyed the fact that the movie takes time to slow down and explore all the supporting characters. The policeman, the flower girl, the newspaper seller, the woman at the cafe. They all get their own stories, and those add something wonderful to the film, and something sadly lacking in most movies that can't wait to get to the next explosion and haven't time for character development for their main characters, much less supporting ones.<br /><br />The 3D effects must be addressed. I'm not a fan of 3D, not even remotely. I find it a distraction, for the most part, and generally regard it as a way for movie studios to pad out their profits. It's generally unnecessary and adds nothing to the plot. Even in the best 3D film I've seen before this, Avatar, it wasn't that much more than a gimmick, though one used to good effect.<br /><br />In this film, though, it really does add something. It really does give a whole new dimension to the movie. I guess this isn't a surprise with a filmmaker like Scorsese. In his hands, this isn't a distraction, and it isn't a gimmick. I'm willing to bet that the film is just fine without 3D, but with it, it really becomes something unique and fascinating. If all 3D films were this good, I'd be less unhappy with them.<br /><br />Hugo is a masterpiece. Look for it to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars and for Ben Kinglesy as Best Actor. Yes, it's that time of the year again. :) Also, this movie is doing very poorly at the box office, so if you can, go see it in the theaters. You'll be happy you did.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Snuggling in for a night at the movies with my kiddos and a blanket was the name of the game last night; and `Hugo' was on my big screen.  Yup, I finally got around to watching this Oscar frontrunner (and winner of 5 Oscars) and I must say that I was wholly satisfied.  It is magically and charming and entertaining and really a very fun and inspired ode to filmmaking in general, and it is easy to see Martin Scorsese the man coming through in almost every frame.  This is a family film, for sure, but it has so much maturity and depth of spirit that it doesn't feel like a children's film.<br /><br />`Hugo' tells the story of orphan Hugo Cabret.  Hugo's father passed away and since his death Hugo has been living with his drunkard uncle and working the clocks at a train station.  His uncle has disappeared and Hugo has basically been stealing for his meals and stealing for his hobby.  You see, before his father died he found an unwanted automaton and both he and Hugo were attempting to fix it.  Hugo carried on this work, stealing from a toy merchant in the train station to find little mechanics needed to complete his task.  He's soon sniffed out by the merchant and punished, made to work off his thievery, and in the process he starts to uncover a greater truth in that little automaton he held so dear to his heart.<br /><br />The `message from his father' led him to an even greater discovery.<br /><br />Visually, `Hugo' is a feast.  The Oscar winning production design is truly eye catching.  You can't help but feel consumed by the flawlessly detailed train station and the simple yet heartwarming living arrangements.  The grandeur of the movies is captured in flashbacks and set pieces alike; and the grace of center stage illuminates the film's heart-tugging finale.  I did feel that the CGI embellishments were a tad overdone.  In some of the scenes I felt like I was watching a stop motion film, and I didn't like the way it took me out of the human appearance of the film.  Some of the sequences didn't work as intended (small moments, like when Isabelle falls in the station or the sudden `belief' in Rene's eyes) but overall there is a total emersion of grace and delight that overtakes nearly every frame of `Hugo'.  The acting is hit or miss, which is sad.  Chloe Moretz acts too hard.  You can always see her thinking about her next move.  Nothing is graceful and she holds her face in an awkward way that always tells us she's `in character'.  Asa Butterfield, on the other hand, is a wonderful actor.  While this performance was not as sincere as the one he gave in `08's `The Boy In the Striped Pajamas', he really understands how to convey emotion.  I felt that he botched his first teary outburst (pleading with Isabelle's god-mother for answers) but he nailed his final one; the most important.  Sacha Baron Cohen was awful, but Ben Kingsley was WONDERFUL.  You see, hit or miss.  It really is like that for everyone.<br /><br />As many have noted, this is Scorsese's homage to film restoration, which is his big charity these days.  I back him one hundred percent.  It is a shame when great films are lost to the rest of us.  That only breeds youth who are removed from the greatness that cinema has to offer.  I'm intent on my children growing up to appreciate film of all kinds, and so I truly appreciate the stance that Scorsese is making.  `Hugo' definitely touches upon that concern, especially in the final act.  It can get a little too direct (it almost felt like a script upheaval for a moment, to be honest) but Scorsese finds a way to balance it back out.<br /><br />In the end, `Hugo' is a delightful film.  It is flawed, sure, but it is truly a moving picture that has a sparkle one won't soon forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>In this wonderfully inventive film, director Martin Scorsese incorporates two different genres into one great story.  The first half of the film deals with a young boy who is orphaned and adopted by his drunken Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone).  Claude is responsible for keeping all of the clocks wound and in proper working order at a huge Paris train station.  Young Hugo (Asa Butterfield) learns how to do this and after his uncle disappears, manages to keep the clocks working.  He lives where he works deep in the belly of the station.  The only thing Hugo has from his father (Jude Law in flashbacks) is a robotic like machine called an automatron.  Since the inner workings of the machine function much like a windup clock, Hugo is constantly trying to get it to function again.  This requires guile, skill and stealing parts.  One of Hugo's victims is the owner of a trinket shop.  This grouchy old man named George is played by Ben Kingsley.  George and his wife however are the Godparents of another young orphan named Isabelle (Chloe Moretz).  She and Hugo create a bond and get into mischief and eventually detective work.  Both are enamored by magic and George was once a great magician as it turns out.  This set up segues to another creative style in which we discover that George is actually famed movie pioneer George Melies.<br /><br />Scorsese is one of the great film historians in addition to being an iconic director and puts in much time and effort into presenting Melies contribution to film.  He was instrumental in giving the new medium a sense of illusion.  Magic and trickery?  Of course.  Movies and magic.  Melies grumpiness is mostly attributed to his departure from the industry after WW I.  The reason is unclear, although the public's lack of interest as suggested seems overstated.  Hugo sets out to bring George the attention he deserves, if many years later.  He enlists the help of a film expert who knows Melies' work but believed he had died years earlier.  The ending is sweet and predictable but also a perfect conclusion to a magical film.  I saw this film in 3-D which was some of the best work this "trickery" has to offer.  A perfect partnership.<br /><br />The Blu ray version of this film is equal to the quality or the original.  The 1080p transfer is shown with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and frankly leaves nothing to be desired.  The film is enjoyable and full of visual treats.  This is reference quality as it the remarkable DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundstage.  This entire disc is demo quality, so keep it handy to show your friends.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese is a well respected director known for R-rated films usually revolving around crime or gangsters in some capacity. Saying the F-word nearly 300 times in one movie, stabbing someone with a pen, flushing a stash down the toilet, getting whacked, getting blown up, and getting your mind blown to such extremities in the last twenty minutes of a feature that you win an Oscar for it even though somebody already made that movie before; these are the things that come to mind when you think of Scorsese. Scorsese hadn't really worked with children much over his career or at least not to this extent. So that was interesting to keep in mind when Hugo started making the rounds. A family friendly Martin Scorsese film seems so surreal, but is more than a worthy addition to an already overflowing resume full of fantastic cinema.<br /><br />It takes a while for Hugo to really get going, but it's certainly beautiful in the meantime. The film is a visual spectacle while each frame is an absolute joy to look at. You're taken through the intricate insides of various clocks at a train station; seeing their gears move as the use of steam adds just the right amount of mystery. It's not so much the fact that Hugo is slow because it isn't. There's this veil of mystery that isn't lifted until Hugo (Asa Butterfield) finally caves and tells his story. The various clocks and train station setting keeps you occupied and the long introduction with no dialogue is extremely noteworthy. It's just for nearly half the film, you have all these elements (clocks, the train station, a notebook, an automaton, and Hugo's father) without much of a connection. But it does all come together in extraordinary fashion.<br /><br />The cast is really superb. Asa Butterfield is so passionate and emotional. Those blue eyes of his tell the story better than words ever could. Chloe Grace Moretz is so optimistic and eager for a chance at an adventure. You can't help but adore the Isabelle character. Sacha Baron Cohen seems to step way out of his element here. The Station Inspector seems like a complete 180 from Bruno or Borat, but his sense of humor is still in his performance. He just happens to have a bit more depth in comparison. Ben Kingsley's Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s goes through such a transformation in the film though that he's able to display such a wide range of emotion. He plays the broken old man impeccably.<br /><br />There are times when movies affect you in a way that let you know they are special. For me, it's like I'm suddenly overcome by a wide range of emotions that make me want to laugh, cry, scream at the top of my lungs, and the overwhelming sensation of never wanting that moment or the movie to end. I'm not ashamed to say I felt that a few times during Hugo. James Cameron called Hugo a masterpiece and it's really difficult to argue with that. There isn't a weak point in the cast, the visuals are outstanding, and you find yourself connecting to the story. You're sucked into this world right from the start. Hugo is one of the most beautiful and charming films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/AAZRWLML88IZK.html">AAZRWLML88IZK</a><br/><p>The 84th Academy Awards are officially in our collective rear view mirror, and though Hugo didn't take home statues for any of the top honors, Martin Scorsese's love letter to the cinema did score a solid five Oscars. Based on the best-selling Brian Selznick novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, the film stars Asa Butterfield as the titular boy, the orphaned son of a clockmaker who loved the films of Georges Melies. In his quest to repair the mysterious automaton that his late father left behind, Hugo befriends a young girl named Isabelle whose toymaker godfather may or may not be intimately connected to his father's automaton. Lavishly shot in 3D, Hugo evokes a strong sense of cinematic nostalgia, demonstrating Martin Scorsese's very personal love for the magic of the movies, and it's a delightful treat for all families, whether they're full of cinephiles or not. Now, it is available in Blu-ray 3D, but whether or not it will be able to duplicate the lush effects seen in theaters is still sort of up in the air; here's hoping they re-release it for a post-Oscar run.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>A film about film-making, or about a slice of life in the history of film-making and filmmakers, must always be an appealing subject for any director, and especially for a quirky and historically-immersed director like Martin Scorsese. We are all children of the film age (including Hugo and the other children who pop up in this film) and thus it was interesting to see as the "plot" unfolded how film began to be used the movies as a modern metaphor for humankind's imaginations, of its dreams and of the process of going from disbelief to the suspension of disbelief that is part of any film experience, including this film.<br /><br />As for the film itself, based on an adaptation of novelistic treatment of the wonder of discovery, of invention, and of pure fantasy inherent in trying to make dreams come to life it works pretty well. And to place that challenge in the hands of a child just adds to the effect. One might argue, and should, that the length of the film including its little redundancies (the constant background shots of the railroad station and it inhabitants) could reasonably have been shorter by about fifteen minutes. And, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that it really does take film's magical suspension of disbelief techniques to take a plot that is centered in Paris while the cast speaks the Queen's English making one think that we could have been in the center of London just as easily. Other than those minor points this film was entertaining. And isn't that what film should be all about. That is what its founders thought anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>Great actors, script, sets and CG for a detailed realistic experience of a fantastic nostalgic story. Love silents and this Georges Melies eulogy is truly wonderful in all respects. Hooray for Martin Scorsese. Another Ben Kingsly success, Baron Sacha Cohen's best role, and Asa Butterfield was fabulous. Now have seen this movie 4 times and it is just the beginning of a long relationship. My only criticism is the scene when Hugo he starts up the ladder and ends up going down into the clock. What did I miss?</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>A young boy lives in a train station, and spends his days eluding the station inspector. He befriends a girl, and together they try to understand the meaning of a mechanical man left behind by the boy's father upon his death. Martin Scorsese has long been a great storyteller and he has now established himself as a master of the 3D effect. The visuals in this film are remarkable, without being a blatant attempt at cashing in on the 3D fad. With good acting all around, the performance that stands out is that of Chloe Moretz, one of the best young actresses in Hollywood. Her subtle expressions throughout add to the charm of this film. The film's intricate storyline may not keep younger children entertained for two hours, but for older kids and adults Hugo is a magical journey of discovery and visual wonders.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>HUGO is a strange film. It purports to be for children despite the fact that the screenplay written by Josh Logan based of the book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick has more references to words and people and events that children would not relate to on the same level as adults. It is a spectacle in the order of director Martin Scorsese with some of the most beautiful contraptions and mechanical wonders ever filmed.  It seems in many ways to be an homage to the history of filmmaking in the manner in which the rather disjointed story is presented.  Likely it comes across better in 3D than on the small flat screen.  Not that the film is without special merits: there are many moments of impressive philosophical values, child/parent relationships, and a few comedic turns.  The cast is solid if somewhat underused in this visual mechanical Parisian extravaganza spectacle, but it well worth watching as pure entertainment  - and that is really OK!<br /><br />The story is well known: Hugo (Asa Butterflied) is a lad whose inventor father (Jude Law) salvaged a broken automaton from a museum to fix it but dies before accomplishing that: his Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a drunk, is let in charge of the lad.  Hugo is soon left alone in the bizarre train station in Paris where he tends to the multiple clocks, misses his beloved father, and fends for himself by shoplifting food and a few `parts'. He is caught by a rather glum Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s (Ben Kingsley) who runs a toy store while bemoaning his current lack of the thrill of living, despite the nurturing he receives from his wife (Helen McCrory) and his adopted daughter Isabelle (Chlo? Grace Moretz) who longs for adventures.  In time Hugo and Isabelle become fast friends and discover the secrets held by Georges and it is through their efforts that joy and the dreams of the aged filmmaker are resurrected.<br /><br />There are some sidebars - an injured WW I veteran who serves as Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who dreams of the attention of the flower lady Lisette (Emily Mortimer), Madame Emile (Frances de la Tour) who sips coffee while tending her dog and attracting the attention of the hefty Monsieur Frick (Richard Griffiths), cinema devotee and historian Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg) who opens the doors to the mysteries that have collected during the story), and the odd Rene Tabard (Christopher Lee) who part is questionable.<br /><br />The cast is strong - especially the children - and the special effects are very lovely to watch.  The film takes us to the land of fantasy and it is worthwhile trip. Though the film seems to be impressed with itself and the revelation of the history of cinema, it offers many pleasures. Not sure it is a DVD to buy, though.  Grady Harp, February 12</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo' is his first family friendly entertainment, but just like all of his endeavors, his film pays dirt.  Filled with passion, innocence, yet shrouded in mystery, 'Hugo' works well by its own merits, but, having seen it in 3-D, it can't be said enough how much the enchanting story unfolds like a flowing pop-up book.  (While 'Avatar' wins the prize for being elaborate, 'Hugo's 3-D experience is more worthwhile, my best to date.)<br /><br />It is the camera lens that gives us such a wide-eyed (pun intended) view about an orphaned boy who works the clocks at a Parisian train station while trying to uncode a message from his late father.  Besides his dire circumstances, he must contend with two nemeses:  One is from the toy vendor (Ben Kingsley) at one of the train's stands and a policeman (Sacha Baron Cohen) who patrols the depot and is fond of coralling wayward orphans.<br /><br />The story is embellished by some love interests, including an unlikely girl who becomes Hugo's companion, a flower vendor (Emily Mortimer), and the toy purveyor's wife.<br /><br />Not only do the 3-D effects unveil some breathtaking cinematography, but the way both the screenwriter and Scorsese unfold secret messages, secret identities, and secret hideaways, make for a treasure chest of a movie.<br /><br />As has been stated elsewhere, 'Hugo' is a tribute to moviemaking, but it does its best work by its own merits.  'Hugo' is a triumph of filmaking and antecedently a tribute to all the geniuses, particularly one early one, who have made films a worthy and sometimes thrilling art form.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>HUGO begins from a high altitude perspective over Paris. After centering on a long-distance view of Montparnasse railway station, the lens zooms-in over the city's streets and rooftops, enters the station from the track side, swoops along a platform between two trains and among scurrying travelers, comes into the station's arrivals and departures hall, and finally comes to a stop in a close-up of a set of young eyes peering out from behind a large clock set high on the concourse wall. The alluring imagery of the film is immediate.<br /><br />Date stamped by one particular real event that takes place late in the plot, the year is no later than 1929, though an on-line summary of the movie places it in the early 1930s. Never mind, it's pretty much irrelevant to an appreciation of this bravura production.<br /><br />The story centers on the 12-year old orphan, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who, after a lifetime of familial misfortune, alone maintains the huge station's clocks while living inside the building's forgotten infrastructure. His presence has gone unsuspected by Station Inspector Gustav (Sacha Baron Cohen), a bitter and pitiless wounded war veteran who walks with the aid of a dodgy leg brace, and who dedicates his time-on-duty apprehending - with the aid of a big, black Doberman - parentless children wandering the great terminus and packing them off to an orphanage. Hugo's secret existence is precarious as he steals food from the Montparnasse's food vendors and tools and small gears from the owner (Ben Kingsley) of a toy repair booth located within the station. Young Cabret uses the stolen items from the repair shop to attempt to fix a non-functioning automaton from his deceased father's former clock shop. Once again operable, Hugo hopes the mechanical figure will do ... well, something ... that may somehow prove to be a message from his Dear But Dead Ol' Dad.<br /><br />HUGO is Martin Scorcese's tribute to the ground-breaking French illusionist-turned-film maker Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who, between 1896 and 1913, directed - and often stared in - some 531 short (1-40 minute) silent films, most of which have since been lost. Georges himself, I suspect, is virtually unknown by most of the public except a knowledgeable few in the film industry, though any one may have seen, at some point in life, a scene from his film "Le Voyage dans la Lune" ("A Trip to the Moon"), that of a canon-fired spaceship hitting a humanized Moon in the right eye.<br /><br />The visual presentation of HUGO is positively magical, especially as rendered in the 3-D format. Unusual camera perspectives linger lovingly on moving gears and machine parts, clock pendulums, abandoned labyrinthine spaces (within the Montparnasse infrastructure), as well as the chaotic and crowded ambiance of the station's public areas.<br /><br />Students of film will appreciate the significant inclusion of rescued, archival footage from M&eacute;li&egrave;s's silents.<br /><br />HUGO was the first of a cinematic doubleheader attended by my wife and I on Christmas Day, the second being the latest Mission Improbable episode, GHOST PROTOCOL. As gripping an action film as the latter is, I wouldn't bother to attend it again or review it. HUGO, however, I would see once more (at least) just for the utter delight it brought me - that same delight a child experiences on first gazing upon a fireworks display, or first holding a puppy, or perhaps first eating an ice cream. A delight that comes less often as we age. It's the purest reason for seeing any moving picture show, and the reason for their making that M&eacute;li&egrave;s understood and Scorcese understands.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>As Martin Scorsese enters the twilight of his career he continues to challenge himself as an artist and challenging the audience along with him.  I can think of three primary goals Scorsese had in mind making "Hugo".  Firstly he wanted to advance the 3-D technological process but in turn he imbued it with heart that distinguishes "Hugo" from "Transformers" and their ilk.  Secondly he wanted to make a family film that not only engages the children but allows adults to appreciate the subtleties.  Lastly he wanted to promote his pet cause of film preservation and in turn resurrecting the legacy of French silent filmmaker George Melies.  Scorsese has assembled an impressive cast but special mention should be made for the youngest actors, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, whose work here belies their tender years.  There are innumerable riches that can be mined in "Hugo".  The star rating system does it no justice.  "Hugo" is an instant classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Hugo, the latest film from cinematic maestro Martin Scorsese, is both his first film geared for families and his first film shot in 3D. While many noteworthy directors have been weary of the new format, some greats have embraced it and been eager to try it. James Cameron, not the inventor of 3D but certainly a recent innovator, upon seeing Hugo, called it the best use of 3D he'd seen. No matter what your thoughts on 3D may be, this is no small feat coming from this man. The film, based on the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick and with a screenplay by John Logan, who also penned Scorsese's The Aviator, Hugo is largely billed as a family film but it's worth noting that the film's biggest fans will probably be adults, although there's enough whimsical fantasy to tug at the heartstrings of even the most jaded child.<br /><br />Hugo largely takes place in the early 1930s at a Paris railway station. Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a young boy whose father (Jude Law), a clockmaker, dies suddenly in a fire. His alcoholic Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone) is responsible for maintaining the clocks at the railway station and teaches Hugo how to do so before taking an indefinite leave of absence. Hugo, left all alone, lives within the walls of the train station, maintaining the clocks, acquiring food by stealing, and spending his free time trying to fix the automaton his father left behind. The automaton is a mechanical man that, once wound up, is supposed to write; his father found it difficult to fix and it's Hugo's mission to see that it finally works. To successfully accomplish this goal, Hugo steals mechanical parts from a toyshop owner named Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), a callused, angry old man who eventually catches Hugo and steals his blueprints that guide him in fixing the automaton. Hopeless, Hugo befriends Isabelle (Chlo? Grace Moretz), Georges goddaughter, and begins to uncover the mystery of Papa Georges cinematic past. The film co-stars Sacha Baron Cohen as the feared Station inspector, who will happily whisk Hugo away to the orphanage if he catches him and Christopher Lee as a generous librarian who specializes in finding a good home for books.<br /><br />Hugo is without a doubt the most visual film that Scorsese has ever directed. Armed with a large budget, the film is heavy on CGI yet moves with the grace of a silent film. The production design by Dante Ferretti and the art direction, credited to ten people, is luxurious and Oscar-worthy, although I confess that it's hard to differentiate between reality and CGI at times. The look, among other things, is completely different from anything Scorsese has made before. The man that directed such gritty films as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver has had a much smoother style in recent years with films like The Departed and Shutter Island, but until now Scorsese has never made a movie that could truly be described as a visual feast for the eyes. As for the story, it's easy to see what made Scorsese respond so strongly to it but taken at face-value it's a rich, lovely fairy tale with shades of Charles Dickens. Of course, in true Scorsese fashion, it's also a history of and love letter to cinema with the importance of film preservation being a theme at the forefront of it all.<br /><br />The performances are great all around, striking and heartbreaking. Butterfield carries the emotional weight of the character well, while Moretz continues to establish herself as one of the best child actors working today. Kingsley delivers a performance that is, at first, cold but gradually turns to sympathetic. Cohen is quietly hilarious but brings genuine pathos to his role. It's a memorable performance that proves what a gifted actor he is and it's worthy of an Oscar-nomination, although if anyone is nominated it will likely be Kingsley and deservedly so.<br /><br />As Hugo is very much a cinematic love letter to early cinema, young children may be bored by it. It has enough magical imagery, but I'm not sure how successfully it could capture some people's ADD-riddled attention spans. It's one of the most classic-feeling modern films I've seen, which could be good or bad depending on your perspective. However, it's a joyous film that both children and adults should give a fair shake.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, Hugo is one of the best films of the year. Who else but Scorsese, well-known as such an incredibly passionate lover of film, could make such a wondrous film about the wonder of film? It's a celebration of all that cinema can be, as well as where cinema came from. It illustrates the progression between cinema being made of dreams to becoming the thing dreams are made of. It's amazing that a major studio would release this film at a time when major studios are largely considered creatively bankrupt. In making a film that celebrates early, silent cinema Scorsese seems to be winking at the audience by creating a film that could not exist without modern technology. Hugo is a perpetually heartwarming and smile-inducing film. Beautiful, not just aesthetically, it's a triumph of spirit; a soulful, magical masterpiece that actually brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />GRADE: A<br /><br />As for the 3D; I've always preferred to see 3D used as the gimmick that it is rather than seeing an attempt to be artistic with it. I was not impressed by James Cameron's Avatar and have only seen it used with true purpose in Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams. Truth be told, I have not been particularly impressed with any use of it I've seen thus far. That changed with Hugo. Scorsese does not use it as a gimmick, but as a way to provide the film with an additional dimension and deepen one's immersion into the overall experience. Would this film still function as magically without it? Yes, it would. Does this use of 3D actually add something to the experience? Undoubtedly. While 3D is still not a fad that I'm particularly hip to, it's good to see a director trying to use it with purpose and actually succeeding.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese is primarily known for two things: making gritty, true-to-life movies (usually set in New York City) that chronicle violence and human chaos in all its nasty forms; and loving, utterly treasuring, the art of cinema.  HUGO belongs firmly in the latter category.  It's a movie about movies; moreover, it's a movie about cherishing movies, a summation of an entire art form from one of its most devoted admirers.<br /><br />There is a plot here, of course: young Orphan Hugo hides in the walls of a train station, working the clocks and carrying for a robotic figure his father found in a museum.  He steals parts from a local toymaker to keep up the machine; when the toymaker catches Hugo in the act, he steals the boy's pocketbook, and Hugo sets out to get it back, with the aid of the old man's goddaughter, Isabelle.<br /><br />If you simply want a family movie, then HUGO will work sufficiently.  It has a plot; it moves along at a decent pace.  But to truly appreciate how magnificent this film is, you have to approach it from an entirely different point of view: that of a film lover.  This is, in effect, a very serious, very moving, very effective film.  The acting from the two child leads, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, is nothing short of wonderful; child actors are usually a sticking point for me, but Scorsese knows how to ring a fine performance from all of his actors (it doesn't hurt that both have already proven themselves to be talented up-and-comers).  Ben Kingsley delivers one of his best performances in years (perhaps of his entire career).  Other supporting players get to shine in their brief roles: Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Helen McCrory, Michael Stuhlbarg, Frances de la Tour, and Richard Griffiths (it's a whole HARRY POTTER reunion) all make significant, even if minor, contributions.  Sacha Baron Cohen, as the single-minded (and strongly anti-orphan) Station Inspector, provides some of the film's weaker moments; not Cohen himself, as his performance is dependably strong, but more the character, whose slapstick shenanigans try to remind us that this is a family film.  (Cohen is clearly aware of this, and provides decent bursts of humor elsewhere, and yes, some of it tends to lean towards the "young adult" spectrum of things; younger children, fortunately, probably won't catch on, and adults will get a good belly-laugh.)<br /><br />But the true heart of HUGO lies beyond the casting.  It's Oscar-winning effects are utterly dazzling (and I only saw it in 2D; when I finally see it in 3D, as it's intended, I think my heart will stop with pure joy).  The cinematography is also just spellbinding, and also Oscar-winning (the film took home five statues, all for more technical aspects, which is appropriate because this is one of those films where even more casual movie-goers will notice things like lighting and score). Everything comes back to Scorsese's lovelorn directing; he's a man with a crush, and he's writing a brilliant love note that goes far beyond "check yes or no."  HUGO may not be Scorsese's best film, but it is certainly his most special.  Anyone with a pulse can feel the love here--and it is real, genuine, and reciprocated in full.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese offers audiences a film absolutely like none of his others, a truly heart-felt valentine to the early history of cinema and of a young boy's indefatigable search for a hidden message from his deceased father in 1920s Paris; "Hugo", based on Brian Selznick's bestselling children's tale "The Invention of Hugo Cabret". It is Scorsese's most personal, and most poignant, film, and is certainly among those destined to be remembered as his finest in long, quite distinguished, star-studded cinematic career. Working with a talented team of actors led by Sir Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee, and a technical crew led by visual effects guru Rob Legato ("Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" and "Avatar") and film composer Howard Shore ("The Lord of The Rings"), Scorsese has rendered a cinematic vision of Paris as vividly magical as the futuristic worlds of "Star Trek" or the fantasy realm of "Middle Earth"; a vision that is still most apt even in the two-dimensional version that I saw recently.<br /><br />The young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) runs afoul of toy store owner Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s  (Ben Kingsley) in the main Parisian railroad station, as he tries repairing an automaton found by his late father (played with utmost warmth and sincerity by Jude Law), believing it may disclose his father's hidden message. Winning the sympathy and friendship of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' goddaughter Isabelle (Chlo? Grace Moretz), and Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee), the train station's book seller, young Hugo soon makes an electrifying discovery of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' almost forgotten past as one of the world's greatest film directors in the early infancy of cinema. Moretz's warm, radiant, performance nearly steals every scene she is in, though there are great performances too from Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Michael Stuhlbarg (as the fictional film historian Rene Tabard), Helen McCrory (as M&eacute;li&egrave;s' wife Mama Jeanne), Emily Mortimer (Lisette, the train station's flower shop owner) and Sacha Baron Cohen (as the World War I-injured Station Inspector, with whom Hugo has problems with too). This is an emotionally riveting tearjerker of a film that will leave audiences spellbound, especially pre-adolescent children and adults; whose visual and musical styles are more similar to Hollywood classics from the 1930s and early 1940s than any contemporary family-oriented film in recent memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>HUGO (2011, prod. Johnny Depp and Martin Scorsese, dir. Martin Scorsese, 127 minutes, based on the novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439813786">The Invention of Hugo Cabret</a> by Brain Selznick) is one of those films that makes me envy the very young, who are just old enough to have been taken to see it by their parents, and appreciate it. They will grow, and in middle age and beyond, will think back on it with nostalgia. And they will watch it repeatedly.<br /><br />It also reminded me of my childhood in a way that made me catch at my breath.<br /><br />Hugo Cabret (an enchanting, old-souled Asa Butterfield) is a lonely boy living inside the walls and the attic of the Paris train station. Having been taught by his watchmaker father (Jude Law) about all things mechanical, and by his uncle (Ray Winstone) to maintain all the clocks perfectly, he lives a lonely, spooked life. He steals his daily food, tends the clocks, and tries to bring an automaton back to life.<br /><br />This clockwork 'android' - discovered by his father in a museum shortly before his untimely death in a freak fire - holds a magical mystery that the boy must unravel. (It is based on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FDGU0E">The Jaquet-Droz automatons</a>, built between 1768 and 1774 and still in working order today.)<br /><br />Set in a shop inside the station is a bitter old man (Ben Kingsley), who sells toys, magic tricks and repairs clockworks. Hugo steals from him regularly, because this man has the parts Hugo needs to finish fixing the automaton. This old man happens to be the legendary magician and filmmaker Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s.<br /><br />I will spoil a little and tell you: the train station is the Gare Montparnasse. Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s did in fact work as a toymaker at that station after World War I. The spectacular derailment scene (in Hugo's dream) is a reference to the famous 1895 derailment at the station - and a reference to the great train crash from one of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' films.<br /><br />This rich, kinematic-cinematic joy will teach you first of all that there is life beyond HARRY POTTER. It will show you colors you thought you'd forgotten and make you feel what you thought you could no longer feel. It will make you laugh and cry. It will become a part of you. Set in the late 1920s, it is rich in visual flashes of our true history: the films of M&eacute;li&egrave;s, movie posters of everything from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Y4MJA">Judex (Deluxe Edition)</a> (see my review) to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNOLGE">FANTOMAS</a> to Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd (famous scenes from their films are featured), the streets of Paris as you've never seen them.<br /><br />You will see Sir Ben Kingsley give his greatest performance since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00190N4E4">Gandhi</a> - and it will make you feel as warm as a mug of hot chocolate to see him in full, glorious action again. Things will puzzle you: who exactly was Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s? (He was very real and you'll see plenty of scenes from his movies.) Did they really make ladies' heels out of repurposed old film? What's the deal with Christopher Lee and Sacha Baron Cohen? - all reminiscent of questions kids ask after seeing a magic show.<br /><br />Trust me, you'll not have seen magic like this too often, and it is a darned shame we don't see it often enough. If only all films were like this - it even gives you the lineage of great magic: Robert Houdin, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s (which leads to the unmentioned Harry Houdini). The ending cannot be spoilt, yet I have a feeling you might know what it is already.<br /><br />Get this. Please, get it and immerse yourself, treat yourself to it. History - and magic, and the history of magic and film - never so easy, so fun or so deep. Even the pointless 3D can be ignored if you fancy.<br /><br />With the delightful talents of Chlo? Grace Moretz, Emily Mortimer, Helen McRory, Frances de la Tour, and Richard Griffiths.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I just had to get in my 5-stars.<br /><br />This film didn't win 5 Tech Oscars for no reason; Scorcese has crafted a very personal film; his devotion to film preservation is no secret to anyone.<br />The lovely story of Hugo Cabret is perfect subject matter for a man who finally decided to make a film his kids could watch. I never read the book, but the film, as presented, created a magical world. Indeed, the work of Melies may have gone forgotten.<br /><br />I'm sure many who are not serious film aficianados may not understand its importance, but the story being told should suffice. There are good characters, good script, fine acting and excellent direction, pulling all these elements together. Oscar-winning production values are reason enough to watch "Hugo", and Scorcese's loving homage may resonate with those who know the power of film.<br /><br />I've always had a particular affection for films seen through the eyes of kids; kids see so much more, and more simply...probably more like it is. The difference is that kids choose what is most important at the time, and Hugo makes good decisions.<br /><br />It's a marvelous family film.

This gets lampshaded by one particular scene, where the audience watches a scene where a train pulls into a station and flips out, as they think the train is coming for them. Yet, given the subject matter, it only seems inevitable that a man like Martin would think up such an idea for such a plot, anyway.<br /><br />Based off the book "The Invention of Hugo Cabret", which is a stunning mix of hand drawings and writing, and set in 1920s Paris, the film "Hugo" tells the story of Hugo Cabret, a young orphan who works and lives in the clock tower of a train station, which is ruled by a ruthless inspector, and is also where he has been stealing several toys for their parts to fix a broken automaton, made for the movies of Georges M&eacute;il&egrave;s. One day, when caught trying to steal a toy, the owner notices Hugo's notebook, which contains conceptual sketches for the automaton, and steals it, to which Hugo tries to get back.<br /><br />But Hugo instead meets Uncle Georges' adoptive daughter, who helps him try to get the notebook back. But through all this, they both end up in the mystery surrounding the automaton, and movies. Isabelle hasn't seen a movie, and after a stint in a cinema, they find out that film itself is what keeps drawing them closer and closer in this spider's web... and so begins an adventure for the two where they discover themselves, the joy of movies, and the need to stick together in the face of adversity.<br /><br />Wow... What a film. Honestly, I don't think I've seen a movie like this at all. I always knew you could count on Marty to blow your mind, and here he really has outdone himself. I was left speechless after the movie- honestly I don't think I've been left with that feeling in ages.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is just brilliant. First, the acting is STELLAR. Asa Butterfield plays the titular character so heartbreakingly beautifully. He puts so much pain and emotion into his performance that it's as mesmerizing as it is heartbreaking. He is a great actor with the eyes too, and he really showed it here... Every melancholy expression of his had me on the verge of tears (and I'm a very manly guy!!!). Moertz... Well, we knew she was amazing when we saw her in Kick-Ass!, and she is especially brilliant here. Cohen is his usual funny self, let's face it: he was made for the comic roles. He does brilliantly here. But best of all is Kingsley... Oh man. Word to all directors ever: if you don't want your audience reduced to sobbing messes, never have Ben Kingsley play a broken old man, ever. We all know he's an amazing actor. But here, he gives his most devastatingly beautiful performance ever. I cried in a few places, he is that phenomenal.<br /><br />The plot? Well, you knew already it's great. But my synopsis does not do it justice, believe me. Absolutely beautifully done.<br /><br />The cinematography is perfect, and the 3D is amazing. This is the best 3D I've seen in any movie, ever. It helps tell the story, for once- it helps a movie about the magic of filmmaking, that should say something. This must be seen in a 3D cinema, I mean that. Every single detail is exposed, there's several moments where its like you're looking through a window. I think Scorsese made a wise choice to shoot in 1:85.1, too. That helped give the movie the old timey feel it aimed for. I will definitely add this film to my Blu ray collection, even if it's just to show off my HD equipment for family members visiting in the future.<br /><br />And another thing- the feel of the movie is perfect. This is a film made for us who go to a movie to immerse ourselves in it. To escape from reality and indulge in this world being brought forth to us. Not since TRON: Legacy have we gotten a film as magical as that, and I did not want this movie to end at all.<br /><br />In short, do not miss this film. If you're tired of brainless blockbusters and dialogue driven movies that turn them into videotaped plays, and want a film that sums up why we go to the cinema, see this movie. You will regret having missed it, if you don't, and that I guarantee.<br /><br />Bravo, Scorsese. You have re-proved yourself as a favourite filmmaker of mine.<br /><br />OVERALL: 10/10<br /><br />THE GOOD: Everything!<br /><br />THE BAD: ...the fact that it had to end. :(</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese's beautiful film based on Brian Selznic's "The Invention of Hugo Cabret" (screenplay by Josh Logan) is full of gears and timepieces both large and small.  It's riddled with a rich, porous, dream-like fabric that in the end is a celebration of the birth of cinema itself.<br /><br />The story, set in 1930s Paris, is about Hugo, a fatherless boy whose drunken uncle brings him to the train station and teaches him how to run the giant clocks.  The kid is a natural, having learned the mechanics of maintenance and repair from his father.  So when his uncle disappears, Hugo keeps the clocks running.  Always on the run from a station inspector who collects strays and sends them to an orphanage, Hugo eventually becomes involved with an elderly toy merchant and discovers a secret about the man, birth of cinema as an art form and why movies are dreams made real (or at least reel).<br /><br />The 3-D, which I usually hate, is magnificent and most appropriate here.  It greatly enhances the film's extraordinary, multi-layered, dreamy patina from start to finish. And make no mistake, the 2-D version is more than fine.  Steam Punk fans will also find a vibe to enjoy in this sometimes slow, uneven, but heartfelt and beautiful celebration of why movies matter.  And to what level the artistry aspires.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Hugo(released Nov/11) stars Ben Kingsley  as George Melies,Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret,Chlo? Grace Moretz as Isabelle,Sacha Baron Cohen as Inspector Gustave,Jude Law as Hugo's father,Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse,and an astounding supporting cast of other actors.This is a nostalgic look back at film making's earliest days and how a young boy is the catalyst for one its most honoured creator's deserved return to the limelight.Beautifully photographed and set decorated,this piece almost immediately brings you into the film titled young boys life and world,and from there the adventure never stops building to its inevitable climax.<br />The story takes place,I would guess,in the late 20s.Hugo is a young boy living with his father,who works in a museum.Hugo has become a tinkerer of sorts,like his father,and both work together on repairing and bringing back to life an automaton Hugo's father claimed from the museum's basement.One night his father is fatally caught in a conflagration at the museum and Hugo is forced to go and live with his inebriated uncle.The uncle tends the clock works at the Gare Montparnasse,the central train station in Paris.And when his uncle is away,which is quite often,it is left up to Hugo to pick up the slack.Eventually his uncle is found dead,and he is left an orphan.<br />When Hugo has down time he works away at the automaton.He regularly scrounges parts from an old man who runs a small toy store in the train station.One day the man catches the boy and Hugo is forced to empty his pockets.Among the items the man confiscates is Hugo's diary which his father kept while working on the automaton.That night Hugo follows the man  home and speaks to his young god-daughter,who promises to keep her father from burning the book and to help him get it back.<br />Next day Hugo is hired by the old man in the toy store to fix his toys.In return he says he will eventually return his book.One day Hugo takes the old mans god daughter to the movies(to which she has never been)and in return she introduces him to a local bookseller.Then Hugo introduces her to the automaton he has been trying to fix.In the process Hugo discovers she,coincidentally,has the heart shaped key that is needed to turn the machine on.The key is inserted and the machine comes to life.Hugo is expecting a message from his father but instead a drawing is made of a scene from an old film produced in the late 1800s by George Melies.They both return to the girls home and present the drawing to her god-mother who wants them to forget about it.Just then she hears her husband waking up and the children are shuffled into a side room.They search for the diary while in there and find a heavy box hidden in a secret drawer in the top of an old armoire.The chair she stands on collapses and the box and her come tumbling down.Papers scatter everywhere,but all have drawings from other scenes of Melies films.The old man enters the room and can only sit despondent at the supposed betrayal Hugo has perpetrated.<br />The children return to the bookseller wanting to know the best place to find books on old film making.They end up at a specific area at the local library and while reading one particular chapter in a book about George Melies,it dawns on them that her god-father is none other than George Melies himself.Suddenly a stranger appears behind them,who turns out to be the very author of the book they are reading.He asks about their interest in Melies and she tells him her god father is he.The author is incredulous but nonetheless takes the chance and returns home with the children.As soon as her god mother opens the door the author,who met both her and Melies when he was a child,recognizes her instantly.He expresses his gratitude for Mr.Melies inspiration,who is at the moment sleeping.Before parting he gently asks whether she would like to see one of her husbands works.She acquiesces and before long the projector is ticking away,frame by magical frame,the only known remaining print of a George Melies film.They all sit in amazement and when the film ends Mr Melies walks in on them.He instantly starts recalling in brief his career in film making with his wife,and the calamity that led to him having to sell his films for scrap and burning all his sets.He thought no one cared any longer.<br />Hugo excuses himself to return to the train station to retrieve the automaton.Along the way he gets arrested by a station gendarme who has been dogging him constantly.When Hugo fails to return promptly Mr Melies and his god daughter return to the station and rescue Hugo just in time.It turns out the automaton he and Hugos father work so judiciously on for so long,originally belonged to Melies himself,who was also a tinkerer and an inventor.He had donated the automaton to the museum,but when the fire destroyed it he assumed it has been lost also.<br />The film ends as the author introduces Melies to a packed audience,who are there to watch again Melies works that have been rediscovered and lovingly restored.Hugo has found a new home and life with the Melies family and the film fades out as we stare at the automaton;the very thing that brought a man and his son close together and has now brought Hugo a whole new life.<br />As much as the film is a children's adventure,it is also a marvelous educational tool.The film's own subject matter,the French film pioneer George Melie's and his works,which are on prominent display off and on throughout,are absolutely marvelous to look at.On top of this we have a myriad of references to stars of the 20s such as Douglas Fairbanks,Max Linder,Charly Chase,while we actually see Buster Keaton,Charlie Chaplin and especially Harold Lloyd doing his thing in Safety Last.We also get the point of the neglect of film over time and what we have lost,and what we need to do to protect it in order to ensure their longevity or just plain existence.The film also has some neat touches such as the guitar player in a band at the station,who more than likely is a Django Reinhardt reference.So much going on in this film,but all lovingly wrapped up in what essentially is a children's story.All players here do a fantastic job in their portrayals.<br />Technically speaking the film is its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extra is a making of featurette.<br />All in all a highly recommended film ,a children's adventure cunningly concealing a message about old cinema and its preservation.Well acted,well shot and well deserved of a place on your DVD shelf.</p></br><a

Well, in this case one could make the argument that he sold out to early French cinema, in a loving tale celebrating the work of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013K8J90">Georges Melies</a>.  I say let Scorsese be a "sell out," because this is a wonderful film that recreates a time between the wars in Paris and of imagination rekindled thanks to two plucky kids, Hugo and Isabelle. Chlo? Grace Moretz steals the show as Isabelle.  She's already a heartbreaker at 14.  But, this is ostensibly Hugo's film, so we see it through his eyes, hiding up in the steel trusses of Paris' grand train station, where he tries to reassemble the missing pieces of an automaton left behind by his departed father.<br /><br />The story takes a number of complicated turns with Sacha Baron Cohen providing comic relief as the station inspector, ever vigilante of vagabond kids.  Ben Kingsley plays the noble Georges Melies, reduced to selling mechanical contraptions at a little kiosk.  Scorsese brings Hugo and Georges together through Melies' niece, Isabelle, resulting in a beautiful tribute to early French cinema, ultimately leading to the resurrection of Melies' masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006XEH7EO">A Trip to the Moon</a>.

To assuage his loneliness and to give some purpose to his life, he fixes and maintains the station's many elaborate time-pieces - and, to survive, he furtively steals food from the local vendors selling their wares there.<br /><br />A life-affirming departure for the normally dark and brooding Martin Scorsese, "Hugo" is such a beautifully crafted work of commercial cinema that I feel a trifle ungrateful for not actually liking it more - though, more accurately perhaps, I should say that I love the final third of the film but have some reservations about what comes before. It is certainly a wonder to behold in terms of its art direction and scenic design, which together help to create a never-never world of Art Deco architecture and breathtaking cityscapes, where the surreal and the real comfortably meet - a fitting visual correlative, as it turns out, for the theme of the film. And it goes without saying that the movie richly merited each of the many awards it earned for its visual accomplishments.<br /><br />Adapted by John Logan from the Brian Selznick novel, "The Invention of Hugo Cabret," "Hugo" is at its most magical when it is reveling in and celebrating the pioneer days of filmmaking, particularly the fantastical works of magician and special effects wizard Georges Melies ("A Trip to the Moon"), who is an actual character in the movie (played by Ben Kingsley). It seems, according to the story, that Melies left filmmaking an embittered, forgotten has-been and now owns a toy booth in the very train station that Hugo calls home. One fateful day, Hugo and Melies' paths cross - and so the adventure begins...<br /><br />Given all these quality elements, what then are my objections to the film? Primarily, they rest in the fact that, as a central figure, Hugo is too lacking in fire and passion to generate much interest for the audience; that the secondary characters - particularly Sacha Baron Cohen as a war-ravaged security guard - come across more as live-action cartoon figures than as real people; and that the storytelling and pacing in the first half of the film often lag behind the visual stimulation. All these work as distancing devices that keep us from becoming as fully engaged in the plot and the world of the film as we perhaps would like to - until the last third, that is.<br /><br />And that final third winds up making all the difference, as it brings together the movie's disparate elements into a unifying theme of fixing that which is broken - be it a mechanical device or the human heart. This theme is reflected in the film's visual motif of endless machines, both those that are functional and those that are in need of repair.  And Scorsese's meticulous re-creation of Melies' classic works is indeed a wonder to behold.<br /><br />There is one glaring anachronism, however: though the story is set in 1931, Hugo at one point makes reference to having seen Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood," a movie that wasn't released until 1938!  A prescient kid, that Hugo.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Wonderful, wide-eyed, sentimental adventures through the eyes of an imaginative child.

Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz are appropriately doe-eyed and rambunctious youths, Ben Kingsley brings a perfect amount of hidden warmth to the role of the stern, icy toy shop owner with a secret, and Sacha Baron Cohen shows surprising versatility in his turn as the persistent, bumbling train station officer. Spectacular visuals, passionate storytelling and expert direction make this kids' movie suitable for all ages, even if it does drag for a stretch in the second act.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>On the surface Martin Scorsese's latest film "Hugo" appears to be a family-oriented adventure film about a boy named Hugo following his dreams. In fact, "Hugo" is more like the director's love letter to cinema of old (silent movies) and new (3D technologies). And it is a very passionate one. If you remember Martin Scorsese's dedication to the movement of film preservation, it is not surprising.<br /><br />Having lost his father in a fire, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is brought to the station by his uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a clock maintainer with a bottle in his hand. While living alone inside the walls of the station, Hugo dreams of fixing an old automaton, the only thing that connects the boy to his dead father, but to do so he needs a heart-shaped key. One day he meets the very person who literally holds the key, a girl named Isabelle (Chlo? Grace Moretz).<br /><br />Set in the 1930s Paris, the story of "Hugo" slowly leads us to the past of one aged toyshop keeper and Isabelle's godfather played by Ben Kingsley. We eventually come to know who he is, uncovering his buried past memories through the eye of Hugo.<br /><br />This means you are invited to the spiritual journey of an orphan boy Hugo, but Scorsese's film is not about him; Hugo is there, together with incredible coincidences and contrived storyline, so that we can share his experiences of revisiting what is once thought lost, the cinematic imagination of Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, through the world of state-of-the-art special effects.<br /><br />Thus "Hugo" is not an adventure film. If you think story is slow-moving and dull, and characters flat (with two exceptions Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s and his wife played by excellent Helen McCrory), that is because the real star is not Hugo; it is cinema of old days, recreated by the newest technologies. Since I like old films (my favorite is Buster Keaton, though), I give four stars, but I also think paying more attention to characters of Hugo and Isabelle, and narrative structure is not a bad idea.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>My reaction to the first two minutes of "Hugo" was that they had more wit, humor, charm, and the sheer /pleasure/ of watching a motion picture than the whole of "The Muppets" (which I'd watched the day before). As several reviewers have pointed out, "Hugo" embodies the reasons we go to be movies -- to be moved and enchanted.<br /><br />"Utterly boring"? I guess there just wasn't enough drug use, car crashes, rape, and disemboweling to hold the reviewer's attention.<br /><br />I have two not-unreasonable complaints. The story starts off as a tale about an orphaned child trying to recover his life, then turns into a biography of one of motion pictures' great pioneers. The forced, "necessary" quality of the latter doesn't sit well with the "poetic" quality of the former. And the story's belief that the innocence and idealism of children are capable of redeeming adult lives is... well, wishful thinking. ("Hugo" is hardly the first film with this belief at its core.)<br /><br />Regardless, an exquisite motion-picture experience that you should not deny yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>Most of the reviewers here have been very careful to preserve the plot surprises in Martin Scorsese's "Hugo," and I will be too, although by now many writers have spilled the beans. So all I will say is that "Hugo" is one of those very rare movies that lives up to the phrase, "movie magic." Scorsese has us in the palm of his hand from the first shot, a magnificent panoramic sweep of a Paris train station circa 1930, and keeps us there all the way to the expected happy ending. The basic story--Hugo (Asa Butterfield), a misprized Parisian orphan who keeps the station clocks running, even as he tries to evade capture by the officious station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen)--is one just about any child can relate and thrill to. But the story really opens up once it gets to Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), curmudgeonly proprietor of the station's toy shop, and his beloved goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz).<br /><br />"Hugo" can best be described as a voyage of discovery, using extraordinarily sophisticated cinematic techniques to create a marvelously sustained mood of childlike wonder. As Hugo and Isabelle, piece by piece, uncover the life story of Papa Georges, Scorsese pays glorious tribute to the early days of the cinema, and to the pioneers who created it. This is the first film I have ever seen in which the director uses 3D to advance the story, not just to provide chills and thrills to the audience. The effect is that of Scorsese, like Papa Georges within the movie, waving his magic wand to cast a spell of enchantment over the audience.<br /><br />Scorsese's usual crew is here--photographer Robert Richardson, designer Dante Ferretti and editor Thelma Schoonmaker--and their work is flawless. Also flawless is the cast; "Hugo" features a veritable honor roll of some of the best actors working today, including the aforementioned players as well as Helen McCrory, Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone, Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Griffiths, Frances de la Tour, and--in a brief, poignant cameo--Jude Law.<br /><br />If I were as curmudgeonly as Papa Georges, I could complain that the story of "Hugo" stretches a little thin toward the end. But considering the glittering cinematic art that surrounds it, that complaint is extremely minor. It's a cliche to say a movie will delight children of all ages, but in the case of "Hugo," it happens to be true.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Hugo" is brilliant!

Yep, there is a heightened sense of reality in that the panoramic cinematography and the fabulous set designs evoke a childlike sense of wonder. There is a fairy tale ambiance of sorts. HUGO is a fable concerning an intrepid orphan boy and a long neglected artist, care worn and bitter and resigned to fading into obscurity.<br /><br />His pa deaders and his hard-imbibing uncle having amscrayed for parts unknown, young Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) has been living in a post World War I Parisian train station, inhabiting the walls, navigating the catwalks and catacombs and precarious steps that make up the train station's dusty inner sanctum. Hugo keeps busy by doing his uncle's work. He's been secretly tending to the clocks in the sprawling train station. In his spare time, he strives to piece together a mysterious broken-down wind-up automaton that was abandoned in a museum. Hugo believes fervently that the little metal man, when functioning properly, will reveal a message from his father. But Hugo is stumped by a missing heart-shaped key which activates the automaton. Hugo perseveres, long as there's food to filch and his father's notebook to guide him and mechanical bits to steal from the toy salesman's booth.<br /><br />Hugo has an affinity for machinery, a knack for fixing gadgets. This serves him well when his luck runs out as a thief and he's nabbed by old Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), him what runs the toy booth. The furious Papa Georges nevertheless indulges in an act of kindness; he takes on Hugo as a booth assistant. Around this time Hugo meets Papa Georges' niece Isabelle (Chlo? Grace Moretz), and so we're introduced to the film's best performance in my opinion. Chlo? Grace Moretz radiates a warmth and great charm. Her Isabelle is captivating and inquisitive and effortlessly rolls off literary references. I love that she savors them fanciful words, words such as "reprobate" and "clandestine" and "covert lair" lovingly tripping from her tongue. But Isabelle is tired of living vicariously thru books; she longs for an adventure of her own. And she embarks on one with Hugo. At one point, she's heard to remark: "This is marvelous. I feel just like Jean Valjean." Except that she's ever more lively than good old Prisoner #24601.<br /><br />It's interesting. The first half of HUGO tracks our scampering orphan's escapades and the tone is very much adventurous. But somewhere in the middle bits, it seems as if director Martin Scorsese finally put his foot down and decided to go ahead with what really drew him to this project. Scorsese loves cinema, and somewhere you must've seen him espousing a cause near and dear to his heart: the preservation of old films. His passion for old movies and the salvaging of them fold into this picture. I won't say what, but there is a huge reveal somewhere in the middle bits, and the tone alters some and the spotlight sort of veers away from Hugo, even though Hugo is still the catalyst to everything that happens hence.<br /><br />HUGO is a film for kids, but maybe not all kids. The visuals are dazzling and enthralling and whoever came up with them should be tapped for an Oscar nomination. For those who harbor love for silent pictures or are curious about the early days of cinema, the second half of HUGO is a marvel, as only an affectionate valentine by Scorsese could be. As in the source material, HUGO shines a light on a near-forgotten pioneer of cinema, a talent who once upon a time made over 500 films until the advent of the first world war and the movie audience's shifting tastes forced him to sell his films, of which celluloid were broken down to chemicals and refashioned into the heels of women's shoes. And you wonder why this old bloke is melancholy?<br /><br />I've isolated Chlo? Grace Moretz as my favorite performer in this film. Doesn't mean that the rest of the cast sucks asphalt. This is a terrific cast, from Butterfield to Kingsley to a fantastic Helen McCrory (who makes the most of her minimal screen time) to Christopher Lee (who lends benevolent weight as the librarian Monsieur Labisse). Even Sacha Baron Cohen restrains himself and is fine and funny as Gustave Gaston, the bum-legged Station Inspector whose mission in life - when not wooing the shy flower lady - is to corral all runaway urchins and send them packing to the orphanage. Cohen's antics and his lanky build remind me in some ways of a Keystone Kop or maybe Tony Azito who played the cowardly police sergeant in THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE. Some effective slapstick moments provided by Cohen... and that police dog.<br /><br />If immortal folks like Chaplin, Keaton, and Fairbanks evoke fond memories or some recognition, then HUGO treats you very finely. Location-wise, this is as idealized a version of Paris as you and I can hope to see. The automaton is a steampunkish concoction of gears and coils and springs and thingamajigs, and, early on, is what drives the narrative, piques our curiosity. The kid actors contribute mature performances. And because this is the kind of film that delivers the goods, chances are solid that, by the closing moments, our forgotten filmmaking pioneer will take taken his bows, remembered once more. HUGO isn't fantasy in the mold of Harry Potter and such. But Scorsese introduces an enchantment of sorts, one somewhat anchored in reality. But I've always considered Scorsese magical, even when his subject matter is scurrilous mafiosos (which by the way sounds like a nasty medical condition). Scorsese again demonstrates his great craft. To lift from Hugo Cabret's vocabulary, Scorsese is like... clockwork.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>MOVIE NOTE #12: HUGO Based on the book by Brian Selznick's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret, this film was incredibly enchanting and warm hearted for me. Paramount Pictures's film Hugo, was Co-Produced by Johnny Depp and the director Martin Scorcese (the `Godfather' director himself) - this is Scorcese's first film that didn't involve, the mob, gangsters or guns - this is actually a family film with a very big heart.<br /><br />Rated PG, for he subject matter - it tells the late 1930's tale of a young boy, HUGO (played convincingly by Asa Butterfield of `Nanny McPhee', `Wolfman' & the `Merlin' TV show) who loses his father and takes the place of his uncle (Played by the convincing Ray Winston of `Indiana Jones', &' Percy Jackson and the Olympians') - to do the task of keeping ALL the MANY clocks and their mechanisms working in the world famous and huge Paris railway station. His father, lovingly played by Jude Law (`Sherlock Holmes', `Aviator' & `Alfie'), finds an Automoton (Clock-work Android) that apparently has a special ability that after his fathers death, Hugo goes on his journey of discovery.<br /><br />The whole time Hugo is literally mentally tortured, teased, taunted and abused by one of Academy Award Winner - Sir Ben Kingsly's (`Gandhi', `Schindler's List' & `Prince of Persia') most amazing and heartfelt performances ever. He plays film maker and innovator George M&eacute;li&egrave;s, most noted for the silent film `A Trip To The Moon' - where an oversized bullet takes travelers to the moon and shoots the moon in the eye! `Hugo' although very visual in nature and making full use of the 3D process has beautiful imagery, soft warm tones and a very visual dynamic with all the clock, clock workings and cogs of the machines that tell time in Paris. Not to mention another incredible musical score by Howard Shore (`Lord of the Rings', `Phillidelphia' & `Ed Wood')<br /><br />Young Hugo also has one other problem - he is continuously being chased by the railways Inspector played by the impressive comedic talents of Sarah Baron Cohen (`Sweeney Todd, `Borat' & `Madagascar') who he himself has a malfunction mechanism attached to his leg to help him walk. He and his dog (with his witty smirks) torment Hugo and then unexpectedly gets help from Georges granddaughter - Isabelle (Played by Chloe Grace Moretz of "Kick Ass' & "Diary of a Wimpy Kid') they find their way to know the real story behind her Grandfather and his Father's `message'.<br /> The film is amazingly entertaining and might be a little slow for the younger crowd - but it has amazing performances, visuals and great `not in your face' 3D effects. It's also a great period film too with many details and intricacies.<br /><br />The film also has some impressive performances `sprinkled' throughout by the Bookstore owner played by Christopher Lee (`Star Wars: The Phantom Menace', `Lord of the Rings'), the Inspectors love interest played by Emily Mortimer (`Shutter Island', `Cars 2' & `The Pink Panther' 2008), a `blooming' love romance played ever so gently by Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour (From the Harry Potter films) and the most heartfelt and magical performance of Helen McCrory (the Harry Potter Films, `The Queen' & `Doctor Who') who plays George M&eacute;li&egrave;s's sympathetic and loving wife.<br /><br /> This was refreshing 2 hours and 7 minute film and although the pace is slower that your average shoot-em-up....you really feel apart of Hugo's life. I gotta read the book now!</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>Not entirely successful as an entertainment, but still a marvel to behold. The expert use of 3D creates depth and texture, though much of the production looks artificial. This may be - actually it is likely - intentional as this artifice echoes the subject of artifice which absorbs much of the movie, whether focusing on magic, automatons, or filmmaking. The classically styled adventure of a boy fending for himself in an unusual setting and the characters who inhabit the small world he is intimately familiar with segues into what is ultimately an exploration of the most magical of early cinema pioneers and a plea for film preservation. That this is accomplished so entertainingly is a small wonder itself.

The problem is that there were too many subplots that took away from the storyline and depth of character for Hugo, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s and most importantly the automaton. The dogs; the security guard; store front owners were nice touches but became overbearing superficial distractions. By showing the films of M&eacute;li&egrave;s the movie accomplished one of it's goals which was showing us the history of cinema (as an aside I believe that to understand any subject requires knowing it's history whether it's physics or politics) but I would have liked to have seen even more of his diverse accomplishments. The most obvious missing story was that of the automaton. I was waiting for much more of not only it's history but to see it do more whether in reality (they were amazing devices) or just with fantasy. The automaton essentially just disappeared. Finally, I was disappointed that they couldn't come up with a more positive way for Hugo to sustain himself than continually stealing, lying - bad message for the younger viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For those who believe that 'Hugo' is all about the title character, think again. Martin Scorsese only uses a fanciful child's tale to arrive at his true intent: a tribute to film pioneer, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s. Visually, one can argue that the film is a tour de force, with some fantastic special effects as well as a sumptuous score, but until we arrive at said tribute, Scorsese's tale lacks the requisite tension and charm.<br /><br />The film starts off rather nicely as Scorsese takes us into the heart of a Paris train station, circa 1930. We meet Hugo, an orphan, who's being raised by his alcoholic uncle, after Hugo's watchmaker father is killed in a fire. The uncle teaches Hugo how to maintain the vast array of clocks, hidden inside the station but their relationship remains completely underdeveloped. The real tension is supposed to be between Hugo and the autocratic station inspector (awkwardly played by Sacha Baron Cohen), who is bent on sending the orphan away to a reform school. Scorsese relies on a series of slapstick chase scenes between Hugo and the inspector to move the plot along, and adults should not find much interest in such shenanigans.<br /><br />The connection between Hugo and M&eacute;li&egrave;s is made through a keepsake bequeathed to Hugo from his father. It's an 'automaton', a mechanical man which the father could not get to work, and now Hugo has taken to stealing mechanical parts from a toy store owned by M&eacute;li&egrave;s, now a virtual recluse, in the hope that those parts will enable him to start the device up. M&eacute;li&egrave;s ends up confiscating Hugo's notebook, which contains drawings of the Automaton and his efforts to repair it. Eventually, M&eacute;li&egrave;s hires Hugo to work in the toy store, in order to pay off the debt for the mechanical parts he stole from the store.<br /><br />Hugo finally gets the Automaton to operate when he discovers that M&eacute;li&egrave;s' goddaughter, Isabelle, is wearing the key (that starts the device), around her neck. Wouldn't you know it but the Automaton draws a screen shot from M&eacute;li&egrave;s' most famous film, 'A Trip to the Moon', proving that the "great man" is still alive (unbeknownst to an indifferent public). The two kids manage (with the help of a kindly film historian), to bring M&eacute;li&egrave;s back into the public eye, and M&eacute;li&egrave;s ends up getting the recognition he "deserves", from the French film society.<br /><br />In the best part of the film, Scorsese shines, as he offers up a film hagiography of M&eacute;li&egrave;s' career. The flashback, which includes how M&eacute;li&egrave;s actually created 'A Trip to the Moon', features that glass house, where the pioneer's seminal feature film, was made. Nonetheless, one gets the feeling that Scorsese's embrace of the past, has gone too far. The reverence for M&eacute;li&egrave;s has gotten to the point where Scorsese has placed the film pioneer, on a saintly pedestal. Yes, he is an important figure in the history of cinema and he was extremely talented, especially in a day when film was in its infancy and no one had yet grasped the concept of film as spectacle --but M&eacute;li&egrave;s was still a product of his time, and those ancient images belong in the context of the times they were made in. If it was up to Scorsese, M&eacute;li&egrave;s would be placed in the same pantheon as Shakespeare and Dickens; but M&eacute;li&egrave;s' films were not designed to appeal to the intellect. M&eacute;li&egrave;s' appeal to Scorsese is on the technical level and that's why he admires him so much. To a certain extent, there's nothing wrong in that. But for Scorsese to expect the average film goer to worship M&eacute;li&egrave;s as some kind of film 'deity', I would suggest he's gone a little too far out on a limb.<br /><br />Karina Longworth, in her review of 'Hugo' in the Village Voice, sums it up best by arguing that the 'ticking clocks' are the true antagonist in the film: "In the story of M&eacute;li&egrave;s's life as recounted by Scorsese--and by extension, the story of the movies--time is the enemy that alters the tastes of audiences, decays film prints, and turns today's fetish objects into tomorrow's relics."<br /><br />'Hugo' in many ways, feels more like a documentary in parts than a clever children's story, fraught with conflict. The conflict here is manufactured and the two child actors end up with little to do except act as impresarios for the M&eacute;li&egrave;s main act. Relationships here are never really developed or explored and we're asked by Scorsese, to simply applaud the hagiography. If you were to take out all the spoken dialogue in the film and leave only the musical soundtrack, you wouldn't miss much. Perhaps, ironically, that's what Scorsese was really aiming for: a stunning visual tribute, to the technical wizardry of an early film pioneer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>Since the  history of the art of motion pictures, along with the art of audio reproduction, have always been subjects of great interest to me, I would have expected this homage to the movies by Martin Scorsese to be at least engrossing if not emotionally involving.  Unhappily neither was the case.<br /><br />We have a story, which is a fantasy, set in the late 1920s to the middle 1930s taking place largely in a Parisian railway station in which, curiously, all of the characters not only exclusively speak English, but with a British accent.  Dramatically the film simply never takes off as one expects it to.  Even the action (chase) scenes are curiously static and uninvolving.  The acting style and delivery of the dialogue resemble to a very large degree the first Harry Potter picture -- utterly sleep inducing.<br /><br />A great effort is made to recreate the times in which the story takes place but that feeling never develops.  Visually, the film  looks very impressive and its sound recording is excellent.  Nearly every shot of Paris appears to be the result of CGI processing and everything about the ancient city looks absolutely new.  Nothing looks old or worn but appears to have been created only for this picture and intended to be discarded or erased when the film was completed.  Efforts were made to evoke the period between the Great War and World War II.  We see scenes of a group of musicians in the station with a guitarist apparently made up to resemble Django Reinhardt, but the music heard resembles romantic Parisian styles and bears no relation whatever to the jazz style for which Reinhardt was famous.  I had the distinct impression that no one in connection with the making of this film had ever heard one of Django Reinhardt's recordings.  Other recreations of historic figures pop up from time to time, as in Woody Allen's "Midnight in Paris" and it didn't work that well there either.<br /><br />When clips or recreations from the old movies of Harold Lloyd and Georges Melies are seen, they, as usual, are shown at the current sound projection speed of 24 frames per second, while having been originally shot at an average of 16 frames per second with the result that the characters are seen running around like jumping jacks and not the way they must have been seen in theaters of the times in which the films were made.  Scorsese makes an obvious appeal for the preservation of motion pictures, something with which I entirely sympathize.  But if one observes what has been achieved in film preservation in the last twenty or thirty years, I think he need have few fears.<br /><br />A few years ago I heard an interview I think on NPR, with a film screen writer or director whose name now escapes me.  He  made an interesting comparison between writing a novel and a screenplay.  He noted that when writing a novel, you can always go back and add more and more detail as the story requires, as in designing a building -- you just make it bigger if you have to.  But he said that writing a successful screenplay is like designing an airplane that must be light enough to take off and fly or it's a complete failure at what it is primarily intended to accomplish. This is the feeling I had watching "Hugo" -- that it was simply static with long pauses in the dialog that slowed the pacing to a fatal degree.  And I really did so want to like this picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I had HIGH HOPE for this movie because of trailer & all those Awards shows they got & all.<br />Yes all in Technical, Visual & special effects is Stunning to watch, BUT story & movie real boring & drags a lot here & there.

I expected a fantasy story about a young orphan in Paris, with floating robots and mystery trains. Instead, I got a rather pedestrian tale about the orphan with little of the fantasy. Indeed - spoilers ahead! - the film became a biography of early cinematographer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, he of "Voyager to the Moon" fame. As sad as was the life of poor orphan Hugo, forced to wind clocks in the Montparnasse train station, the story of M&eacute;li&egrave;s (played by Ben Kingsley) was a much more compelling and could have been a film in itself. The Hugo material was too skimpy, making this part of the film tiresome. A couple of love stories between train station regulars might have made the film more bearable. As would a btter eye for comedy. I knew we were in trouble when an early scene, in which a character catches a leg brace in a train door, fell comedically flat. And Sacha Baron Cohen, as a brutal yet lovesick gendarme, was completely misdirected. His character was not given any motivation or his foul temper - the audience was left to imagine a war wound as the likely cause.<br /><br />I will say that Scorcese did a nice job of evoking 1920s Paris fashions, signage and technology. The train station was truly a bustling place full of thousands of stories every time a train arrived or departed. The Paris scenes were mostly done as matte paintings, and lacked realism. That might or might not be your cup of tea.<br /><br />"Hugo" is a huge waste of money, except that it will bring more attention to M&eacute;li&egrave;s and his enormous output of wonderful early films. The man was a creative genius and his story deserved not to be twisted with a nameless and fictional orphan. And the 3D brought nothing to the film, except a buck or two extra on the ticket price.<br /><br />I told you I was disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I expected a lot before watching this film but was a bit shocked that I found it sincerely boring. To see a director make a film just to may some sort of a tribute to his own profession, film - making, is just not that overwhelming. I like dramas based on the human emotion, it seems this is specifically based on creating magic out of nothing. THE ILLUSIONIST and PRESTIGE are films based in similar era's that tower over HUGO. Hugo is a primeval film about machines and man at the dawn of the cinema era. I don't blame myself entirely for not curbing my apathy towards this film. It is not a bad film - it is just ordinary and hardly moving.<br /><br />Watch this if you don't mind watching a two hour long film based in early 20th century about an orphan.<br /><br />I have a sinking feeling that M.S thinks he nailed crime/drama films after THE DEPARTED and won't be making a film with that bent again. He is starting doing these tributes to film making - SHUTTER ISLAND for instance, what was that all about?! Yet, that is a much better, more laconic film than Hugo (Which I doubt will figure in my top 15 of last year)</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>This movie was entrancing to me and bored my wife; yet another example that beauty is in the eyes (and ears) of the beholder. Hugo evoked memories of the excitement of being young, impressionable and filled with wonder at the mysterious parts that make things work, both animate and inanimate. The movie progresses at a rather slow but steady pace at the beginning that may put off those who are looking for action in their movies. To me it did an effective job of identifying and defining Hugo with all of his dreams and aspirations; I felt a kinship with him that reminded me of certain aspects of my childhood. Gradually the clues that are given in the early part of the movie are put together and the viewer begins to see how it all fits together.<br /><br />The movie is visually somewhat overwhelming in its level of detail on the screen; one gets the feeling that one needs to watch it again to finish seeing all of the amazing and fascinating things being shown. This movie will be a feast for many boys and those men who have not lost their boyish sense of wonder. The role of Hugo is convincingly played by Asa Butterfield and the other lead roles are well done by such seasoned actors as Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, and many others.<br /><br />The movie is just over two hours long and seems to proceed at a leisurely, introspective pace. I have not been young for a long time but it brought back memories of youth that took me back to the feelings of childhood. I recommend it highly.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>HUGO is a magical treat from start to finish, beginning with its marvelous open tracking shot of a Paris railroad station in the '30s. From then on, there's a treasure of masterful photography involved in the telling of a boy who lives in a train station and, in the tradition of his inventive father, keeps the huge clock and its machinery working.<br /><br />The boy is played with great sensitivity by Asa Butterfield in what has to be one of the best child performances ever. He carries the film and never lets the momentum stop as he scurries around the train station trying to avoid the overzealous clutches of a crippled station master (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his fearsome dog. It's like watching Dicken's innocent Oliver Twist or David Copperfield trying to avoid the unscrupulous mishandling of a mistrustful adult.<br /><br />All of the behind-the-scenes glimpses of the whirling machinery inside the clock are an added visual treat, creating the illusion of suspense and danger whenever the plot demands it. As the girl whom Hugo befriends and shares his knowledge of the automaton with, Chlore Grace Moretz is equally charming and natural. Their chemistry helps the film's most pivotal moments work beautifully.<br /><br />A much needed sense of humor is helped enormously by the contribution of Sacha Baron Cohen, whose station master emerges as one of the story's most interesting characters. Emily Mortimer is touching as a woman he admires and Christopher Lee does a standout job as the librarian who takes an interest in furthering Hugo's education.<br /><br />The story's thread is slight, but the film is full of such complex images and turbulent events surrounding the boy's precarious situation that it remains an absorbing tale of an orphan who proves to be a most resourceful lad in keeping one step ahead of the authorities.<br /><br />Then too, it's a backstory of the famous cinema inventor Georges Melies, who had the imagination to become one film's most inventive craftsmen in the early 1900s. Glimpses of his work are seen throughout the film and Ben Kingsley is a perfect choice to play this complex man. His scenes with Hugo are extremely touching.<br /><br />And finally, I must end with a word of high praise for Martin Scorsese who lends his own magical touch to the proceedings to create one of the year's best films for the child in all of us. All of its wonders are underscored by Howard Shore's lovely background score.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>This movie is a classic film.  It is wonderfully scripted, directed and performed.  Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who lives in a train station.  He was taken there by his uncle who took him in so he could work for free fixing the clocks at the station.  Hugo is a street person who lives by his wits and his ability to steal what he needs to survive.  His uncle disappears and Hugo is really on his own.<br /><br />His favorite project is to rebuild an automaton that his father rescued from a fire before his death.  He is constantly stealing parts for the repair work.  While taking parts from an old clock/toy maker he is caught and the old man steals his notes and refuses to return them...<br /><br />The old man, Georges Melies, is played by Ben Kingsley and the performance is top notch.  The direction by Martin Scorsese is so good that this is one of his best films.  The movie is a sleeper as it did not do well at the box office but we loved it.  We watched it with our grandson and even he liked it.<br /><br />This is a very good story and you should get it to watch with the family!</p></br><a href="../users/A18HHKM6WGEF9D.html">A18HHKM6WGEF9D</a><br/><p>This is a beautiful, masterful movie, as one would only expect from Scoresese, and I thoroughly appreciated its artistry, and enjoyed watching it. My kids however, ages 5 and 7, were a bit young for it, and found it slow. The shots in old Paris are lovely, and the train station setting is wonderful and allows for some amazing shots, especially as the young Hugo works inside the clocks, and the trains race through the stations. Orphan Hugo works with a friend to discover the trick to getting an old automaton his father left him to work, and ends up discovering the world of early film making. This movie basically offers a brief history of film, with footage from pre-war movies both real and created, and I loved this. It does verge on sentimentality though, and wasn't nearly as fascinating to my kids. For all the talk of movies being like dreams, I thought this could have used a little more of a nod to modern-day special effects, beyond some of the train scenes, to capture the youth of today. Other than that though, this is a wonderful film with a warm heart, and safe family fare.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>Sorry, Mr. Scorsese! This was a good, entertaining film. But worthy of an Academy Award? Nope. The beginning of the film was a bit off and slow; the plot really didn't pick up until about 40 minutes into the film. The best performance in the film was by Helen McCrory who portrays Mama Jeanne (Georges Melies' wife), but the others were decent. I feel like people (especially the Academy) are only crazy about this film because (1) it's Scorsese, and (2) it's about film history -- particularly honoring that history. There is no doubt that Melies was a visionary genius and his films are legendary, but this story and film of his involvement with a curious, orphaned boy sort of seems like something that should be made in the tradition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EPZ048">Mars Needs Moms</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AGTPUK">The Polar Express (Widescreen Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011NVC9I">Beowulf (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NFM3JK">Disney's A Christmas Carol</a> -- those performance-captured computer graphic films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>If I get a vote in this year's Oscar, I will vote for either of the two Paris films that are nominated. Either Midnight in Paris by Woody Allen, or this charming kids story about an orphan boy living in a Paris railway station attending to it's clocks. He encounters a gruff toy shop owner who turns out to be a forgotten master of the movie industry. Beautiful work by Scorsese with a good cast. Special mention is earned by Sasha Baron Cohen as station cop with a lame leg, a doberman, and a soft spot for the flower sales girl.<br />P.S. The awards are out now. Hugo collected 5 minor oscars, better than nothing. I can't say that the winner didn't deserve to win, but I will keep rooting for Hugo. There is a lot more to be said for the film than I have done here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>Having read and loved Brian Selznick's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439813786">The Invention of Hugo Cabret</a>, I was eager to see the film adaptation, especially in the hands of uber director Martin Scorcese. He does not disappoint - this movie far exceeded my expectations, and I actually loved it even more than the book. It was like whatever I had imagined while reading the book (which has lots of graphics btw) was brought to life, only even better!<br /><br />My husband and I took our almost seven-year-old daughter to view this and she was riveted. It is difficult to imagine any child or adult not being captivated by the visuals in this movie. They are truly magical, and though my daughter is obviously too young to get some of the subtler undertones and themes in the movie, she was able to appreciate the visuals and follow the basic premise of the movie.<br /><br />The story itself is one that tugs at one's heartstrings and imagination. Young Hugo Cabret (finely nuanced performance by Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who has lost his father (played by Jude Law) in a fire and is now living on his wits, keeping the clocks running in a large train station in 1930s Paris. His uncle is the real timekeeper, but for a large portion of the movie, we do not know where the drunk has got to. Hugo's father was a clockmaker and had been restoring an old automaton, an object of fascination for both father and son. Upon his father's death, Hugo takes over the automaton, and tries to get it to work, using his dad's notebook as a guide. He steals parts from wherever he can, including the store of Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), who catches him in the act one day, and becomes irate with anger when he sees the notebook.<br /><br />Over a period of time, young Hugo forms a friendship with Papa Georges' goddaughter, the orphan Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), and the pair discover some of Papa Georges' long-buried secrets. Hugo is in peril though, as the station inspector, Gustaf (Sasha Baron Cohen) holds no tolerance for young orphans and makes it his mission to catch them and have them hauled off to the orphanage. Emily Mortimer plays flower seller Lisette, whom Gustaf pines for, but is afraid to make the first move for fear of rejection and self-consciousness at his crippled leg.<br /><br />There are several bit roles played by some recognizable actors which add to the charm of the movie, but the real appeal of this movie revolves around young Hugo's attempts to get his automaton to work, and how he eventually finds his way 'home'. Along his journey, Hugo discovers the history of cinema, and all the wonders associated with it. The director's love of films shines through in every frame, and the beauty of this film is that it truly dares us to dream and give flight to our imagination!<br /><br />This is a magical film, and a homage to the magic of film-making, that will capture the hearts and minds of viewers, both young and old. The film is rated PG, as there are some intense scenes, though I'd have to say Hugo's father's death is more subtly portrayed here, alluded to by a giant ball of fire. There are some scenes which younger viewers might find scary, such as the scenes of Hugo being chased through the train station by the Station Inspector, etc. but on the whole, the movie is great entertainment for the family.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>This was a beautiful movie to look at and magical at times, but in the end it left one flat.  While it was touching to regard the inventor of movies receive the acclaim he deserved (or was it, his movies looked a tad silly), it did not seem to be enough of a conflict or problem to inspire an emotional tie. In short, this viewed did not cry at the end, he merely shrugged his shoulders.  A decent enough movie, but not great.  It certainly does not deserve to be included in the pantheon of great Scorcese films.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>If a movie was judged solely by its cinematic dazzle and sheer appreciation of the wonders of the medium, then Martin Scorsese's virtuosic 2011 adventure drama should have taken home the Best Picture Oscar hands down. However, there is something overly meticulous and dramatically inert in the execution that somehow makes the film miss its mark for me emotionally. As much as I admired all the technical achievements presented here, I felt a bit of a chill when it came to the emotional elements. Adapted by John Logan (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00080ZG10">The Aviator</a>) from Brian Selznick's historic fiction novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439813786">The Invention of Hugo Cabret</a> (2007), the fanciful story centers on Hugo, a twelve-year-old urchin who lives within the walls of Paris' Gare Montparnasse railway station in 1931. His father was a master clockmaker who took Hugo to see the early films of cinematic pioneer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006XEH7EO">A Trip to the Moon (1902)</a>) and was working on his most ambitious project, repairing a mechanical robot who could write with a pen, when he died suddenly in a fire.<br /><br />Hugo is taken away by his drunkard uncle, who took care of the main railway clock until he disappeared one night. All the while, the boy obsesses over finishing his father's project by pilfering gears and other parts he finds in the station toy shop run by none other than M&eacute;li&egrave;s who has fallen on hard times. Now an embittered man, he take's Hugo's prized notebook with all his father's notes and threatens to burn it as punishment. However, M&eacute;li&egrave;s decides to let the boy earn back the parts he stole by working in the shop. Hugo also meets M&eacute;li&egrave;s' precocious goddaughter, an orphan named Isabelle who is a bit older than him. They bond immediately with he taking her to the movies for the first time and she leading him to the key that unlocks the mechanical man's programmed capabilities. Through quite a few convolutions in the plot, including an elaborate dream sequence, the connection between M&eacute;li&egrave;s and his earlier groundbreaking work is finally recognized and celebrated.<br /><br />Finally back in a top-grade production, Ben Kingsley plays the gruff and mysterious filmmaker-turned-toyshop owner with the ideal mix of austerity and frustration. Chlo? Grace Moretz (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG983M">Kick-Ass</a>) is also winning and immensely likable as Isabelle. The same can't be quite said about Asa Butterfield's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00628RVV0">The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</a>) sullen performance in the title role. The young actor has the immense weight of the story on his shoulders, but he doesn't provide enough conviction to gravitate the heart to Hugo's plight. The most problematic performance is Sacha Baron Cohen's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P4ME14">Borat</a>) slapstick-driven turn as the station inspector. It's not so much the stunt-casting aspect as it is the anomalous approach he takes in making the character strangely menacing with little redeeming value. Much smaller roles are taken by Jude Law as Hugo's father and Emily Mortimer as a flower girl. Scorsese's visual team has done near-flawless work here, starting with production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Robert Richardson, both of whom bring 1930's Paris to vivid life with exacting detail and burnished brushstrokes.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>"Clocks tell the time, and trains take you places."  Interesting sentiments that begin Hugo Cabret's (Asa Butterfield) journey towards understanding the world around him and the loss that he has endured after the death of his father, a clock-caretaker and an inspiration to Hugo's inquisitiveness to how things work, especially anything mechanical and most importantly clocks.  The movie takes place in the city of lights Paris within a train station where Hugo also lives.  With the opening scenes of the film, viewers have entered a world of mystery, mischief, and magic that looks like a combination of animation and like-action.<br /><br />Hugo becomes an orphan but somehow becomes independent and self-reliant.  His curiosity and persistence to understand the things that his father (Jude Law) left behind leads him to an experience like no other that a child his age could ever imagine.  And the key component that leads him to a world that he has been enthralled and fascinated with, his father's small sketch notebook; the notebook was one of the last objects along with the mechanical figure that his father had been working on that will help to spark Hugo's energy to unlock the mystery behind the drawings and the mechanical figure.  But before he and Isabelle area able to unlock the mystery, he encounters a disgruntled toy shopkeeper by the name of Georges (Ben Kingsley)and retrieves the notebook who inquires about the drawings; but as the film progresses more mysterious elements arise and the question of who exactly is Georges? But along the way, Hugo does not make his journey alone, and he befriends Georges's goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz).  The drawings reveal much in terms of the love for film and its origins, which renowned and critically acclaimed Director Martin Scoresese helped to revive and unlock the mystery as well as the history of film-making within the main character of Hugo as well as other most recent films The Artist.  Both films recaptured the craft and innovation of what movies had first set out to accomplish - entertain but also make the filmgoer wonder after the last credits of the film have gone up.  But also most notably, the individuals that first made this world of wonderment happen and what Hugo's storyline centers upon, legendary filmmaker George M&egrave;li&eacute;s and the cinema.<br /><br />With the sudden resurgence of the history of film, the release of Hugo and The Artist are a welcoming aspect, especially during this rise of technology within the film industry and overall within the cinema.  It is amazing to see that films still make one think and offer discussion afterwards.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Who would've thought Martin Scorsese could make such a gentle fantasy movie like HUGO?  HUGO is visually breathtaking, deservedly winning 5 Oscars for its technical wizardry.  Of course, Scorsese's direction is brilliant, from its sweeping opening sequence to its glorious finale celebrating the restoration of the silent films.  This restoration is a basic element of the film's focus on creativity, determination and pride.  The movie is hypnotic and features an excellent cast.  Asa Butterfield's Hugo is superb, a child actor with an uncanny maturity who provides the heart and soul of the film...one of the best youth performances in recent cinema.  Chloe Grace Moretz continues her impressive career as the engaging Isabelle.  Ben Kingsley gives one of his best performances since GANDHI as the bitter Georges.  Sasha Baron Cohen is surprisingly effective as the disapproving inspector.  Rounding out the cast in smaller roles are Jude Law, Richard Griffiths, Ray Winstone, Christopher Lee and Emily Mortimer.<br />HUGO is delightfully entertaining and a credit to a master director's diversity and vision.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is a unique combination of the way the story is told as an interweaving of a fictional protagonist to tell the story of a real life person. I have seen the formula of interweaving reality with a fictional character before; one of the most famous is "Sophie's World" by Jostein Gaarder.<br /><br />Any way the basic story is of a child that loses his father and thinks that his father left him a message that will change his life. In the process of perusing the message he meets Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s who may just have a message to change the reader's life.<br /><br />The book incorporated a lot of pictures to help tell the story. This is innovative and holds your attention. However it did not translate well into the film as the film was slow and dragged a lot in scenes and even dialog.  They lost the continuity and purpose of the story by incorporating the station inspector story that was a minor part of the book. It was too slapstick.  What was great graphics in the book translated in almost cartoonish graphics in the film.  However they did an excellent presentation of how the original films were designed to show us the stuff that dreams were made of.<br /><br />The flat screen version was well enough. The 3D graphics were sort of gimmicky sort of looking through a stereoscope; however they were several fields deep.<br /><br />So we have some unnecessary story added and some slow dragging parts but in the end the feel of the original book shines through.</p></br><a href="../users/AIY4H4KWR2KWZ.html">AIY4H4KWR2KWZ</a><br/><p>Quite surprising for an American director to create an excellent Euro-styled production. Filmmakers crossing ponds and finding success is very rare in my cinema experience, very rare.<br /><br />A pair of examples of how unusual and difficult it is: '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DRF84W">Hulk</a>' directed by Ang Lee. It sucked. And visa versa, '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016LTNL4">Death at a Funeral</a>' crafted by Frank Oz. Again, it sucked. These are highly regarded directors in their respective cultures - but translating that into a completely different cultural product is so very difficult. The style, temperament, and visual cues are often subtle and easily detectable if missed. And if not done correctly, will sink a film. Though to be fair, Lee's project immediately after the green disaster was a hugely successful movie.<br /><br />Point being: Few filmmakers can transfer and translate their abilities. Obviously Martin Scorsese is a member of that very elite club.<br /><br />Loved this film, and I was really impressed by wide-eyed newcomer Asa Butterfield, who played the all-important lead role of Hugo. So easy for a director to select a child actor who is inappropriate - either overrated or because they're simply incapable. Remember the atrociously plastic kid in the latter 'Star Wars' films? Or how about that ridiculously pretentious little prig in the recent stinker '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006PZBR8S">Real Steel</a>'? Lots of kids just don't have "it" - and surprisingly, many of them still somehow con their way into films. I'm honestly amazed that Scorsese was able to cut through the blatherskite and find the right performer.<br /><br />Butterfield has just enough universal appeal to forgive the fact that he, and the other artists, were speaking English. A tough sell given that almost the entire cast were from the UK.<br /><br />I have to think the French would've been happier if Scorsese had utilized an authentic Franco cast. Sadly, many in the US don't speak another language or are incapable of reading subtitles - so it's completely understandable from a marketing perspective. But from a creative angle, it's the one very minor failing of the production.<br /><br />A wonderfully rich story that I really enjoyed - with kudos to one of my all-time favorite actors - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAE7KO">Sir Ben Kingsley</a>.<br /><br />Finally, I was surprised to read scathing jabs by social media mavens commenting on how sad and "wrong" it was that this film garnered so many Academy Awards when their favorites were iced out. I won't get into it other than - with age comes fine appreciation and wisdom. Hopelessly clueless blog yakkers and paid professional hacks, whose cinephile creds are based on less than thirty years of screenings, should shut the bleep up and learn the difference between populist tripe and cinematic excellence.<br /><br />More proof that '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHOG">Idiocracy</a>' in action is an observable fact.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>"Hugo" based on the popular kid's novel is an odd film; its not a project I would expect Martin Scorsese to helm but I have to give him credit for trying such an unusual project given his past films (Taxi Driver [Blu-ray], GoodFellas [Blu-ray]) and stretching himself as an artist with a genre he's never tackled before--a fantasy children's film.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Hugo (Asa Butterfield) the orphaned son of a clockmaker (Jude Law) lives above the train station in Paris tending to the large clock. Hugo tries to unravel the mystery of an automaton that his father was working on just before his death and spars with the bitter owner of a small gift shop named Melies (Ben Kingsley)while on the run run from the station inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen). Hugo finds an unlikely ally in Isabelle (Chlo? Grace Moretz from Let Me In [Blu-ray])as they search for the key that will wind up the automaton so they can discover what, exactly, it was designed for.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />A movie that is as much about the history of film, the redemption of Melies and who, exactly, build the automaton, Scorsese creates a lush, lovely looking film filled with some truly stunning set pieces (particularly a computer generated train crash that looks amazing)but is undone by the languid pacing of the film which fails to generate much suspense. While I didn't expect the attention deficit cutting style of, say, Michael Bay, I did expect a more involving experience.<br /><br />The screenplay by John Logan (based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick)fails to generate characters with much depth (beyond Melies and even then he comes across as just a grumpy "get off of my lawn" old man who wants nothing more than to nail Hugo). Certainly Hugo is portrayed sympathetically he is, after all, an orphan and, at times, a bit of a scamp always trying to find food and stay off the radar of the station inspector who is always looking to catch a stray kid.<br /><br />The truth is that I found little in "Hugo" to identify with and my kids just couldn't appreciate the fantasy elements of the film. Visually rich, "Hugo" only has the wisp of a plot to hang the rest of the film on. While the performances are solid throughout by the actors, Logan's script uses cliched characters that just don't draw us in.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get a commentary track from director Scorsese. His insights on what appealed to him about the project, shooting it and the challenges of taking a popular children's book and adapting it to the big screen would have been interesting.<br /><br />We get four featurettes on the production of the film and a fifth one that's a bit of a joke about actor/comedian Sasha Baron Cohen. The making of featurette provides little insight into the making of the film. "The Cinemagician, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s" is the best of the featurettes giving us a bit of insight into the cinematic world of the talented, groundbreaking visionary and brilliant filmmaker who almost ended up forgotten by many due to the fact that his films weren't in circulation for a long period of time.<br /><br />The featurette on the visual effects is pretty fascinating glimpse into the creation of the train crash scene. Finally the featurette on the automaton and their popularity during the late part of the 19th and early part of the 20th century is a pretty interesting glimpse into these robotic devices.<br /><br />Given all the praise the movie received, I'm surprised that there aren't more special features as part of this set (given that most are produced prior to the release of a film).<br /><br />Rather than do a blind buy, I'd recommend renting "Hugo" first to see if it's a film that appeals to your sensibility. I would approach the film without expectations (given Scorsese's name that may not be possible but try) and, perhaps, you'll enjoy it a bit more than I and my kids did. With all the praise the film received (which honestly was difficult to ignore), perhaps I was blinded to the appeal of "Hugo". I suspect I'll have to try it again after a little while to see if my take on the material divorced of expectations were inaccurate and colored my view on the film.<br /><br />I'd recommend going with the Blu-ray if you decide to pick this up because although the DVD looks nice it just doesn't do justice to the rich, lush look of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>"Do you ever wonder where your dreams come from? Look around, this is where they are made."  Hugo Caberet spends his days winding clocks and searching for parts for his auto-man.  After running into shop owner George Melies (Kingsley) and his daughter he is forced to reveal his secret to them, which sets off a chain of event that changes him and the city.  I have to start by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. I really liked it but it is very slow moving and for the casual movie watcher it may seem like nothing happened.  That statement may seem strange but after you watch it it will make sense to you. This is a movie that each scene builds on the next (like most Scorses's) and is hard to talk about without giving anything away but I will say that it is a movie that entertained me all the way through.  I can see why the movie is up for 11 Oscars, but I will be surprised if it wins any of the major ones. Overall, a movie I really enjoyed, but again not for everyone. I give it a B+.</p></br></body></html>

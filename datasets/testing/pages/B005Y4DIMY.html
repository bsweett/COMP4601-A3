I picked up the DVD version on an impulse and find this movie is still pretty intense. Lots of blood and gore for those of us who like it and who doesnt love Pinhead? The DVD quality is good with an option for widescreen or fullscreen and THX did a great job on the sound as well. Very well done and quite creepy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Clive Barker's deranged and brilliant imagination brings to life a story of the darkest recesses of Hell.  The gates are opened with a puzzle box key, letting loose the denizens of the Outer Regions of the Universe, the Cenobites.  Creatures whose sole existence is to bring pain to those who summon them.  <p>Gore-laden special effects and the first film appearance of the now Horror film staple, PinHead, make this a must for Horror fans.  The story of dark seduction, murder and betrayal and the terrible price to be paid is classic Barker!  The torturous designs of the Cenobites and their malicious glee in bringing pain are some of the most disturbing images ever brought to a world wide theater going audience.  Essential viewing for every Horror fan.  Written and Directed by Clive Barker.  &quot;No tears please, it's such a waste of good suffering&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S9887MZFNNH1.html">A3S9887MZFNNH1</a><br/><p>What can I say? This is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. It's so clever, both script and characters. This original spawned 3 sequels to date but none of them live up to this mordern masterpiece of horror. I  strongly recommend HELLRAISER (Not for the faint hearted.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>A man named Frank Cotton opens an exotic puzzle box, hoping that it will open the doorways to the pleasures of either heaven or hell. What he got was the pain and torture of hell. After spending some time dormant in the  floor boards of an upstairs attic, he is resurrected by the blood of his  brother, and must feast on more blood to become fully whole again. This  movie which was scripted and directed by horror writter Clive  Barker has  been highly regarded as a horror classic. Its loaded with blood and guts  and comes with quite an interesting plot. Very entertaining and watchable.  Based on the novel 'The Hellbound Heart' by Clive Barker.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>I love to read what others say about "Hellraiser," but it never fails to amaze me, even in regards to people who love this film, how much many misunderstand it. People write on & on what great horror icons the "Cenobites" are, & yes this is true, they have made a huge impact to cinema horror, but the "Cenobites" are not what this truly intelligent horror film is about...no, not at all!<br /><br />This is a film about Frank & Julia.  Frank will stop at nothing to find the next thrill, even if it means his physical & metaphysical destruction. Julia is the cool aloof wife of Larry, Frank's brother. Julia is seduced by Frank's dark & sadistic sexual aura, though that same aura lay dormant in Julia until Frank awakened it by seducing Julia before her wedding to Larry. "I'll do anything," Julia desperately confesses to Frank to keep his affection. Little does Julia dream that in the future that will be exactly what she has to do to keep Frank, after he unleashes "the Box," & its horror, the Cenobites.  In what is truly an Oscar worthy performance, Julia (Claire Higgins) the aloof, but so far non-threating wife transforms into the murderous, cold, calculating queen bitch, to ressurect & have Frank. To bad we've not seen more of her in other films.<br /><br />Yes, "Hellraiser" is about treachery in the family, the worse sort, deception & murder. "Hellraiser" is about blind love. Larry's unswerving devotion to Julia, which makes him the last to know, & seals his doom. "Hellraiser" is about the tragic plight of Kristy trying to save her father. What could be worse than knowing a loved one is going to be murdered & you could not stop it? "Hellraiser" is about real life plausible situations that are better off left alone, the darkest part of the human psyche, to want something so bad you're will to sacrifice anything & anyone to achieve it, maybe even your self. "Hellraiser" aptly uses the theme of don't tempt fate ("the Box"), unless your prepared to be taken by it, as the "Cenobites" so profoundly demonstrat.<br /><br />So yes, the true monster of this story is ambition & want. The "Cenobites" are just a cataclysmic vehicle (a very disturbing one) to carry Julia & Frank to their just deserts in the end. "Hellraiser" made the "Cenobites" seem like ultimate bogeymen by giving them little screen time & keeping them mysteriously cryptic to the audience, something later films could've benefited from. Thus "Pinhead" & crew were much more menacing & potent in this first, & by far the best, most intelligent film of the series, & in horror cinema.... But again, it was Julia & Frank, & their ambition & want that were the true terrors here. Nothing is more disturbing & horrific than discovering someone(s) you love & trust will eventually murder you.<br /><br />Chilling!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>I'd never really heard much about this horror film until I received it for Christmas. I had absolutely no idea of what I was getting into, but I must say I was very impressed with this horror film. It's no wonder it's a horror classic. While most critics were in favor of it (62% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), there were some who whined and complained about it. Roger Ebert gave the film an awful half-star out of four and said it was "uninspired" and "not scary." Most certainly not!<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: There is a mysterious box that when opened can unleash the pleasures of Heaven or the pleasures of Hell. It starts off with a man named Frank who buys this box and unfortunately unleashes the pleasures of Hell from it and gets taken to Hell where he is tortured by demons called Cenobytes. Then we are introduced to a couple; Larry and Julia who move into Frank's house (They don't know that he's dead). Frank was Larry's brother, but it turns out that he had a relationship with Julia while she was married with Larry. When the couple is moving in their stuff, Larry accidentally cuts his hand on a nail, and when he goes upstairs to the attic (Where Frank died and where Julia is at reliving the memories of her and Frank), he bleeds on the floor. After he, Julia, and his daughter Kirsty return from the hospital, Julia hears a strange noise upstairs and when she investigates she finds a hideously grotesque person who looks like a rotting corpse, but still alive. It turns out to be Frank, and that Larry's blood brought him back so he begs Julia to help bring him back, which means she has to bring people back to the house and kill them. But the daughter Kirsty starts noticing strange things about Julia, and learns of the box as well.<br />MUSIC: This film had really eerie music. It fit the mood of the film pretty well and was creepy too.<br />ACTING: For the most part the acting was pretty good, except for the actor who played Larry. He was flat-out awful and was also given moments of bad dialogue. Thankfully, the rest of the acting is good and you can forget about Larry.<br />ACTION: This film starts off a bit slow, but once it gets going it proves to be a very interesting and strange horror film. This film is also twisted and disturbing and is filled with all sorts of hellish things. This film is also both gruesomely violent and excessively sexual in demeanor, but unlike most horror films, the sexual aspect doesn't get annoying and is actually done tastefully. This film was a creepy, disturbing, surreal nightmare that oozes with style.<br />OVERALL: It's a definite horror classic, that every horror fan needs. Unlike what Roger Ebert said, this film is rather inspired and very unique. There is nothing quite like this film. Moral lesson overall: don't play with weird boxes.<br />THE GOOD: Interesting story, good music, good acting, imaginative, gory, and stylish.<br />THE BAD: The actor who plays Larry sucks and the film starts off a bit slow.</p></br><a href="../users/AAI57M3OXP5NK.html">AAI57M3OXP5NK</a><br/><p>This is a horror classic because it stars many unknown people and it is very scary.  The only idea of the movie I didn't personally like was the spinning box at the end but hey nothing's perfect.  This movie only had a 1 million dollar budget.  If you're a fan of horror movie I suggest you get this movie and get Hellraiser 2:Hellbound also is just as good.  I heard there is another Hellraiser coming out, Hellraiser 6.  I recommend Hellraiser because horror movies will live on.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>It's astounding to ponder that I was twenty-four years younger at the tender age of eight when Clive Barker's directorial debut scared me out of my hi-tops in that splendid year of our Lard, nineteen hundred and eighty-seven. The mind boggles, really. However, the how and why of that venture are at least as entertaining as the features of this disc, which I'll attend to in just a few minutes.<br /><br />From memory, I can't retrieve the paper name of my babysitter. No matter; as I knew her then as Fat Legs (her most prominent attribute, especially from my then-diminutive perspective), so shall she be known again, if only to avoid confusion. Fat Legs and I arranged numerous clandestine trips to the cinema that my dear mother never knew anything about until I confessed all to her a few years ago. In this way, I was able to view many films that were otherwise verboten and she had a place in which lengthy heavy petting with her noxious boyfriend was possible (I scarcely noticed, though that spectacle beside me was surely more offensive to the senses than anything found in this picture).<br />Still furious that I hadn't been allowed to attend a screening of Blue Velvet the year before and enticed by a crude TV spot, my little boy's heart was set on, nay, utterly devoted to seeing Hellraiser. When Fat Legs protested by informing me that one of her friends had told her it was "gross," I threatened to reveal her cache of weed, from which I'd confiscated a joint in case she didn't take my threats seriously. Even then, I knew that petty, opportunistic women only understand force, a fact which has helped me to avoid unimaginable suffering.<br />On a bright, warm weekday in September, we were transported in the IROC-Z of Fat Legs' imbecile beau from the far-flung countryside into culture-free Philadelphia suburbs, and I was treated to my very first taste of horror on the big screen. This was equivalent to learning how to swim by being dropped into the ocean amid a battery of barracudas, though far bloodier. I emerged bewildered, very shaken, vaguely aroused and troubled by nightmares for the next two months...without a single regret.<br /><br />Working against conventional wisdom, Barker realized that a filmic adaptation of his terrific novella, The Hellbound Heart, would be best served by a unique M.O. Here, gore is good and more is MORE, but these excesses never overshadow the very human drama at the the story's core. Gruesome and twisted, those now-iconic Cenobites plastered on the walls of nearly every '80s horror enthusiast aren't really the monsters of the movie; they're merely impartial enforcers of the underworld, present only to retrieve one who's escaped them and savage anyone who dares interfere. No, the real villains are a pair of deranged lovers - one alive, the other resurrected - driven by love, lust, frustration and monomania to the cruelest murder and deception.<br /><br />Prior to this, Barker's only movie-making experience had resulted in two awful short films that he wrote, directed and co-starred in during the '70s. Here, his first stab at feature direction is so skillfully indulgent that one would imagine he'd helmed at least a half-dozen major productions before taking this on. Admittedly, he hasn't directed many films since then (and certainly little of worth), but no matter - Hellraiser is a movie that stands the test of time. Barker's style is preoccupied with sweaty close-ups and gory effects, but never to the extent that he neglects his gifted performers, for whom he clearly has enormous respect. Hellraiser's longevity can be attributed to the fact that it incorporates at least as much character development as grue-trigger, and it's all the better for it.<br /><br />This is the kind of birthday present that's filled to brimming with features to please devoted fans and many invocations of memories long dormant. Twenty-four years later, I've been reminded that I still love Hellraiser to death, though I'd like to think that the feeling isn't mutual.<br /><br />All of the DVD's menus are decorated with an excess of chains, Cenobites and the famous Lament Configuration, and both the main and extras menus feature music from Christopher Young's sweeping, unforgettable score. Like of most other Anchor Bay releases, the feature's audiovisual quality is first-rate. Properly restored to its 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio, the picture is as sharp and vibrant as one could expect from SD. The remastered Dolby Surround 5.1 track has a punchy quality, driving home every sickening snap of bone and thrusting orchestral swell. Though hardly as lucid or forceful, the Dolby Surround 2.0 track is perfectly adequate, and no doubt better suited to smaller speaker configurations. For those of us who grew up watching one washed-out, muddled, mutilated VHS edition of this film after another, this really is a sight and sound for sore eyes and ears. Twenty-eight easily navigable scenes can be accessed from thumbnail selections.<br /><br />Of this disc's wealth of special features, the commentary track voiced by Barker, Ashley Laurence and horror screenwriter Peter Atkins is by far the best. Personable and self-effacing, Barker and Atkins analyze every aspect of the film's themes, characterizations and production, and tell a few great stories related to the conception and development of the picture. Laurence - whose presence in the movie repeatedly distracted this viewer from the commentary itself - also has a fine sense of humor and a prodigious memory, with which she effortlessly describes myriad difficulties related to any number of scenes with good-natured charm. Genuinely funny, informative, conversational commentary tracks aren't so common, so it's always a treat to hear one.<br /><br />This edition contains five featurettes - about two more than I needed or wanted, but it can't be argued that Anchor Bay isn't catering to completists. In Hellraiser: Resurrection, a slickly edited featurette shot a decade ago, Barker and Laurence hadn't much to say that they didn't reiterate more ably in the commentary track. Still, Barker and Doug Bradley read some intriguing passages from The Hellbound Heart, and there's plenty of discussion with Cenobite actors and the film's makeup wizards on the challenge of creating and wearing those ghastly cosmetics. In Under the Skin, Pinhead actor Bradley explains in far greater detail the exhaustive physical and psychological difficulties of his stolid role, his interactions with Barker and footage cut from the film that nobody else seems to know about. His interview is interspersed with video shot between takes that I haven't seen anywhere else.<br />If you own a prior edition of Hellraiser on DVD, the three interviews with Andrew Robinson, Ashley Laurence and Christopher Young that are new to this disc really don't warrant its purchase, but they're very good. In addition to his talent as an actor, Robinson is a great orator (why he's not called on to record commentary tracks is inexplicable), and his insights regarding the movie's characters and his fellow performers bear terrific nuance. He also explains his career in summary by recounting his work with Don Siegel and Clint Eastwood on Dirty Harry, and his subsequent typecasting - a story that should have been featured on the substandard Dirty Harry DVD.<br />Laurence's interview begins and ends with her best impression of a teenage airhead, a persona that's been unintentionally adopted by most middle-aged American actresses nowadays. With an affection for trivia mongers, she describes her casting and character, the arduous nature of the shoot, the disappointment of insubstantial sequels and her (rather good) fantasy artwork. Her career is a curiosity - she hasn't the depth to be an actor of any distinct excellence, but she's still much more talented than most other attractive women who are typecast as ingenues and shrieking eye candy; a comparison with her performance and that of the wooden, unappealing Terry Farrell in the second sequel confirms that much.<br />Composer Young also has plenty to relate: his earliest influence in film music (Herrmann, to no surprise), how he was chosen over British musical group Coil to score the movie, his working relationship with Barker, the dynamics of composition and the challenge of composing another score for the sequel, Hellbound.<br /><br />Three trailers and four TV spots are included. Of the two U.S. theatrical trailers - one "R-rated," the other "G-rated" - the latter is certainly better, more suggestive and restrained, and edited with a keener eye. The international trailer is essentially a long, poorly-cut spoiler sporting a very stupid tagline; it's only interesting because Sean Chapman's vocals aren't dubbed over by an American voice as they are in the movie. I remember the TV spots well enough - brief, murky little allurements that filled my juvenile noggin with such longing for those sights they had to show me!<br /><br />Over two hundred images can be viewed in the still gallery slide shows, which can't be accessed one-by-one, but can be navigated like any other video. These include photos of the cast and crew while performing; application of makeup; prosthetic fabrication; the many alignments of the Lament Configuration prop; the design, development and execution of special effects; American, French, German and English publicity photos; Japanese theatrical posters; plenty of storyboards, including a shot-by-shot comparison of the footage and storyboards of Frank's resurrection.<br /><br />Both the first and final drafts of the screenplay in PDF format can be accessed with a DVD-ROM drive.<br /><br />Those who intend to buy the Blu-Ray edition should note that nearly all of the aforementioned features are available therein.<br /><br />A year after I saw this, I was much more prepared for its sequel...but that's another story for another review.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>Being new to the Hellraiser movies I recently watched this.  Being a huge fan of Horror movies I have to say, this movie is in the top 3 of my favorite horror movies of all time. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>The vast majority of mid to late 80s horror movies are pretty lame. HELLRAISER is one of the rare exceptions. Rather than following the same dull old formula, Clive Barker singlehandedly reinvents the horror film for a frustrated and jaded audience. He uses sheer darkness and evil to enhance a sense of utter doom. Frank is a sado-masochist with a thirst for unlocking the secrets of hell (the ultimate experience of pain and pleasure merged). He attains the Lamont Configuration (a puzzle box which is actually a transdimensional gate), unleashing the cenobites (pinhead and his fellow demons), who torture and tear Frank apart. Some time later, Julia (Clare Higgins) and her family move into Frank's abandoned house. Julia had had an affair with Frank, who is her husband Larry's brother. Frank is resurrected when a drop of blood soaks into the attic floorboards, revitalizing a piece the cenobites missed. As he grows, he needs more blood and flesh to sustain his re-emerging form. Julia grudgingly agrees to help Frank by luring men home with her for sex. Instead, they are hit in the head and attacked by a grotesque, cannibalistic Frank, who takes what he requires, leaving only a shriveled carcass behind. Julia's daugher Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) gets a hold of Frank's puzzle box and inadvertently gates in the cenobites. They are ready to take her with them into hell, until she tells them that she can deliver uncle Frank into their clutches. The rest is a gruesome fearfest! There are moments of real terror in HELLRAISER that make 99% of the rest of the genre look ridiculous by comparison. A uniquely chilling story became a terrifying movie that only Barker could pull off. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>Great horror, effects, plot and scares.

Lovecraft style horror, S&M and fantasy combined thanks to the mind of Clive Barker who wrote and directed this movie. Based on his novel "The Hellbound Heart", this movie sets as his debut movie and the movie that made him for what he is today. The film deals with sexual perversion and the occult, it does offer some graphic gore with disturbing imagery including subject matter that pushed the limits back then as it's still disturbing today. Pinhead became a horror icon much like Michael or Jason or Freddy or Leatherface, the creatures are very imaginative including the cenobites and the special effects are well done for it's time.

This movies takes you down to the boundaries of "Hell". Clive Barker has most certainly made history with "Hellraiser", and I don't think there will ever be one like it again. I love when Pinhead goes "Oh Kirsty, I have such sights to show you". Barker took gore to another level because I was definitely creeped out by Frank walking around with no skin on his very bloody, and very fleshy skeleton. There definitely aren't too many scary and orginal horror movies today but, "Hellraiser" is one of a kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Of the many horror franchises that endured through the 80s and 90s Hellraiser, surely, has the most sequels (I think we're up to part 10 now). The mythology, and point, may have been lost on the long line of successive filmmakers who took up the reigns after Clive Barker's departure, but the original film remains a true, hardcore, nose-to-the-grindstone horror that is completely unafraid to do whatever it wants.<br /><br />The story has Larry Cotton and his wife Julia move into the old family home (in what seems to be England, but no one is speaking with an English accent) where his wayward brother Frank appeared to have been staying before mysteriously taking off. Little do they know that Frank's soul is imprinted on the walls of the attic and brought back to life, in a skeletal, barely human capacity, when Larry spills his blood on the floor. Frank and Julia rekindle a fling they once had as he begs her to help him restore his human body, by luring naive wannabe lovers, for him to feed on before the Cenobites discover he's escaped their dimension of eternal pain/pleasure.<br /><br />What impresses me most with Hellraiser is that everything is done before the camera. All the blood and make-up effects are cheap but utterly convincing. If it were made today it would be nothing more than a CGI-crapfest that would horrify no one, but the raw, ugly visuals and unfiltered cinematography elevate Hellraiser far, far above the trash that passes itself for horror these days.<br /><br />Chris Young also provides a glorious score, which may well be the best horror film score of all time. It's absolutely amazing stuff and I highly recommend that you check out the Hellraiser score CD. It gives the film an extra edge and a touch of timeless class. Despite being made in the 80s, Hellraiser has barely dated and looks much better than modern horror films with 50 times the budget.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great with a 1.85:1 1080p picture and Dolby TrueHD 5.1. A decent amount of extras are included.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Be forewarned that this review is primarily for the DVD release of Hellraiser, not the film itself.  It's no secret that Anchor Bay has done an excellent job bringing classic and cult horror films to DVD, even if it's over and over again.  The 20th Anniversary Edition of Clive Barker's Hellraiser adds a few new extras, while bringing over the same extras that were available from the older DVD release of the film.  What's new here are the interviews with the film's stars Doug "Pinhead" Bradley, Andrew Robinson, and Ashley Laurence.  Other than that, it's the same stuff that we had before, including the interesting commentary by Barker and Laurence.  If you already own the previous release of Hellraiser, the new interviews alone aren't any reason to go out and pick this up whatsoever.  Anchor Bay has quite a habit of double and triple dipping their DVD's (there is yet again another edition of the original Evil Dead on the way as well), and the 20th Anniversary Edition of Hellraiser is no different.  As for the film itself, it's an excellent and original exercise in violent horror that still holds up 20 years later, and remains Clive Barker's crowning film achievement.  If you don't already own Hellraiser on DVD, then by all means pick this edition up, but as said before, if you already own it, there's no reason to pick this edition up too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Hellraiser is an extreme horror lover's dream come true.  Clive Barker's unique vision marked a virtual rebirth of the genre at a time when slasher sequels were the fun, yet predictable, norm.  Although the premiere setting for viewing this movie is a crowded theater of screamers (and sick puppies like myself who find humor in gore), one can still achieve a quite satisfactory effect watching this movie alone in the dark.  Some horror creators rely on blood and gore for its own sake, others rely on the story itself to produce the desired effect.  Clive Barker is one of the few horror geniuses who can make copious amounts of gore an integral and necessary part of the story.  Hellraiser can be deliciously gross, so those with weak stomachs should beware.  It features rats; decayed, maggot-infested meat; and copious amounts of blood--and that's just the teaser.  Later there are acts of cold-blooded murder,  human dismemberment by arrays of chains, a partially formed, pus-dripping, oozing carcass, and then the incredible Cenobites themselves.<p>The movie at its simplest level is a retelling of a story that goes back to Goethe's Doctor Faustus and beyond--when you sell your soul to evil forces, you will regret it.  Frank Cotton is a despicable, uncaring man who has grown bored with life's most extreme pleasures.  When he hears about and eventually acquires a puzzle box which can open the door to a new world of perverse pleasures, he finds out that one man's pleasure is another man's pain under the tutelage of the Cenobites.  Somehow, he manages to escape the other world, and when his brother's blood is spilled in his chamber of horrors, his body begins to reform itself.  More blood is required to complete the job, and his brother's wife Julia supplies it by picking up men at bars and bringing them home for Frank's nourishment.  The prim and proper Julia was ravaged by Frank soon before her wedding to Frank's brother Larry, and she enjoyed the experience so much that she will do anything to get Frank restored to vaguely human-looking life.  Larry's daughter Kirsty, played by Ashley Laurence in her motion picture debut, discovers what is going on and manages to get her hands on the puzzle box.  When she is introduced to the Cenobites, the fun truly begins.  <p>The Hellraiser series degraded into a sad mimicry of itself in later movies, but the original vision personally sculpted by the masterly hands of writer and director Clive Barker is a horror masterpiece.  The Cenobites are one of the most unusual, fascinating "bad guys" ever dreamed up in the imagination of man.  They really don't appear too often in this film, and Pinhead (played by the great Doug Bradley) is never referred to by this name even in the credits.  When they do appear, with Pinhead enunciating such great statements as "No tears, please.  It is just a waste of good suffering" and "We will tear your soul apart," they are truly horrifying, mysterious, and larger than life.  Less is definitely more when it comes to the prominence of Pinhead and his demonic associates in the movie.  <p>Those who dislike horror probably have sense enough to stay clear of Hellraiser.  Those of us who revel in extreme horror delight in watching it.  If you are an intermediate-level horror fan initiated by the Scream and Freddy/Michael/Jason movies, here is your chance to really test your horror mettle.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Clive Barker's 1987 masterpiece, "Hellraiser," is a little more challenging than your average Freddy Or Jason movie. It bears little resemblance to what was popular in horror at the time, and yet it's still a hit, and still strikes a chord with a massive audience. If you've ever seen it, you can't forget it. As many times as I've seen it, I still get uncomfortable (in a good way) and find new things to appreciate.<br /><br />"Hellraiser" is an extremely well made, mature movie that isn't for everyone, not even for every horror fan. There is no campy humor to it, no relief from the drama. It digs deep, and really brings to light just how ugly the world can be, and how cruel and senseless people can be, often under the spell of love. This is all performed, of course, by Julia and Frank (Claire Higgins and Sean Chapman), two very intense lovers who find themselves in a bind. See, it's not bad enough that Julia is actually married to all-around nice guy Larry (Andrew Robinson), who is in turn, Frank's brother, but apparently uncle Frank has a taste for the spicier things in life and finds himself in Hell after playing around with a puzzle (Pandora's Box, anyone?). In order to resurrect Frank, who is all but a mass of bloody tissue and bones, hiding out in an empty room in Larry's house, Julia lures innocent, albeit, horny men inside with the promise of a good romp. What they get, however, is usually a hit to the head with hammer, often repeatedly, and a visit with Frank, who sucks their blood from their body, which in turn makes him stronger and glues him back together, so to speak. However, there's a race against time here, as the Cenobites -- grotesque creatures of Hell who inflict unimaginable torture on anyone who solves the puzzle -- are looking for Frank after he escapes their clutches. Add to that, Larry's snoopy, attractive and intelligent daughter Kirsty (played by Ashley Laurence) is onto their scheme. Things get very dirty, very gross, and very bloody in the 93 minutes this movie runs. However, the gore (which is well acheived for it's time) is not what makes the movie crawl under your skin. It's the horrible things that Julia does for Frank, for her forbidden love. Just the fact that humans can be this ugly in real life is enough to make you uneasy. Aside from the far-fetched situation, this movie isn't that far removed from the real world. This vision, unfortunately, took a backseat in later sequels (starting with Part 3) to the character of Pinhead (whose name actually isn't mentioned in this installment) and the attempts to turn this into another "A Nightmare On Elm Street" type franchise failed miserably. I usually don't look down at horror sequels, I love 'em, but the only other installment that holds up as well as the original is part 2. But I digress.<br /><br />"Hellraiser" is a fantastic film, one that any genre fan should see at least once. It's different, it's bold, and it's risky, but it works. It's very gloomy, so I recommend you put yourself in the right mood before watching it. Clive Barker crafted the perfect horror film here, and considering the current horror movie climate, this history lesson is worth repeating. It won't exactly "Tear your soul apart," but it will make you very uncomfortable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X7FS1H4R02W1.html">A1X7FS1H4R02W1</a><br/><p>She got him men, for the skin.

Laurence then winds up in some kind of hospital later on in the movie where she has the puzzle box and discovers for herself some pretty hellish things like PinHead, played by Doug Bradley, and his 3 goonies. Fast, fierce, gruesome fun all the way threw with Clive Barker on the spot, he doesnt destroy this horror classic. Ashley Laurence is scorching hot....even to this day.

If you're a hardcore horror enthusiast, I know you're already considering clicking that little "not helpful" button down there.  That's fine.  I'm not writing this for you.  This review is for people who kinda like horror, and who have been told by their hardcore horror enthusiast friends, "You have got to watch HELLRAISER.  It's a classic."<br /><br />Movies are classics for a couple of reasons.  Either they are timelessly good or they set the standard for the time with innovative directing, writing, or (usually) special effects.  But let's be clear: just because something leaves its mark on cinematic history doesn't make it worthy of five stars.  After all, the Model T was an historical creation, but compared to cars of today, it sucked.<br /><br />HELLRAISER set the bar for horror movies of its day (1987) with some truly disturbing imagery and groundbreaking special effects.  A guy named Frank purchases a puzzle box that opens the gate to a universe populated by grotesque creatures known as Cenobites (I know; it sounds like the name of astronaut candy).  The Cenobites are agents of "indivisible pain and pleasure," which translates into "killing people with chains and hooks."  Why someone would create such a box, let alone buy and open it, remains the greatest mystery of the movie, perhaps to be solved by one of its many sequels.<br /><br />Frank is obliterated by the Cenobites in one of the most confusing openers to a movie I've ever seen.  Shortly thereafter, his half-brother Larry (newly remarried to a mannish woman named Julia who also, coincidentally, had an affair with Frank) moves into the house and accidentally bleeds on the floor of the attic.  Larry's blood somehow transdimensionally nourishes Frank's tortured soul back into corporeal existence.  But not all the way.  So he must convince the still-whipped Julia to troll for horny men to bring back to the attic so that their lifeforce might fully rejuvenate Frank's icky-sticky bloody body.<br /><br />Frank's original return from the Cenobitic universe makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, but it is a well-done and supremely squeamish scene.  There are a few other moments that turn the stomach (Frank's final scene foremost among them), but they don't make much sense in the grand scheme of things.  In fact, the story line exists as a shadow of the gore, a nuisance to be endured so that Barker might treat you to more scenes of sadomasochistic torture.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is unaccountably bad, and the Cenobites' powers are murky at best.  I learned after watching the film that it had been edited from the theatrical version, which might explain the disjointed plot and the several scenes that appear to have nothing to do with the movie.  I'm not sure if there's an uncut version out there anywhere, but this version WILL leave you doing a lot of scalp-scratching.<br /><br />Classic?  Not exactly.  I give it props for ambition and for being (in '87) something no one had ever seen before.  I respect the place HELLRAISER holds in the pantheon of horror, but respect doesn't always mean admiration.  If you're one of those hardcore horror fans, I get where you're coming from, but I also don't believe you need reviews like this to tell you if a movie is any good.  However, if you're a passing enthusiast who's wondering if the hype is true, if you're interested in something creative, scary, clever, and cool, be aware that this movie is only really one of those things, and not in any great amount.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>The greatest true horror movie ever. No horny teenager, who cannot act and no comic relief. This movie grabs you by the throat and doesnt let you go for ninety minutes. The movie is short, but gets to the point and there is rarely any filler. Pinhead is such a great actor, and he has amazing quotes and doesnt try to make the audience laugh. Doug Bradley does any amazing job as Pinhead and his human counterpart. The other movies are excellent, and I enjoy the entire series. Part 3 was probably my faviorte, and I cannot see why people do not like that entry. After Bloodline, it went straight to video but never disappointed me. Pinhead is rarely seen in the last 3 movies, but when he comes on screen, its a treat. Pick up this movie or if you dare, the whole series. Wont be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Why?<br />Well... Because the box has been opened.<br />So?<br />We have come to rip apart your soul.<br />Super....<br />Yes.<br />(long silence)<br />So what's the deal with the pins in your head?<br /><br />I have never seen this film before and only finally decided to check it out because I have been annoyed by a friend constantly going on at me to watch it. I didn't really enjoy it and although there was a lot of good to say about this film, there's also a few negative things I have to say about it which I'll touch upon later. The film itself is a typical 80s slasher film with a lot of blood and a holy hell of a lot of guts. Based upon the Clive Barker novel "The Hell bound Earth" this film may have missed a lot of detail out of the film that was in the book, making it all the more confusing to me.<br /><br />The thing is primarily based around the plight of 3 main characters. Julia & Larry move into an old family home of his and are looking to settle in when Julia finds a zombie version of Larry's half brother, Frank who she once had an intimate moment with and has not forgotten about him since their encounter. At the start of the movie we see Frank with a mysterious puzzle box in his hands and as he's managed to activate it which opens a door to hell, releasing the fury torturous wrath of the Sadomasochistic Cenobites. Hooks shoot from the box and pull Frank apart and we see "Pinhead", one of the Cenobites, sorting the mess and closing the box. In order for Frank to fully regain his humanity and spend his life with Julia, she must offer human sacrifices to him so he can gain the needed parts of the sacrifice in order for him to reconstruct himself.<br /><br />I think I got the basics of the plot correct so I will now touch upon what I think worked and what I think did not. The overall tone of the film was extremely creepy, there's no denying that, and in fact I felt like this film should have featured the Cenobites as the main protagonists rather than it feel like Julia as the main focus. That is in fact one of the worst things about the film. Clare Higgins, the actress playing Julia just appeared wooden and it was actually a bit of work to believe her character. The scene at which she first encounters Zombie Frank is one that should have played out with strong emotion and genuine fear. However, I felt myself just finding the whole scene drab and pointless. It was because of the lack of acting ability I couldn't become engaged in the terror that should have been that first moment.<br />Apart from that, there is sincerely a lot of good about the film. The tone of the entire film is very dark and really puts across the idea that the events taking place are because of the direct association with Hell. The initial rebirth of Frank is something that will go down in movie history as one of the most haunting and amazingly orchestrated zombie births ever. Before the days of CGI, everything had to be done for real with the use of clever animation techniques as the creature rises from under the floorboards and out of the ooze.<br /><br />I would recommend it, but only for those who really like the gore fests. It's not a film with a huge amount of depth and in fact finishes with a lot unexplained and I still don't really get the whole Pinhead posse thing, especially the Cenobite cameos by Jabba the Hutt's younger, slimmer brother and the monster from Resident Evil. Their particular appearances seemed to go unexplained and just came across as freaky looking for the sake of it. Pinhead was pretty cool and I can fully understand why so many people remember him as a figurehead of the 80s horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>I hate using a star system to rate things.  People skim over them, without reading the actual review a lot and think a 3 star is a bad movie.  Its not.  And Hellraiser isn't a bad movie.  I don't think its a terrific film, but its interesting.<br /><br />The story behind Hellraiser and the mythology therein is extremely involved and interesting.  I was genuinely intrigued and interested the entire way through.  However, the acting was atrocious.  It made scenes that probably were supposed to be moving and/or scary hillarious.  It was over-the-top and maudelin and really kept me at arms length.<br /><br />Of course, this is a 1980s horror film and relies on puppetry, much like the amazing The Thing.  I can look past technical effects on films and they usually don't bother me, mostly because I can see them within context of the time and appreciate the skill going into it.  But when a puppet monster is chasing Kristy down a dark hallway and you can not only see the cart the monster is resting on but the people pushing the cart, I have a problem.<br /><br />Again, the story is quite interesting and dark.  The gore level is high, but it has a good story on which to sit on, unlike some other gore films.  It fits within the construct.  I'm very interested in seeing the second film in the series as it continues the story, much like Halloween 2.  If you can look past the technical deficiencies and the very laden and melodramatic acting, its an interesting story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I am a huge horror movie and book fan, but "Hellraiser" was beyond lame. While Pinhead is a cool looking villian, he wasn't in this film more than five minutes. The acting was even below some of the worst horror films I have ever seen (Pinhead excluded of course). I liked Clive Barker's novel The Hellbound Heart, but this movie was cheesy beyond belief. I need to watch my copy of John Carpenter's "The Thing" again to remind myself why I love horror films so much. Stick to writing Clive!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" is certainly quite imaginitive, but it is not a horror film classic by any means whatsoever.  As I watched, I thought to myself that this movie is very radical and way out of the ordinary and that is probably why people like it so much.  Frankly, I did not find the cenobytes to be that scary (interesting, yes, but not scary) or Frank in his bloody flesh form.<br /><br />The movie kept my interest because I wanted to see how it would end, so for that part, I'll give it a 2.5 STAR rating, but as an overall horror flick, I wasn't that impressed.  That being said, it was suspenseful and the story is somewhat interesting and entertaining to a certain degree.  The acting is actually pretty good and the directing is average, but the storyline isn't that compelling as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a man named Frank, who is quite evil (he comes off as more evil than the Cenobytes to me) and very sensual who buys a puzzle box that supposedly contains the secret pleasures and pain of Hell which are obviously closely related.  I sincerely doubt there is any pleasure in Hell, but if you are evil maybe you can get some sick form of pleasure from it.  Anyway, the Cenobytes are released from the box by Frank.  The Cenobytes introduce Frank to incredible torture and pain that is of a supernatural nature.  The leader of the Cenobytes named "Pinhead" orchestrates such torture upon Frank and anyone else who dares to fiddle with that box.  I should say that I found all of the Cenobytes to be interesting and very imaginative.  My favorite one was the whose teeth were always chattering.  I thought he was funny.<br /><br />However, Frank discovers that he can actually regain human form if he is given enough blood and flesh from the living.  His former adulteress procures men that she kills in order to provide this blood to Frank and slowly but surely he regains this human form.  However, the daughter of the adulteress's husband informs the Cenobytes that Frank is escaping their clutches and she leads Frank back to them so that they can take him back to Hell where he belongs.  The young lady discovers that the Cenobytes want her as well, but she is able to manipulate the box to thwart any of their evil advances.<br /><br />The ending of this movie is pretty lame in my opinion as some demon flies off with the box.  While Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" is quite imaginitive and entertaining to some degree, it is also plenty gross and disgusting as the movie indulges itself with inordinate amounts of gore which the film obviously relies very heavily upon in order to attain a horror-like quality.  To me, this is not scary, but it is gross.  I do like blood and gore when it is used correctly to accentuate the horror, but I believe that blood and gore are a tool which should be incidental to the story and atmosphere of the movie.  With "Hellraiser", the blood and gore overshadows the story to some degree.  I understand that a certain amount of gore was necessary to the movie's story, but when the gore overshadows the story, I think the movie becomes more of a display of gore for the sake of gore.  In other words, it takes more than imagination and gore to be a great horror movie, and Clive Barker fails to create the ever elusive classic horror experience in "Hellraiser".<br /><br />Given the criticisms of this movie, I still recommend renting "Hellraiser" just to be able to have said that you have watched it if nothing else, but don't expect it to live up to the raving reviews it has received on Amazon because it simply isn't that scary, nor is it great, and I feel very confident that sophisticated horror movie fans will see exactly what I mean when they watch it.  After having read these glowing reviews, I can honestly say that I was disappointed with "Hellraiser".  2.5 STARS for "Hellraiser" for the fact that it is a decent (but flawed) horror movie, imaginative and entertaining to some extent.  However, for the reasons mentioned herein, I would conclude by saying that I do not think that "Hellraiser" is a great horror movie or a classic horror movie by any stretch of the imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>The blood is too thick and gooey, the skin with hooks in it is very obviously latex, and the Cenobite with the shades is more goofy than scary.<br />Also, I must point out the silliness of some of these humans and of the plot elements:<br />1.  Why did the pleasantly bland fellow get remarried to such a horrible woman?<br />2.  If you see that your dad's head is bleeding for no apparent reason, wouldn't you immediately assume that something is terribly wrong?<br />3.  Who the heck moves into a house with rats and bad plumbing when they don't have to?<br />4.  Why is the word "Cenobite" never really explained?<br />5.  When a homeless guy comes into your place of business and starts eating bugs, wouldn't you call the police?<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />There's such a fine line between silly and scary, isn't there?</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>This is one of those films you remember from being young and think, hmm that seemed like a cool movie. Then you see it as an adult, and wonder what was I thinking? There seems to be 2 stories going on here. The whole Pinhead and his box to hell. And the other story is a guy who escaped pinhead and needs blood from victims to be become normal again.<br /><br />The living corpse, slowly coming back to life in the dark room, was the better story. It could have been a movie without the whole Pinhead tie in. I find the Pinhead characters laughable and not the least bit scary, especially the cone-head female one who looks like that chick from Saturday Night Live. You just wanna smack her. The 2 headed monster puppet was utterly ridiculous. And the sado-masochist torture devices  are nauseatingly stupid and unnecessary.<br /><br />I wonder who greenlights these Clive Barker movies? They all seem like they were written by some 13 year old heavy metal fan who draws comic books on the side. The only Clive Barker story which even remotely entertained me was Candyman, and he ripped that off from earlier stories (bloody mary).</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>HELLRAISER is one of the creepiest films made by Clive Barker. While he's best known for helping to write CANDYMAN, it's the HELLRAISER saga that brought his name into the limelight. Boasting one of the most infamous of horror legends (Pinhead), HELLRAISER established Clive Barker as a tour-de-force director of the horror genre. Clive was quoted as saying he tried to check a book on film directing in from the local library, "and they had two, but they were both checked out. And I thought I'm so f---ed, I don't even have a book." Nevertheless, HELLRAISER was one of the best horror films to come to life. Bringing the idea of s&m to the horror genre was unsettling, as HELLRAISER really explores the idea of what pleasures and pains await certain people.<br /><br />The catalyst of the movie is a puzzle box, which opens up a gateway to true hell, one where pain is the ultimate pleasure awaiting its victims. Kirsty (played by the beautiful Ashley Laurence) has found her own place, but is having some wicked dreams. Her parents have moved into a house with a dark secret: Frank (brother of Larry) was killed in this house by the box, and the inhabitants (the Cenobites) have ripped him to pieces. Now after Larry suffers a fairly nasty cut from moving, the blood that drips on the floor of the infamous room awakens Frank from under the floor, and the transformation is one of the creepiest, sickest things. But the visual of it is astounding, and no doubt one of the film's strong points. Frank is now transforming, and he needs Larry's wife Julia to help him. One by one, she brings home strangers posing as a prostitute, but each victim is beaten until Frank sucks them up to help reshape his body until ultimately, he's his old self again. But no one's ever escaped from hell, and when the Cenobites along with their dubious leader Pinhead (played magnificently by Doug Bradley) are hunting him down, Kirsty strikes up a deal with them to bring him back. However, it's going to be real hard after Frank takes over precious dad's body and Kirsty, after time, realizes it. She has to sacrifice dad to save her and put the Cenobites away for good. The ending of the film subsequently leaves the film open for the next chapter. This sick little gem brought Clive a little success, and championed seven sequels that would ultimately follow in its wake. While none would match the success of this cult hit, HELLRAISER is the best of the bunch.<br /><br />So if you want a good horror film with good monsters, creepy visuals, sturdy acting, and good direction...try HELLRAISER. The transformation of Frank will send chills down your spine, and no doubt the ruthless Pinhead should give you reasons to think twice before playing with strange puzzle boxes. In the world of HELLRAISER, there are "such sights to show you".</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>It is surprising when you go back and watch "Hellraiser" again, after having steeled yourself for the experience because this time you know exactly what is coming, that Pinhead, the leader of the Cenobites, has so little screentime.  Of course, this shortcoming has been rectified by the various sequels to the original, but even if there had only been one "Hellraiser" the image of Pinhead would remain one of the most disturbing images of contemporary horror films.  <p>However, even without Pinhead, "Hellraiser" has plenty of intensely disturbing images.  We begin with the compelling little Lamont Configuration, an exotic puzzle box that opens a door to Hell, which is what poor Frank (Sean Chapman) discovers just both the Cenobites rip his body to pieces.  But when Frank's brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his second wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into a new house and Larry rips his hand open on a nail, the blood brings Frank--well, part of him--back from the Hell dimension.  It seems that Frank and Julia had been lovers, and she had promised to do "anything" Frank wanted.  Julia was looking for something in the area of sexual deviancy we assume, but Frank now has something else in mind as he holds Julia to her word, namely, seducing men to come back to her house and up to the attic where their life's blood can help further regenerate Frank's body.  By the time poor Larry and his daughter Kristy (Ashley Laurence) have a clue what is happening upstairs, it is pretty much too late. <p>Writer-Director Clive Barker does not pull any punches in his first film when it comes to putting as much raw horror on the screen as he can cram into this 94 minute film.  "Hellraiser" rewrites the rules in terms of how far you can go and what you can try to do to the poor viewers of your horror film.  The key thing is that as gross as things get on the screen, there is an intelligence and a creativity behind the horror that can neither be ignored nor easily dismissed.  You can imagine Barker saying, "What?  You WANTED to see a movie that would give you nightmares, didn't you?"  This is not a particularly polished film, but I really think that adds to its effectiveness.  "Hellraiser" is a primal horror film, operating on a raw level that is as innovative as it is disquieting.  If they had rated this film "X," I probably would have agreed with the judgment.  Not for the squeamish (or their neighbors).</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>This is one of the more fiendishly original ideas ever put on screen. A simple gold puzzle-box, correctly solved, opens up the "pleasures of heaven or hell" to those who seek the ultimate in experience. Of course, we never see the pleasures of heaven -- this is a horror movie, not a porno flick -- but the pleasures of hell are delivered by four latex-and-leather nightmares called Cenobites: highly stylized humanoid demons who inflict the most awful tortures imaginable on those who summon them. In this case, however, one of their former victims, the debauched, thrill-seeking Frank Cotton (creepy Sean Chapman) manages to escape from hell when some of his brother Larry(veteran actor Andrew Robinson)'s blood accidently re-animates what is left of his corpse (which is not much). Frank recruits Larry's deceiving wife Julia (a very, very creepy Claire Higgins) to seduce and murder some hapless businessmen so he can feed on their blood to restore himself, but eventually he will need a suit of skin to walk around in -- and his brother's is a perfect fit. Opposing them is the fiesty Kirsty (Ashley Lawrence, typical horror-movie actress -- shreiking and running), Larry's devoted daughter, who ends up making a devil's bargain with the Cenobites in an attempt to save her father's life. "Hellraiser" is a gritty, nasty, ugly film, with more gore and blood-splattering than you can shake a mop at and very few redeeming characters, and it is more gory and disturbing (the Cenobites calm, clinical thirst for torture is somehow much worse than the chainsaw-waving of Leatherface or the the silent-stalkings of Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees) than it is scary, but the concept is so original, and so jarring to see, that you will never be completely free of it. Unfortunately, Cliver Barker's subsequent directorial outings, like "Nightbreed" and "Lord of Illusions" were so bad that this film, which he says is his least favorite outing, comes off as more of a fluke than the beginning of something grand. But "Hellraiser" stands fine on its own.</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>Hellraiser is an original film made at a time when the genre was seriously bankrupt of new ideas. Hellraiser stands apart  from other 80s horror films and it was welcomed when it first appeared in 1987, a point where Jason and Freddy were slashing screens and the horror genre was by the numbers profiteering.  <p>Clive Barker got to direct his own story and with a budget of only one million dollars he made a very stylish and inventive horror film.  Based on the novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser is about the ends people will go to experience pleasure...and pain.  Frank is a drifter who is presumably bored with his travels and his excesses.  As the film opens he purchases a mysterious, black laquered box and opens it, unleashing unfathomable pain at the hands of the Cenobites--"angels to some, demons to others"--figures from hell led by 'Pinhead'.  Meanwhile, Frank's brother Larry and his wife Julia move into an old family home in England as they try to kick start their icy marriage.<p>Before long, a drop of blood in the floorboards awakens Frank, who escaped the Cenobites and is hiding in a gellatinous, skeletal form.  He begs Julia to help him, and she lures men to the house where Frank consumes them in the hopes of growing flesh back on his slimy bones.  Meanwhile, Frank's daughter Kirstie (from a previous marriage) arrives and suspects all is not well on Ludovico Street.  Eventually she summons the Cenobites, led by Pinhead, and cuts a deal with them so that they reclaim Frank and spare her.  This sets up a cruel and bloody climax between hell and earth. <p>Hellraiser has proven very popular over the years.  It's a gothic horror tale about desire, lust, betrayal, and consequences.  Pinhead immediately became another horror icon alongside Jason, Freddy, and Michael, but he's not a movie slasher and he's not some unstoppable id hunting down teenagers.  Indeed, Pinhead and the rest of the Cenobites (the first two films feature the best crop including the Chatterer, Butterball, and an unnamed female Cenobite played by different actresses) are called by those who have sought out the elusive Box and they provide a kind of ultimate judgement on their souls.  (Both Inferno and Hellseeker, the fifth and sixth installments of the series, respectively, would play this angle.)  Indeed, the Box itself (known as the Lament Configuration) is a recognizable icon as well.  Doug Bradley plays Pinhead and has gone on to be the only consistent factor in every Hellraiser film since. <p>It's still hard to believe this was only made for a million dollars in 1987.  It's not slicked up, and go figure: the effects and makeup look a lot more expensive than the budget would indicate.  These are considered 'old fashioned' makeup effects as well, since today cgi would be cheaper, quicker, and not necessarily better.  Christopher Young provides one of the best modern horror scores and that alone seriously raises the stock of this film.  He would outdo himself with the score to Hellbound: Hellraiser II. <p>Those who don't like gore be warned: this is a very bloody film.  "Jesus wept" indeed.  The Cenobites favor ripping people's skin off with hooks and chains, so you know where that's going.  (Yes, they'll literally tear your soul and you apart.)  However, the gore is not a cheap shock tactic, it's central to the story and is a device Barker uses in his fiction as well.<p>I would highly recommend tracking down the tin box set featuring Hellraiser and Hellbound together along with a gorgeous booklet and chapter index cards.  It's out of print but Amazon always has sellers out there. <p>The film looks and sounds great on DVD, and the commentary is very rewarding.  Barker reveals a lot about the production, and you get the idea that this was a labor of love.  A rare thing when a horror writer of some originality gets control the movie of his own work. <p>Highly recommended for horror films.  This film will deliver some legitimate chills.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I've seen this film a zillion times in my local shop, and finally decided to get it, due my Dad showing an interest in it. I'd never heard of Pinhead before - just knew of his face due to seeing it on the DVD! <p>I actually enjoyed this film, but I doubt I would ever watch it again. It's a one-time only film I thought. I found it extremely dated, but that's only to be expected. It was quite hilarious looking at Julie's (Clare Higgins) outrageous makeup, multi-coloured eyeshadow right up to the eyebrows! Oh, the 80s. What a decade.<p>I didn't really find it that scary - gory more than anything. There was a certain scene (where Kirsty's - Ashley Laurence - character is in hospital, and starts playing with the box) that reminded me of Labyrinth slightly. She was running through a seemingly endless corridor, whereas Jennifer Connolly was running through a maze. <p>Clare Higgins was extremely familiar - she had one of those faces. I've looked at what she's done, but she hasn't done anything I recognise, so I guess she reminds me of someone from Neighbours/Prisoner, or some other Australian show! She had that kinda look about her!<p>For all you film score fanatics out there, Christopher Young (Sweet November) does a brilliant score to this. It's not that intrusive, as any good score should be, and it highlights all the good parts of the movie.<p>So I liked this film - that means someone out there is removing it from their wishlist right about ... now!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>I've read The Hellbound Heart, but the fresh approach Clive Barker made in directing the film added "uumph" to an already excellent story.  What a visual conception!  Goobers coming up from the floor, the unforgettable scene of spinal cord meeting the goopy brain, the gelid, slippery goo, the half-formed rib cage - hello vicar!<br /><br />Larry and Julia Cotton are moving into the house left to Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his wayward brother Frank (Sean Chapman).  The house is a mess, with maggots in the kitchen and a makeshift bed and evil shrine in one of the upstairs rooms.  The shrine shows evidence that Frank has been and gone from the house.<br /><br />After cleanup, while moving, Larry cuts his hand on a nail and bleeds heavily onto the bare floorboards of the room which formerly held the shrine.  Julia (played by Clare Higgins - her businesslike sexiness was a real turn-on) has been reminiscing in the room over her former affair with Frank.<br /><br />It turns out Frank had been playing with a very dangerous toy in his room, Lemarchard's Box, which opens the gates to a hellish realm ruled by Cenobites from the Order Of The Gash.  Indeed, Frank unlocked the gates to hell itself.  Larry's blood on the floor sparks Frank's return from hell, growing his flesh back from goo.<br /><br />Enter the Cenobites, "Angels to some, Nightmares to others", starring Pinhead (played by Doug Bradley).  The cenobites rule the worlds of pain and pleasure (we have such sights to show you).  Frank wants to come back from hell, and convinces Julia to bring him more blood in order to fill out his fleshless body.<br /><br />But she's observed by Kirsty, Larry's daughter, and when Kirsty discovers that Frank is alive in the house, she manages to get the box away from him and inadvertently summons the Cenobites again.  Can Kirsty make a bargain with Hell, for Pinhead to accept Frank's return instead of taking her?<br /><br />This is one of the best horror flicks ever made.  Pinhead rocks!  He's evil and nasty looking, as are his followers.  There's a lot of gore and gross, gooey things in the film, more than enough to satisfy that unnatural taste you have for bleeding flesh.  Julia's coldness always drew me to her.  I loved it, her elegant, icy demeanor.  I also love Kirsty's happy drunk.  It reminded me of me.  The upside-down Hell-Monster was cheesy-cool, unique and frightening.<br /><br />If you are a horror aficionado and don't own this movie, then buy it ... it won't disappoint.  A 10-Star horror flick.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A157XTSMJH9XA4.html">A157XTSMJH9XA4</a><br/><p>Plot: In Hellraiser, we're given the frightening story and the tragic ripple-effect of Frank Cotton's twisted experience with evil. He's a bit of a scumbag, only out to get the pleasure he feels he deserves. It seems like a dream come true when he gets his hands on the mysterious puzzle box that is supposed to be a gateway to the universe's extreme pleasures, but he discovers that gateway leads straight to hell -- litterally. The Cenobites -- a clan of demons just dying to bring you home to daddy -- come to rip Frank to pieces and enjoy every bit of it. He's trapped within the pits of another world full of torture of both physical and mental nature. But when his brother's blood from an accidental scratch reaches the floor of the room he "died" in, he escapes back into Earth's realm in the form of a messy skeleton-man. It's the blood of another that has enabled him to take on some physical features. Now Julia -- the long-lost lover of Frank -- enters the plot. She discovers the gruesome Frank in the attic, and must keep it a secret. To make matters truly worse, she's just as determined as Frank is to get every bit of flesh back on those bones and muscles. To do so, he needs more gore from fresh humans. She becomes his death tool, as she lures unexpecting men into her house when her husband is gone, murders them, and leaves their corpse to Frank. For the icing on the cake, Kirsty, Frank's niece, enters the storyline. She slowly uncovers the horrors of her returned uncle and his new plans. She manages to get a hold of the puzzle box, though completely oblivious to its powers. As you could imagine, this is a bad move. Those Cenobites now come for her, and quite litterally all hell breaks loose. Between the endless greed of Frank, the diabolical support of Julia, and a pack of demons on her tail, Kirsty becomes just another confused target caught in the middle of a deadly game when human nature takes a turn for the worse.<br /><br />Hellraiser has in every way become a cult classic. It certainly deserves it. Even if you don't feel like catching the moral of the story about human greed, lust, and curiosity, there's plenty of blood, guts, suspense and other delicious terrors to help you out. Enjoyable by horror fans of every kind, Hellraiser succeeds in giving the people want they want. Though various sequels have spawned throughout the years, causing the main Cenobite "Pinhead" to be degraded to just another slasher, the first arguably remains the best. If you dare to unleash the painful pleasures of a definitive horror movie, get your hands on Hellraiser and enjoy the haunting effect of how far our corrupted minds can take us. Possibly, to hell and back...</p></br><a href="../users/A29COAL60SB48B.html">A29COAL60SB48B</a><br/><p>Clive Barker proved he is a genius not only in the printed word but behind the camera as well.  This, the first installment of the Hellraiser series, should be the measuring stick by which *real* horror should be judged.<br /><br />By reading the reviews here, a person will understand the plot.  But what one can't put into words is the fear that gets caught in your throat whenever the Cenobites appear (the handful of times you see them).  That's how a horror film is supposed to work: Having the monster(s) scare the crap out of everyone - characters and audience alike - without having to make too many appearances (and definitely *not* cracking cute one-liners to ease the tension for the chickens in the audience).<br /><br />As a fan of Freddy Krueger (more than Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees), I remember watching this the first time and being quite frightened.  I actually appreciated watching a horror movie that was able to elicit fear - that did its job of scaring me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, this series really went downhill.  My feeling is that Pinhead was mass marketed to the high heavens to make him more likeable for the masses (like Freddy and Jason), taking away his scariness and making him crack laughable one-liners.  I saw an interview years back with Clive Barker and he expressed regret that he allowed Pinhead to be mass marketed (using Pinhead's likeness on everything from dolls to trading cards).  He felt that all the marketing caused Pinhead to lose his effectiveness as a monster.<br /><br />As a fan of true horror, I couldn't agree more.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>'`Hellraiser' is, of course, one of the more famed and revered horror films of the last 2 decades or so.  Course, much of it's fame comes from the popularity of the 'Pinhead' character, but it's really impressive for other reasons. (He's cool and all, but not that big of a deal, and really doesn't do much of anything, in this one anyway.)  Though there were still plenty of good horror films being made, much of the originality of the genre had slipped away in the 80's.  'Hellraiser' stands in contrast to this trend, as it refuses to be forced into one of the prominent horror subgenres, and actually attempts to be horrific on a number of different levels.  Beyond this, it has fine, stylish direction from Barker, well above average performances from the cast, an excellent, if occasionally a bit overbearing score, and some great, classic fx work.<br /><br />Basic setup is this:  Recently wed Julia and Larry Cotton move into a house jointly owned with Larry's brother, Frank, with whom they've lost touch.  Turns out Julia has quite a thing for the crazy, lecherous Frank, but, unfortunately for her, he's dead.  (Earlier, we'd been shown that he was killed in the attic of this very house, ripped to shreds by creatures from another dimension, whom he summoned by solving a puzzle box.)  While moving in, Larry cuts himself and bleeds all over the attic, which mysteriously revives Frank, albeit in a less than complete form.  Julia discovers Frank, and, in order to revive her affair with him, begins to seduce and murder men, so that Frank may feed on them, and continue to regenerate.  Naturally, this does not bode well for either Larry or his teenaged daughter Kirsty, and it turns out that the demons who abducted Frank in the first place are rather interested in seeing him come back home, thus complicating things even more.  This is a relatively complicated plot summary for a horror movie, which I think points towards why this is so good.  It just covers a lot of bases: It has gruesome, visceral horror in the form of Frank's spectacular resurrection and skinned appearance; gothic, haunted house horror as we are aware of Frank's existence, in the attic, but Kirsty and Larry aren't; emotional, human horror as we are forced to relate to the initially reluctant Julia, who commits horrible, repulsive crimes in the hopes gaining a greater desire; monstrous horror, found in the late arrival of the sadistic cenobites; familial horror, (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT) as Kirsty is forced to do battle with the fully resurrected Frank, who now appears to be her father, Larry, having stolen his skin in order to be completely restored.  Really, I can't think of another horror film that works in so many different ways.  Upon an initial viewing, this film is really likely to keep you on your toes, as it heads in a number of different directions.  I don't really find this movie scary, but I'm so rarely really scare by horror movies anymore that I can't really call this a fault.  What I look for in horror are interesting situations and ideas, things which turn the real world upside down, and few films have made as powerful and nasty an alternate reality as `Hellraiser' has.<br /><br />The acting is strong, if not always remarkable.  Higgins is good as the conniving, icy Julia, with her elaborate, terrifying 80's hair.  Robinson is also good as Larry, managing to not make his character particularly likable, but also not making him unlikable enough that we feel he deserves to be victimized by Frank and Julia.  He needs to be right in the middle, and he is. (SPOILERS: Also, he does a nice job in his later role as Frank, even if it is perhaps slightly over the top)  Laurence is perhaps a bit bland as Kirsty, but she's good enough, and quite good looking, I might add, in spite of her 80's hair.  (Wait, check that.  She was only like 16 at the time, so, legally, I am not allowed to find her attractive.  So never mind.)<br /><br />The gore fx and makeup in this movie are quite cool.  The skinned Frank isn't precisely terrifying, but he works, which is pretty impressive as the whole walking Gray's Anatomy figure is kinda silly in concept.  Also, his initial regeneration scene is awesome, one of my very favorite pieces of traditional FX work ever.  The Cenobite makeup is quite nice too again, when it also could've turned out quite lame.  (Well, fatty ain't so great, but the rest are cool.  And fatty actually looks quite impressive, his design just isn't very good.)  The two monsters they have aren't so great, but they're kinda fun in a cheesy  way, and they don't have too much screen time.<br /><br />Well, I guess I've rambled on enough.  Definitely one of the best, and most distinctive horror films of the 80's.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Clive Barker is unique in the field of horror and fantastique. All is based on the square and cubic figures. The magic box is cubic and its opening opens doors to hell. The basic human situation is also square. The father, his second wife, his brother and his daughter. We can see at once that this square figure is not that square. It is centered on the father and hence we have a trihedral figure, the father at the top and the three others building the triangular base. This geometry is reflected in the three cenobites, plus a fourth one that appears afterwards, in Pinhead whose pins are planted on a square pattern, in the house that has three floors, Franck ? living ? on the third one, hence in an inverted order. It is the absolute hatred and rivalry between the two brothers that determines the whole story. One is a social success. The other one is a marginal reject and he wants to take his revenge. So from the third floor, from the top of the house, he will come down and steal his brother&#8217;s wife and skin and try to steal his daughter. Hence there is a strong trinity in this vision, but a trinity that is perverted from the outside. The cube itself decomposes in a whole and complex set of triangular or semi-triangular forms, and it is this decomposition that leads to the opening of the doors of hell. When these triangular shapes are brought back into the cubic form things go back to normal. <p>The film is based on a simple idea : pleasure is going beyond the limits of normalcy. Hence pleasure goes beyond pleasure itself, as it is understood by ordinary people, and thus the acme of pleasure is suffering. The cenobites themselves are humans who have inflicted suffering on other fellow humans and have thus deserved being promoted into angelic devils, monsters who bring pleasure through suffering. The best part of this film is that there is an escape, but it is so narrow, so fragile, that it practically does not exist. It is pure luck, chance, randomness. There appears no plan, no order, no logic in this escape. Any deal is crooked and one has to keep his fingers crossed and nothing else. Fate is fatal and lethal, fetal and regressive....</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Yes my friends here we are again with another cut version of a film on DVD.<br />How sad the state of the industry.As a consumer I really feel a big let down(i.e.cheated) with these people/companies who are just out to get their bucks and seem to have no remorse or moral sense of obligation to the people who buy their products.Let's look around for a moment.<br />We have two of tinseltowns' biggest names Lucas and Spielberg.Lucas up until recently refused to release the original theatrical versions of the original Star Wars trilogy.When he finally did(after years of fan "begging") they are in a terribly poor state of transfer,alongside his newer "vision" versions(in pristine condition,thank you very much!).Spielberg has outright refused to release the theatrical version of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" on DVD ....period.It's gone though quite a few incantations on DVD.But the slipcases of the versions out there won't tell you this isn't the original version.Then we have the huge Star Trek franchise with its' first movie "Star Trek-the Motion Picture".It has not been made available on DVD in it's original theatrical form either.But AT LEAST they tell you up front the one they do have is a new "directors cut".<br />Then you have MGM that tells you one thing(on the slipcase,on the DVD,etc) but it's another when you buy and watch.Case in point:"The Frankie and Annette" collection(see my review)where the entire collection is supposedly widescreen and it isn't.Then you have a very minor company that re-releases a Laurel and Hardy classic"March of the Wooden Soldiers"(see my review)that is supposed to be one thing and upon close examination not up to the hype of its' creators.And on and on,ad nauseum.<br />Now we come to Hellraiser.A wonderful movie of its' genre....I would even daresay a classic in some respects.An original in thinking and execution.I liked this movie when I saw it in theaters upon release and watching it on VHS some time after;both were identical in footage.I recently picked this DVD version up and was astonished at how much had been cut out.<br />Now the print itself is in good shape and the sound has been reworked nicely but Freddy Krueger himself couldn't have done a better slash job than this.<br />The films impact and meaning has been greatly diminished by the elimination of alot of gory sequences and alot of the eroticisim.It's almost a made for TV release print.There are things you find that don't make alot of sense.For example you see Frank at one point sucking the life out of his sister in law on the stairs.She slumps down there and the action continues.Much later we see a short shot of her now on an upstairs bed(in worse shape than on the stairs)being held in place by the hook chains and holding the cube in her hands.? How did she get there,one wonders?<br />An example of the eroticism would be to look at the beginning of Hellraiser Two.It starts out with a flashback montage taking actuals clips from the first one.There is a short scene of Frank and the sister in law making out on the upstairs bed.....hmm,you might not recall having seen that in the first one and you would be right;that's because it wasn't in this versions' first one.<br />The list goes on and on but suffice to say Anchor bay isn't going to be releasing it in its' original form and uncut any time soon.Even the 20th anniversary edition coming out soon apparently has the same print and just a few more extras,that's all.<br />So my advice to you all is AVOID any print released by Anchor Bay now and in the future unless the slipcover explicitly tells you it is "complete and uncut".Because in this version,as B.B.King so eloquently put it,"the thrill has gone".</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>The brilliance behind Clive Barker's Hellraiser doesn't simply lie within his undeniably powerful visuals, but also with his ability to create a singular world of horror, one defined by the terrifying rules of his devilishly unbound imagination. Every facet of this masterpiece screams originality, from blood-soaked nightmares and disturbing surrealism to the imagery of the Cenobites and their twisted realm of pleasure and pain. Few have ever crafted a vision as recognizably frightful and unforgettably chilling as Hellraiser.<br /><br />When Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson) and his wife Julia (Clare Higgins) move into a house previously occupied by Larry's thrill-seeking brother Frank (and former lover to Julia), they unwittingly resurrect the zombified remains of the treasure hunter long since trapped in the confines of hell. Needing human blood to fully regain his original form, Frank plays upon Julia's feelings for him and manipulates her into bringing unsuspecting victims back to the house. When Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) discovers Frank's sinister plan, all hell is literally unleashed upon them in the form of grisly demons intent on subjecting their summoners to indescribable horrors.<br /><br />Easily the most impressive aspects of the late 80's thriller are its ample gore effects and shocking imagery. Ingenious special effects combined with Bob Keen's skillful makeup work result in several truly unforgettable moments of terror - most notably in Frank's ghastly reincarnation, Kirsty's crimson deathbed nightmare, and the shockingly violent conclusion. In addition to the mesmerizing practical blood and makeup effects, Hellraiser offers us the Cenobites, treacherous demons whose gothic and bondage influenced blend of attire and weaponry showcase Barker's knack for macabre visuals. The now legendary Pinhead is perhaps the most stylistic of them all, standing tall in black leather garb and crowned with a face full of pins. Like Freddy Kreuger and Jason Voorhees before them, the villainous Cenobites have become so popular that they have surpassed their antagonist roots to virtually become the stars, as evidenced in practically all of the sequels. Instead of rooting for the protagonists to defeat the cunning torturers, we anxiously wait to see who they will kill next.<br /><br />A few clich&eacute; lines, some novice acting, and questionable lightning effects really can't detract from one of the most original and terrifying horror films ever created. Many have copied, few have equaled, and as Pinhead would have you believe, no one has ever escaped.<br /><br />- Joel Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>While it is not my all-time favorite horror film, I must say that Hellraiser is very interesting in originality, and at the top of my list.  It is a very creepy film, complete with eerie music and numerous characters with highly questionable natures.  While Pinhead (leader of the Cenobites, or demons, if you will) may be the ultimate object of evil, it is Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) and Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins) that have spotlights shining down on their evil intentions throughout this film.<br /><br />Frank has opened Pandora's box, opening the gates of hell and releasing the cenobites, who take Frank into a place beyond pain and pleasure (if you ask me its just pain on top of pain).  Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson) and his second wife, Julia, move into Frank's old home - thinking Frank up and left, Julia has realized Frank's presence still remains.  An acident of spilled blood slowly revives Frank, into a rather gruesome, skinless human (we see this skinless Frank throughout most of the film, so you'll have to get used to this particular visual).  Julia can't keep the visions out of her head of the affairs she and Frank had in the past, and thus promises Frank she will help bring him back to life, by brining men into the home, seducing them and finally killing them.  Frank has every desire to return to human form by taking these victims remains, no matter the cost, and Julia is right there in the middle of the gruesome action.<br /><br />Ashley Laurence plays Kirtsy Cotton (Larry's daughter) who is suspicious of Julia from the start.  It is Kirsty who ends up with Pandora's box and releases the cenobites, thus offering a bargain to give them Frank in exchange for her life, however the cenobites won't go so easily.  In the chilling words of Pinhead (who is deliciously played by Doug Bradley (I wish the character had more screen time)) "We have such wonders to show you."<br /><br />Pinhead is a visual that is hard to forget.  He is named so because his head and face are literally lined with dozens of nails, representing eternal pain and suffering.  His cenobite followers are rather creepy as well, especially "chatter box"<br /><br /> Hellraiser's greatest strength lies in originality.  There is actually a story to this horror film, and is so much more than a basic slasher flick.  Expect some of the unexpected here.  Hellraiser is lined with evil characters, and that list does go beyond the cenobites.  It's a chilling and eerie hour and half of interesting viewing "pleasure".<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Horror - 4<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>"Hellraiser", directed by Clive Barker, is an amazing sort of fantasy/monster-horror crossover movie that has the creativity and professionally written touch to both:<br />A: Make its own set of rules, and B: Not only abide by them, but still prove to be a twisted movie!<br />So, if you probably know the plot by now but haven't seen the movie, I'll convince you as to why this movie is so incredibly awesome:<br />First off, "Hellraiser" is a movie that is able to pull off having quite a few characters. There's Julia and Frank, who, although are deemed the "protagonists" are in the end, obviously the villains. We have Kirsti, played by the gorgeous Ashley Laurence, the type of jailbait only Motorhead would sing about (I can't believe I just said that!), and Kirsti is also a protagonist, though, we can tell that she stays good and doesn't cross over to being an actual villian.<br />And then we have the Cenobites! Pinhead, the sadomaschocistic (sp?) leader, Butterball as I call the heavy-set one, the Chatterer, one bad fella who proves it when he sticks his fingers down Kirsti's throat, and Fembot, as I call the Cenobite that's female with the pale face and shadowed eyes.<br /><br />OK, so obviously all the characters are dazzling, but what makes this movie even better is how there's so many twists! When Frank opens the puzzle box, he is supposedly dead, but when a mover cuts his hand on a nail and spills blood on the floor, Frank gets resurrected as a deformed corpse...hey, that's the supernatural for ya.<br />Frank and Julia used to be lovers, and the only way for Julia to restore Frank to his fully human form is to bring people to their attic and kill 'em, then their blood will spill so Frank can absorb it and become fully human.<br />This is also all the responsibility of the puzzle box that contains Pinhead and the Gang, and that comes into play about an hour in. Kirsti, now the only protagonist that's still good, opens the box, and, yes, does set Pinhead and the Wild Ones free. If there's another thing to know about "Hellraiser", is that it's a movie with GREAT monsters! Pinhead can even control chains all with his head, baby!<br /><br />But the ingenious factor of "Hellraiser" is how sadistic it becomes. How far Julia is willing to go to give Frank rebirth? How many people must she kill to have her lover return from being but a bloody corpse? What's gonna happen to Kirsti, the innocent heroine, throughout all of this? And what are Pinhead and the Cenobites gonna do?<br />The answers lie within the movie. Within these 90 minutes of sex and violence lie true intellect, so many props go to Clive Barker. The good guys, the bad guys, the monsters, the sublime sort of pain each character seems to be in (as Robert Englund said on the 100 Scariest Movie Moments countdown), the gore, the plot, EVERYTHING about Hellraiser that I thought was good, was GOOD! This is a movie that, if you rent it for the weekend, you WILL watch it twice!<br />And since that was the case with me, "Hellraiser" now holds a high and mighty spot on my "Horror Movies To Buy" list. WATCH THIS! If you like fantasy horror, if you like scary movies with good monsters, if you wanna watch a movie with lots of depth, twists and style, "Hellraiser" will make your night! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Clive Barker<br /><br />Cast:  Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence, Sean Chapman, Oliver Smith, Robert Hines.<br /><br />Running Time:  94 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence, extreme gore, nudity, and language.<br /><br />Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" portraits Frank Cotton (who starts out the film as the main character; played by Andrew Robinson) as a soulless man who lives only for life's pleasures. He will go to great lengths to satisfy his lusts, and thinks nothing of who he may be stepping on to get there. He is offered a small, strange puzzle box called The Lament Configuration by a strange man in what looks and sounds to be a Mid Eastern market. The box, he is promised, will open the gates to a world of pleasures that no mortal can possibly imagine. Frank takes the box, but he doesn't understand that the pleasures the box offers are to the demons that live within it. The Cenobites, sadomasochistic creatures who live eternally beyond the gates that the box can open and close, take great pleasure in ensnaring new human victims to toy with, imprisoning them forever in a labyrinth of pain and suffering. Frank disappears, and many months later, his brother and sister-in-law come to live in the abandoned home.  The film then switches gears and gives us a new main character, Julia (Clare Higgins), the wife of Frank Cotton's brother Larry; Julia is a cold woman. Beautiful and immaculate, she is icy and distant and seems to derive no pleasure from anything, least of all her husband and his daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty (played solidly by Ashley Laurence). Julia's only private joy are the memories she has of Frank, with whom she once had an affair. Frank seems to be the only man who was never intimidated by Julia, treating her roughly and breaking down her defenses. Little does Julia know that Frank never left the house; he is upstairs, in the attic, having escaped from the Cenobites and now biding his time until he can return to a world of flesh and blood. When Larry accidentally injures himself and bleeds on the floor of the attic, Frank is brought back, feeding on the fluid and slowly regenerating, growing back bones, muscle and skin. Julia soon discovers the terrible secret in the attic. After her initial shock and disgust, she agrees to help Frank, for whom she still lusts, and begins bringing him men she picks up in bars. She bludgeons them to death and Frank feeds on them, each one helping him in his regeneration.<br /><br />The main reason "Hellraiser" stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh, and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be.  "Hellraiser" breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skillfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.  A writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged; just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating. This film differs from most other eighties horror films because of the fact that the actors are a talented bunch. You come to expect bad acting from this sort of film, but "Hellraiser" has only spare moments of mediocre performance.  The entire cast shines, with Clare Higgins making the biggest impression as the evil Julia. This was Clive Barker's directorial debut, and at times, it's clear that this is the case; but Barker makes the best of his locations, and while his camera sometimes feels enclosed; it fuses with the tragic music brilliantly, and all this helps the film to create that fabulous atmosphere so convincingly.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>Hellraiser is a horror film to be mettled with.  A classic horror film about the disruption of a family because of a man who has gone to hell and came back with demons by his side.

A horror movie for the ages for anyone who can hold their food down.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>Of all the horror characters from the 1980s, Freddy Kreuger with his bladed glove, Jason wearing his hockey mask, the leader of the Cenobites from the film "Hellraiser" stands supreme.  I hate his nickname, "Pinhead," which suggest minimal intelligence and a gullible nature.  He has neither.  Rather, he is a General of Demons!  Now for the film.  This movie does have flaws: a dated feel and look which is all the more obvious when looking at the style of clothes and haircuts these actors donned; the most repellent flaw here are some cheesy special effects that end the movie on a campy note.  These flaws are altogether unfortunate because the ideas here are fantastic and gruesome. In particular, I was extremely disappointed when this film did not recieve an Oscar nomination for Best Makeup.  Only a year before this film came out, "The Fly" won the Oscar for Best Makeup for similarly grotesque and realistic creations.  Clive Barker brings his book "The Hellbound Heart" to the screen with surprising effectiveness, using religious imagery that is absent from the novella, and motivating all of the actors here to not treat this like a B-movie; and the dialogue here is a vast improvement over that in the novella.  The best acting performance comes from Claire Higgins who practically carries this film showing great range of emotion from lust to absolute horror in a state of intense believability.  Hers is my personal favorite performance here, but by no means is it the only notable one.  There are two Franks.  The Frank who longs for new experiences, "pain and pleasure...indivisible," and Frank the Monster who is the personification of evil: selfish, scheming, and murderously manipulative.  Both actors shine.  As for Ashley Laurence, this is her first film; and while she overacts occasionally, she also has many impressive moments of genuine emotion.  I've seen this film a dozen times, at least, and at no time in any of the "Hellraiser" films that followed this one do the Cenobites look and feel this malevolent.  However, it is not uncommon to find fans of the series favoring "Hellbound: Hellraiser 2" over the original.  I prefer the first one because the acting is better, the story is more eerie and reminiscent of the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, the dialogue is sharper than the novella, and there is a sense of inspired "we've got nothing to lose" ambience from everyone involved in every scene.  This DVD also has THX surround sound which is a huge improvement over my previous EP VHS tape.  This DVD is easy to recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Produced in 1987, Hellraiser was not only a much welcomed relief to the horror genre, but it was extremely original. <p>I watched it again in 2004, and despite it reeking of the 80's (hairdo's, fashions, some special effects), it still works and is quite clever.  Even the effects are very well done considering the year they were done.<p>The storyline is something I have not seen before and that's what makes it so special.  A genuinely creepy tale, that will make you look away on more than one occasion. A man takes possession of a special box that can open the doors of hell if not careful!  He is not careful and telling anymore would spoil this exciting tale.<p>A must own for horror fans.  The DVD sports a nicely cleaned up transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>15 years ago extremely gifted horror writer and author Clive Barker made his directorial debut with the original Hellraiser; a film that would re-define the horror genre, spawn many inept sequels that suffered without Barker at the helm, and introduce one of the most frightening, menacing, and unforgettable horror icons in film history: Pinhead.  Based on Barker's novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser was one of the few films that delivered loads of graphic violence and gore and could still be scary as hell, something that can very rarely be pulled off in the horror genre, especially today.  I'm not going to go into the storyline, you can read it in the Amazon review or one of many other customer's reviews, but I will say that this new edition DVD which is remastered by Anchor Bay (also responsible for recent remastered DVD's of the Evil Dead Trilogy and Manhunter among others) is great and features some commentary from Barker himself.  All in all, if you've never seen the original Hellraiser, you are sorely lacking.  But be warned: if you consider the recent "teen horror thrillers" to be horror films, then this definitely isn't for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>this is a gorey and dark film with a good plot.<br /><br />this is how i shall rate this film<br /><br />plot 5/5- an old fling returns from the dead and wants his brothers wife to help him be human again by the blood of others.<br /><br />meanwhile hes brothers daughter finds her undead uncle and her step mom helping him by killing others for him.<br /><br />  she finds the puzzle box and enters into the world of hell<br /><br />where she offers pinhead her uncle instead of her.beacuse her uncle had essacpt from pinhead.<br /><br />acting 4/5<br /><br />gore- 5/5<br /><br />  rated R for graphic violence,nudity,sexual content<br /><br />  some language</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>When Larry Cotton moves with his 2nd wife, Julia, into his family's abandoned, old house in London, they accidentally and unknowingly awaken Larry's evil, dead brother, Frank, who requires blood sacrifices to make his body whole again. Julia happens to be madly in love with Frank, with whom she had previously had an affair, so she takes on the role of provider for Frank's blood needs. Gradually, he becomes more whole, as Julia lures men to the home and murders them in the attic where Frank hides. Complications are more than just the risk of getting caught for murder, though, as Frank is being pursued by sadomasochistic, other-dimensional beings called Cenobites that desire to take him back to their realm and torture him forever. Larry's attractive, young daughter, Kirsty, becomes mixed up in the whole thing too when she discovers the skinless Frank, escapes him, and unleashes the Cenobites via a mysterious puzzle box that opens a doorway to their world. She attempts to make a deal with the Cenobites to save herself, but they are no to be trusted at all.<br /><br />Clive Barker's "Hellraiser" is no doubt one of the big 1980's horror classics. And, I have to admit, being a film buff with horror being one of my top genre preferences, I shamefully still haven't seen a lot of the big classics. This is one of those I had put off for far too long. Luckily, one of my good friends frequently introduces me to such films. So, I've finally gotten to see Hellraiser in this 20th Anniversary Edition DVD release from Anchor Bay. My overall feelings? This is a really good horror film. It's not something that's likely to scare you or make you jump, but it has cool, creepy, disturbing concepts, and if you are a gore fan (I'm not, but as long as the movie is good anyway...) it is sure to please in that area too. Not something to watch while you're having dinner (I won't do that again), but definitely worth viewing if you have never seen it before. I particularly am fascinated with the concept of parallel dimensions and their inhabitants these days, so something like this is extra fascinating and creepy to me because of that. The whole exploration of the concepts of hell and heaven and the afterlife, and possible alternative explanations incorporating multi-dimensional theory, really enthrall me. Though it is pure sci-fi/horror, this film has a lot more to offer than cheap thrills. I do recommend checking it out. It won't become one of my favorite horror films (though it does have a cute female lead, which I always appreciate), as I tend to prefer a higher "fun factor", adds to the rewatchability too, but it is still worthy of being a genre classic.<br /><br />As for the 20th Anniversary DVD (and, yes, this film IS on Blu-Ray already, but I can't say what is or is not included in that release), this one holds multiple behind the scenes interviews, a commentary with Clive Barker and star Ashley Laurence, multiple trailers, galleries, and some DVD ROM features. Pretty satisfying. There have been a great many sequels to the film, too, which I now have ahead of me to explore, but I get the impression from what I hear that this is the only essential one. I'm still curious to see them though; the ones with Ashley Laurence at the very least.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>So I'm going to review another horror series for this month & I'm going to review them all even the dreddful direct to DVD sequels. So<br />He'  l  l  raiser released in 1987 directed by Clive Barker who wrote the novel. The movie stars Andrew Robinson as Larry Cotten, Claire Higgans as Julia, Sean Chapman as Frank, Doug Bradley as Pinhead & Ashley Laurence as Kirsty Cotten. Story is this guy Frank bought a puzzle box. When he goes & solves it he gets ripped apart by hook chains & then the 1st appearance by PPinhead & The Cenobites. Frank's Brother & his Wife Julia move into the house Frank's no where to be found he believes he's in Prison cause he has a criminal history. Larry's Daughter Kirsty moves in with her bf cause she doesn't like Julia. Larry cuts his hand on a nail when he was moving a Matterss upstairs. The blood drips on the floor which leads to the attic which brings back Frank who is skinless. He needs blood & or g  an  s to look normal. Julia has history she was cheating on Larry with Frank & she decides to help him she picks up other guys & kills them so Frank can regain his skin. Kirsty sees what Julia is doing. Kirsty is confronted by Frank she throws the puzzle box out the window & runs for it & later passes out. She wakes up in a hospital She solves the box & it summons Pinhead & The Cenobites. She's chased by this 1 creature which is a nice practical effect. Kirsty tell Pinhead about Frank. Frank went & killed Larry & he has control of Larry. Kirsty goes home & then she finds out what happend & Frank & Julia try to kill her but he accidentally kills her & then it leads into the attic where Pinhead & The Cenobites tear Frank apart with great FX no CGI nonsense. They still want Kirsty to come intio their realm. She figures out the box & sends them back. I'm sorry it wasn't an in depth review. But this is a pretty solid horror film. Great effects messed up images. Clive Barker does good job directing. Andrew Robinson was great. Doug Bradley does a great job for the few scenes he had. Ashley Laurence was good likeable character. Sean Chapman did a good job. So that my H  e  l  l  raiser review & I'll review the 2nd which is my favorite.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YVDY3TISDRE1.html">A1YVDY3TISDRE1</a><br/><p>British writer Clive Barker makes his directorial debut with "Hellraiser", based upon a story he wrote.<br /><br />The story is about a couple Larry and Julia who relocate into an old house, owned by the husband's family member, who recently died.  Together they are eager to start a fresh life away from the city.  Larry's daughter Kirsty also has moved out and is starting to live on her own.<br /><br />Unknown to them, Larry's half-brother Frank (who had disappeared years earlier) is now living in the attic of the house; barely able to breathe in his half rotten body.  He has recently escaped the Cenobites, sadistic messengers of evil from hell.  Years earlier, Frank had discovered a magic box which would give him all the desires of his flesh.  It would come with a price though- he would experience pain, through the Cenobites' relentless torture.  Frank opened the box and entered into the dark spirit world.<br /><br />Julia discovers Frank in the attic.  Frank informs her that he needs dead bodies to feed off of to complete his transformation and to be made completely well again.  Since they were former lovers, she agrees to help him.  She seduces strangers in bars and brings them back to her house, taking them to the attic.  Then Frank kills them, sucking all the flesh from them so that he will be given more.<br /><br />The plot of Julia and Frank goes well, until Kirsty discovers Frank in the attic and the steals the box from him.  She escapes the house and runs away.  She passes out in a downtown area.  When she wakes she is in a hospital, the box by her side.  Out of curiosity, she manages to open it, and then the Cenobites arrive in her hospital.  She tours a fantasy nightamre world of pain and horror, escaping from one of the four Cenobites.<br /><br />Eager to tell her father about the dangers of Frank and the Cenobites she rushes back home to inform him.....<br /><br />* you'll have to watch the end of the movie to see how this conflict plays out.  I liked the actors in this film (Clare Higgins, Oliver Smith, Ashley Laurence, and Andrew Robinson).  They do a great job of keeping everything believable in this fantastical story.  The Cenobites are effectively creepy and scary and nightmarish.<br /><br />* highly recommended for the horror fan.  This film was released 23 years ago at the time of this review.  It is now considered a horror classic, and has spawned several sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Creepy Ghoulish, Disgusting, Gore-ish(I hate gore), Hell, Just a Horrible scary movie. don't care much for it, Obviously it scared me.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>This is the first film by Clive Barker, whom Stephen King called "the future of horror fiction." Hellraiser spawned a couple sequels, a couple more direct-to-video sequels, and a Freddy/Jason-like horror icon in the form of Pinhead. What we have here is not just a landmark horror film, but a pretty good one too.<br /><br />A man buys a puzzle box and is seen messing with it in a basement (attic? Who cares). Moments later, he is ripped to shreds. Enter Larry and Julia who are moving into a house that has recently been vacated by Larry's brother Frank. What Larry doesn't know is that Julia had an affair with Frank and harbors a fanatical obsession with him. When Larry cuts his hand open and the blood drips through the floorboards, Frank is reawakened. Problem is, he looks like a rotting corpse...So; he enlists Julia to assist him in bringing victims to the house so he can eventually fully regenerate and escape before the mysterious cenobites get ahold of him.<br /><br />Of course this synopsis plays down the role of both Larry's daughter Kirsty and the cenobites, but I don't want to give too much away.<br /><br />Hellraiser was made in the 80s and like almost all 80s horror movies; some parts haven't aged very well. Furthermore, some of the acting is less-than-spectacular, particularly the two Franks. Frank, before he's ripped apart, is played by Sean Chapman. This guy's line delivery is hilarious (although, apparently dubbed). Frank in monster form is played by Oliver Smith. Smith looks 100% frightening, but once again...Some of his delivery is just a bit off. On the other hand however...There are several examples of poor dialogue throughout this movie.<br /><br />The make-up effects however are exceptionally good, give or take a few scenes (i.e., Frank being ripped apart in the beginning). An example of some of the good makeup effects is a rather grotesque scene in which Frank is being reanimated by Larry's blood. There is something gag-inducing for you.<br /><br />Then, there are the sadomasochistic cenobites. The cenobites are some of the creepier, unique creations of horror cinema. Doug Bradley as the Lead Cenobite (that's right ladies and gentlemen, he's not actually called Pinhead in this film) gives the best performance in the film. Yes, he is given the best dialogue but he's actually really quite good. The Pinhead make-up and latex look very real and Bradley makes the character genuinely menacing and creepy. Pinhead is a horror icon for a very good reason.<br /><br />Hellraiser is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination (few horror films are), but it is a very satisfying horror movie. Even the sub-par acting isn't bad enough to take away from that. If you like your horror films bloody, depraved, grotesque, and unique...This is your horror film.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Hellraiser is a film that I recall seeing when I was seven years old. Clive Barker was a rising talent in Hollywood and made a great first film. Ashley Laurence( who early in her career looked like a low budget Heather Landekamp) gives a good performance as the films' heroine and Andrew Robinson is always good. The villains played by Sean Chapman and Claire Higgins give a shocking performance as the brother and wife of Robinson's charcter who had a tryst back in the day . But ther eal star of the film is Doug Bradley as Pinhead who used to haunt my dreams as a child and if I ever see the box I'll run.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I love horror, and finally saw Hellraiser last night. I had put it off for so many years because I thought it would be more sci-fi than horror, which I don't care for. After watching Bravo's scariest movie moments, I decided to take a chance and rent it. To my total surprise, I loved it! The story line was great, as was the acting, as were the scares. Shame on me for not seeing this years ago. I saw where so many future movies were influenced by this and was amazed. Someday, when someone puts out a list of things you must see to call yourself a fan of the horror genre, this had better on it. Not everyone will like it, but everyone should see it.</p></br></body></html>

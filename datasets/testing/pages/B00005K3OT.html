But at some point, its scrumptious heart melts its viewers into drooling weepers ready and hungry for its fairytale framework. And once that happens -- perhaps only minutes after the opening sequences, or maybe after its final ones -- it's more than difficult to shake its warmth. To call the movie inspiring may be too generous, but it more than deserves to be called uplifting. And it is.</p></br><a href="../users/AXSH6O4OP5L4M.html">AXSH6O4OP5L4M</a><br/><p>Lasse Hallstrom's film version of the Joanne Harris' novel Chocolat is as delightful a confection as were the heroines' chocolate creations themselves.  The plot is intricate and intriguing, carrying the viewer through the emotional transformations of each of the main characters.  In a sleepy medieval French town where life has assumed a repressive structure that has created an emotionally frozen and empty life for even the most highly placed members of its society, the heroine Vianne and her daughter arrive to set up a chocolate shop.  With her wonderfully concocted sweets she manages to liberate some of the denizens of the town, revealing their potential for greater happiness.  The story has a sense of myth, fantasy, and fairytale about it that leaves the viewer with a feeling of personal satisfaction.<br /><br />This is a film full of strong female performers.  Judi Dench is especially wonderful as a curmudgeonly elderly woman estranged from her daughter and forbidden to see her grandson.  Juliette Binoche does a fine job as the heroine.  She is as fragile and seductive as Monroe in some scenes and as forceful and independent as Bacall in others.  Lena Olin is wonderful as the abused wife who rises from the confusion and ashes of her own ruined personality like a phoenix under the influence of the heroine.  <p>This is one of the best movies I've seen in a ling while, and I expect to order and read the book upon which it was based--something I rarely do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>&quot;Chocolat&quot; tells a fable-like story of a young single mother (played by Juliette Binoche) who, with her young daughter, drifts into a small French village in the mid-20th century. She sets up a chocolate shop, but her efforts to bring some fun to the repressed villagers bring her into conflict with the town's tyrannical mayor (well played by Alfred Molina).<p>&quot;Chocolat&quot; is beautiful to see and hear. The fanciful sets and the playful score by Rachel Portman enhance the fairy tale atmosphere of the story. Although there are some unsatisfying loose threads in the script, the story as a whole is delightful. And while the film's message--about the importance of tolerance--may be a bit obvious, it's still worth thinking about.<p>Director Lasse Hallstrom showed his skill at handling a large ensemble cast in &quot;the Cider House Rules,&quot; and he does an equally satisfying job here. And what a cast! Juliette Binoche is excellent in the lead role; both elegant and earthy, she is an enthralling screen presence. The great Judi Dench sinks her teeth into a supporting role as a grouchy landlady who has a tender spot for her young grandson. Johnny Depp is charming as Binoche's love interest, and Hugh O'Conor is absolutely delightful as the baby-faced village priest who secretly loves the music of Elvis. <p>To sum up, &quot;Chocolat&quot; is an appealing comedy-drama with some real touches of magic.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>First big suprise with this film was that it was filmed in English language, not French, so there are no subtitles.  I've read that more and more movies are being shot in the English language simply because the potential box office profit is so much huger. Put simply, this is a delightful film which many critics are probably grading downwards because it is &quot;just&quot; a simple story that is simply (but beautifully) told.  I am hardly ready to number myself among them!  Lasse Hallestrom, who first distinguished himself with the marvelous &quot;My Life As A Dog,&quot; knows his way around a film script and with actors and it shows.  Playing much like a fable or fairy tale, Juliette Binoche is a woman, Vianne, who wanders from place to place with her daughter, Anouk, setting up shop as a chocolatier. This time she sets up shop in a peaceful French village in the winter of 1959. Delightful as the love story portion is with the river rat, Gypsy-like Johnny Depp, it is the hilarious war waged on Binoche by the town's mayor, played by Alfred Molina, who will reduce you to complete gut-busting laughter. His wife left him and his inability to deal with that fact fuels a lot of his animosity towards Vianne and the general air of sensual repression he wishes to foster in the village.  All of the villagers are delightful characters and Binoche is pulled into relationships with them.  If you need to brighten up your day, this is the movie to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>This adaptation of Joanne Harris's novel lacks the seductive charm and magic of the original, but it succeeds on its own as a quiet film about a French village rife with personal crises.  When the mysterious Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), dressed in red capes, arrive in town on a day the wind from the North gusts open the church doors, interrupting the sermon on the first day of Lent, something begins to stir.  The pious mayor (Alfred Molina) knows it better than anyone.  Vianne opens a chocolaterie, serving up exotic confections designed to bring out the best in people, and relationships in the grim town shift.  Vianne seems immune to her own magic - until a band of gypsies and their leader Roux (Johnny Depp) set up camp on the edge of town.<br /><br />Director Lasse Hallstrom excels in his evocation of a small French village in 1959 and the people inhabiting it.  Despite its Swedish director, British author, and international cast, this film feels authentically French.  Its rhythms are mostly gentle, and its focus is on character rather than an intricate plot.  Juliette Binoche turns in a fine performance, even though her smile at times seems too vapid and easy for such a complicated character.  Judi Dench makes a memorable appearance as Vianne's landlady, a crotchety but spirited old woman who is estranged from her uptight daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss) and her grandson.  John Wood and Lena Olin also turn in strong supporting roles.<br /><br />Art house film addicts will want to see this, but more mainstream viewers may be bored.  Recommended for viewers who enjoy the leisurely unfolding of a quiet drama.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This is an American movie directed by Swedish born director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules, 1999; Something to Talk About, 1995), set in France with a distinct French flavor.  The cast, headed by the very talented Juliette Binoche as Vianne Rocher, a wandering proprietress of chocolate, is highly accomplished and very much worth watching.  Judi Dench has a substantial role as the cranky Armande, and Johnny Depp makes a belated appearance as Binoche's love interest, Roux, the River Rat.  Alfred Molina plays the small town's semi-fascist Catholic mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud.  With his slicked-back, straight black hair and the precise black mustache and his imposing countenance, one is somehow reminded of Count Dracula.  Leslie Caron (An American in Paris, 1951; The L-Shaped Room, 1963), now in her seventies, has a small part as the widow Madame Audel.  Carrie Anne-Moss of Matrix fame (but I recall her most memorably in Memento, 2000) plays Armande's strait-laced and estranged daughter.  Noteworthy is the captivating Victoire Thivisol as Anouk Rocher, Vianne's nine-year-old daughter.  Thivisol won the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work as a four-year-old (!) in Ponette (1996).  She is surely the youngest actor ever to win such an award.<br /><br />Chocolat is also a kind of modern Dionysian morality tale in reverse with the Catholic church and small town narrow-mindedness as the bad guys.  It gets more than a bit sappy at times, and the unrelenting celebration of outsiders and non-conformists is wearisome and sorely tried my patience throughout.  However, just as is the case with chocolate with its uplifting qualities amidst the lure to overindulgence, the good surely outweighs the bad.  Hallstrom is an ambitious director who is comfortable playing to an adult feminist audience.  He attempts the complex and the unlikely.  Here, there is more than the usual Hollywood seduction of the intended audience.  There is underneath the surface a strong symbolic presence, giving the story a kind of resonating, fairy tale existence.<br /><br />Chocolate of course serves as the Dionysian wine, but it is also a semi-addictive substance from a tropical American plant, the cacao, rich in sumptuous oils and theobromine, a heart and general nervous system stimulant similar to caffeine.  Cocoa was the first stimulant drink to break the unrelenting hold of beer and wine on the European palate.  It was quickly followed by coffee and tea.  Prior to the rise of these cerebral drinks, it was commonplace for Europeans to drink beer for breakfast, and indeed to drink beer and wine throughout the day.  Many believe that caffeine was a handmaiden of the Renaissance, which of course led to the eventual weakening of the hold of the Roman Catholic church.  Vianne, who is the daughter of a central American mother and a European father, represents the shamanism of the New World, leading the populace away from the narrow confines of the medieval mentality with her irresistible confections made with the seed of Theoboma cacao.<br /><br />The problem with the movie, and the reason it did not achieve a more wide-spread acclaim, lay not only with its cloyingly unbalanced feminist viewpoint and its anti-Catholicism, but with the difficulty Binoche (and Hallstrom) had with her complex role.  Her character is a woman who wants desperately to find a place in society and to be accepted by the petite bourgeoisie while maintaining her personal sense of value (and her red shoes!).  She is, in a sense, a gypsy fortune teller (recall the spinning plates) who longs to be a pillar of the community.  She is worldly wise, kind and forgiving, but partly a shopkeeper with a shopkeeper's need to set down roots.  She is also a Mayan princess born to wander with the sly wind that ushers her about.  So, underneath all else, this is a story about finding a home.  Because Vianne is frequently attacked for her lifestyle while being the sort of person who does not return insult with insult, Binoche is reduced in many scenes to a kind of tolerant, slightly superior, patient smile that becomes wearying.  It is only when Johnny Depp appears that we see the real Juliette Binoche and a true indication of her ability.  Incidentally Depp is excellent as a gypsy musician who understands himself and his place as a counter balance to a conservative society.  He is an inspiration to Vianne because he alone is not transparent to her; she only discovers his "favorite" chocolate by happenstance after two wrong guesses.  Depp also serves to save this film from the near monotony of inadequate males and dissatisfied females.  When he appears I can almost hear the audience sigh.<br /><br />Incidentally, you might want to compare this to Babette's Feast (1987) in which the narrow-minded and in need of liberation are northern Protestants, while the woman with the tempting goodies is an exiled Catholic chef from France.  If Hallstrom had taken a clue from Gabriel Axel, who directed Babette's Feast, and followed a more objective and balanced treatment, Chocolat might have been a great movie.  As it is, it is a very interesting one, and one you're not likely to forget or to feel neutral about.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8.html">A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8</a><br/><p>Chocolat is set in a small town in Framce, where Juliette Binoche plays Vianne and her little girl, Anouk transforms the convention upon opening their confectionary shop that threatens the local mayor (played by Alfred Molina) and his rigid hold on propriety. The movie, directed by Lasse Hallstrom falls no short of magical charm - and plays it well sublimely with a great supporting ensemble like Judi Dench, Carrie Anne Moss and Johnny depp as Roux, her love interest to branch the subplots that made the movie a tantalizing delight.<p>It is the acting that shines, Binoche plays Vianne with a subtle charm and resilience that illuminates alongside with Lena Olin as a battered wife. Judi Dench spices the screem with wit and hard emotions and Alfred Molina is aptly casted as the mayor with the prim and proper decorum. Chocolat is simple as a story that dissects the quandry between temptations and morality, and a lighthearted note on human emotions. Forgivance is seen in the mother and daughter feud, hope when Vianne sees Josephine (Lena Olin) as a friend. It is all heartwarming and yet the correct amount of saccharine to make this movie a delight. Not forgetting the passionate Johnny Depp as her love interest, yes  predictible though it may be, Chocolat is indubitably spellbinding with charms.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>&quot;Chocolat&quot;, chocolate in french, is one of the few quality fables filmed in history.  Its sweet tooth theme is perfect with the characters' emotions.  The old town french town was wonderfully crafted.  The fashion designers crafted the costumes perfectly to look 1959.  Lasse Hallstrom directed this movie brilliantly.  The writers give the movie the extra unique touches that most other today's movies need.  They make all the events fit together as one. <p>Juliette Dimoche was the perfect actress to play Vianne, a chocolate cook whom most of the town calls her &quot;Satan&quot; for no reason.  Judi Dench wonderfully portrays a cranky old woman whose fate becomes unexpected.  Both deserved their Oscar nominations.  Johnny Depp proves that he's improved greatly in the past few years in his role as a river drifter who falls in love with Vianne.  Lena Olin plays a battered wife emotionally.<br /><br />***Important word of caution: One will become very hungry while watching this movie.  A small bowl of chocolate will cure the craving and will give the experience an extra touch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) comes with her daughter to a quiet little village in France where people value Tranquilit&eacute; - Tranquility. Just before Lent she opens a chocolatier that will turn the town upside down.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Vianne Rocher: And these are for your husband. Unrefined cacao nips from Guatemala, to awaken the passions.<br />Yvette Marceau: Psshh. You've obviously never met my husband.<br />Vianne Rocher: Well, you've obviously never tried these.<br />===============================<br /><br />Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) sees her as a threat to the morals and tranquility the people of Flavigny-sur-Ozerain treasure. He starts a crusade against her, and against a group of vagabonds headed by Roux (Johnny Depp) who arrive by boat. When Vianne Rocher befriends them, a line is drawn in the sand:<br /><br />-----------------<br />Comte de Reynaud: Let me try to put this into perspective for you. The first Comte de Reynaud expelled all the radical Huguenots in this village. You and your truffles present a far lesser challenge.<br />=============================<br /><br />But to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, "I can resist everything, except chocolat."<br /><br />I like everything about this film, and everyone in it is chock full o' talent. Somehow, though, the whole was equal to less than the sum of its parts. And less was not more, less was less. Was it too many cooks spoil la mousse au chocolat? This was an attempt to create a fable, and that is a very delicate thing. Like a chocolat souffl&eacute;, someone slams a door and the whole thing collapses. Maybe it was just me. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Speaking of fables, Edward Scissorhands, for me, now, there was a fable. Johnny Depp was fabulous in it. Sometimes you can't create a fable, you just have to use your divining rod and find one. Sometimes the magic just doesn't work, especially when you set out to create a fable. Chocolat is magic, but too much chocolat is just an overdose.<br /><br />Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m made this after The Cider House Rules, and as they were filming, they learned that they had 7 Oscar nominations, and would win for Michael Caine, best supporting actor, and the script by John Irving. Chocolat would also garner five nominations, but no wins. Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m is married to Lena Olin, who plays Josephine in Chocolat.<br /><br />I don't fault him for that, or think it adversely affected the film, I just mention it because you can tell that everyone is having a great time making the film, Chocolat. They are literally making chocolat, and eating chocolat, too. It is a family affair, with old friends reuniting, and new friendships being forged.<br /><br />Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin both appeared together in The Unbearable Lightness of Being, where they were two corners of a love triangle with Daniel Day-Lewis. Olin played Sabina, the one who wore her grandfather's derby while making love.<br /><br />Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m had worked with Johnny Depp before, when he directed him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? In Chocolat, Johnny finally gets to play guitar, and we hear him do some blues and Django Reinhardt's Minor Swing. It is a real treat to hear Depp play Le Jazz Hot, and he is not half bad. He has some great vintage guitars and a Dobro.<br /><br />Peter Stormare is great as Josephine's husband, a wife beater. He is not quite a scary as he was in Fargo, but he is scary enough, and also a little sad. Alfred Molina is kind of an uptight wet blanket, but you can see that he is just an insufferable self righteous buzz kill because he is sad. Nothing that a little, or a lot, of chocolat won't cure.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Vianne Rocher: [to the Comte de Reynaud] Ah, good morning. Can I interest you in some nipples of Venus?<br />==============================================<br /><br />Judi Dench is fabulous, as usual, and so is Leslie Caron, though her part is so small I didn't even notice her.

But, what a fine role it is. Alright, so he doesn't necessarily make the movie, Juliette Binoche is fantastic too, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. They all do a great job of portraying what life was probably like in a small French village, in that time period. It seems like every character is hiding some little secret. Its a great mix of mystery and romance and even a little bit of fantasy. This refreshing movie should be seen by all chocolate lovers, and even non-lovers!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>If ever there was a movie that was a delicious as its subject then `Chocolat' is that movie.  Making a movie about chocolate, the one guilty pleasure that transcends age, gender and race, is an idea in itself, but making that film creamy, sweet and pure is something all its own.  `Chocolat' tastes so incredibly sweet on the viewers palate, a film that coats our eyes with its rich goodness and makes us crave even more of what this beautiful film has to offer.<br /><br />Okay, enough with the obvious chocolate innuendoes.<br /><br />All kidding aside, `Chocolat' is a wonderful film, one that I never expected to like as much as I did.  My wife had seen the first part of this film some time ago and reported that it was horrible and thus she turned it off.  I must admit that the advertisements and posters for the film failed to draw me in (although after seeing the film and casting glance at the poster I can't see how Binoche's smile didn't draw me in at first glance) and so I accepted her complaint and tossed aside all aspirations of seeing the film even though my wife has significantly lower taste in film than I do and I generally reject any and all of her opinions on movies.  Now the other night, late at night I must add, this little film came on the food channel and I decided to watch it.  I only caught the first half hour before sleep overcame me but that first half hour was, in a word, spellbinding.  I insisted that my wife give it another try and so we rented to film the following day, and while she is not as intoxicated with this film as I am she readily admits that her initial response to this movie was wrong.<br /><br />The film centers around Vianne Rocher, a mysterious woman who moves to a reserved and very religious French town with her young daughter Anouk.  The town, about to observe Lent, immediately turn their backs to Vianne as she opens her chocolatier and tempts the townsfolk with all that they have vowed to abstain from.  No one opposes her more than the uptight mayor Comte Paul de Reynaud who comes to despise Vianne and everything she stands for.  He watches his power over the town slip from his grasp as they all begin consulting Vianne and falling prey so-to-speak to her chocolaty deliciousness.  Yes, Vianne is just as delectable as the chocolates she makes.  Her smile alone is intoxicating.<br /><br />The film is lovely to look for the cinematography is marvelous.  The acting is brilliant as well, from Binoche's devilishly sweet performance to Judi Dench's crotchety Armande Voizin to Alfred Molina's malicious Comte and Lena Olin's mysteriously beautiful Josephine.  Everyone involved here delves into their characters and delivers beautifully.  Johnny Depp has a very small role although it may seem from advertisements that his role would be larger.  He's effective but no where near as memorable as the remaining cast.  Carrie-Anne Moss delivers a nice little performance here as Armande's cold hearted daughter and young Victoire Thivisol manages to make Anouk a real girl, immature and foolish yet with a sense of maturity that would accompany her situation.<br /><br />I don't know if this would be constituted a spoiler, but I wanted to talk a bit about Pantoufle since I feel he is really the moral center of the film.  When the film opens we are introduced to Pantoufle, Anouk's imaginary friend kangaroo.  He is wounded and cannot leave her side.  At the end of the film Pantoufle is healed and bounces away from the town, and Anouk is happy for this.  Throughout the film mention is made of the fact Vianne moves around a lot and she even mentions herself that while she tells herself it's good for Anouk she knows in her heart that Anouk hates it.  To me Pantoufle was a metaphor for this very fact.  Anouk longed to stay put, thus the fact that Pantoufle could not leave her side.  He was wounded and thus could not travel.  She wished that she too could not travel but could experience some stability.  When she finally receives that stability at the films end she has no use for Pantoufle anymore for she has what she wants and so her subconscious sets him free.<br /><br />So, in the end I must say that I LOVED this movie, truly adored it.  It made me smile and rarely do films do that.  Maybe that's because I often seek out the film that depresses and saddens me because I enjoy the emotional connection to cinema, but it's nice to watch something that brings a smile and sense of joy to the soul, and `Chocolat' does just that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) glows as Vianne Rocher, a free-spirited young woman that the wind blows into a small, morally obsessed and oppressed French town one day. Using an ancient Mayan recipe discovered by her father, she and her daughter have come there to open a chocolaterie. Her confections are out of this world, and she uses them to try to help mend the various broken people and relationships in the town. But the mayor (Alfred Molina - Spiderman 2), whose family has dominated the town for centuries and who fears she will lead the townspeople away from their traditional faith and mores, declares war on Mademoiselle Rocher and tries to turn the townspeople against her.<br /><br />One by one she gains allies, first in the form of her landlady, Armande Voizin (Judi Dench - Shakespeare In Love, Pride And Prejudice) and her grandson Luc Clairmont (Aurelien Parent Koenig - debut), which infuriates Luc's mother, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss - The Matrix), who has forbidden him from seeing his grandmother. Then she gains a battered woman (Josephine Muscat - The Ninth Gate), whose husband (Peter Stormare - Fargo) the mayor tries to reform in order to prove that his way of changing people is better. It doesn't work. Johnny Depp doesn't appear until the second act to reinforce Vianne in her cause and to offer romantic interest. He and his river gypsy friends are also considered undesirables by the town.<br /><br />What's interesting about this film is that the Christian townspeople are being held hostage by the self-righteous, morally oppressive mayor, and consequently Vianne acts more like a Christian than any of they, even though she is not a believer. She takes a genuine interest in people and tries to help them with her friendship and chocolates. The mood of the film is magical, though magic has nothing to do with it - it's really about love. The question is, will love win out before Vianne gives up and decides her cause is hopeless?<br /><br />This film is rated PG-13, which is a shame because, if several scenes that are not critical to the story had been toned down or left out, it would have made a wonderful family film. It has a story-book setting and feel that would appeal to any age. Unfortunately, several scenes push it into the category of adult romance. Nevertheless, it is a wonderful story about love in the face of prejudice that all of us need to hear, as well as enough chocolate shown onscreen to satisfy any chocolate lover's craving.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>I watched this again recently after purchasing it and was reacquainted with this lovely film. It is a sweet fable about personal freedom and the simple enjoyment of life. The acting is superb all the way around from the always great Judi Densch and Alfred Molina to the small but vital work of Johnny Depp (nice guitar work on the Robert Johnson and Django medley!)and culminates in the excellence of Juliette Binoche. It is a  shame that her subtle and understated elegance lost out to the over-the-top performance by Julia Roberts for the Academy Award.<br />The pacing, the tender storyline, the acting, the gorgeous scenery, and the precise musical scoring allow for a total abandonment of the self so that one can revel in the deliciousness of this film.

But she brings the town together after the Christians had split them apart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a pleasant, though obvious, adult fable, broadly hinting at the often sensual, restorative, and mystical properties of chocolate. A beautiful and mysterious woman, Vianne, delightfully played by the winsome Juliette Binoche, along with her daughter, Anouk, arrive in a remote and very provincial French town, where she rents a patisserie from an elderly, crotchety woman, magnificently played by Judi Dench, and turns it into a chocolatier. From here, she concocts visually dazzling, mouthwatering amounts of chocolates, along with copious cups of hot cocoa made from a very special recipe, that are always sold or given by Vianne with a Julia Roberts style, mega watt smile. Vianne is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. She is, therefore, a person to be feared by those who lack those traits.

While it is a handsomely filmed and charming movie, only the manipulations of Miramax honchos forced its way into the Oscar elite.  Lasse Hallstrom infuses the film with luscious cinematography and a strong sense of romantic fantasy.  He also elicits some marvelous performances from his talented cast:  Juliette Binoche as the mysterious chocolatier; Alfred Molina as the self righteous and lonely mayor; Carrie Anne Moss as a charming widow who carries a torch for Molina and a heavy hand in relations with her son and mother (Judi Dench in a cranky but touching performance); Hugh O'Conor as a young impressionable cleric; Lena Olin as the abused wife of cafe owner Peter Stormare.  Johnny Depp has a smaller role as the romantic interest for Binoche, but one figures any actor could have played the role and Depp's rich talents are underused.  The still lovely Leslie Caron brings a touch of class in a small role as a grieving war widow.  Rachel Portman's score is lush and evocative, and while CHOCOLAT is lightweight fare, it's still a testament to Hallstrom and crew for their tight professionalism.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>CHOCOLAT is a movie that warms the heart. It has a mystical feeling about it that is generated by the incredible performance of Juliette Binoche (Wuthering Heights, Blue) and the fictional village where her character creates a chocolate shop of magic in a small European town.<p>It has warmth about the relationship of a strained mother and daughter who spend their time moving from town to town trying to set up shop. A Chocolate shop it was directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Shipping News, The Cider House Rules) who masterfully makes you, the audience, a part of this film. From the evil towns would be "Mayor" to the towns very own "Mistress" - it has something for everyone to talk about.<p>This film is soft to the touch and has an incredible amount of humor in it. Including the concept that chocolate is an aphrodisiac. They play that to the hilt. Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hallow) plays the love interest who is the stranger from out of town who is also the bad boy. There is a woman in the story cleverly played by Judy Dench (Shakespeare In Love, Elizabeth, the 4 James Bond movies) who is old and doing everything she isn't supposed and teaches the lessons of life, love and enjoying yourself. It comes at a high price for her in the end.<p>The story is fun energetic and it is photographed extremely well. It was a charm about it that makes you want chocolate but more, importantly, want to enjoy it to its fullest. The DVD extras include a really good commentary and real detailed documentary on making this fictional town seem very real. This is a good film for the whole family. It has a good simple story and a lot of passion. Just a good feeling type of film...</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>This is a unique movie with features and messages portrayed in "Babette's Feast (1988)" and "Like Water for Chocolate (1993)".<br /><br />The story has been told many ways. Yet this movie is still unique in its presentation. We get to visit with our favorite actors and they do such a good job that they do not overwhelm the characters. I especially liked Alfred Molina who played a similar role in "Enchanted April (1992)" as someone that really was not a bad person; he was just misunderstood or has a misunderstanding and comes around later to be really a good guy.<br /><br />Like "Babette's Feast", everyone is supposed to shun Vianne Rocher who goes out of her way to help people. And like "Like Water for Chocolate" the movie has a mystical feel.<br /><br />Basic story is a town where everyone knows their place and duty is visited by a north wind caring a mysterious woman and her daughter. Their present's wakes up the people from their organized existence.<br /><br />The DVD has all the DVD goodies that you are looking for, such as voice over, deleted scenes etc. And they do not force the coming attractions on you.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053VBK">Babette's Feast</a></p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2000 fill is what is called a "feel good" movie.  It appeals to all ages, includes comedy, drama and romance and leaves you smiling when it's over. Not only that - it has a good story too.<br /><br />Set in a village in France, it's the story of a woman and her daughter who set up a chocolate shop.  The leading citizens of the town are horrified because not only does this woman not go to church, she also opens her shop right in the middle of Lent. The leading citizen of the town tries to show how immoral she is.  But, little by little, the woman worms her way into the hearts of the townspeople and not only wins them all over, she finds romance as well.<br /><br />Nominated for several academy awards, there are only good things to say about this film.  Jullette Binoche is cast as the chocolate shop woman and I adored her immediately.  Judi Dench is cast as her landlady who goes to the shop for comfort because her own daughter has turned against her.  Alfred Molina is the town leader and he sure is comical.  Johnny Depp is the romantic interest, a "river rat" who comes to the town to play music.  And in the end, everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br />Even I, who usually prefer films on the dark side, was enchanted.<br /><br />Don't miss this film.  You'll love it.

I recommend experiencing both.<p>This movie is visually stunning with alot of work having been done to perfect the scenery so that the viewer is transported into a quaint little French Town. The musical score is upbeat and passionate which adds a special dimension to the film. <p>Johnny Depp does an excellent job as the gypsy drifter that is greeted with reserve and prejudice by the uptight townspeople. Juliette Binoche plays the single woman with child who blows into town with a wind and leaves it in stiches. She opens a chocolate shop and falls prey to the overly religious mayor of the town because she entices others to sin during lent. I have to say that my favorite character is played by Dame Judy Dench, she is the free spirit of the town refusing in all of her years to be programmed by the rest of the world. She indulges in the delicious chocolate despite being diabetic and scolded by doctors and her own daughter. The chocolate becomes its own character managing to magically cure all of the towns ills if they allow it to work its sweet way into their deepest desires. <p>A sweetly sinful indulgence indeed!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Movies like these are usually drugged on their own sweetness and are thus painfully predictable. But I guess I was rather pleased with Chocolat, the execution is fine. <p>Juliette Binoche sparkles as usual. Johnny Depp's Irish accent is passably credible. Their chemistry is good, specially in a scene where Juliette swims to protect her daughter. Problem is that once Depp has introduced a parallel to the notion of a stranger upsetting the conservative patterns of a village (which btw is merely to provide a romantic backdrop for Juliette), everything not only becomes preachy but also quite predictable.<p>A wide array of chocolate in all shapes and contours comes to the rescue though, adding a splendid flavor to the screen. But don't bother to ask how such a reclusive, middle-of-nowhere village gets all that cocoa. <p>The subdued religious angle is a bit moronic, it makes organized religion look like a kindergarten tiff. Just because Binoche's character is &quot;different&quot; no one takes easily to her and every kid in town feels comfortable taunting her child at school. What precise religion was this?<p>The final scene with a whole village prancing about at Easter together with vagabonds and gypsies is banal to the hilt. So is the priest's message of tolerance, however praiseworthy it may have been in itself. Come to think, we could probably have done without the gypsy stuff altogether. <p>Anyway, the film is woth seeing if you know what you're getting into and are expecting pseudo-charming fluff. In the same league perhaps as Notting Hill, French Kiss or Sleepless in Seattle.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>Expecting greatness about a film based upon sweet confection?  You won't be disappointed!  This is a wonderfully entertaining film, beautifully photographed and acted, which features strong female lead characters.  Refreshing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Chocolat is a wonderful little film that has much to say people, as individuals and as groups. With its exotic yet familiar feel, beguiling music, and focus on truly human characters, the movie stands as an oasis in the middle of the desert we call life. Don't get the idea that this film is boring just because it doesn't feature a lot of "action," as there is a great deal going on in the lives of these characters. They are all at a collective crossroads, only it's not really a crossroads because the only real options are to go forward or backward.<br /><br />The setting is a quaint French village which stands starkly on tradition; new people with new ideas just aren't welcome there at all. The best way that I can think to describe the social setting is to say that these are French people being French. There's one self-righteous, powerful know-it-all at the top who tells everyone what to do and how to do it, and all of the villagers are too cowardly to rock the boat or think for themselves. Living in the past is a miserable way to live. You've got an elderly woman still mourning her husband's death 42 years after the fact, a younger widow who won't let her son doing anything because she's afraid something will happen to him, a wife who won't leave her abusive husband, etc. Everyone is so worried about what others might think of them that they don't really live. The mayor is so puritanically dominant that he even writes the sermons for the young village priest.<br /><br />Things start to change when a stranger and her daughter show up (wearing red cloaks, no less) and open a chocolate shop. There's a bewitching quality to Vianne (Juliette Binoche), as she seems to know the right kind of chocolate for each person who enters her shop, and there really is some kind of unquantifiable power in her delicious concoctions. With it, she melts the hardened heart of a grumbling old woman (played magnificently by Judi Dench), puts the romance back into a passionless marriage, and even helps give an abused wife the strength to leave her worthless husband. The mayor and most of the townspeople are not at all happy - and then things get even worse, as a band of "river rats" settles on the local riverbanks. The whole town just says no to "immorality" and refuses to serve or have anything to do with the "dangerous" riff-raff - but Vianne does. She hits it off particularly well with a guitar-playing nomad named Roux (Johnny Depp).<br /><br />Naturally, all of this internal conflict going on inside everyone eventually comes to a climax - and it is here, in particular, that we see both the good and bad side of humanity. There are some really poignant moments as the film draws near to a conclusion, and in the end you're left with something tangible, a renewed spirit. Maybe it's just for a few moments, but you stop and think about the truly important things in life. That's what makes this beguiling little film so special.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>Whether as an afternoon teatime snack, quick pick-me-up at work, or Halloween treat, chocolate has become a staple in America.  This movie is about chocolate, but about its use as a healer and its power to "unlock hidden yearnings and to shape destiny." Figures, since depression can be alleviated by chocolate.  And the creator of this confection in this extremely palatable movie is a healer herself.<p>Chocolat tells the story of two people who descend upon a provincial French village in the wake of a sly and strong north wind.  Those two people are Vianne and her young daughter Anouk.  Oh, perhaps I should say two people and an animal.  Anouk has an imaginary friend, Pontouf, who is a kangaroo.  She sets up shop, a potisserie, and opens it during Lent, not exactly perfect timing in a God-fearing village whose inhabitants believe in calm, tranquilitee, to use French.  Basically, knowing one's place, being obedient to authority, and going to church on Sunday are the pillars of this French village.<p>The idealist and romantic Vianne comes against the extremely conservative mayor, the Comte de Reynaud, as well as most of the people here.  She doesn't wear black, doesn't go to church on Sundays, and (gasp!) is an unwed mother.  She is also the only one who accepts Roux, the handsome leader of raft-bound river rats the town shuns as being immoral.  As a wanderer herself, Vianne naturally finds affinity with the riverfolk.<p>Before long, things start happening in the village.  People who buy her wares become more loosened in attitude, more courageous, and in the case of one married couple, saves their marriage with a rebirth in their sex life.  She also helps her landlady establish ties with her grandson, who has an affinity for drawing morbid pictures.  Basically, her altruistic spirit helps spread friendliness and helps certain townfolk relax from their hidebound ways.  Vianne gains the enmity of the mayor who sees her as an enemy, and seeks to drive her away by having sermons against temptation and of the powers of Satan concealing first a veiled, later an open attack against her wares.<p>This will be the ultimate Juliette Binoche film for me, and my favourite movie of 2000.  (OK, I know it came out in '99 but it came to my local theatre that year.)  I must admit I was torn between her and Julia Roberts as my Best Actress choice for 2000.  I've seen Alfred Molina play a large variety of roles, be it as Kenneth Halliwell (Prick Up Your Ears), Satipo (Raiders Of The Lost Ark), and most recently, as Diego Rivera in Frida.  His portrayal shows he can act as a diametric opposite of Rivera, an uptight, stuffed shirt traditionalist.  Lena Olin gets kudos as Josephine, a misunderstood kleptomaniac in a trapped marriage who follows her own drum.  Naturally, she is one of the first to befriend Vianne.  Judi Dench as Armand the landlady, and Peter Stormare as Josephine's odious and abusive husband also shine out here.<p>Chocolat also shows two things:  One, we need more people like Vianne to heal us.  Two, we need something to heal us, and no, I don't mean with standards such as religion or money, but something else that fills us within.  This movie's a nice confection that isn't sickly sweet or mere coloured sugar, but something with a rich flavour that will leave one's stomach glowing inside.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Definitely a wonderful movie, Chocolat, brings to the screen the story of a wandering mother and daughter as they settle in a small rural post-war French village, open up a chocolaterie and begin affecting the small community/society in a most profound way.<br /><br />As the movie implies there is chocolate and lots of it...<br /><br />The setting is 1959 France, and it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about how trust, love, and inner strength, can lead out of situations, which might seem bleak or desperate at first glance.<br /><br />On the negative side, the only setback is the clich&eacute; clash between "conservatism" and "progressivism" and how Vianne falls for the wandering gypsy.<br /><br />Needless to say, Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, especially Alfred Molina's character who as the town's mayor, steals the show!</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>A film to awaken the senses and stimulate the sweet tooth, "Chocolat," directed by Lasse Hallstrom and starring Juliette Binoche. is both a sensuous and sensational delight.  In the mid `50s, as if borne on the winds of fate, a somewhat mysterious woman arrives in a small town in France, with a young daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) in tow and a special talent that soon has the townsfolk in quite a stir.  Binoche is Vianne Rocher, a woman who uses her exotic recipe for chocolate to unlock the repressed sensibilities of the predominately Catholic citizenry, heretofore kept under the rigid and righteous thumb of the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), with no respite or help, even from the town's young and inexperienced priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor).  And because Vianne has the audacity to open her chocolate shop during Lent, when of course her sumptuous treats are forbidden, she quickly runs afoul of the Mayor and a battle of wills between the two ensues.  Her chocolates are irresistible, but the Mayor has tradition and religion on his side, and it puts the free-spirited Vianne-- who has something of the gypsy in her-- to the test.  As a director, Hallstrom has just the right touch that brings out the best this story has to offer, which is to say, quite a bit.  It's an affecting and funny movie that will touch you emotionally as it involves you with the characters; Hallstrom knows what buttons to push and when, and it works splendidly.  There's a touch of mystery surrounding Vianne that underscores the sensitivity of the story, and Hallstrom never allows it to become maudlin, which successfully maintains the integrity of the drama.  And there are moments throughout the film that evoke an almost dream-like sense of pacification that draw you in as you indulge in the mouth watering visual pleasures of the chocolate.  Be forewarned, though, it's a tough one for diabetics to watch.  What Hallstrom also has going for him in this one is an absolutely exquisite cast, many of whom give Oscar worthy, memorable performances, beginning with the superb Juliette Binoche.  There's an earthy, enigmatic and classic sense of beauty about her that make her presence on screen captivating; she's simply a joy to behold.  Judi Dench (Amande), meanwhile, does a terrific character turn as a mother whose daughter, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), deems her an embarrassment and a bad influence on her son, Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koening), and Lena Olin (Josephine) is outstanding as well, as an unhappy woman who finds hope in Vianne's undaunted spirit.  Three extraordinary performances from gifted actresses that should be recognized with Oscar nominations.  And Molina, too, as the narrow minded Comte, gives possibly the best performance of his career, while Johnny Depp (Roux) lends some charm as the leader of a roving community of river people.  Rounding out the supporting cast are John Wood (Guillaume), Peter Stormare (Serge) and Leslie Caron (Madame Audel).  Possibly the "sweetest" film of the year, as well as one of the best, "Chocolat" is a visual and emotional triumph that will warm your heart and make your taste buds salivate, with a story and characters as rich and satisfying as the candy they embrace.  It's a film with a human touch whose images and sensitivity will remain with you long after the screen has gone dark; an uplifting, entertaining movie that proves that the answers to the mysteries of life just may be found in that box of chocolates, after all.</p></br><a href="../users/AWEOR1WZSMBEZ.html">AWEOR1WZSMBEZ</a><br/><p>Even back in the 1950's, in this quaint old-fashioned French town, they considered chocolate as an 'indulgence'. No, they were not concerned with the possible weight gain or health problems brought about by eating excessive amounts of chocolate.  They deemed this treat as a temptation, &amp; since it brings too much pleasure to the eater, they (particularly the town's mayor) considered it grave &amp; sinful.  <p>As a viewer, I would deem the 'chocolat' as something intoxicating &amp; liberating.  It represents anything that would bring pleasure to the human senses.  True, it unleashed passion &amp; sensuality among couples.  But it also signified something deeper than skin-deep gratification.  It also represented anything that would liberate the town folks from their fears, insecurities, loneliness &amp; prejudices --- whether it be directly or indirectly.<p>Like chocolate, culture &amp; religion come in different forms...some are common &amp; widely accepted while others are a bit different &amp; stand out like a sore thumb.  But, also like chocolate, uniqueness adds to its beauty.  <p>So the next time you find yourself staring at a box of chocolate, do not judge its beauty simply by its shape or packaging.  Why don't you cut out on your prejudices, broaden your horizons, widen your options &amp; enjoy the experience of a mouth-watering treat.  <p>How about one of those melt-in-you-mouth-not-in-your-hand chocs?</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>A memorable tale about the human spirit and believing in and living in truth--and what it costs to do so.<p>Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>A perfect international cast comes together for this wonderful fable that will keep you enrapt for 2 hours.

A beautiful and mysterious woman, Vianne, delightfully played by the winsome Juliette Binoche, along with her daughter, Anouk, arrive in a remote and very provincial French town, where she rents a patisserie from an elderly, crotchety woman, magnificently played by Judi Dench, and turns it into a chocolatier. From here, she concocts visually dazzling, mouthwatering amounts of chocolates, along with copious cups of hot cocoa made from a very special recipe, that are always sold or given by Vianne with a Julia Roberts style, mega watt smile. Vianne is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. She is, therefore, a person to be feared by those who lack those traits. That is why she is greeted with bare civility by the town's mayor, wonderfully played by the always underrated, very talented Alfred Molina. He is a sanctimonious, intolerant, unhappy, religious prig, who insists on writing the sermons for the town's young, beleagured priest.

She gains the confidence of those willing to become friendly with her through the mystical properties of her chocolates and hot cocoa, changing their lives forever. Though the mayor has vowed to drive Vianne's business into the ground and run her out of town, Vianne hangs on, determined to stay until the North winds blow her and her daughter to yet another unhappy town. What happens in this town, however, ultimately changes the lives of its mayor, the villagers, and even Vianne, forever. <p>This is a lovely, well acted, and moderately entertaining film, that thematically deals with the mystical, sensual, and palliative properties of chocolate. It is a frothy, pleasant confection. If you want a film, dealing with a similar theme, that will fully satisfy an appetite, however, one need look no further than the superb film, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>Why is CHOCOLAT a favorite film? Please don't ask me why. I was really enamored by Johnny Depp, was studying French art and had a trip to France planned with my school at the time of this film's release. Juliette Binoche is really fantastic in this film. The film itself is so viewable and continues to be so on repeated viewings. I think the lure is how Juliette Binoche's character has such an effect of the townspeople bring out all their repressions. However, Binoche being just as human as the rest is affected by Depp's arrival. Without being deep, I just think this film tells us something about who we are and helps us explore our own ambitions and frailties. I really like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Juliette Binoche does not do much with which I can find fault. She is beautiful, talented, unconventional and luminous in this role of a wandering woman and her daughter who open a chocolate shop in a small, conservative French town just as Lent begins. Binoche slowly wins over the townspeople with her delicious concoctions, but the mayor (Alfred Molina) is unmoved, as is a severe women who works with him (Carrie Anne Moss, virtually unrecognisable from her role as Trinity in The Matrix). Binoche's daughter is charmingly portrayed by young actress Victoire Thivisol, who was first seen as a tiny child in the engaging and sad French film Ponette. Binoche's love interest is played by Johnny Depp, who is summarily shunned by the town. Other fascinating roles, the always superb Judi Dench as the woman who rents the shop to Binoche (and as Moss's estranged mother. Moss will not allow Dench to see her grandson, but Binoche conspires to allow grandmother and grandson to see one another secretly at her shop). Also important here are the roles of the abused wife, Lena Olin (real-life wife of director Lasse Hallstrom) and her husband, played well by Peter Stormare (whom you may remember best as the accomplice to the crime in Fargo. He was the blond one who stuffs Steve Buscemi's body into the wood chipper). Overall this is a beautiful film, and while it basically has a happy ending, it is still worthwhile and wonderful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>This movie follows an increasingly common theme.  Men are pretty much all pigs.  The only meaningful intimacies are between women.  The Johnny Depp character is very shallow and superfluous and provides only an unconvincing heterosexual love interest for Juliete Binoche.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it's an engaging film and worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>I have read through a fair number of reviews, and I see that many people have taken exception to this film's anti-Catholic attitudes and pervasive Liberalism.  Well, nobody will ever accuse me a being a great friend of Roman Catholicism or of being a staunch conservative, but I too found this film to be pretty hard to stomach at times.<p>What was most annoying for me was how black and white everything was in this film.  The liberated chocolatier versus the stuffed shirt mayor.  Worldly cosmopolitanism versus small-town provincialism.  I expect more from Lasse Hallstrom than a bunch of straw men waiting to be knocked down.<p>I found the chocolatier to be unbearably smug, as she deftly solves, one after another, the various problems afflicting the townspeople.  You would think that these folks must be dumb as posts, because they seem incapable of solving their own predicaments.  Perhaps it is in fact because these types of problems are so rarely solved with a few simple words and some chocolate goodies.<p>The treatment of the mayor was particularly hard to take.  Here was a man of obviously deep convictions who took his duties to his town quite seriously, yet he is an object of ridicule throughout the film.  His chocolate-induced collapse at the end of the movie struck me as a false note that could not be possibly be reconciled to the personality we had seen on the screen for the previous two hours.  It seem extremely contrived?  Is it possible that the filmmakers could not successfully resolve this storyline about the conflict between the two main characters?  Left with no resolution to the move, were they forced to cobble together this ridiculous conclusion?  It just seemed too forced and unbelievable.<p>I don't like movies that pretend to have all of the answers.  However, the cinematography and music was very nice; for that, I give it 2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JJOV69MAU2J2.html">A1JJOV69MAU2J2</a><br/><p>First off, Chocolat is a metaphor -- a metaphor for thinking in new ways, trying new things, renewing the human spirit, enjoying life and salving deep emotional wounds. On that level the movie works wonderfully well, with Juliet Binoche giving a marvelously subtle performance that balances her character on the edge of vulnerability while exuding confidence.<p>Some windy sourpusses reviewing this simple, wonderful and heartwarming tale (How many of those does Hollywood put out a year? Two, three?) seem to focus on The Horror that the main character tempts townspeople with chocolate during Lent, and therefore it is anti-Catholic. Those arguments are simply silly dreck. It's not anti-Catholic, it's anti-dogma and pro-tolerance and pro-living. I suppose those reviewers would be happy if the townsfolk had burned the woman at the stake for being different and a veritable magician!<p>Unless you will be offended by temptation (in which case you shouldn't see ANY movie), you will find Chocolat a delicious treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>I would go as far as to call this a modern era classic film!<br />This story is an excellent one which Juliette Binoche carries off well...<br />a mysterious woman and her daughter wander the european countryside<br />and come upon a quaint little village.

I don't have much use for chocolate, really, except for sippin' the occasional hot cuppa, and the cynical curmudgeon in me grumbles at the tradition of purchasing chocolate for your sweetheart (and don't even get the curmudgeon started on flowers). So I don't know that I buy into chocolate as a sort of universal panacea. But I did like CHOCOLAT, a film about sensuous magical realism and a shifting of status quo and the acceptance of things strange and new, and it's about romance and, of course, chocolat. The cynical curmudgeon in me just passed out.<br /><br />Journey back to 1959 and eyeball that tiny, quaint French village down there. Observe the air of "tranquilit&eacute;," which for the purposes of this film is defined as staidness and, perhaps - no, definitely - repression. And also note the residents attending church, and that tamped down sense of vague discontent even as they worship. Then a heavy gust blows, and blows open the church door and also blows into town two red-cloaked figures which will change various lives before it's all over. I quote: "A sly wind blew in from the North."<br /><br />The newcomers are Vianne Rocher and her daughter Anouk, and the tiny village is soon richer by the count of one humble chocolaterie, or a chocolate shop. As the movie audience promptly learns, the village's strings are pulled by the Comte de Reynaud, a pious gent who happens to be Mayor and whose wife may or may not be away on an extended holiday. As we also eventually learn, the Comte isn't truly a villainous soul, only that he believes he knows what is best for the community, this including observing Lent stringently and keeping at bay all things untoward and controversial. This last part, it would quickly dawn on the Mayor, would have to include tearing down Vianne Rocher, her business and her reputation. The Mayor would prefer his village to remain a sleepy one.<br /><br />Vianne enjoys walking around in her red shoes and being la vonne vivante and demonstrating that joie de vivre, and that about drains my French lexicon. It's made obvious early on that the movie's central conflict will revolve around Vianne's free-spirited nature and the Comte's attempts to stamp down that liveliness and sense of freedom. She's friendly and that's fine, but, in her exuberance, Vianne also thumbs her nose at proprieties and gently mocks the Mayor ("Can I interest you in some nipples of Venus?" she offers him.). She ignores the village's religious structure (and, by that, I mean she refuses to go to church), opening her shop during Lent (a time of abstinence and sincere penitence) and orchestrating a pagan chocolate spring festival at the same time as Easter Sunday. So, no, the Mayor doesn't enjoy having his moral superiority tweaked. We see the Mayor admonishing Vianne: "You don't misbehave here. It's just not done, did you know that?" Whispers abound about whether she's a radical or even an atheist.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Vianne does start making a few friends here and there, and her chocolate fineries are things of wonder. Vianne claims to know what sort of chocolate best suits her clientele, and this is the part where that opening sentence comes in. "The Maya believed cacao held the power to unlock hidden yearnings... and reveal destinies." Soon Vianne is doling out delectables and remedies, although, as in the best of stories, these remedies work their mojo in an indirect way. Throughout all this, the mayor is busting her chops. And it all gets a lot worse when the river throws up several boatloads of families and drifters. Except, for the movie audience, this is where things really kick up a notch, because at this stage Vianne goes from serving mostly as a plot vessel to someone infinitely more human and more riveting.<br /><br />On board one of those boats is Roux, disarmingly, roguishly played by Johnny Depp, and he is, of course, Vianne's love interest. And, to play up the romantic tension, Vianne has a bit of trouble guessing which chocolate is right for Roux. Anyway, if one thought the Comte De Reynaud was unhappy before, imagine the state of apoplexy he achieves when river rats suddenly begin to sully his bailiwick. He can't say it aloud, but he's probably thinking: "Sacr&eacute; merde!"<br /><br />As the movie progresses, we learn about Vianne's parents and how her vagabond mother set her about her wandering ways, traveling village to village at the whims of the North wind, dispensing cacao remedies. We learn the cracks in Vianne's irrepressible nature and we learn that her daughter Anouk is unsettled enough with the lack of stability that she's invented an imaginary kangaroo friend as a form of security blanket. So it's not a fairy tale life after all, following the North wind.<br /><br />CHOCOLAT is a wonderful film, and makes me want to read Joanne Harris's novel, although, from what I understand, the role of the Big Bad was altered from being that of a priest in the book to that of the mayor in the film adaptation. Nevertheless, Alfred Molina is superlative, lending a depth and complexity and a melancholy to his character (see how forlornly he gazes at his wife's picture), elevating the Comte de Reynaud to beyond mere token villain status.<br /><br />It's the feel of the thing which I appreciate the most, I think. CHOCOLAT feels like a charming fairy tale peopled with real life characters. The tone is right away established with the narrator's voice over (supposedly the voice of a grown up Anouk) and the two wind-blown figures in red. The cinematography is exquisite, the exteriors shot in France (the little village is post card picturesque!), the interiors apparently filmed mostly in England's west country and just outside London. And the musical score perfectly supports whatever mood is invoked onscreen. So, okay, I don't know that the dialogue is all that brilliant, even though I did like it. What I do know is that the words in the script are enlivened by a cast of marvelous actors. The battered housewife, the embittered landlady estranged from her family, the repressed lovely assistant of the Comte, the widow who may or may not be grieving over her four-decades-gone husband... these are characters who develop as they fall under Vianne's cheerful ministrations and are themselves empowered. As portrayed by Lena Olin, a sublime Judi Dench, Carrie-Anne Moss, and a still vibrant Leslie Caron, they each add memorable color to CHOCOLAT. I should mention young and talented Victoire Thivisol, as well. She plays Anouk, and she impresses me enough that I aim to look up PONETTE, in which at only four years old she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival! How awesome is that?<br /><br />But it all falls on Juliette Binoche, ultimately, and her delightful performance transports the movie to a wonderful viewing experience. Juliette is older now, and yet she's just as exquisite in her maturity. She seems more solid, somehow, than when she was taking on those sex goddess parts in earlier films. As Vianne, I've never liked her more. And she's still beautiful, her inner light keeps on shining. I think the word I'm looking for is "luminous," although that description's probably been beaten into the ground.<br /><br />CHOCOLAT is that same old package, really, done plenty of times and touting that same message, but this time it's presented with grace and a certain lightness. You get a smattering of romance. Quite a bit of prejudice. Religion, as a restricting engine, again gets a beating. The consumption of foods is just about equated to foreplay. And Johnny Depp plucks at a steel guitar. It's a fable that is comic and uplifting and also sensuous and passionate and excellently enacted. It's a fable, and yet it's inhabited with a core of emotional reality.<br /><br />Now, if they were to make a movie about my favorite candy, that sucker'd be called... CARAMEL. Does the North wind like caramel?</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>A religious, small town in the French countryside receives newcomers Vianne (Juliette) Binoche and her daughter.  They come dressed in red, and soon open a chocolate shop across from the church on the first week of Lent.  Scenes of  townspeople in confession describing the delicious chocolates are meant to be titillating.  Chocolate treats from the new shop is described sensually with double-meaning, including sex and other sins of enjoyment.<br /><br />The mayor launches a campaign to get rid of the new chocolate shop that is causing so much excitement in this once sleepy little village.  Then the children see "pirates" along the river and Vianne's daughter runs to her mother announcing the landing of the swarthy crew.  It is a band of Irish river people and headed by a handsome Roux (Johnny Depp  - who plays pirates well).  The beautiful Vianne and the handsome Roux become romantic as they understand each other as outsiders and agents of change for all they touch.<br /><br />"Chocolat" is a sweet movie, but trite in that  it suggests that all a person needs to liberate their soul, forget all the wrongs done to them, and become happy is a piece of candy.  There is a "leave it to Beaver" feel to the movie - too perfect, and the dialogue is often boring.  Judi Dench plays a role as a local diabetic who does not want to give in to her disease.  She keeps eating the sweets and enjoying life despite her critical condition.  I felt pain in all the actors trying to keep a French accent going - it did not come naturally for most in the film.<br /><br />Overall, enjoyable and more of a "chick flick" with a sweet chocolate shop princess and a swarthy pirate to bring it to a Disney ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>i stayed away from this movie all this time because i was scared off by the "chick flick" aura it had, but if this is a CF, bring on more like it!  set in a small french village in 1959, still not quite caught up with the modern world, juliette binoche stars as a single mother who wanders from place to place imparting the magical spells of chocolate, altering peoples lives while sadly not managing to alter her own.  the townsfolk include a repressed mayor (alfred molina) who is her main foe with his reliance upon traditional catholicism, and a slew of fine actors (lena olin, judi dench, john wood, leslie caron -- & isnt it grand to see HER?, &c) all of whom are eventually won over, as well as johnny depp, her counterpart as an irish rover who manages to settle her down, as she does him.  the movie is charming, funny, and gripping from end to end.  plus, how can you NOT like a movie that hails the merits of chocolate?</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>Being the lover of chocolate that I am, I knew I had to see this and I'm so glad I did.  It's such a beautiful movie with a great storyline and great acting.  No wonder it was nominated for some Oscars.  It's a terrific heart-warming movie that is fun to watch again and again.  Well acted by Juliette Binoche (nominated for an Oscar for this performance) and other cast members, I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to see a beautiful story with no violence, sex, guns for a change.  It's set in a beautiful country town in France and the scenery is lovely.  I love the touches of humour it has throughout and again; I really recommend this to everyone.  It also stars the amazing Judy Dench.</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>Like Mary Poppins, Chocolat is a classic tale of the transforming power of the Feminine in the face of patriarchal oppression.<p>The absurdly talented Binoche, Depp, Dench and Molina lead a cast made in heaven in this most magical of movies. Even on a simplistic level, this is a gorgeous love story which unfolds intelligently and concludes satisfyingly.<p>Chocolat is also a visual delight and remains one of the most beautiful and well crafted films I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q.html">A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q</a><br/><p>The movie starts off in the winter of 1959, at the quiet and tranquil French village, where the inhabitants live there lives as quietly as possible. Until one day, driven by fate and a strange wind, Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her duaghter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) arrive in town. The villagers are rightly very curious about the strangers but when Vianne opens a chocolatier, the town's mayor (Alfred Molina) warns off the people against the 'evil'. But even when giving out warnings and instilling a fear for such temptations, the mayor cannot stop the villagers' attraction to not only the chocolatier but the outwardly friendly and irresistable Vianne. Vianne little by little shows the villagers what it means to not only enjoy life, but live it. <p>&quot;Chocolate&quot; has gotten a total of 5 Oscar nominations: Best Picture (David Brown, Kit Golden, Leslie Holleran), Best Actress in a Leading Role (Juliette Binoche), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Judi Dench), Best Music Original Score (Rachel Portman), and Best Writing (Robert Nelson Jacobs).<br /><br />First off I must say that the acting done by such an all-star cast is superbly done. Notably Juliette Binoche, with her beauty and charming accnet, is vibrant in her role as the woman Vianne who can't help but be different from everyone else. Alfred Molina also handles his character with what seems like the greatest of ease. Sort of the bad guy in the movie, but can't help loving him by the end of the movie. There's Judi Dench as a elderly woman made an outcast by her own daughter (played by Carrie-Ann Moss you won't believe as the same Trinity we know and love!). There's also Lena Olin who acts out her character of a battered wife to perfection, Leslie Caron in a role you can hardly recognize, and the young priest played by Hugh O'Conor (there's one scene where he sings and dances to &quot;Hound Dog&quot; which is very cute!). And of course I mustn't forget Johnny Depp as Roux, the Irish gypsy who falls for Vianne. Unfortunately he had a very small role in the film but was an adorable match for Juliette Binoche. Of course he could have worked on his accent a bit since it comes and goes often.<p>As for the movie itself, the plot is nothing too complicated or too original. In fact, some like me might find many similarities to the Disney movie &quot;Pollyana&quot;. There's an outcast who ultimately though reaches to each and everyone in the town. There's a kind of 'bad guy' who chooses what kind of sermons will be preached. <p>The reason for my 3 stars is because I thought that besides the marvelous acting, the movie itself felt a bit slow and nothing remarkable. And most of all, whoever decided to categorize this movie as a romantic/comedy must have not really read the script. The romance is more like a subplot and &quot;Chocolat&quot; is more like a drama than a comedy. Sure, there are a few moments where you can chuckle or even laugh a bit. But no a laugh-out loud movie at all.<p>So in conclustion, &quot;Chocolat&quot; is a sweet movie which flows along at an even pace. A film to watch when you have a few hours to spare where you don't have to concentrate that much. Oh, and a bit of trivia. Johnny Depp plays guitar in this movie in three scenes, and also does on one song on the soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>Trouble in demi-Paradise when a free-spirited woman blows into a French village a la Mary Poppins to open up a chocolate store right in the middle of Lent!<p>I didn't know a THING about this movie when I agreed to see it with Sis in Law, but I think she choose very well for us. Juliette Binoche is quite charming as the chocolatiere who's getting everyone worked up but managing to subdue them all with just the right kind of truffle or cocoa. Oh, if life were only so simple in actuality! I especially loved the colors of her clothes in this movie, lovely aquas and salmons. "Chocolat" is a feast for the eye as well as the mouth (although the mouth part is vicarious, really). Dame Judi is a bit more crotchetty here than usual, but still a great performer. Depp is sexy as a gypsy guy who manages to be slightly a step ahead of Binoche, disconcerting her as the only one who's favorite chocolate she can't quite detect.  <p>I think it's interesting how many other reviewers are angry that Johnny Depp didn't have a larger role than his billing would have you believe, but I think the true qualifier for that dubious honor would be Leslie Caron. I don't think she says two words together in the movie; she just keeps looking over her shoulder to be amazed at finding John Wood there (is that really the strangest thing?).</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>This is a gorgeously produced movie with its heart in the right place, but ultimately it fails to deliver more than the merest trifle (pun intended) of entertainment.  It's all SO well-intended and politically correct, and the story is barely believable. (How did this woman who shows up in town on foot, with only two suitcases, manage to equip and stock a confectionery store?)  I enjoyed it while it lasted, even though I felt that the movie was trying to manipulate my emotions, but it left no lasting impression. Enjoy it for what it is --- a (semi) modern-day fantasy or fable -- but don't expect greatness. It's not as good as most reviewers would have you believe!</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>When chocolate making harmonizes with our passions, and the chocolate maker is Juliette Binoche, total success and delight are inevitable.<br />While awakening passion in everybody's life in a small village, Binoche faces the classic struggle between being true to one's self and following what is supposedly the righteous way forced on us by others.<br />Each character in the movie is a forceful presence and each plays an important role in this wonderful story. The short appearances by Johnny Depp ignites a fascinating emotional spark between a noble man and the family of a single charismatic woman and her smart daughter.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Based on the novel by Joanne Harris, the film "Chocolat" takes a lot of liberties with the book's story, but is still a very good film. The movie revolves around a mysterious woman, Vianne (Juliette Binoche), who arrives rather suddenly to a remote French village with her young daughter in tow. Vianne quickly settles in and establishes a chocolate shop, which instantly becomes the talk of the town. While certain people are intrigued by this fascinating woman and her sinfully sweet candies, other townspeople see Vianne as an immoral person who threatens the village's core principles and values. When a band of "pirates" (a.k.a. Irish gypsies) arrive in town, Vianne immediately befriends their leader (Johnny Depp), causing other people in the town (especially the mayor) to resent her even more. Eventually Vianne is tempted to flee again in search of another new start, but this time she may have found something worth staying and fighting for.<br /><br />As I said, there are some major differences between the film and the novel. Usually when filmmakers deviate from the books their films are based on, they end up with a gigantic mess. However, that isn't the case with "Chocolat," which is an endearing film with a wonderful cast. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Maybe there isn't much difference - but Vianne's is more magical than most. She spends her life as a wanderer, bringing with her chocolate recipes that descend from the Mayas, but with preparation to tempt the most refined Europeans. The story starts when she and her daughter wander into a small city in France that dates back to the middle ages. It's a walled city, filled with walled people, the kind affronted by opening a chocolate shop during Lent and nastily eager to note the mother's never-married state.<br /><br />But, with a lot of determination and a little magic, Vianne wins them over, one palate at a time. As she helps bring people together, heal rifts, and create second chances for the townspeople, one wonders why the charm doesn't work on her own life. Then, Roux (played by Johnny Depp) appears, even more of a wanderer than Vianne. Instant affinity arises between these two roamers, but instant enmity comes from the deep-rooted locals - how dare they not live lives as staid as the villagers' own?<br /><br />Based on chocolate, you just know that this has to end up as a feel-good movie; I'm not spoiling any surprises there.

Carrie-Anne Moss and Alfred Molina delivers a good performence as well and Judi Dench, she is brilliant as always. The film throws light on the simple pleasures of life, the life in towns in France. A film worth watching!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>Lasse Hallstrom's "Chocolat" is a richly delicious movie. Set in post-WWII France, Juliette Binoche is luminous as Vianne,a gipsy who works magic with her chocolate. Alfred Molina stars as the melancholy, repressed Comte who initiates a crusade against her in the name of morality. With Rachel Portman's sensuous soundtrack,"Chocolat" is a delicious treat.<br /><br />In "Chocolat",Vianne befriends the abused Josephine (Lena Olin) as well as the suffering Countess (Judi Dench),who's estranged from her uptight daughter Caroline (Carrie-Ann Moss). Vianne defiantly opens her chocolaterie during Lent. One can argue the premise is offensive-what if Vianne opened a hamburger shop in India,or sold pork in a Muslim country? Isn't Vianne being insensitive,or just adolescent? Vianne's chocolate shop ends up being a refuge and place of healing. Her chocolate is an aphrodisiac, spicing up a passionless marriage and jumpstarting a romance between an old widow (Leslie Caron) and a man who's pined for her since WWI. Johnny Depp leads the river pirates to the small French town. His name is Roux--so he's named for the butter-flour mixture that thickens soups. The plot thickens. In the meantime, the Comte is bullying the young priest. Doesn't he have anything better to do? To his credit, the Comte tries to reform Josephine's abusive husband Serge. As for the Countess, she is secretly suffering from diabetes and desires Death by Chocolate.<br /><br />Vianne decides to have a Chocolate Festival to counter Easter. After kneeling before a crucifix, the Comte finds Vianne's chocolate goddess on an altar surrounded by Mayan and Aztec images. He succumbs to the temptation of the chocolate, and everyone gets a Happily Ever After.<br /><br />"Chocolat" works as a light-hearted fable. It's sensuous and magical. It's delightful,fast-paced,and the ensemble cast is first-rate. One may disagree with the unrepentant,ungrateful Vianne,who doesn't thank the Divine for her healing gifts,or the fact that she doesn't know who her child's father is. Still, Vianne is compassionate and charitable. Even the villainous Comte has nuance,a man depressed from his wife's death. "Chocolat" is delicious. Succumb to the tasty temptation!</p></br></body></html>

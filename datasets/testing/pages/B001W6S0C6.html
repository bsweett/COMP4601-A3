It's very entertaining and well balanced between action scenes and slower-moving scenes. The overall atmosphere of the movie is very much on the dark side, which is something that works very well, in my opinion.  If you've seen other Tim Burton movies and like his style, then this movie should please you as well.  The dark feel of Gotham City gives the movie a feeling of dreariness and mysteriousness. The street scenes in Gotham City portray a city with lots of crime and chaos, yet the movie maintains a true comic book feel.  Tim Burton definitely created a vintage comic book movie, and that's really how a Batman movie should be.<br /><br />Michael Keaton does a great job playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. His portrayal of Bruce Wayne is that of a mysterious guy with an alter ego that he's concealing for most of the movie. He is overshadowed somewhat by the performance of Jack Nicholson as The Joker. Nicholson's performance is classic, and in my opinion, the best acting he's done in his entire career. The Joker in this movie is a psychotic killer who doesn't hesitate to poison Gotham City, whether by Smilex gas or contaminated hygiene products, and doesn't think anything of bumping off his own right hand man, Bob. This was the first movie ever made where the true nature of The Joker is exposed, which is more accurate to the comic book Joker. Batman: The Movie (1966) and the 1960s TV series didn't allow Cesar Romero to portray the Joker in a psychotic way. Instead, Romero's Joker was made into a funny thief. This was completely fine for the campy TV series, and Romero was an outstanding Joker with incredible talent.  Nicholson's Joker, on the other hand, is a balanced mixture of dark humor and evil, which is what a true Joker should be like. His wardrobe and makeup are outstanding, not to mention that permanent grin is incredibly creepy. The Joker gets darker and more evil as the movie progresses. For fans of this iconic villain, I highly recommend seeing this movie and the legendary performance of Nicholson.  In my opinion, Nicholson OWNS Heath Ledger when it comes to portraying The Joker.<br /><br />Other strong performances are by Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, Robert Wuhl as Alexander Knox, Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent, Jack Palance as Boss Carl Grissom, and Michael Gough as Alfred. It's a very entertaining movie that is often compared to The Dark Knight, but usually loses. Personally, I prefer this movie to The Dark Knight. One of the best things in this movie is the score by Danny Elfman. The music fits the scenes so well and has become a timeless, classic score over the years. I highly recommend this movie.  I also highly recommend buying the score.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>The story of the hero known as Batman is one that many people are familiar with to some degree. As a comic book character created by Bob Kane for DC Comics, Batman has remained one of the most popular heroes throughout the years, and the same can be said, for the most part, for all of his various incarnations in both the comics and other forms of media. In the 1960's the Caped Crusader was adapted into a weekly television series, starring Adam West (Bruce Wayne/Batman) and Burt Ward (Dick Grayson/Robin). The problem with this series, in my opinion, was that it chose to make a comedy out of Batman, everything about this series just screamed camp! I'll admit I have watched some of the episodes, along with the movie that was released around the same time, and for some reason I actually found myself unable to look away. The only conclusion I could come up with was that the series was the equivalent of a train wreck; you know the results are going to be disastrous, yet you can't bring yourself to look away. Sure the series was a hit, but I challenge any fan of the series to go back now, and actually watch it and see if you truly feel that it did any sort of justice to the character of Batman. Anyway, I digress, the series eventually ended; however, that would not be the end of Batman's life on television. He would later appear in animated form on the kid-friendly "Super Friends" show, which was basically the Justice League superhero team without the name. After a few seasons on the air, "Super Friends" ended, and once again Batman was left to only appear in the comics.<br /><br />Then in 1989, Warner Brothers released what would become the first of four feature films that would comprise the original Batman film franchise. In this incarnation the character appeared to be getting the treatment he rightfully deserved, gone was the camp and stupidity of the 1960's, and in was a darker, brooding, and vengeful billionaire version of Bruce Wayne who prowls the rooftops of Gotham City in the guise of Batman<br /><br />"Batman" focuses on the Batman's (Michael Keaton) initial appearances in and around Gotham City, stopping crime whenever and wherever he finds it. For many, he is nothing more than a myth supposedly lurking in the shadows, created in an effort to deter the criminal element that plagues the city. However, when a maniacal menace by the name of Joker (Jack Nicholson) begins terrorizing Gotham, Batman is forced to come out from the shadows to confront this madman before his city is plunged into madness.<br /><br />After the popularity of the 60's TV series, Tim Burton's dark vision of Batman was exactly what was needed to turn the Dark Knight back into the vengeful hero he was meant to be. Burton was wise enough to create a version of Batman that was dramatically strong, yet remained true enough to the hero's legendary origins, while still adding a few tweaks for artistic license, that he was able to present a movie that would please the fanboys (and girls), and also gain great critical acclaim and commercial success. The approach of the story was different from most superhero movies of today, because here Bruce Wayne has already become Batman, and we are given his origin through a series of flashbacks. Taking the place of the traditional hero origin was the origin of the film's villain, the Joker. Generally in superhero films both origins tend to be presented simultaneously, or at least in quick succession of each other; however, the change to that method worked out well, and I believe the film's success when it was released, and its continued popularity today, is partially due to that somewhat unconventional approach to the storytelling. The overall story in "Batman" was very well-paced, and generally balanced in regards to the main characters. I did feel that at times perhaps Joker was getting way too much focus, and that Batman/Bruce Wayne was getting pushed aside a bit (this was possibly due to Jack Nicholson's much broader appeal and star power over that of Michael Keaton). Vicki Vale was fleshed out a little in the story, although she never manages to become much more than the token girlfriend for Bruce Wayne in this movie, not that this is all that surprising. The action worked well within the film, never feeling forced into the proceedings to provide the obligatory fight sequences for a comic book or action movie. Basically, all of the story elements within "Batman" worked perfectly with each other to create a very entertaining movie, and beloved comic book adaptation, and at the time, it could have been viewed as a "How To" guide for making a successful superhero movie.<br /><br />The cast was led by Michael Keaton, who was a source of much contention amongst fans at the time of his casting; because at that time all he had really been known for were comedic roles, and his most recent had been the title role in Tim Burton's "Beetlejuice". However, once trailers for the movie started appearing on TV and in movie theaters, and then the eventual release of the movie, the fans soon began supporting Michael's portrayal, and to this day he still remains the fan favorite for many Bat-fans. Michael brought a very serious minded approach to the character of Bruce Wayne, playing him as being somewhat uncomfortable in his billionaire role, and much more at ease in the part of Batman. He also was the first to give the two characters very distinct voices to differentiate from one another, a choice that has stuck with the character throughout all of his movie incarnations since then (well, except for "Batman & Robin", George Clooney never left `George Clooney' mode). Jack Nicholson ("The Bucket List") was the perfect choice for Joker, and at the time was the iconic version of the character that all other versions would be judged by; however, the late Heath Ledger has dethroned Nicholson with his recent portrayal of a much more menacing version of Joker in Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight". Jack brought a dark sense of humor and violent disposition to the character, aspects of the Joker that hadn't been seen before except in the comic books, mixed with a little bit of wackiness, although not so much that it became cartoonish or distracting from the movie or his performance. Rounding out the main cast was Kim Basinger ("Cellular") as Vicki Vale, her character as I stated earlier, was essentially nothing more than eye candy and a love interest for Bruce Wayne. There were a few moments where Kim was surprisingly given some important scenes in the script, therefore adding some depth to her character and her relationship with Bruce, but otherwise she was nothing more than the damsel-in-distress for the hero to save.<br /><br />In the end, "Batman" was, and still is, an excellent superhero film adaptation, and at the time was responsible for resurrecting the seemingly dead comic book genre after the one-two punch of "Superman 3" and "Superman 4: The Quest for Peace" had killed it off. Boasting a very solid story that was approached seriously by all the cast and crew working on the film, Tim Burton's "Batman" was the perfect weapon for successfully destroying the public's misconception of Batman as being nothing more than a silly superhero for children that was the focal point of an extremely campy TV show.<br /><br />"Batman" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>It's hard to believe that stars like Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Harrison Ford, Charlie Sheen, Pierce Brosnan, Tom Selleck and Bill Murray were all considered for Batman, at some point. It's even harder to believe that Tim Curry, Willem Dafoe, David Bowie and James Woods were considered for the Joker. Thankfully, the powers that be gave us Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson in their respective roles that made this film a classic among Batman fans. Directed by Tim Burton, Batman was a critical and financial success. The film inspired Batman: The Animated Series and a series of films. Up until the release of "The Dark Knight", it was the highest grossing film based on a DC comic book. In my opinion, this movie is the definitive Batman movie. With over 50 years of comic books to be based upon, it's the one closest to Bob Kane's original vision for Batman. Although there were three more movies to follow after this one, This movie is my most favorite out of them all. I mean, it had an all-star cast involved with it like Kim Basinger, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Jack Palance, and Jerry Hall. Heck, even Batman creator Bob Kane has a cameo in the movie. Who wouldn't like it?? This Two-Disc Special Edition includes features such as Audio Commentary by director Tim Burton, Legends of the Dark Knight Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Parts 1-3 Beyond Batman Documentary Galleries, On the Set with Bob Kane featurette, and three music videos by Prince. Definitely worth getting if you're a Batman fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Some good action scenes, especially at the end.<br />*Very solid cinematography.  Seems very fresh and original.  Quite a few strong images.<br />*Pretty dark and moody, but not overwhelmingly so.<br />*Production design is completely awesome.  Gotham City is very imaginatively designed.  The Batmobile is still probably the best in this film.  The Batwing is cool.  There are loads of nifty gadgets, cool costumes, and good sets.<br />*Storyline is not too bad.  Lots of memorable scenes.  Has a good amount of drama, romance, action, and snippets of comedy.<br />*Characters are good and well-acted.  Michael Keaton is cool.  Jack Nicholson makes a good, funny, somewhat menacing Joker.<br />*Music score is good, and there are a few good late 80s songs in there (lots of Prince!).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Seems a bit long or slow in the first hour or so.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*Some parts are a little goofy (but it's not too bad in this case).<br /><br />Even though the newer Batman films are stronger in a lot of ways, this version is still quite original and entertaining.  It has good characters, a pretty good story, and some excellent production designs throughout.  The ending has a lot of great action too.  Definately reccomended for anybody who is interested in comic-book heroes.<br /><br />The one-disc version has okay image and sound quality, and no special features.  The two-disc version has good quality and a number of featurettes.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>When the original Batman character was created by Bob Kane many years ago, he was meant to be a shadowy, scary figure that was as much vigilante as hero.  Over time, though, perhaps due to the comics' appeal to children or the campy 1960s Batman TV series, Batman became a much lighter subject matter, almost rivaling the pristine Superman in terms of heroism.  This 1989 film from Tim Burton that perception, bringing Batman back to his dark roots.<br /><br />In the film, Batman battles the nefarious Joker, who much earlier in life murdered Bruce Wayne's parents and effectively transformed the young Bruce into the Caped Crusader.  However, much time is also devoted to how Jack Napier ultimately (at the hands of Batman himself) becomes the Joker, setting up an interesting character dichotomy.  A love interest (Vicki Vale) is also present for Bruce/Batman which, while never really heating up, does draw out some of the personal demons that haunt Bruce.<br /><br />The acting in this movie also stands out as impressive.  Michael Keaton plays a very introspective and intense Bruce Wayne and is spot-on as the brewing Batman.  Of course, Jack Nickholson steals the show as the psychotic, cackling Joker in a role he seemed born to play.<br /><br />Overall, this film really brings the character of Batman back to its dark, brooding roots.  In typical superhero movie style, Batman features its share of cool gadgets and intense action sequences, but it also contains enough character development to make viewers care about the main storylines.  Essentially, this film put Batman back on the superhero map.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>When Tim Burton's 1989 classic "Batman" was released on dvd back in the late 1990s', I think that it's safe to say that its fans were more than a little disappointed. The packaging was shoddy, there were no bonus features, and sound and picture quality was average at best.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2005, With the success of Christopher Nolan's reboot "Batman Begins", interest in the old series has been revived. Picking up on this, Warner Brothers has finally released the original 1989 blockbuster (as well as its three sequels, which vary in quality) on special edition dvd, complete with a second disc filled with bonus features.<br /><br />Most reviewers have already gone over the plot and other aspects of the film (such as Jack Nicholson's amazing performance as The Joker), so I'm going to jump straight into the second disc. I can only say one word...WOW! There is a ton of stuff loaded on this dvd. The first disc features an entertaining commentary track by Burton himself. It is insightful, informative and at times hilarious, but never annoying like some reviewers say it is. But the second disc is where all the goodies lie. There are featurettes going over every aspect of the Dark Knight's journey from the pages of DC Comics to cinemas across the world. The interviews are all very enjoyable. I was really glad that Jack Nicholson participated, since he isn't really a big fan of interviews. His comments are a joy to watch. He to this day loves to have been a part the film, and it shows. He even wears a purple shirt and a Batman pin to prove it.<br /><br />I can go on and on and on about how awesome this dvd, but I'm just gonna sya that this is one dvd that belongs in your collection (alogn with the other four Batman films, which are all available on two disc special edition dvds as of October 18th, 2005). It is one you will want to reach for over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/AD7IBJCYSJ9EE.html">AD7IBJCYSJ9EE</a><br/><p>Batman was released in 1989 and was directed by Tim Burton.

I remember the anticipation and the dread it incurred from fans and non-fans alike.  The purists wanted it to go in the direction of it's comic book roots by going in a darker direction.  These acolytes loathed the 1960's TV series with a passion.  Jack Nicholson seemed the obvious choice to play the Joker.  Michael Keaton?  That light comedian as the Dark Knight?  And what of this young director, Tim Burton, who had two relatively successful films under his belt, "Pee Wee's Big Adventure" and Beetlejuice"?  Let's just say that this is not Adam West's Batman.  What is most striking to me is the macabre tone of the film and that it got such an overwhelming reception from the general audience($250 million in 1989 dollars).  Michael Keaton gives an interesting reading as Bruce Wayne/Batman, a kind of stoicism with personal demons bubbling under the surface.  Nicholson's performance is downright inspired with him just chewing the scenery as the mirthful homocidal performance artist.  Much was made of the look of the film, which won an Oscar for art director Anton Furst ("Full Metal Jacket").  The look of Gotham City can best be described as decaying industrial gothic.  Unlike alot of films nowadays, with the exception of the "Spiderman" films, character and story come first here and that's the reason "Batman" holds up so well.  The most recent entry in the "Batman" canon, "Batman Begins", is the only one that I can think of that compares favorably to this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>&quot;Batman&quot; set the standard for all comic-to-screen heroes that came after it.  It's a good movie that shows you just how twisted and complex &quot;Batman&quot; really is.  He's not played out as some good guy without a care in the world, he's portrayed as a  vengeful, scared and somewhat chemically-imbalanced human being who just happens to be loaded and has a collection of &quot;wonderful toys.&quot;  In other words, Keaton plays the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; as human as a guy in a batsuit can be.  Although everyone talks about Nicholson, Keaton is the real treat here because he pulls off a character that no one really thought he could portray.  <p>Don't get me wrong, Nicholson is wickedly funny as our favorite villain, &quot;Joker.&quot;  He's a total jerk with a screw loose(not unlike our hero) who's hellbent on making everyone &quot;happy.&quot;  He is the glue that keeps this story together.  He's also the reason most folks who don't read comics went to the theater to check this movie out.<p>The special effects are excellent for the time period, and the supporting cast is good as well.  Kim Basinger is nice to look at, but she is probably the least convincing character in this film.  As other reviewers stated, the story is a little uneven, but it's made up for with the brilliant belltower climax.<p>In closing, &quot;Batman&quot; is what all superhero flicks should be:  1) True to the original concept of the characters(Manipulating 'Penguin' in the second flick was immoral) 2) Has an interesting storyline(unlike every sequel) 3) Good special effects that don't come off too cheesy(ref. every sequel) 4) A real cast that's actually interested in the story(no George Clooney) 5) And completely void of multiple arch-villains(Why did every movie after this one include two baddies versus &quot;Batman&quot; anyway?) <p>Enjoy this flick, and if you like it, you'll probably enjoy &quot;Daredevil&quot; and the &quot;Blade&quot; flicks as well.  They are just as dark and brooding.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>Released in the summer of 1989, this film rocked at the box-office, MichaelKeaton brought warmth & humanity to not only Bruce Wayne, but Batman as well, Keaton's facial expressions convey that of a wounded soul, Jack Nicholson finally played the role he was born to play as the crazy,off the wall Joker who's gags never get old, especially when he takes over for his deceased boss(Jack Palance)by telling his cronies to think it over after killing one who disagreed with him in a comical way, Nicholson is over the top as Joker, you can tell he had fun here, as he faces off with Batman in the end by displaying a gun that would put "Dirty Harry" to shame, Kim Basinger lends support as Keaton's somewhat girlfriend who is after the story surrounding Batman, & is targeted by the Joker, one of te best scenes that plays on emotions is the flashback scene where Keaton discovers that Jack Napier/Joker was the one responsible for his parents murder, which gets him in a vengence mode, as he destroys Joker's operating compound with the Batmobile, one of Cinema's coolest cars, their showdown at the end is very gothic, but satisfying, its sequel "Batman Returns" was less that perfect, if only they hadn't put Danny DeVito under a ton of makeup, it might have been better, but this one is the best of them all, "Batman Forever" is as good as this one, despite Keaton's absence, but avoid "Batman & Robin" at all costs!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>The best comic book film to date. Tim Burton's unique visual display will leave you breathless. In a time of crime, Gotham City is in the need of a superhero. Batman, or the Dark Knight, scares criminals and delivers justice to the city. Jack Napier, a man who is cheating with his boss' girlfriend is about to be wasted, but falls into a chemical tank instead. After that, he becomes the Joker (played by the immortal Jack Nicholson) and vows to get revenge on Batman, the man who dropped him into the pool of chemicals. Batman's personal life revolves around Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), an aggressive photographer who is on a mission to discover the roots of the Batman. The man behind the mask is none other than the richest man in Gotham City, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton). He is traumatized by his parents' deaths and vows to get revenge on the man who murdered them. He waited for many years to get his hands on Jack Napier, or the Joker. Boy oh boy, does he get revenge! This movie is filled with comic relief from Jack Nicholson with his art altercation in the museum, 'love that Joker' commercials, and huge revolver. Michael Keaton is perfect as the mysterious, but tough Batman and Kim Basinger is too cool as his love interest. &quot;You wanna get nuts!? Let's get nuts!&quot; Listen for the soundtrack with its great orchestration and Prince songs! This movie is the coolest comic book film ever and will forever remain the best. The closing scene where Batman is on a rooftop of a building looking up at his signal is just the best. I can't stress that enough. This movie is pure immortal.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>BATMAN: fantasy action comic book story; dark character archetype with the Underworld of Hades; great archetype with the Joker too; the city being a jungle analogy; cool gadgets; Keaton did a good job playing a twisted dark hero wrestling with his past; and, of course, Jack Nicholsan was great as the Joker.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>First of all, Michael Keaton makes a creditable Batman. Sure, they had to sculpt a rubber muscle-suit (would the Dark Knight really wear something that so restricts his head movement and peripheral vision?), but as soon as he starts talking in Batman's harsh whisper, you believe. <p> Unfortunately, much of this beautifully designed film is given over to Jack Nicholson's role as the Joker. He looks like he's having fun, and obviously director Tim Burton is enjoying it, but many of his scenes run way too long and a lot of his ad-libbing falls flat. Nicholson doesn't quite make his Joker frightening enough, and we're left with a performance that's half Jack's devil from &quot;Witches of Eastwick&quot; and half Cesar Romero's campy, mustachioed Joker from the 60's tv show. <p> Burton manages to avoid overt camp (why do directors always have to make fun of this sort of material as if they're so much above it, when obviously they're NOT), but the pace drags as he indulges his more precious tendencies a bit too much. The scene where the Joker holds a one-way conversation with a dead crony doesn't really play, and there are too many scenes that exist only because Burton thinks the imagery is hauntingly beautiful- although this is correct in the scene where a rushing Batmobile sends fall leaves blowing in its wake. Despite its langorous pace, flat attempts at humor and Batman's over-reliance on gadgets and sfx, Burton and company manage to produce a visually striking film that rivals Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and Fritz Lang's &quot;Metropolis&quot; for inventiveness. The more street-level action sequences work surprisingly well, and Kim Basinger really brightens up the film's darker elements. <p>  All in all, it's well-worth seeing for comic book fans, but falls short of the precedent set by &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; and the brilliant, virtually perfect &quot;Batman: The Animated Series,&quot; which is one offspring of this movie which more than justifies any of the parent's flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Like many, I had some initial reservations about the casting of Michael Keaton in the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, but, boy was I wrong!  Keaton proved all the naysayers, like myself, to be totally in error.  <p>Under  director Burton's able hands, Keaton showed a talent that had been hidden  by his previous comedic roles.  His menacing, yet sarcastic expression was  meant for the part of a character with two distinct identities.  Too bad  that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not reward him  with at least a Best Actor nomination.  This performance is worthy of that  recognition.<p>Jack Nicholson basically plays the Joker as only Nicholson  could!  No more needs to be said. A marvelously haunting score from Danny  Elfman as well as the contributions from Prince make for pleasurable  listening during the film. A pre-Oscar Kim Bassinger is  &quot;eye-candy&quot; in the limited role of Vicki Vale.<p>Finally, the  &quot;look&quot; of Gotham City is both beautiful and grotesque.  This  makes for a truly unique movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This review focuses on Burton's Batman (Batman89, Batman Returns), Nolan's Batman (Batman Begins, the Dark Knight), and 1992 original Batman: The Animated Series. I'm excluding Schumacher's Batman (Batman Forever, Batman and Robin), the 1960's Batman series, and "The Batman", simply because I believe they are the weakest representations.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I love Burton, Nolan, and BTAS equally. All three interpretations are so different, that they cannot be compared. And it is really annoying that I find people on YouTube trying to see which one is better (most opinions are biased). So here it goes with MY opinions:<br /><br />BATMAN: Michael Keaton, Kevin Conroy, and Christian Bale have given us excellent performances. Conroy (from BTAS) has the perfect voice for Batman, though the physical depiction seems a bit too much. Bale really acts well as Bruce Wayne, but his voice for Batman is too deep and goofy. To me, Keaton is the ultimate "Bruce". He has the awkwardness and the eccentricity of the character, and plus his hoarse voice for the Bat is far superior to Bale's. It's too bad that he doesn't get that much screen time in both of Burton's films.<br /><br />VILLAINS: Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Clayface, Mad Hatter, Scarface, Killer Croc, Bane, Baby Doll, Penguin, Clock King, Harley Quinn, Professor Milo, Poison Ivy, and Rupert Thorne appear only on BTAS, and they are marvelous in their own right.<br /><br />The Scarecrow was better portrayed in BTAS (voice by Henry Polic II) than he was in Begins. Cillian Murphy looked too young as Doctor Crane, and the actual villain was much underused in the film. Two-Face had the scariest appearance in TDK; Aaron Eckhardt was flawless. However, Two-Face in BTAS (Richard Moll) had a much better origin. Years of suppressing anger can do that, you know. Ra's al Ghul is much more interesting in BTAS (David Warner); Liam Neeson's performance in BB was just above average as he wasn't very believable to me. The Penguin, one of my favorite Batman villains, has been blessed with both BReturns and BTAS. Danny Devito and Paul Williams have done superb jobs with this antagonist. Same goes with Catwoman: Michelle Pfeiffer had the better dialogue and better catsuit, while Adrienne Barbeau was a better Selina Kyle, and her chemistry with Batman is deeper.<br /><br />Finally, for the Joker we have Jack Nicholson (B89), Mark Hamill (BTAS), and Heath Ledger (TDK). All three of them are perfect. Nicholson has the best dialogue, Hamill has the best laugh and look, and Ledger has the best sadism. Three different worlds, three different performances. People on YouTube should understand that.<br /><br />SUPPORTING CHARACTERS: I couldn't see Michael Caine as Alfred, so it's thumbs down from me. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and Michael Gough are the ideal Alfred's. Aaron Eckhardt is truly a one-of-a-kind Harvey Dent. I Believe in Harvey Dent! Billy Dee Williams was great in B89, also, and he had the tough and virtuous personality, as did Richard Moll in BTAS. Gary Oldman and Bob Hastings are the definitive Commissioner Gordon's; Pat Hingle is the weakest, but certainly not at all terrible. He's just a bit too short. Morgan Freeman is the one and only Lucius Fox; Brock Peters of BTAS had the better persona, but Freeman had the better chemistry with Batman.<br /><br />GOTHAM CITY: Burton captured the dark and gothic feel of the hellish city perfectly. It looks as if "Hell came sprouting out of the concrete and kept right on growing. You gotta give credit to Anton Furst, the film's art director, for creating this atmospheric universe. Gotham in BTAS also has its advantages. The towering skyline, the dangerous alleys, and the red sky make it all more mesmerizing. Nolan's Gotham looks hellish, too, but it looks too much like Chicago (filming location for both BB and TDK). But other than that, it succeeds in creating a Faustian nightmare.<br /><br />EVERYTHING ELSE: The gadgets in BTAS were the most realistic, while the Batmobile for B89 was better-looking. Keaton's Batsuit is classic, while Conroy's cape and cowl is ultimately frightening. The heroines (Basinger, Holmes, and Gyllenhaal) are lovely additions, although I wish Basinger would stop screaming throughout B89. And let's not forget the music: let's give it up for Danny Elfman, Shirley Walker, James Newton Howard, and Hans Zimmer. These are the composers who gave us those catchy Batman themes. We will never forget them or their work.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Burton's universe, Nolan's universe, and Timm's universe are near ideal. I love them equally, really. I can't wait for the next film.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>In 1989, Tim Burton and Warner Bros. brought Batman to the bigscreen, giving both Batman and Bruce Wayne a severe overhaul and finally giving him a movie that truly captures the purity of the character. Gone were any and all elements of the corny Adam West show of the 1960's. Here, a new and improved, darker and more complex Batman emerged. Personally, I love this movie. Always have, since I was [...] and was frightened by my first home-viewing of the movie. Opinions seem to go in every direction about this movie, but one thing that cannot be denied is that this incarnation of Batman was way ahead of it's time.<br /><br />To play Batman/Bruce Wayne, an unlikely candidate in Michael Keaton was elected. Delivering a somewhat neurotic and mysterious version of the Dark Knight, Keaton was complimented well by his nemesis in the Joker, as played by Jack Nicholson. Some may say Nicholson went over the top with his performance, but that's the way it should be. Balls to the wall is how Nicholson plays the Joker, and I wouldn't want it any other way. Nicholson delivers pure evil with a grin, and nearly steals the show from the Caped Crusader. These two performances alone just about make the movie what it is, and behind the direction of Tim Burton, create a movie that is really intelligent, moody and layered, but still has the accessible, popcorn movie feel that one should expect from any superhero flick. "Batman" delivers the goods, with just as much action as there is character development. The story itself may be a bit dodgy, but does a good job of telling the origins of Batman in a quick, and to-the-point manner, which helps push along the pace.<br /><br />Some may say that time hasn't been too kind to this film, and I'm likely to agree. Afterall, it was made in 1989, and with a soundtrack heavy on the Prince tunes, it's not hard to feel trapped in the 80's. So parts of it may be corny and truly dated, but it's still one of the best superhero movies to date. It set the standard for many movies to come, and for better or for worse, paved the way for many other Bat flicks and pushed Batman's relevancy to the point where now, he is just about the most recognizable superhero the world over. "Batman" is simply revolutionary, inspiring and way ahead of the curve. Worth watching over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Director Tim Burton absorbed all the important lessons to be learned from the four Superman movies and added his own unique (some might say warped) vision to 'Batman', successfully moving the motion picture superhero genre to the next level. While the Superman series fiercely clung to a high degree of light-hearted comedy throughout, 'Batman' presented a dark, grim world for Bruce Wayne to defend. While the villianous Joker (Jack Nickelson) was a comedic villian in his own right his was a more modern up-to-date black comedy that caused one to both laugh and cringe at the same time.<br /><br />A great beginning for the Batman series that would spawn three sequels. Study the background scenery of Gotham City and you'll see just how much Burton's vision has influenced the genre for decades to come.<br /><br />Cast includes: Kim Basinger, Jack Palance and Michael Gough as Alfred the butler. I don't think I would have picked Michael Keaton to play Batman, but he was indeed up to the task. Highly Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I hadn't seen the original Batman movie since it was released in 1989, and I have to say that it is not quite as good as I remember it being the first time.  Sixteen years later, I'm still trying to figure out how Michael Keaton got the Batman gig.  He was actually pretty good in the movie, but it just doesn't really feel like Batman when Keaton is behind the cowl (nor does Keaton really exude the proper Bruce Wayne aura).  When you get right down to it, Jack Nicholson pretty much carries this film on his shoulders, as it doesn't have the greatest of plots, the whole modern remaking of the Batman mystique results in several drawn-out, somewhat boring scenes, and there really isn't all that much action.  And who decided that Batman has to have romantic relationships all the time now?  The real Batman certainly doesn't have a sleepover on a first date.  The whole Vicky Vale storyline just didn't work for me in this film, largely because Keaton doesn't effectively sell the whole Batman vs Bruce Wayne conflict that lies within him.<br /><br />This film basically introduces Batman to his fellow Gothamites.  Gotham City is a veritable cesspool of crime and corruption, and I can't imagine how Commissioner Gordon kept his job with all of the organized crime operating throughout the city.  It takes Batman a little while to find his niche as a crime-fighter.  Once people actually start believing the wild stories about a dude in a bat suit, they question whether or not he is good or bad.  The Joker helps resolve that little dilemma, as he doesn't really hide his definite bad-ness under a bushel.  Of course, The Joker wasn't always the Joker, and this movie gives us one version of The Joker's origins.  Jack Napier was just a high-ranking henchman before an encounter with Batman left him, uh, changed.  Then it's green hair and Fantasy Island smiles all around.  His first big caper consists of poisoning household products with the Smilex chemical that made the Joker the Joker - not exactly a money-winning venture.  The Joker is basically all about killing people and upstaging Batman in the Gotham City headlines.  He and Batman do come across one another a couple of times in the film, but they don't really square off until the end.  The film does at least show some of the special relationship between good guy and bad guy - this is, after all, Batman's primary personal enemy.  To some degree, The Joker created Batman and Batman created the Joker (and they also seem to share the same taste in women).<br /><br />Jack Palance and Billy Dee Williams are sort of wasted in this film.  This was good news for Jack Nicholson because Palance is one of the few actors who could have held his own and taken some of the spotlight away from him.  The scene where Nicholson impersonates Palance is priceless, though.  Nicholson really gets all of the good lines here (e.g., Wait'll they get a load of me), and he pretty much lets himself go wild playing this insane character.  It's interesting that the guy playing Batman doesn't get top billing in a Batman movie, but Nicholson definitely deserved that honor for this film.  Without Nicholson, Batman would be an insufferably flat, tedious film.<br /><br />The Prince music is still kicking, Tim Burton's directorial vision retains its intriguingly dark quality, and the Joker is still lighting up the screen, but Batman just doesn't have the same punch it had when comics' most celebrated crime fighter came to the big screen in 1989.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>Even if &quot;Superman&quot; is a decent movie, Batman is the real thing; Tim Burton created an ultra-stylized film, and his dark version of the superhero paid tribute to the true spirit of the comics, instead of using the style of the TV comedy series; in my opinion that was the right choice.<br /><br /> This film is also the best of the series; when Tim Burton and Michael Keaton left this movie franchise after &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, the quality of the rest of the films was pretty poor. In &quot;Batman&quot; there are a lot of things to enjoy: good performances (Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson of course, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance, to name a few), good music, great sets, ultra cool gadgets (the Batmovile is amazing) and a very interesting story.<br /><br /> A comic superhero film is not an easy to make, but Tim Burton proved to be the right choice in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>this first BATMAN movie is the beggining of a saga...many many BATMAN movies had come after this....i remenber seeying it at the cinema....TOTAL CLASSIC!!!

Jack Nicholson is absolutely great in it and without him is hard to say what this original film would be.  Many people consider this to be arguably the greatest work of his career.  Hard to say but most of everything he does in pretty great.  The movie starts out a little slow but then gets fun.  I am not a big fan of comic book type movies like this but have to say Batman is very entertaining.  Sometimes sequels or parts 2,3 can overtake the original but in the Batman series it's hard to beat this original.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/ACKDSX71VI5HY.html">ACKDSX71VI5HY</a><br/><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />"Batman," director Tim Burton's 1989 film, is a modern classic of its genre and is arguably the original standard-bearing film in the "Batman" filmography.  Starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, it redefined the character after decades of prominence for the more campy Adam West TV series and movie.<br /><br />The screenplay is extremely sharp, as a whole yielding an involved, relatively deep story which draws a compelling connection between Batman and The Joker, and gives each character a considerable amount of depth. Both Mr. Keaton and Mr. Nicholson offer exceptional performances in giving, for the time, the definitive portrayals of their respective characters.  There are also a wealth of one-liners throughout the script which reveal the characters in witty, pointed fashion.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also exceptional; from Michael Gough appearing in the first of four "Batman" films as Alfred, Bruce Wayne's butler and closest confidante, to Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, ace reporter and increasingly mystified girlfriend to Bruce Wayne.  Billy Dee Williams also appears as idealistic District Attorney Harvey Dent.<br /><br />Also featuring a classic dramatic score by Danny Elfman, "Batman" is highly recommended as both a companion piece to Christopher Nolan's great "Batman" films, and is a towering classic of the superhero film genre in its own right.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>The worldwide success of Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" has prompted Warner Bros. to finally release Tim Burton's 1989 "Batman" with an extra disc of special features...and this is an event worth cheering about!<br /><br />A groundbreaking cinematic achievement (and one of the most expensive films ever produced, to that time), "Batman" was a tremendous gamble, and the story behind the ten-year struggle to bring it to the screen is fascinating! It is a tale of visionaries, beginning with Michael Uslan, a young student/Batman fan, who not only convinced his university to include comics in their curriculum, but, fired up by Richard Donner's "Superman", knew a Batman film could be just as powerful, and took the idea, with Batman creator Bob Kane's blessing, to Hollywood; of Peter Gruber and Jon Peters, who listened to Uslan, after every studio had passed on it, saw the potential, and decided to gamble; of Sam Hamm, who had a "Batman" script in his head, praying to get the chance to write it; and, most importantly, of Tim Burton, whose dark, quirky sensibilities made him THE director to film it, despite only two feature films to his credit.<br /><br />This remarkable story, with archival footage and new interviews, is the highlight of disc two, but there is much, much more! Did you know that Robin was scripted to make an appearance in the first film? That Sean Young, not Kim Basinger, had been cast as Vicki Vale? That the Batmobile, designed by Oscar-winner Anton Furst, could actually do 95 mph (and that Tim Burton drove it, once?) That the room where disfigured Jack Nicholson received his unsuccessful plastic surgery was actually a studio prop room? Each chapter is a revelation!<br /><br />Not that there aren't a few disappointments in the presentation; there is no chapter with deleted scenes (although a few moments are shown that never made it into the finished film...a little girl, seeing Batman, asks, in all seriousness, "Is it Halloween?", which causes him to pause, and grin); the 'History' of Batman, despite a wealth of photos and clips from the comics, serials, and graphic novels, does not offer a single visual from the campy 60s TV series (whether this was a refusal by 20th Century Fox, who produced the series, to permit their use, or an attempt to distance the movie from the "ZAP! BAM! POW!" silliness is not explained). Also, the brief appearance of screen legend Jack Palance, as 'Boss Grissom', is largely ignored, other than in Tim Burton's audio commentary, which is surprising. Still, many of the cast share their memories (Billy Dee Williams still expresses disappointment that he didn't get to play 'Two-Face'; Robert Wuhl, regret that after they rewrote his death scene to allow his character to survive, he never appeared in another film in the franchise).<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying, is...chuck your old copy of "Batman", and replace it with THIS one!<br /><br />You'll be glad you did!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>This new DVD edition should definitely replace your old Batman DVD or, God forbid, VHS tape.  There are hours of bonus features included, mostly done in documentary format.  All angles are covered on the 2nd disc.  Beginning with the original Batman creator, Bob Kane, through the lengthy history of Batman, to the ultimate cinematic adaptation by Tim Burton, who also speaks at great length about the production of the film.  This is very interesting material that a fan will truly appreciate.<br /><br />This movie spoke for itself at the box office.  The combination of Tim Burton's vision and direction, impeccable casting and wonderful special effects took the movie world by storm and reached far beyond the silver screen.  For a while there, you couldn't look anywhere without seeing the Batman logo.  They did some job marketing this movie...<br /><br />I still feel this is the best Batman movie.  Points can be made in favor of the most recent Batman Begins, but having no precursor, Burton's Batman set the stage wonderfully to begin the modern Batman film-making era.  After all, it seems people have granted such praise to Batman Begins, in part, for how it represents a return to the "darkness" of the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Acclaimed filmmaker Tim Burton brings the legendary caped crime-fighter to the big screen in the spectacular 1989 blockbuster "Batman". In the dark streets of Gotham City, an urban myth known as "the Batman" (Michael Keaton) uses the night to strike fear in the hearts of criminals. When the city is threatened by the psychotic criminal known as the Joker (Jack Nicholson), the mysterious Batman becomes the city's only hope. "Batman" is an outstanding action-packed spectacle that honors Bob Kane's popular creation. Director Tim Burton's unique style gives the story much emotion and depth. Michael Keaton gives a fine performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Jack Nicholson is terrific as the Joker. The movie also contains some nice visuals, impressive action, great humor, cool gadgets and a rich music score. The cast also includes Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Michael Gough, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance. This comic book film became the runaway smash hit in 1989 and launched a multimillion dollar franchise.<br /><br />For fans whom been waiting years for a special edition release, "Batman" Special Edition really delivers. The 1989 blockbuster is presented in its original 1.78:1 theatrical widescreen format. The DVD contains a truly vibrant picture quality and an intense 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. Its supplemental extras include a detailed audio commentary by director Tim Burton, the comprehensive 40-minute "Legends of the Dark Knight" documentary, several behind-the-scenes featurettes, "Heroes & Villains" galleries, theatrical trailers and three music videos by Prince. With such new bonus features, "Batman: Special Edition" obtains an "A".</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>The film:<br /><br />Disclosure - Batman was the first movie that really knocked my socks off as a kid. I saw it several times in the theater, and it ignited a decade long love of comic books for me (that ended when I moved out on my own and didn't have the money any more). So reviewing this film is an exercise in taming my nostalgia.<br /><br />It is a very good movie. It's got some very good performances, especially Keaton and Nicholson. The story overall is strong, intertwining the origins of the two principals. It gets a bit flabby in pacing at the end, and about 10 minutes could have been cut. The ending is easily the worst bit, as Batman suddenly becomes rather homicidal, in contradiction to well-established characterization in 50 years of prior stories. Some of the effects work doesn't stand up very well today, with obvious model shots and some pretty bad animation which would now be done by CGI. Actually, what strikes me now is how "low budget" it seems at times, if you're looking for it anyway (and the vision is generally so powerful that you might not - but then I've seen this film a good 20 times).<br /><br />Overall, the fractured vision of Tim Burton and designer Anton Furst, married to a tenuous grip on reality (which was completely gone by the sequel, unfortunately), makes this compelling viewing. It's not as good perhaps as the new Nolan movies. But it's a classic. It inaugurated the boom of comic book movies that we are still enjoying/suffering through today. Kids 8 to 80 should enjoy this film. It's well worth owning as a home video.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />This video transfer is very faithful to the original film. Which is to say, it's drab, dark, monochromatic, and not at all the kind of thing you want to demo your shiny new HDTV with.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. This looks better than the previous two DVD editions. When a scene is lit reasonably well, you can see pretty good detail in hair, facial wrinkles, and wet pavement. But the overall dynamic range of the image, from dark to light, is pretty flat. This is a very dim-looking movie. The audio is a competent Dolby TrueHD 5.1 channels mix.<br /><br />Extras are comprehensive, but they are all in SD, and they are all recycled from the previous 2 disc collector's edition. There are LOADS of cast interviews, production featurettes, and one large documentary which is a 70 minute cut from the one that spanned all four "original" movies. All told I would guess there are about 3 hours of featurettes, most of which are pretty worthwhile for Batman fans. Irritatingly, most of them do not have a "play all" option. So you're forced to navigate a large menu full of small type and try to remember what you've already seen. Argh.<br /><br />Burton's commentary is very entertaining. He only trails off one or two times in the 2 hours of the film. He starts to repeat himself a bit by the last half hour, but overall it is very engaging, loaded with information, and has plenty of honest opinion from the director.<br /><br />***********<br /><br />If you own the 2 disc collector's edition on DVD, I'm not going to say this is a strong recommendation. It's just not that much of an upgrade. All of the extras are the same, and the transfer isn't one of those revelatory HD experiences.<br /><br />If you don't already own it, and you're looking to expand your comic book film collection, then definitely go ahead and pick this up. It laid the groundwork for all the films we've gotten since. It's easily the best of the original 4 Batman movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Gotham City: dark, dangerous, 'protected' only by a mostly corrupt police department.

Directed by Tim Burton, it features a dark and brooding storyline, amazing sets, a well-chosen cast, and an update on the technology traditionally associated with the Batman character.<br /><br />Michael Keaton was a surprising choice as the Dark Knight, by day a weathly philanthropist, by night the Caped Crusader.  Keaton's touch is to portray on-screen, and successfully, the motivation of a scarred childhood that drives Bruce Wayne to create and live through his alter-ego, Batman.  This Batman fights crime in a black rubber and kevlar-armored suit, using a variety of gadgets to come and go from crime scenes.<br /><br />Batman's opponent in this film is the Joker, played with over-the-top maniacal evil by Jack Nicholson in an Academy-Award-nominated performance.  The Joker is a gangland hood who survives betrayal and an industrial accident on a job, emerging as the deformed and now insane master of crime in Gotham City.<br /><br />Beautiful photojournalist Vickie Vale, earnestly played by Kim Basinger, becomes the object of desire of both men.  Their parallel story arcs will intersect in her person, who is kidnapped by the Joker and must be rescued by Batman, in a spectacular finale set in the bell tower Gotham Cathedral.<br /><br />Burton's superb direction takes full advantage of the brooding, spectacular and vaguely retro sets; if this movie has any fault, it is that scene, mood, and setting tend to overwhelm the characters.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as excellent entertainment for fans of the Batman franchise.  Its success sparked three lesser sequels, with Valmer Kilmer and George Clooney taking their turns as Batman while being crowded off the stage by their respective villians.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Batman is one of the best super hero films I've ever seen. Michael Keaton portrays the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman very convincingly as well as Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The story remains kind of vague at the beggining regarding Batman's origin, but as the film goes on it becomes more clear. The direction was really great for this film; I thought that Tim Burton really did a great job adapting the character for the big screen. The special effects are definitely the best I've seen so far for any super hero movie. Jack Nicholson a.k.a. the Joker is the best comic book villain to grace the big screen; I really can't see anyone portraying a better villain. Overall, the movie offers a very deep story about the Dark Knight and offers many action sequences to compliment the plot. I feel many Batman fans will love this movie as well as everyone else.

But, when The Joker, once a hitman turned ass-clown due to a chemical accident, wants to destroy Gotham City by way of a chemical gas known as Smilex (you literally die laughing) & seeking revenge against the mobsters who set him up, its up to Batman to get the last laugh and rid the city of this original insane clown and his posse.<br /><br />After the rise & fall of the 60's T.V. show with a successfull 1966 film released by 20th Century Fox, it seemed Batman would be forever grounded to the pages of his DC Comic (in the 70's if you wanted a Batman T.V. fix it was either watching reruns of the 60's show or tuning in to ABC on Saturday mornings to watch "The Super Friends").<br /><br />In the late 80's with "Warner Bros." owning the publication rights to all DC Comics, the company decided to take a stab at bringing Batman once again to the big screen. But the tone of the comic had changed since the 60's.<br /><br />The Joker went from becoming a dangerous thief to an extermely insane psycho-sociopath killing on a whim & a laugh with goulish devices such as a flower brouch pin filled with corosive acid and his now trademark Smilex gas that can bring a smile to ones face only a coroner could love.<br /><br />Batman also had changed, going from the example setting, lesson teaching hero to the dark, brooding, detective obsessed with keeping evil off the streets of Gotham City & turning into a hero's anti-hero. With Frank Miller's comic mini-series "The Dark Knight Returns" released in 1986, it was only a matter of time before Batman returned to theaters.<br /><br />Die-hard fans were protective of who was to star in the film, however & when, comic actor, Michael Keaton was chosen to star as Batman, fans were pissed, to say the least. Only when the film "Clean & Sober" was released in theaters, 7 and 1/2 mths. before the release of "Batman", did some bat-fans relax. The film starred Keaton as a recovering alcoholic facing his demons in rehab. It was one of Keaton's first dramatic roles, and it worked.<br /><br />Fans gave 2 big thumbs for Jack Nicholson as The Joker, but fans approached cautiously when Tim Burton signed on to direct (his only other credit, at the time, was the comedy "Beetlejuice").<br /><br />The film is great, but, falls just shy of hitting the bullseye.<br /><br />Nicholson steals the show as the over the top Joker, hitting all the right notes of insanity. Keaton is good as Bruce Wayne, but doesn't say too much as Batman. Kim Basinger is hot as Vicki Vale. Screen vets Michael Gough & Pat Hingle are great in their roles Alfred Penneyworth and Commissioner Gorden.<br /><br />The sets are monsterous. "Star Wars" veteran, Billy Dee Williams who plays District Attorney, Harvey Dent in the film has said that the sets for "Batman" are as big, if not a bit bigger, than the sets used for "Empire" and "Jedi". The film, I think, got an Oscar nod for best set design.<br /><br />Danny Elfman gives a memorable score to the film that should have gotten him an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />The DVD itself is a bare bones affair with the film both in the widescreen & full screen versions with 5.1 Dolby Digital and no special features. I hope "Warner" smartens up and releases a Special Edition to this film as well as the other "Bat" installments (well, we could do without "Batman & Robin").<br /><br />Don't hold your breath, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>BATMAN is more a Tim Burton movie than a comic book adaptation. Gotham City is clearly a creation of the artist who will build the world of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS one year later. <p>The problem with Michael BATMAN Keaton is that he is able to be himself only when he's disguised as a bat or hidden in his steeled batcar. He has to wear a mask to protect his face. The Joker, on the contrary, doesn't have a mask ; in fact, his face is already a mask. He loves to work on raw material (pitiful Jerry Hall!) or poison cosmetic articles in order to recreate his satanic smile on his victim's faces. <p>BATMAN is a movie which has to be appreciated for a lot of reasons. It's a really good entertainment, the cinematography is great and full of visual ideas, the story can be read at different levels and, last but not least, the musical score will stay as one of the all-time best.<p>Too bad there are no special features to be remembered of.<p>A DVD zone twilight.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OI841P5R6FCH.html">A3OI841P5R6FCH</a><br/><p>You know, the more I go to the movies, the more I appreciate watching them at home. At home, I don't have to deal with screaming kids, idiots who think it's the height of coolness to project their laser pointers on the screen or talkin' on their cell phones every five minutes, and schmendricks who think they're standing in for Joel/Mike and the `Bots from MST3K. With wonderful little distractions like this, is it any wonder I prefer to stay indoors to maximize my cinematic enjoyment?<br /><br />This, the first of the modern cinematic `Batman' outings, became a case in point. In a strange fit of masochistic insanity, I decided to catch a midnight matinee re-release of `Batman' at the local bijou. I was in luck for a while- people were behaving themselves. Then came the moment where Eckhardt, a cop on the take, gets shot down by Jack Napier (the guy who becomes the Joker).<br /><br />William Hootkins, the man who played the portly and corrupt cop, is also famous among pop-culture sci-fi aficionados as Porkins, the first X-wing pilot to get shot down during the climactic Death Star battle in `Star Wars'. Ironically, this character's last words were, "I'm all right, I'm all--Aaaaagggghhh!", which were the very words I heard a group of uber-Warsies yell out when he caught a bullet in `Batman'. You know, I like the `Star Wars' flicks as much as the next geekin' fanboy, but not to the point that I'll annoy other folks with my high-decibel verbatim recitations of an actor's lines from another movie. It's kinda gauche, you know?<br /><br />But, aside from that, I rather enjoy this little slice o' comic-book celluloid. Jack Nicholson's Joker is one of his most nutso performances ever! Actually, that's not saying too much, is it? I mean, you take a look at `The Shining', `The Witches of Eastwick', or `One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', and it's pretty obvious that Nicholson isn't exactly challenged by roles involving psychos and evil incarnate. Still, he makes the Joker over-the-top without going overboard, unlike the villains from the Joel Schumacher-directed Bat-flicks!<br /><br />I'll be one to admit that Michael Keaton doesn't exactly look the part as Bruce Wayne... which I learned was what director Tim Burton wanted (he states in one of the behind-the-scenes shows that he wanted the Bruce Wayne character to look like he HAD to dress up to be scary to criminals). But as Batman, it's a completely different story. Neither Val Kilmer nor George Clooney could ever hope to match that chin! Of course, if Jay Leno were to ever accept the role...<br /><br />Speakin' of special features: as I stated earlier, there's a big ol' freakin' butt-load of stuff to look through here. I started off with the feature-length commentary track by director Tim Burton-- which I stopped listening to about ten minutes in, `cuz I was zoning out to his incessant droning about... something or other. Okay, so the commentary track was a bust; no biggie. To be honest, I'm not all that thrilled by most DVD special features; after watching several zillion behind-the-scenes mini-docs and retrospectives, I've gotten more than a little jaded by it all. Still, for the sake of putting together as thorough a review as possible, I gotta make a few sacrifices...<br /><br />Anyhoo, there's a whole ton o' behind-the-scenes featurettes, retrospectives, and even a history of Batman in comic books featuring interviews by such comic book luminaries as Paul Dini, Alex Ross, Frank Miller, and Kevin Smith, as well as the late, great Batman creator Bob Kane. While I usually find most behind-the-scenes docs kinda dull, many of the shows on the bonus platter had some reasonably interesting moments. Especially entertaining were the movie's principals discussing how "iconic" and "archetypal" their respective roles were, and how the roles "related to their comic book counterparts." This whole love-fest got to be so nauseating that I almost "barfed."<br /><br />Also covered were looks at the special effects, as well as the building of the bat-suit and batmobile. Quite frankly, I found some of the effects in this particular go-`round a tad less than special, especially Joker's fall off the cathedral. But others worked out pretty well, albeit not totally perfect.<br /><br />Also covered are profiles on the film's main heroes and villains, with retrospective interviews by the principals who played the parts. They even did a profile on the Joker's trusty sidekick, Bob the Goon (as played by Tracy Walter)... who is my all-time fave bad-guy sidekick. Well, aside from General Disarray, faithful aide to the scourge of South Park Professor Chaos, that is.<br /><br />All in all, the 2-disc special edition release of the first Batman flick gives you about as thorough a look at the history, development, and making of the movie as you can get! `Course, if you're not into the extra stuff, the movie itself looks pretty danged good... a little better than the original DVD release, even!<br /><br />`Late!</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>The Movie<br /><br />Don't let this one fool you.  Michael Keaton may be wearing black Nikes and Jack Nicholson may be done up in white makeup and green hair, but this one is for real.  Nicholson is particularly masterful as the signature caper opposite the immortal caped crusader - "This town needs an enema!"  Batman is a classic and despite its age, a solid and memorable piece of filmmaking.  Where the Christopher Nolan envisioned Batman Begins and The Dark Knight feel as if it does occur in a real world, Tim Burton's Batman feels as if it takes place in its own universe.  That in itself is a compliment.  There is some real imagination at work here and this is probably the best movie Tim Burton will ever make.  Batman Returns definitely outdid Batman in some areas, notably in editing and production design.  But, Batman has a balanced script where our lead superhero doesn't have a cameo appearance in the villain shod sequel.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray<br /><br />This one holds water.  The transfer is vibrant and despite the occasional graininess, pretty sharp too.  Clean and simple cinematography drag the Dark Knight out of the gutter and into a bright High-Def presentation.  Color is vivid without being over-saturated.  Overall the film looks and feels natural.  Heck, even the pre-digital optical effects hold up for the most part.  The main casualty here is on the audio end of things.  Sound is clear but on the flat side, with surround mixing on the Tru-HD is a bit half-assed.  This is a mono track movie they dropped an occasional decibel to the rear speakers, but there's no real surround sound.  It is almost completely shot on sound stages and wasn't shot on IMAX, but Batman looks much better than its humble roots and age would imply.  Go buy it.<br /><br />The Movie  5/5<br />The Blu-Ray  4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>I believe I watched this movie six times in one week after it's release. I had always enjoyed Michael Keaton in comedic roles ( MR. MOM, and especially BEETLEJUICE ), and was curious to see what he'd do with a serious role. His low-key, brooding, portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman was excellent, and Jack Nicholson as the Joker was phenomenal, however I was even more impressed with Tim Burton's use of darkly operatic sets, and atmospheric shadows to heighten suspense. Danny Elfman's score ( with the use of only 6 minute's of Prince's songs ) added greatly to the mood of this classic.<br /><br />I love BATMAN BEGINS, and THE DARK KNIGHT ( and I wholeheartedly agree that Heath Ledger was an even better Joker than Nicholson ), but this is the BATMAN movie to beat as far as I'm concerned.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>In 1989, Tim Burton directed his phenominally successful big budget take on Bob Kane's mythical comic book series, Batman. What surprised the entire civilized world was how intense, dark, and mystically provocative the film  turned out to be. The casting of Jack Nicholson as the Joker proved to be  the production's masterstroke, though the choice of Micheal Keaton as Bruce  Wayne/Batman turned out to a lucky break as well. Tim Burton's usage of  updated German Expressinism and Film Noir morphed what could have been a  standard superhero movie into an elaboarate exploration into the dark  interior of modern metropolitan societies and trumatizied adults. There is  a searing honesty to Bruce Wayne's saddness and underlying alienation over  the brutal loss of his parents by street thugs so long ago. Keaton's  emotionally stiffled face shows all the loss and pain in every scene he  appears. The hyestrical dementia of Jack Napier's tansformation into the  Joker is so colorfully recreated for Batman with such comical flourish and  enthusiasm that Nicholson creates another one of his unforgettable screen  personas. Nicholson's Joker maybe a sterotype but he is a lavishely  entertaining character that obviously propelled the movie more than any  other element. Watch Batman for its unapprecaited gothic atmoshere, zany  performances, and genuinely magnificent atmosphere. This was Tim Burton's  entrance into mainstream cineama as a considerable talent, and even eleven  years later the film is still an enchanting walk into the macabre mind of a  master filmmaker.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>FINALLY Warner Bros have released this classic the way it should have been done in the first place for a DVD. I was appauled to find the previous DVD had no bonus features what so ever and wasnt even in surround sound or wide screen.<br /><br />At long last we have the special edition. The movie didnt look all that much touched up, but it does look a bit better. The 5.1 sound is ok, tho, it's not fully 5.1 surround sound.<br /><br />Disc 1 also features a commentary track with Tim Burton... tho, it put me to sleep, so I cant tell you if it was interesting enough to listen to or not.<br /><br />Disc 2 has a bunch of stuff thats in some ways a bit disapointing, and yet other bits are interesting. The first thing is a HISTOY OF THE DARK KNIGHT feature, it goes for about 30 mins and shows the history and changed Batman has had over the the last 60 years. Starting from the origons with Bob Kane and showing the development of it all over the years up to the Cartoon series of the 90's.<br /><br />There is unfortunalty not very much of any behind the scenes of the movie. The Feturette showed more of Bob Kane talking about the movie then actualy showing the movie. There is also some bits and peices of the development team making the Batmobile, Batsuit and a bunch of things like that.<br /><br />What disapointed me is there is no deleted scenes. HOWEVER, there is a very interesting thing that shows the story board of a scene that did not get filmed, but intended to have a suprise glimpse of the boy wonder!!!!<br /><br />There is a few more things, but overall, i may be a bit disapointed with the features, which makes me wonder if this is just the Special Edition that is going to be replaced with a 3 disc Ultimate edition in 6 months.<br /><br />Still, over all, its about bloody time they released this propperlly, the way it shoudl have been done years ago.</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>Now that the hype of The Dark Knight has died down, it's time to remember the original Tim Burton film. Now I know I previously praised that film but the original is undoubtedly the best. Michael Keaton is my favorite of all the movie incarnations. Kilmer was OK and Clooney was just a joke. Bale does a good job and I commend him on actually using two different voices for Bruce and Batman but not in this manner. Sounds like he has lung cancer or something. Now Keaton does use a different voice; he subtly lowers his voice. And when Bale is in his Bruce Wayne persona, he acts to hard to through people off. When Keaton was cast as Batman, there was a public outcry as people couldn't picture him as Batman. Isn't that how it's supposed to be? You shouldn't suspect him at all. The suit in this film is way better than in the films to follow (except Returns as that was pretty much the same suit with minor alterations). It's classic Batman. Keaton handles the action well and the quiet moments are standout (there aren't really any quiet moments [except in Returns] in any of the sequels). Kim Basinger is good as Vicki, noting that she's essentially a knockoff of Lois Lane back in the 50s. And she's a much better actress than Holmes/Gyllenhal (or however you spell her name) in the newer films. They look like clueless teens who somehow ended up in a big superhero film. And Nicholson is my favorite modern live-action Joker. Not to knock Heath Ledger, he was good too, but the way Nicholson played him is actually the way the Joker should be played; a psychopathic clown who commits his crimes with a flair for the theatrical. If he's gonna kill ya, he's gonna do it in style. Billy Dee Williams should've had more screen time as Harvey Dent and he was contracted to play Two-Face but he was paid out and we got...over-the-top Tommy Lee Jones. Michael Gough's Alfred is good but I prefer the Michael Caine version as he's more involved with things. Pat Hingle's Commissioner Gordon is hardly in the film to really critique so Gary Oldman's version is better. Danny Elfman delivers with the music, providing a theme for Batman that rivals John Williams' Superman, but the actual person conducting the orchestra is none other than Shirley Walker, the woman who would provide the music for Batman: The Animated Series and most of its subsequent spin-offs.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>After years of having the original single disk DVD lying on the shelf, WB finally presents an all new and collectible edition of Tim Burton's classic film "Batman". There is actually not much to say about the film that hasn't been mentioned by other reviewers so I will focus on the DVD features.<br /><br />The Movie<br /><br />The movie is presented in a new digital transfer that looks way better than the original DVD release, the picture quality is greatly improved and the colors look brighter than in the previous edition. The classical battle between Batman and his nemesis the Joker looks and sounds better than ever. Both Keaton and Nicholson's performance make of this film the cult classic it is for many fans.<br /><br />The movie is dubbed in both English and French with Spanish, English and French subtitles.<br /><br />The Special Features<br /><br />The original trailer is included as well as many other documentaries that will be a delight for fans of both the comic and the movie. A new audio commentary by director Tim Burton that (as usual and if you are familiar with his previous commentaries) provides not much of extra or valuable information but is a nice to have. A new documentary entitled "Legends of the dark knight" that takes you through the Batman myth over the seven decades of this character's existence, many people involved with the character are here, from Bob Kane, Dennis O' neil, Alex Ross, Jim Lee and many other artists from the Batman comic book universe. Another documentary is included, "Shadows of the Bat", the whole documentary is divided in several pieces and if you want to watch it or have I completed you will have to buy the complete Batman series, in the first movie you will find parts one trough three.<br /><br />Villains profiles are included as well as the original Prince videos (which by the way were not remastered as the film was but, who cares?). A great added value this edition has is the storyboards of the deleted Robin sequence. It was originally scripted that in a certain part of the film the Graysons would be face to face with the Joker, the complete storyboard sequence is here completely edited with music and dubbed by the actors who made the voices for the animated show from the 90's (Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy). With all these details you can see and imagine how many efforts WB put in the production of this set.<br /><br />A great edition of this classical film finally completed with extras that make it a collector's piece.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ1H3VLCDR298.html">AZ1H3VLCDR298</a><br/><p>Ever since the film's debut twelve years ago, I have been watching this film first on beta(yes, i was on of the 8 people who still had beta back then), and then on DVD. All I can say is that this film is even more incredible when you add the widescreen picture(it also features a standard version) and Dolby Digital sound to the movie. All I can say is that if you own a DVD player and liked this movie, you'll enjoy this film even more now.<p>Tim Burton has made some of the best movies to come out in recent years, most notably Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow. He created a Batman here that was (please forgive me) even better than the comic book series. The film has a dark, industrial look throughout the film, with little color and a very dark brooding musical score by Danny Elfman. The plot is about Bruce Wayne(Michael Keaton), a rich millionare who fights his personal demons by becoming the Dark Knight, a man who must avenge his parents death every night by stalking and bringing down criminals. But in his path is the Joker, played by the always fabulous Jack Nicholson. Kim Bassinger comes in as Vicky Vale, a photographer who becomes the object of interest for both Batman and the Joker. While there is not as much action in this like the other 3 films, it is the best one when it comes to acting, directing, and overall feel. On DVD, Batman becomes the best comic book film(underneath Superman I and II) of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9G9G8CJGJPO.html">A3F9G9G8CJGJPO</a><br/><p>BATMAN (1989)<br /><br />  Warner Bros.<br /><br />  Release Date: June 19, 1989 (Westwood, California) (premiere)<br /><br />  June 23, 1989 (USA)<br /><br />  Runtime: 126 minutes<br /><br />  CAST:<br /><br />  Michael Keaton....Bruce Wayne/Batman<br /><br />  Jack Nicholson....Jack Napier/Joker<br /><br />  Kim Basinger....Vicki Vale<br /><br />  Robert Wuhl....Alexander Knox<br /><br />  Pat Hingle....Commissioner Gordon<br /><br />  Billy Dee Williams....Harvey Dent<br /><br />  Michael Gough....Alfred<br /><br />  Jack Palance....Grissom<br /><br />  Jerry Hall....Alicia<br /><br />  Tracey Walter....Bob the Goon<br /><br />  Lee Wallace....Mayor<br /><br />  William Hootkins....Eckhardt<br /><br />  PLOT SUMMARY:<br /><br />  As metropolitan Gotham approches its 200th Anniversary, the powers that be fear that the high level of criminal activity will deter citizens from attending the celebrations. Gotham's mayor tasks district attorney Harvey Dent with finding a way to make the city safe again, in hopes of revitalizing local business. Dent, in turn, targets notorious, well-known mob boss Carl Grissom, who is believed to sponsor most of the criminal activity within Gotham and who is known to be paying off a significant part of the police force.<br /><br />  Gotham, meanwhile, is slowly starting to take notice of a dark vigilante dressed in a bat costume that has started to prey on criminals during the night. The movie actually opens on a lost family that gets robbed by two hoodlums. Batman confronts the two thieves and instructs one of them to tell all his friends about him. Newspaper reporter Alexander Knox is on the scene after Batman disappears, but his questions are deflected by skeptical cops, nameley Lt. Eckhardt, who is one of many police offers on take from Grissom. Eckhardt is paid off in a back alley near the crime scene by Jack Napier, Grissom's second in command, who is both intelligent and erratic - leading Eckhardt to call him "nuts". (In fact, Napier has very psychopathic and strange tendencies, such as carrying around a "lucky deck" of cards, which, of course, includes a joker.)<br /><br />  When Grissom discovers that his girlfriend is cheating on him with Napier, he sends Napier out on a job to Axis Chemicals with the intention of Napier being discovered and killed by police, who he has tipped off to the job. Eckhardt and police arrive at Axis and begin a shootout with Napier and his goons. Unbeknowst to both, Batman is there to personally apprehend Napier - but must release him when a hostage (Police Commissioner Gordon) is held at gunpoint. Soon after, Napier kills Eckhardt. Later in the scene, Batman again tries to apprehend Napier, but a gunshot ricochet hits Napier in the face. Napier falls over a railing and is caught at the last moment by Batman, as Napier hovers above a vat of dangerous chemicals. Batman's grip slips and Napier falls into the vat, presumably dead. Batman escapes the scene.<br /><br />  Batman, as we discover, is actually billionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne, an orphaned businessman who lives along in the large mansion Wayne Manor, with only his trustworthy butler Alfred to accompany him and help him in his double life. Bruce quickly falls for photojournalist Vicki Vale, who has recently arrived in town to cover the "Bat Man phenomenon" and has attracted Knox's attention as well. Bruce is successful in courting Vale, and the two spend a passionate night together in the mansion.<br /><br />  Meanwhile, Napier pulls himself from a local river where Axis's pipes drain. Obviously wounded but unsure of what happened, he visits a backalley surgeon, who does what he can to help Napier but is honest in his evaluation: "You have to understand that the nerves were completely severed, Mr. Napier." Napier sees his new disfigured reflection in a mirror (while the audience does not), and, at that moment, goes off the deep end. He confronts Grissom, who thinks him dead, revealing his new appearance, with eerie white skin, green hair and a permanent grin. Referring himself as the Joker, he claims "Jack is dead" then shoots Grissom and vows to take attention away from Batman with his "plans" for Gotham.<br /><br />  The Joker begins to overtake the underworld, while Gotham is unsure what to think of him or Batman. The Joker's plan, and a successful one in that, is to use his knowledge of chemistry to create hygiene products that are dangerous when mixed. His plan begins to grapple the city with fear. The Joker then crashes in on the Gotham Museum of Art and tries to entice Vicki Vale to join him romantically, as he saw her in a photograph and was immediately smitten. Batman arrives and saves Vicki, and then explains to her how the Joker is poisoning people through combinations of products. Vicki is unsure of what to think, as many still believe Batman himself to be frightening and just as dangerous as the Joker. Dismissing her worries, he calls the Joker "psychotic" and renders her unconscious then drops her back off safely at home. At home, she is then confronted by Bruce, unaware that he just saved her life. She is upset at him for various reasons but the two are interrupted by a visit from the Joker, who is intrigued by being face-to-face with billionaire Bruce Wayne. After Bruce challenges the Joker to a stand-up fight, the Joker pulls a gun and asks: "Tell me something, friend. Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?" He then shoots Wayne dead. The Joker then leaves amid his own hoopla, and Vicki is shocked to see that Bruce is suddenly nowhere to be found, apparently using a metal platter as a bulletproof vest, as he anticipated the Joker would shoot him.<br /><br />  What Bruce has discovered is that the Joker is actually Jack Napier, and that he is also the man who murdered his parents many, many years ago in Gotham. The final clue was that his parents' murderer said the same phrase to him as the Joker said in Vick's apartment ("Ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?") While grappling with this fact, he is schocked to learn that Alfred has brought Vicki to the Batcave, as he is tired of Bruce's secrecy around her.<br /><br />  The Joker decides to pull a huge stunt, hosting his own nighttime parade and throwing free money out to the crowd. Vicki is there to photograph the pandemonium. In the middle of his generosity, however, the Joker begins to gas the crowd and kill dozens of people - while his thug associates are unharmed because of their gas masks. Batman shows up flying his bat-shaped jet and lifts the parade balloons away - as they are the source of the gas. Furious, the Joker shoots and kills his number one thug, Bob, then baits Batman into attacking him, but manages to shoot down the jet with a powerful gun. Vicki approaches the downed jet, where Batman appears to be dead. The Joker finds her and leads her into Gotham Cathedral at gunpoint, where the two begin to climb the many treacherous flights of stairs to the top, where the Joker plans on being rescued via helicopter by his thugs. Batman is not dead, however, and starts to follow them, though he is obviously wounded and dazed from the violent crash. Despite some challenges, Batman manages to finally confront the Joker mono a mono in the belfry and attack him. The two then angrily explain how the created each other and were, therefore, to blame.<br /><br />  Batman: "I'm going to kill you." Joker: "You IDIOT. You made me, remember? You dropped me into that vat of chemicals. That wasn't an easy thing to get over, and don't think I didn't try." Batman: "I know you did." (throws him) Batman: "I made you? You made me first." Joker: "What are you talking about?" Batman: "You killed my parents."<br /><br />  The Joker uses a moment of oppurtunity and pushes both Batman and Vicki off the belfry, where they cling to the ledge for their lives. The Joker's helicopter appears and he grabs a hold of a dangling ladder. Batman shoots a wire around the Joker's leg, then connects the wire to a stone gargoyle on the ledge. As the Joker is lifted away, his attached wire pulls the gargoyle loose and then causes him to fall to his death. Batman saves Vicki once again at the end, and the two are peaceful in each other's embrace. As the movie ends, Commissioner Gordon says that Batman has given the city a signal (the Batsignal) to contact him when need be.<br /><br />  Trivia:(1)Adam West (the star of the TV series "Batman") wanted to play Batman, but Michael Keaton was given the role after getting the nod from Bob Kane, the creator of the original Batman comic strip.(2)In the film, Jack Napier, aka the Joker, is the murderer of Batman's parents. In the comics, the murderer is a character named Joe Chill.(3)It is claimed that Adam West was offered a cameo as Bruce Wayne's father but turned it down, though West denies being offered the part.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LSRBVD2MK3PL.html">A2LSRBVD2MK3PL</a><br/><p>&quot;Batman&quot; is easily the best out of all the &quot;Batman&quot; films.

Words such as "pow" and "zap" were synonymous with Batman. Director Tim Burton and executive producers Michael E. Uslan and Benjamin Melniker were determined to make a dark, gothic, nightmarish Batman movie. Zorro movies, 1930's movie serials, and Da Vinci artwork may have inspired Bob Kane to create Batman. Tim Burton's Batman was a critical and commercial hit! I can remember boys, girls, men, and women wearing Batman T-shirts. I can remember a kid with a Batman insignia haircut! The Heroic Trio(1992, Dong Fong Saam Hap)borrows visuals from Batman(1989). Michael Keaton gives a sincere performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Before the film was made, people didn't want "Mr. Mom" playing Batman. Jack Nicholson steals the show as The Joker. Kim Basinger is quite good as Vicky Vale, the film's heroine. Although, she does a lot of screaming! The late Michael Gough gives a sincere performance as Alfred, Batman's butler. Pat Hingle is quite good as Commissioner Gordon. Prince wrote some songs for Batman. Tracey Walter is good as Bob, The Joker's lackey. Bob had his own Batman action figure!<br /> In Batman(1989), Batman/Bruce Wayne must stop The Joker from killing off Gotham City's citizens with chemical weapons. Batman and The Joker are also smitten with Vicky Vale. Danny Elfman's Batman music score is excellent and it's aged better than the songs in the movie. Billy Dee Williams is quite good as Harvey Dent. Too bad he didn't get a chance to play Dent in Batman Forever(1995). As Siskel and Ebert pointed out, there's a sense of dread running through Batman(1989). In Batman(1989), Gotham City is covered in grime and filth. In Batman Forever(1995), Gotham City has a bright, neon-colored, Las Vegas look!<br />There were not one, but two video games based on Batman(1989). There was Batman: Return of the Joker on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Batman(1989) still is awesome!</p></br><a href="../users/AYSIGFYKISNHB.html">AYSIGFYKISNHB</a><br/><p>Even though Batman Begins is the best Batman film yet, Batman {1989} is still a great film and a masterpiece.

In fact, everytime I watch this film and see his performance as The Joker, I just get excited. Even though Christian Bale took the title from Michael Keaton as the best Batman/Bruce Wayne, Keaton still is a excellent Batman.<br /><br />I love the new features in this DVD, like Shadow Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight 1-3, Batman: The Complete Robin Storyboards Sequence, Legends Of The Dark Knight: The History Of Batman and more.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Batman {1989}, get this DVD. Also, get Batman Returns.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>Actually, 4 1/2 stars would be more accurate. For those of you who follow my reviews, you know that I like most things that have to do with Batman. As a child, I really liked the Adam West episodes. Sadly, Adam West's wonderful series was cancelled after only 3 seasons. Well, 20 years later, Tim Burton would ressurect Batman. Obvioulsy, it wasn't the 60s anymore. It was the 80s. And Tim Burton did a really great job of bringing back some of the original foundation, but at the same time bringing enough of his own dark and gothic signatures into the picture to allow Batman to transcend into the 80s. Well, all of that said, Michael Keaton did a great job of respecting Adam West's patterns, but at the same time not copying him. Keaton does in fact capture the essence of the loose and easy going Bruce Wayne and the dark, serious, and very sad Batman. Gough is excellent as the ever loyal Alfred. While Gough does remain faithful to the role, he does add a side of Alfred where he says things now and then that Bruce Wayne//Batman may not want to hear. Jack Nicholson did a very good job of taking the baton from Cesar Romero and bringing the Joker into the 80s. And I certainly did not mind the new element that the Joker was a loyal second in command to a crime boss, who was double crossed, but somehow came out of it alive and flipped the tables. Nicholson also made sure we realized that while the elements of psychosis were brewing before the double cross, they did not come into play until AFTER the double cross. Bassinger is fine as the lady in Bruce Wayne // Batman's life who carries some intelligence, purpose, and dignity. Alexander Knox is fine as the character who in doing his job crosses the path of Bruce Wayne // Batman. Finally, the scenery, musical tracks, suspense, and acting are all top notch. My only real complaint (and why I am deducting a half star) is that the final fight between Batman and Joker lacks a climactic edge. (I would like to say look at the fight between Patrick Swayzee and Jimmy in "RoadHouse"), but I'll keep it closer to home. Look at the confrontation in the episode "Joker Is Wild." Cesar Romero's Joker made his own utility belt, and there was a brutal nearly even fight between him and Batman in the end. In an animated episode, Kevin Conroy's Batman, and Mark Hamil's Joker had a brutal fight on a roller coaster, and after some wrestling,the Joker had Batman pinned down. Batman got in a lucky kick, and the Joker fell screaming. But that said, we must thank Tim Burton not only for bringing the character of Batman back from the 60s, but paving the way for the excellent animated series that were to follow. If you like this movie, be sure to see Part 2 "Batman Returns."</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>the first batman was the big blockbuster of the 1980s and has beome a big comic caper to this day. any way the film takes place in Gotham city, over runned in thiefs, criminals, and well crime. the protecter of this city is batman of course and he stops the bad guys. then the city faces a new threat the one and only best batman villian the joker. rising from the acid vats of gotham, he bents on making gotham laugh itself to death. the first film was a dark comic movie but very entertaing extravaganze. see the film that ended the 1980s with a bang</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>I'm still not sure how to spell &quot;omelette.&quot; I think it's one of those stupid words with more than one spelling that's acceptable, but in any case, it all means the same thing. The English language is a confusing one, indeed. Why did I want to become a writer? I don't know, but I still do... I do it well for someone with limited understanding of exactly where the people who invented this language were coming from, I guess. Oh well, to the point... As is the usual with movies by the visionary Tim Burton, &quot;Batman&quot; just reeks of visual style, amazing set design, a great villainous performance, and at the center of it all, a terrific hero. This is the best comic book adaptation ever made, followed closely by its immediate predecessor, &quot;Batman Returns,&quot; &quot;X-Men,&quot; and &quot;The Crow.&quot; I'm really looking forward to what Sam Raimi is going to do with &quot;Spider-Man.&quot; Whatever happens, it'll be good, `cause that's just my pal Sam, but I doubt if it'll live up to the level the bar for comic book films has been set to, after a masterpiece like &quot;Batman.&quot;<p>Everyone knows the story of &quot;Batman.&quot; Billionaire golden boy Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered when he was just a kid, and he was there to witness their demise. In his grief, he vowed to dedicate a part of the fortune he was left, and the empire he took over, to establishing himself as a figure that would strike fear into the hearts of any person who even considered donning a ski-mask and going for an unexpected withdrawal from the bank. He became Batman, the dark figure that looms in the shadows of every murderer's consciousness, ever-threatening their life as a free person. As was expected by virtually every fan of the comic book series, Batman's first veray onto the big screen (discounting the over-acted Adam West version) was going to be against the Joker, and who could possibly play the Joker better than Jack Nicholson? Jack (an 11-time Oscar nominee) embodies the Joker in everyway, and his resulting performance behind the white make-up and red lipstick is astonishing. Michael Keaton was an unlikely choice to play Batman when the film was thought of being made, but oh my God, does he do the role justice! He is amazing behind the cape and cowl. He is Batman! How could Val Kilmer or George Clooney live up to such a dynamically portrayed Batman after Keaton left? Exactly, they couldn't! But the real star of the movie is its director, Tim Burton. His direction of his visual effects and set design is what makes this movie into the dark, atmospheric thriller that it is. The very close second is, of course, the maniacal Joker performance from Nicholson, who is given so many one-liners from the screenwriters that they must've taken half-hour breaks to stop laughing, thinking up this stuff. Their work is hard-fought for and well-done. I love this movie! And remember these words of wisdom: &quot;Never rub another man's rhubarb.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>I'll be the first to admit that Tim Burton's original "Batman" has never been my cup of tea. Even before Christian Bale emerged on the scene in the excellent "Batman Begins" I just never quite thrilled with the 1989 picture. For me, despite an excellent performance, the problem lay with Jack Nicholson's villain who was more comical clown that a truly sinister enemy of the people of Gotham. Burton's style also seemed conflicted over precisely what he was hoping to accomplish seemingly stuck between a cheesy 1980s action comedy and a dark and brooding social commentary.<br /><br />Still, for all its faults "Batman" is a seminal film of American cinema, for it ushered in a genre that had only seriously been tapped by the Superman franchise at that time - the Superhero movie. Modern audiences no doubt do not recall a time when the Superhero movie was a relative oddity. Today's summer blockbusters are swamped with them. Burton's movie then deserves our respect.<br /><br />I will not relate the plot here for I dare say most are familiar with it. But rather examine the 2-disc Blu-ray Digibook release. It is safe to say with the release of this high definition Blu-ray release that you can start using those low definition DVDs as coffee coasters, because once you have been wowed by these Blu-rays you will never want to suffer through subpar DVD transfers ever again.<br /><br />The video quality is a revelation, with a rich and colorful palette, more detail and a depth that has never been apparent on any previous release. The audio is also nicely done and far superior to anything DVD has ever provided.<br /><br />I would advise all fans of the movie to pick up the Digibook release. Housed in a book containing 50 pages of photographs, script excerpts, and comic art this Blu-ray release contains a bumper list of special features a 72 minute documentary, an enthusiastic Tim Burton commentary, and (most interesting for me) a 41 minute exploration of the history of Batman. The special features are: Legends of the Dark Knight: The History of Batman (SD, 41 minutes); Shadows of the Bat (SD, 72 minutes); Beyond Batman (SD, 51 minutes); The Heroes and the Villains (SD, 20 minutes); Storyboard Sequence (SD, 4 minutes); On the Set with Bob Kane (SD, 3 minutes); Music Videos (SD, 14 minutes); Theatrical Trailer (SD 2 minutes) and the aforementioned Burton commentary.<br /><br />With the significant improvement in quality and the housing of the discs in an attractive Digibook, only a fool or the technology challenged would ever settle for the DVD release. This Blu-ray release is definitely the way to go.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>If you were around in summer 1989 then you'll remember that Bat-fever was EV-ER-Y-WHERE! You couldn't look anywhere without seeing the Bat Logo in some incarnation. The film was a mega-hit. People were queueing up around the block for hours (the literal meaning of a blockbuster).<br /><br />The marketing team at Warner had to saturate the minds of the public with the big-screen coming of the Dark Knight. Up until this point the Batman series from the 1960s is how people regarded the Batman character and universe. Tim Burton corrected all that by giving us a dark, sinister and Gothic world with rich production design and a great score by Danny Elfman (who has made a career out of recycling the same old generic cues in nearly every movie he has scored). The original material is respected (to a degree), and the characters are deep instead of just campy.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is the best Bruce Wayne in my opinion. When he plays both Bruce Wayne and Batman you have to watch what he doesn't say and doesn't do. He's a rich, socio-phobic megalomaniac who has more money than sense. This is very different from Adam West's turtleneck playboy.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is a great Joker too, not quite as intimidating or as iconic as Heath Ledger's take on the character, but still a role that has defined his career in a way. Nicholson's Joker isn't much more than an attention-seeking lunatic. But it's still nothing like Caesar Romero's campy, hopping-skipping-and-jumping villain.<br /><br />Anton Furst's Oscar-winning design of Gotham City is very original and unique, and is very much in the style of the Comic book. The smoke-blackened, cramped and claustrophobic 1920s buildings look and create a very oppressive atmosphere. This is definitely GOTHam City. Not LA like the TV series.<br /><br />They didn't even make any attempt with that show did they? In fact the Batcave in the TV series was like the set of a mad scientists lab from a 1950s movie. But the REAL Batcave in this movie is a monstrous cavern filled with stalagmites and it actually HAS bats in it. And there's no fireman's pole leading into it.<br /><br />With Christopher Nolan's reboot of the franchise currently the only Batman worth considering for most fans, it'd be a shame if you were to let this go ignored. It may not be as mature as Nolan's work but it has an edge that no other recent comic-book movie has.<br /><br />It's NOT an origin story. There's no 60 precious minutes on a build-up, it just goes straight to the action. Why can't more comic-book movies do this?</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>Keaton and Nicholson made this one a keeper. Michael Keaton<br /><br />was perhaps at his publicized peak as an actor. He delivered<br /><br />a good deal performance as Batman. Kim Basinger was<br /><br />also good as Vicki Vale. Jack Nicholson as only Jack can do<br /><br />was on fire and always knows how to be the in your face<br /><br />pyscho villian.<br /><br />Tim Burton's direction was right on, effective, mischevious<br /><br />and alert.

However, it doesn't lend itself well to the plotline or lack  thereof. <p>Two major flaws in the movie are the lack of fight choreography  (yes, I know most fights aren't staged beautifully but this is a cartoon  and I want real fight sequences) which looks even more pathetic after a  decade of the Hong Kong Renaissance and the subscription to the Frank  Miller school of Batman writing. It works in the comics but on screen  Burton isn't quite up to task and he makes it into a silly cartoon that  wants to be dark (or a dark movie that wants to be a silly cartoon) and it  falls short of being gripping or interesting in that 80s comic book  fashion.<p>Overall, a good movie to see once and maybe twice, but probably  not a movie to buy. Still it's better than those awful sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>this film is pretty good.it's better than the other 3.Tim Burton does a good job but he has done way better films with less cash&amp;hype.Jack Nicholson does a good job.Michael Keaton is real chill.Kim Basinger is her  usual dull self.the music overall is hit&amp;miss.</p></br><a href="../users/AT7W1EXT0PF2Y.html">AT7W1EXT0PF2Y</a><br/><p>Seeing as though I was like 8 when this movie came out and I've never really sat down as an intellectual adult and enjoyed this movie, I decided it was about time. After all, directed by Richard Burton, Music by Prince, how can you go wrong? Well it kept my attention and parts of it were enjoyable but mostly it just drove me `batty'. I didn't care for the tepid, lukewarm love story that was sewn into this movie. I find Bill and Hillary's romance more exciting frankly.<br /><br />Next there was Michael Keaton. I don't think he kept his identity as Batman a secret, instead I think it was just that he didn't even realize he was Batman himself. He wanders though this movie in a daze. It's like he didn't realize the camera was rolling and was just killing time until the director yelled "action!" In short this is no different from any other movie he's played in.<br /><br />How did Jack Nicholson fare in this movie? Not bad, although this was the 5th or so film where he played the psycho dad from The Shining. I hear that when he was asked how long he studied for this film his answer was, "as little as possible."<br /><br />This movie also took a lot of liberties assuming we were familiar with the whole Batman world. Therefore nothing is foreshadowed. When he needs to make a quick getaway we're introduced to the bat-grappling hook. When they're driving through the bad part of the neighborhood there's bat-mobile-bat-armor. Meanwhile his love interest ponders on whether he wears bat-boxers or bat-briefs.<br /><br />Still compared with the latest pablum excreted from Hollywood I'd sit back and enjoy Batman anyday.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>jack nicholson set a world record for accepting 89 million bones to play the joker here.i didnt like the fact that the joker got wasted since he was easily the best character in thefilm.also,although i think tim burton is a directing genius,in this film he focused way too much on character development and the beautiful gothic arcitecture of gotham and really had little left for the actual storyline.michael keaton is batman.children will enjoy this one.this is easily the best of the batman onslaught of the 90s.this is a film most anyone will enjoy except people who criticize everything.there is only one really hot babe in this one.her name is vickie.shes one of those stuck up buisness broad by day-raving whore by night types.the only major difference between this movie and the comic book is that the joker is batmans long time arch nemisis not just some fly by night clown who gets wasted in the first episode.jack nicholson played an awesome joker.he deserved an award.people say this movie rocks and THEY ARE RIGHT.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>It's a tough thing growing old!......and this film hasn't grown old gracefully. Tim Burton tried so hard to make the film the fans wanted to see, but the 1966 TV show is still present to a degree in this "not so dark" romp through Gotham City! I do enjoy this film despite it's flaws, but you have to remember at the time this was fairly new territory. I went to see this opening night and it was a grand experience for the most part although I was not completely happy with the film!<br /><br />Keaton who fans and critics scoffed at for being picked to play the caped crusader is actually pretty good and way better than Kilmer or the abysmal Clooney! Jack Nicholson's Joker is a slightly more deranged Caesar Romero, his perfomance is sometimes genius, but ultimately it's not that memorable because of the uneven tone of the film. A tone that switches from dark to camp to Hollywood and back again. If there is one consistent critique that remained the same in the last 20 years, it's that the Prince music is horrible and inappropriate in this film! Making the art gallery scene one of my least favorite parts of the movie!<br /><br />OK enough already, the film is still pretty entertaining earning a 3 1/2 star rating from me and this two disc edition is awesome!

Tim Burton crafts a film with a dark comic book vision which makes this film one of the best superhero films to ever grace the screen. I say comic book vision because the film has that going for it. The way Burton has his characters portrayed are lifted right off from the pages of the comic, and he keeps the feel of the comics intact. Batman is a phenomenal, thrilling experience and I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this film. Aside from the Nolan Batman films, Burton's two Batman films are the best of the franchise, and it's easy to see why. I love the visual aspect of the picture, the dark, gritty and ugly streets of Gotham City is exactly what it should be. Michael Keaton is a terrific choice to play Batman, and of course he is only matched by Christian Bale. Keaton brings a sad quality to the role of Bruce Wayne. The films high points are it's darkly comic situations, which are equally serious as they are darkly humourous. Aside from Michael Keaton, the film boasts a strong cast of actors, including Jack Nicholson as The Joker, Jack Palance as Carl Grissom and Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent. These for me, are the most memorable actors in this film. Batman is a terrific achievement for a superhero film, and it's only recently that this film along with it's sequel has been matched. Tim Burton has crafted a memorable, entertaining superhero film that remains one of the best superhero films ever made.I love this movie! jack nicholson is impeccable as the joker. this movie feels like the dark 80's comics. i am so grateful for this masterpiece. thank you tim burton and jack for getting everything on point. this, batman begins, batman returns, and the darknight are the only worthy batman movies worth watching. sorry joel shumacher, your movies suck! IF YOU LIKE THE JOKER THAN YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>In this Batman film he's taken seriously and you don't get shots of his butt in the Bat costume. Joel Schumacher was obsessed with shots of Batman's butt for some reason lol. The movie is perfectly dark and sometimes comical. It doesn't over-due the campiness like Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.<br /><br />  While the under-rated Michael Keaton gives us a fine Bruce Wayne that's still haunted by the death of his parents. It's also brilliant how their murder is linked to the Joker. The "You Made Me and I made You" stuff between the Joker and Batman is well done.<br /><br />  When you think about it though the script is still thin though. I mean yes the Joker is perfectly evil here but what's his real game plan ? It works that he's really not as happy as his difigurement makes him look. So he wants to disfigure other people as well. But other than that his obsession with Vicky Vale doesn't work that well. What does he want from her ? Disfigure her like he did his ex-girlfriend ? Or just dance with her on the top floor of an abandoned church ? lol.<br /><br />  I always had such a ball watching this movie that I never thought of such things. Jack Nicholson is so good as the Joker that I never thought about how the movie doesn't have a solid plot. He did just play a Jack yet again though even if he looked good in the role and had a great Joker laugh. Heath Ledger did more with the role since he transformed into someone else entirely. You also didn't simply have him fall in chemicals. We don't even know what made him the way he is. He tells 2 stories with both of them different and both of them probably aren't even true. Which is even more ingenious than how Jack became the Joker here.<br /><br />  I do still think that Roger Ebert's review was unfair though. He even picked on it saying that Keaton and Basinger have no chemestry. I think they work fine together but in a Batman film who cares about their romance ? The film still delivers and what really mattered is that Keaton and Nicholson played off of each other great. Besides, Batman Begins may be a good movie but Batman just giving a kid part of his costume bugged me as much as Alfred letting Vicky Vale into the Batcave. Yet, that didn't bug Ebert.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>This is a classic movie that is now presented on a great D.V.D. Tim  Burton really outdid himself with this film. Get the movie on this edition. Also, do not forget the sequel BATMAN: RETURNS and stop there (sorry, I for got to mention you should get the classic BATMAN BEGINS). Batman 3 and 4 suck.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Havingly recently seen Christopher Nolan's spectacular "Batman Begins", I thought it was time to go back and re-visit Tim Burton's "Batman".<br /><br />Tim Burton has long been one of my very favorite directors.  With his taste for dark, humorous, wacky and often weird films, he was the perfect choice to direct "Batman".<br /><br />Michael Keaton plays Bruce Wayne, who - shhh - is actually Batman.  Keaton was an interesting choice for Wayne/Batman, and he gives a great performance.  Jack Nicholson is absolutely wonderful as The Joker - a perfect casting decision.  He also delivers the now-classic line, "You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?"  Kim Basinger is Vicki Vale, the lovely journalist whom both Bruce and The Joker fall in love with.<br /><br />The score is definitely one of the film's highlights.  It's by Burton favorite Danny Elfman, and was one of his earliest scores.  It truly is fantastic - "The Batman Theme" is everything it should be and more.  Elfman's music is flawless.<br /><br />Another terrific aspect of the film is the set design.  The film's sets are magnificent.  They perfectly capture the dark, Gothic city that is Gotham.<br /><br />All the aspects I've mentioned above work along with fine photography and a good script (by Sam Hamm) to make a really great movie.  One of the film's few flaws - though I think it's kind of neat - is the music by Prince.  Prince contributed numerous songs to the soundtrack, and it's the one thing which dates the movie.  I'd highly recommend this movie; die-hard Batman fans may not agree with the slight twisting of the Batman legend, but they should appreciate Tim Burton's interpretation of the tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A157XTSMJH9XA4.html">A157XTSMJH9XA4</a><br/><p>It seems Burton and Keaton had a good time together in 1988 with Beetlejuice and decided to team up a year later with Batman. Good call! Michael Keaton plays The Dark Knight in this deliciously gloomy take on the caped crusader of Gotham City. The film begins right in the middle of Gotham's seemingly hopeless ring of crime as Batman drops in for a butt-kicking session with a couple of crooks. And before long, he faces off with Jack Napier at Axis Chemical. Through a freak accident, Napier falls into a vat of toxic chemicals. He is presumed dead, yet actually escaped through the sewer system. He survived, but not without a price. His skin is bleached chalk-white, his haired dyed green, and his facial nerves severed, creating a permanent ruby-red grin. Batman must now face the man he thought was dead, as Napier (now known as The Joker) unleashes pure chaos throughout Gotham with his deadly Smilex gas. The Joker has lost his mind and wants to destroy Gotham, and especially Batman. Thrown in the mix is Vicky Vale, caught in between Batman and the Joker. So not only must Bruce Wayne save Gotham, but also his new love who is oblivious to his hidden superhero identity.<br /><br />It is absolutely undeniable that Nicholson stole this movie and ran with it. He fit the part so naturally well, managing to throw in his own style for The Joker. Tim Burton certainly noticed this, as he gave about half of the scenes to The Clown Prince Of Crime. But, while Nicholson may be the main reason in my opinion to see "Batman", he's not the only reason. Obviously stretching far from the squeaky clean Adam West era, here we get the darker side of Gotham -- as well as a darker vision of Batman. Burton's visual style, mixed with Elfman's brilliant score, is a formula for a wonderful cinematic treat that everyone should see at least once. And if you're a fan of Batman (or the Joker, heheh), then you'll be watching it until the DVD wears out. Five Stars, Two Thumbs Up, and one big maniacal last-laugh for Batman!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Like many folks, I am revisiting the old "Batman" series after viewing "Batman Begins". "Batman" is definitely one of Tim Burton's best films and a great take on the DC Comics "Batman" series.<br /><br />Michael Keaton in many ways is much more believable as taciturn and brooding Bruce Wayne than Batman.  Jack Nicholson (The Joker) more often than not steals the show as well as wreaking no end of havoc on Gotham City.  He's got the best lines and Nicholson is very hard to play against---good man or bad.<br /><br />The effects are still good and the action still keeps you glued to your seat, but the soundtrack doesn't fare so well.  Prince may have had many of us rocking in the 80s, but he's just not as worthy of the title classic as other artists.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>&quot;Batman&quot; stands as an example of how to make a good comic book film.  Above all, the film is just oozing with atmosphere, and &quot;Batman&quot;'s look is undoubtedly its #1 strength.  However, it also has some thrilling action sequences, a terrific villain (perhaps too good- see below), and, most importantly, a good man in the Batman suit.<p>The film belongs to Jack Nicholson- he is probably the real main character of this movie.  He makes the Joker both a funny and menacing character, and he gets all of the best lines.  This was a role Nicholson was born to play, and he enjoys it with relish.<p>Michael Keaton was the best Batman, in my opinion.  OK, so he is a little short, but no one else played the Bruce Wayne part better than he did.  He makes this a Batman to root for.  If only we saw more of him...<p>Which brings me to the film's main flaw- this is the Joker's film the entire way, not Batman's.  Why the filmakers decided to do this I don't completely understand, but it takes away something from the film.  We never really get to bond with the superhero in this one (this was somewhat remedied in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;).  Also, Kim Basinger's character is mainly eye candy and pales in comparison to future Batman girlfriends.<p>Nevertheless, I really do like this film, and I get caught up in its atmosphere every time I watch it- it still looks good 14 years later (although some of the Gotham backgrounds were obviously paintings).  This is largely thanks to director Tim Burton, who mostly understood how to handle Batman and his universe- he was the best man for this job.  He gets help from a great score by Danny Elfman and terrific designs by designer Anton Furst.<p>I would recommend this to all comic book fans, as it stands as an example of both a great comic book transition and of good filmaking in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>This version of Batman is all about Tim Burton's vision of Batman as the dark knight, and agreeably the noir lends itself to better explain the legend.<br /><br />On the feature disc, Kim Basinger is shown commenting that her addition to the film is the only bright spot in Batman's life. Well okay Kim, but Sean Young, who was originally cast in the role would have definitely added to the darkness and further enhanced the depth of the noir legend. Unfortunately, Sean Young was thrown from a horse and unable to continue in the role. A great loss!<br /><br />The added features greatly add to the viewers enjoyment of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie might seem campy compared to the reboot done in the 2000's, but I honestly like this film better. Jack Nicholson does a great job as the Joker, and this movie's camp quality is actually enjoyable, it has more of the comic-book feel which really worked since... well, Batman DID come from a comic book! Overall everyone did a really nice job in this film, and it was the beginning of a solid series (well, at least the first two movies in this series were really great)</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>Probably everyone knows the story of Tim Burton's mental breakdown during and after the filming of BATMAN. For those who don't: Burton was a modest, small-fry director and Warner Brothers approaches him with what was to be the biggest action-superhero movie of all time. Remember the year. Burton didn't know if he was doing the right thing half the time, yet look at the result!<br /><br />Sure, the dialogue is stupidly performed. So what? Half of Cary Grant's films are like that. The storyline is solid, the look is all Frank Miller, although Bob Kane was directly hands-on with this film, and he did not like Miller at all. Not a shock: Kane invented the Miller style, only to be told it was too much for readers back then. So make no mistake: Burton married his nightmares to Kane's genius vision.<br /><br />I want to make an aside about the soundtrack, composed and much performed by Danny Elfman (when it wasn't the big orchestra). I never get to write a thing about Elfman, and I'm a HUGE fan since his Mystic Knights of the Oingo-Boingo days. What a tour-de-force he achieved here. He'd never hit this level again, though he's still second only to John Williams.<br /><br />Choosing Nicholson as the Joker was probably a bad move, but that is what Burton wanted. In a way, he fits really well. Compare him to Heath Ledger and decide. The biggest whack on the chin was selecting Michael Keaton to play the Dark Knight. Burton got death threats for that. In his own words, he did not want a "square-jawed, Arnold Schwarzenegger-type."<br /><br />One star was lost because I hate Kim Basinger. She can't act. Sorry.<br /><br />Other than this movie being in so many ways far ahead of its time, I think the casting of Keaton deserves additional comment. For those who were not there on premiere day, as I was, there were people in the theater dressed in Batman costumes. This was due to Keaton. His performance was hailed by all critics, even though part of the public hated the choice. Everyone was saying, "MR. MOM as Batman?!"<br /><br />What is unfair is that Keaton set the standard for the portrayal of Batman and Bruce Wayne. He's been copied faithfully ever since he did this, and Keaton himself seems to have lost his entire career after walking away from the 2nd sequel. Today we tend to forget him and his work here.<br /><br />I recall talking with my martial arts colleagues about it. We said, well, we know masters and great fighters who are puny-looking and weak-chinned, just like Keaton. We knew Keaton had tremendous potential: indeed, the Batman performances post-Keaton are pale imitations of him. Burton selected Keaton because of his mad eyes and expressive brow--someone to square off against the equally mad Nicholson. And it worked. Try to imagine someone else doing that...oh, wait, let's see, Val Kilmer did it, George Clooney (who played Batman as gay), Christian Bale and I am waiting to see if they break out some pimply-faced 16-year-old for the next installment.<br /><br />CRAP ALARM!!--no one holds a candle to this golden original, and there's no one like Keaton to play Batman. I've heard rumors for years that Keaton will play him again, but I think those rumors were about the Bale film and not about Keaton. Still, I wonder if he'd do it again, just to make us all happy again. BATMAN made me happy. I loved that a good guy, albeit it a billionaire, was doing truly good things. I loved that he dressed up just to scare the pants of the criminals. I like the fact that he saved rather than killed them, as Kane originally had him doing in the first comic adventure.<br /><br />I love that Burton and not some other screw-head directed this, and I love Elfman's rousing score (the overture has been compared to Beethoven, so listen up for it). And I love that the 1980s went out with this summer blockbusting BANG!!<br /><br />For all that, this is not only one of my favorite Deeply Personals, it is a ground-breaking film that has, as you all readily know, absolutely NO peer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YCG57S65QXUU.html">A2YCG57S65QXUU</a><br/><p>The 1989 Tim Burton-directed version of the classic DC Comics superhero is as exciting and thrilling as well as dark, brooding and disturbing. Jack Nicholson has done a great job as the Joker(whose real name is not Jack Napier), and Michael Keaton is at his best as The Batman. The music score by Danny Elfman and the songs by Prince were the best components of the movie. The DVD also features a background story of how the film came to be. This will go down as one of the greatest DC Comics movies ever made.</p></br></body></html>

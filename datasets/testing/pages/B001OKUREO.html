Part of filmmaking, in my opinion, a necessary part of every film, is to, in some way; entertain the people watching the film. Many films also educate, inform, incite, but entertainment needs to be a part of the equation of any successful film. Too often, Stone is so intent on getting his message across, he begins to beat the viewer over the head with these ideas. Subtlety is lost. When the film becomes a lecture, it is no longer entertaining. So I often avoid Stone's films or catch them on DVD.<br /><br />But I should also say I am a very liberal Democrat, which is why I went to see "W". The liberal Democrat in me was stronger than my distaste for Stone's films.<br /><br />But "W" is not a good film. Apparently, Stone was so intent on getting the film into theaters before the election, he fast-tracked the project, rushing every aspect of production.  And it quite frankly shows on the screen. When I exited the theater after the screening, my companion and I both agreed the film was on a par with a television movie. Something you might see on Lifetime Television.<br /><br />Why was Stone so intent on getting the film into theaters before the election? What effect did he hope it would have? Bush isn't up for reelection. I don't get it.<br /><br />But to have any kind of power, the film has to show us something new. Something we didn't already know. Something the average viewer couldn't have already gleamed from a mixture of skits on "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" or "Saturday Night Live" or through various exposes in magazines like "Vanity Fair".<br /><br />And "W" doesn't tell us anything new. The "big" revelation the film seems intent on beating us over the head with is little more interesting than your average TV movie. "W" simply dies on screen. Which is a shame. Because as much as I dislike Stone's films, I dislike the work of our current president even more and would have loved to see a truly great, insightful look at everything that went wrong with his presidency.<br /><br />A far better expose of the 43rd President continues to lie in Michael Moore's film "Fahrenheit 9/11". Check that out instead. Moore delves into the various political and business connections of the Bush family and their political co-horts, connecting the dots for us to see.<br /><br />That said, there is one reason to watch "W", maybe when it appears on DVD or cable (Lifetime?). And that one reason is Josh Brolin's portrayal of Bush 43. From the moment Brolin appears on screen, he seems to be channeling something deep, very deep, to make this character interesting and multi-faceted. Perhaps more interesting and multi-faceted than he has a right to be based on the writing and directing.<br /><br />We initially meet W as he leads a meeting of his senior staff at the White House, trying to come up with the "Axis of Evil" speech. Then, through a series of flashbacks, we see a few moments in W's early life; presumably to give us an idea of what led to this man becoming President. He gets hazed at Yale, he gets bailed out of jail by 'Poppy' (James Cromwell) and he quickly gives up on a job on an oil rig. Poppy, who is running for the Senate, doesn't know what to do with the boy, especially since Jeb is going to graduate with honors. And you get a clue about Stone's theory about how W became the President. It's a weak theory, especially as portrayed in the film, which is part of the significant problem with "W". The flashbacks seem particularly rushed, even unfocused. Is Stone's theory about this man really that superficial?<br /><br />Then one fateful night, Poppy asks W to run his campaign for President. Bush 43 comes up with the Willie Horton ad against Michael Dukakis. And the rest is history.<br /><br />Brolin does a good job of portraying Bush and often walks a fine line, tottering between caricature and an actual attempt at creating a meaningful performance. There are moments when Bush seems in charge and other moments when he seems like a fool, ripe for leading by Karl Rove (Toby Jones) and Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss). It is an interesting, intelligent performance for a man I don't think necessarily deserves such treatment.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is much more problematic. Thandie Newton ("Mission: Impossible 2", "Beloved"), who plays Condoleezza Rice is probably the most successful at recreating the actual person, copying her speech pattern and mannerisms. But the performance lacks any bite or insight into who Rice is. The portrayal makes her seem far too inconsequential and powerless. Richard Dreyfuss manages to grit his teeth once or twice, ala Jon Stewart's impression of Cheney as The Penguin, but that's about it. The performance also lacks any bite or insight. Jeffrey Wright plays Colin Powell. Stone seems especially kind to Powell, giving his character the benefit of hindsight. In virtually every one of his scenes, Wright plays Powell as repentant or against the rest of the group. A brief, very brief scene shows Powell going along with Bush 41 and Cheney during the first Gulf War. As we all know, hindsight is 20/20 and Powell shouldn't be let off so easily simply because he now regrets his decisions. Donald Rumsfeld, on the other hand, is clearly despised by Stone. Scott Glenn's portrayal only serves to make the former Secretary of Defense seem like a complete idiot. At one point, while everyone else is contemplating the consequences of their actions, Stone focuses on Rumsfeld stuffing his face with a huge fork of pie, the Secretary seemingly oblivious to anything but the sweet dessert.<br /><br />Elizabeth Banks plays Laura Bush and seems suitably supportive throughout. Moments of disagreement and/ or criticism seem to have been few and far between in this Bush household. She merely frowns when W proves he has a drinking problem (one or two many times I might add). She merely frowns when W accepts a job from his father to lead his campaign for President, ensuring they will have to relocate to Washington. She frowns a lot, but doesn't look or act like the real Laura Bush.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is even more problematic. She has the emblematic white hair of Barbara Bush, but has very few scenes and only pops up occasionally to show how strong willed she is. I think there was an attempt to paint her as rather crude; she is seen swearing in a few scenes, but this doesn't really come across that well.<br /><br />James Cromwell is the most successful member of the supporting cast. As Poppy Bush, he manages to convey Bush 41's unique and distinctive speech patterns on a few occasions. And he conveys 41's broken heart when he loses his re-election bid. It is an interesting performance and perhaps the most completely realized characterization after the work of Brolin.<br /><br />But there is an attempt to portray their bond as a mythic father-son relationship and this aspect of the story is not successful. There are more than a few references to W trying to do things to please his father, seeking his dad's approval. But he never receives it. Which is apparently what drove W to become President. Yawn. What drove him to invade Iraq? To finish the job his dad started and in the process making Poppy proud. Yawn.<br /><br />This argument may be true, but it is so clich&eacute;d and 'been there, done that' over and over again that we can't really care if this is the reason W is what he is. To make this really powerful, we would probably have to see Bush 41 do something completely egregious or sickening, something to make him seem mean, powerful or Machiavellian. None of this happens. He simply disapproves. And he has a lot to disapprove of. But it doesn't make this aspect of their relationship a powerful thing to watch.<br /><br />"W" is also a poorly conceived film. Opening with a meeting in the Oval Office to work out the details of the Axis of Evil speech, the narrative shuttles back to W's college days and moves back and forth quickly. Generally, when a film begins to incorporate flashbacks, they are provided to help illustrate something happening in the current day. The flashbacks in "W" attempt to show us some of Bush's early activities (he basically got drunk a lot, which led to him becoming a Born Again Christian). But what created the idea of an "Axis of Evil"? In one scene, we see W say he is going to go after Sadam because he tried to 'kill my daddy'. And we see Bush 41 say why he calls Sadam Sah-dam. But these moments just don't connect. Or provide enough of an impetus for Bush 43's actions or motivations<br /><br />Because of the subject matter, I wish Stone had spent some more time fine tuning the screenplay before filming. And I wish he had spent some more time in the editing room, constructing a well-made, cohesive making a cohesive argument about why W is the way he is. Instead, because he rushed to get the film into multiplexes before the election, we have the equivalent of a television movie.<br /><br />A basic cable television movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Ignore whatever facts may or may not exist (consider them Iraqi WMD's, if you will).  Ignore Stone's political agenda (which, let's face it, most of his viewers usually do).  Judge "W." as a movie, as a work of art.  Yes, anything about George W. Bush is bound to be controversial, to bring out liberals who praise it and conservatives who damn it.  Forget politics; look at the film as a MOVIE, which, all politics aside, it is.<br /><br />That being said, "W." doesn't quite stand up.  Oliver Stone has occasionally--though rarely--miss-fired, and "W." is unfortunately such a case.  What's worse, the film's failures are due to Stone's personal political agenda; he rushed the film out before the November 2008 elections (what for, we can't help but wonder; Bush was out no matter what), and in doing so sacrificed some artistic integrity.  The movie's first half is little more than a collection of scenes; good scenes, yes, but they don't really congeal into one whole piece.  The last half is certainly the better, as Bush begins to face his inner and outer demons, and America goes into a war nobody's really sure if they want or not<br /><br />The acting is certainly the film's strength.  Elizabeth Banks brings charisma to the role of Laura Bush; Richard Dreyfuss, as Chaney, is superb; Jeffrey Wright, as Colin Powell, is a scene-stealer; James Cromwell, as Bush Sr., is charismatic and graceful as always.  But, of course, the true star here is Josh Brolin, who tackles the title role.  It is a role that few actors could pull off; however, Brolin's dedication to character is remarkable.  He looks the part and sounds the part, but it is more than that; he finds the strengths and weaknesses of George W. Bush, the privileges and the drawbacks to being the President of the United States.  In other words, as always, Brolin is simply remarkable.<br /><br />So, whatever politics you have (or don't have), you should judge "W." as a film, not a political piece.  Unfortunately, it suffers from the director's ambition to send a political message; perhaps the worst thing is, the film fails in that regard, even--it's not so much too little too late as it is simply needless.  Fortunately, the movie is rooted by strong performances all around, but especially from Josh Brolin, who is shaping up to be one of Hollywood's next great actors.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's latest film, W. is one that will, not surprisingly, attract a lot of controversy. How you feel about it will likely depend on your political views. Me, well, I'm a total flaming liberal, and I found the movie... enjoyable. Great, but not perfect.<br /><br />The movie might as well be called "George W Lives in His Daddy's Shadow", since most of the movie centers around the feelings of inadequacy that young W feels. We see him going through hazing at his fraternity, running for office in Texas (and having the Democratic candidate to him what he would go on to do to others so very well), and eventually see him getting to the White House.<br /><br />One at the White House much of the story centers around the lead up to the Iraq War. We get glimpses back to the early 1990's showing why the first President Bush didn't go all the way to Baghdad, we see George Tennant (played by the wonderful Bruce McGill, who could also play a dandy Bill Richardson), trying to explain, repeatedly, that there's no evidence of nukes in Iraq, and we see Cheney's master plan for the USA to control as much of the world's oil as we can.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is really excellent as W. He doesn't have the look, but rather like Anthony Hopkins in one of Oliver Stone's other, better films, Nixon, he does capture the body language and the voice of Bush 43. Other notable performances are Jeffery Wright as Colin Powell, Richard Dreyfus as Dick Cheney and, in one of his better performances, James Cromwell as Bush 41.<br /><br />The movie lags at parts and frankly I would've liked to have seen more about Bush as President than Bush as booze-hound or Bush as born again Christian. Still and all, it was a decent enough film and worth seeing, if for no other reason than my favorite line from the film where Bush Sr tells W something along the lines of, "You can't spend your life drinking, partying and chasing women! You're not a Kennedy, for God's sake!"<br /><br />And he's right. George W Bush is many, many things, but he's certainly no Kennedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>As long as you don't take this as a docu-history, it's pretty entertaining borderline comedy about the unlikely career of George W. Bush, whose presidency looks more and more fantasmagorical in retrospect. Almost every actor here looks virtually just like the real thing, except perhaps the first George HW Bush and his wife, Barbara, and Laura Bush, who looks way better here than in person. Josh Brolin gets W just right, in almost every respect. Those who play Karl Rove, Condi Rice, George Tenet and especially Dick Cheney are spot on. Almost every scene plays out like something from a Bob Woodward book. Oliver Stone is adept at compressing these signature moments into a coherent whole, though the movie is told in a jump around style timewise. If the kids don't take this as historic gospel, it's ok to watch this for a laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The main thing you need to know about W. is that it shows you the life of George W. Bush from a rather funny (and quite often, accurate) point of view.  From his early days when he first met Laura at a party, to his constant disagreements with his father, to the constant comparison to his brother Jeb, to his early campaign trails, to his eventual presidency of the United States.  W. covers this territory pretty well.<br /><br />Now here's how the movie works- while *those* events are taking place, quite often the story will switch in a different direction that shows the events (portrayed by characters, of course) where Cheney, Powell, Condoleezza Rice and the rest of the gang were discussing the best strategies concerning the war in Iraq.<br /><br />All the characters were convincing in their roles, not to mention really *do* resemble their real life counterparts.  Just look at them and try telling me they don't look and act almost exactly like them.<br /><br />What's especially strange about W. is how it shows George Bush as someone who doesn't seem like he has the dedicated desire (or the intelligence level) to eventually become president of the United States.<br /><br />This means Bush comes off looking rather odd because he's portrayed as someone who definitely wants to change the world and someone who is definitely passionate about doing so (and as we know, he does eventually achieve his dream of becoming US president) but the storyline develops in a way that makes it look like *anyone* can accomplish the same incredible goal, which is honestly not true at all.<br /><br />Then again, maybe that's the point.  Maybe the point is that the writers were trying to make Bush appear like an average man from the get go.  That way we can see how flawed he really is.<br /><br />Anyway, the political arguments dealing with the war in Iraq and the oil supply were interesting in the beginning, but because they are portrayed quite accurately, the only thing these scenes really did for me was allow me to remember the past 8 years.  So for me, the strong point of W. were the humorous segments that focused on how George Bush eventually got into office and less on the Iraq war.<br /><br />W. is a good trip down memory lane with a bit of humor thrown in (especially whenever Bush tries to say something intelligently and ends up stuttering and saying something half-witted- this happens a LOT).  It combines the real life situations with a touch of the fictional pretty well... at least, I assume certain parts are fictional.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>I came to Oliver Stones "W" with any number of preconceptions, many of them not helped by an early trailer which made the entire exercise look like a parody of the man and his presidency; and while it's true, the film does contain satirical elements, I didn't consider them to be at the man's expense. True, the notorious pretzel incident is re-enacted; yes, we are treated to the sight of a tipsy Bush dancing on a bar and, yes, the wilderness years of his youth are examined in no small amount of detail. But this film, which simultaneously explores Bush's ascendancy from Yale pledge to CIC and the machinations of his administration during the run-up to the Iraq war, is a hypnotically fascinating, even-handed and highly intelligent piece of film-making which is far more than just a satirical biopic.<br /><br />Oliver Stone has always been a film-maker I can take or leave. At his best, he can be an incisive explorer of cultural zeitgeist, at his worst he is little better than an exploitation film-maker; his output over the last couple of years has veered wildly between these two polarities, but with "Bush" he really has hit a home-run. There is no doubt in my mind that this is probably due to Stanley Weiser's excellent script and Josh Brolin's astonishing turn as the man himself (and if Brolin doesn't get an Oscar for this, it will only be due to the academy's cowardice). Stone has always been a film-maker who uses broad mythic sweeps in order to reveal a greater personal truth about his subject matter, and, once again, he doesn't resist that tendency here. Brolin's Bush begins his life as a man struggling with both the expectations impressed upon him by his birth into a dynastic political legacy and the passive disapproval of his father; the story then is essentially a tale of the son attempting to seek the approval of (and then usurp) the father's authority. But if this sounds like a deeply simplistic rendering of the complexities of a modern American figure, let me assure you that this is only the spine of a story on which Stone hangs the flesh of a sympathetic and even-handed treatment of the man.<br /><br />Stone's examinations of the conflicts, resentments and motivations within the Bush cabinet are as fascinating as his portrait of the man himself. Those who ascribe to the theory that the entire Bush presidency was in fact a case of "the tail wagging the dog" will no doubt appreciate Richard Dreyfuss' brilliantly subtle turn as a vaguely Machiavellian Dick Cheney (referred to throughout the film as "Vice") but the film stops significantly short of painting him outright as the sinister puppet-master pulling all of the strings; and while possibly the film's best scene -  in which, during the course of a situation meeting,  Jeffrey Wright's superbly gruff Colin Powell questions the motivations of invading Iraq only to have Dreyfuss' Cheney illustrate them in unflinchingly certain terms -  is undoubtedly mythologizing, but one finds it virtually impossible to deny, given the well-documented differences in both ideology and policy that existed between Powell and Cheney, that discussions and disagreements of this nature undoubtedly took place.<br /><br />There are no villains in "W"; merely people attempting to make the best decisions that they can with the information that they have (or more significantly, haven't) got at the time. The film doesn't excuse or condone the actions of the Bush administration in regard to declaring a probably illegal war on a Iraq on the pretext of it's possession of nebulous WMDs, but it does give you an insight into the thinking behind those decisions.<br /><br />"W" ends on a brilliantly ambiguous final shot which is a superbly sympathetic and utterly fitting metaphor for Bush as a man, a president, and, most poignantly, a misguided architect of a war declared on a spurious pretext which still grinds inexorably on to this day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This film is a mixture of political commentary and character analysis, making it far more interesting that I expected. However, as character study and as political commentary it only goes so deep before turning back, as if the Oliver Stone doesn't totally trust the viewing public with all the details. The film actually paints a sympathetic picture of President George W Bush. This is due to the tension depicted between the cool Episcopalian statesman George Bush and his born-again evangelical son, George W Bush. In some regards, George W Bush follows the policies and ideology of Ronald Reagan rather then the realist approach of his father. The issue of the President's alcoholism was handled very well as we see the President move beyond his alcoholism through his religious faith and the support of his pastor, played by Stacey Keach. There were four events that are missing from the film that are highly significant and I certainly would have been willing to watch 1 more hour of film to see how Stone would interpret the events around the Gore vs. Bush 2000 election struggles in Florida, the response to September 11th, Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, and the Joe Wilson - Valerie Plame incident that revealed so much about the power of the Vice President in framing the war effort with Iraq. However since the film is not really meant to be comprehensive history, and only comments on policy indirectly, it is the character of George W Bush that is the true subject of the film.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is excellent as George W Bush as is Richard Dreyfuss in the role of Vice President Dick Cheney. George and Barbara Bush are played by James Cromwell and Ellen Burstyn. They do an excellent job of creating the family of origin tensions that drive much of George W Bush's motivations and actions, at least in this interpretation. Elizabeth Banks plays Laura Bush, the most likeable character in the film. Her support for her husband and faith that he will eventually muddle through appears to be one of his greatest assets. I wish the role of Dick Cheney had been larger since we now know the pivotal role in played in the decision to invade Iraq and the growing distance between the President and Vice President during the last 18 months of his second term when President Bush distanced himself from Cheney, the architect of many of the failures of the Bush Presidency. Jeffrey Wright plays the reflective far-seeing Secretary of State, Colin Powell, who must constantly defend his position against Cheney, Rove, and Rumsfeld. Toby Jones plays Karl Rove and is not given as much emphasis as I would have expected. As far as I can tell, Karen Hughes was completely left out of the film. I was not as impressed with the performance of Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice. She seemed stiff and insignificant.<br />The film does a very good job of revealing how the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction destroyed the credibility of the Bush presidency. At some point George W Bush recognizes that he will go down in history as one of the greatest Presidential failures for taking the United States into a war on false fabricated evidence. The film had to show that President George W Bush was a man who rarely reflected upon his own performance as evidenced by the press conference where he is asked if he made any mistakes in his Presidency, and he responds that he can't think of one. In a presidency that was full of mistakes, this is one of the most fascinating aspects of the film and of the character of George W Bush.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>and you often do not know how much left-inspired claptrap is going to be put into them, and how much factual stuff that few directors could sneak in as well as he does. I am a moderate Democrat, now living in the Bush clan's old hometown, so my vote will never count for anything again, since my county and city are among the heaviest Republican enclaves in the nation. I did not vote for W, either time, but I thought he handled the initial 911 response well, and I gave him the benefit of the doubt on Iraq, until it turned out bad. This film is more interesting for Stone's take on the family dynamics than it is for the Iraq war planning (deceptions, or well-intended honest mistakes?) James Cromwell, as the elder Bush, is wonderful here. Brolin does a fine job in a hard assignment, depicting a person we seem to know so well. It was interesting to see a younger Karl Rove depicted (he just came to town last week promoting his new book.) Love him or hate him, after watching Mr. Stone's very condensed version of his life, you will think you understand George W. a little bit better. Nobody takes the presidential oath intending to hurt the nation, and it's a job that people who are most qualified for it won't go after, because campaigning is demeaning and demoralizing. The Bush family now claims two failed presidents, and I often wonder if W regrets winning a second term. He proved himself more popular than his dad, for a bit of time, but in the end will be rated the less successful leader. This movie reminds us that these famous people once were young, and made lots of ordinary mistakes, before they got the power to make extraordinary errors. You can't help but feeling a bit more compassionate toward the younger Bush when you finish seeing this. That may not have been Oliver's intent, but it's my conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Josh Brolin plays a fascinating George W. Bush and Richard Dreyfus is Dick Cheney.  The movie shows Bush''s life from Yale cheerleader to the 43rd President of the United States.  He leads an amazing life with huge events that he has to face and deal with, sibling and paternal rivalry, his struggle with alcohol, finding faith and his wife, as well as the days leading up to the Iraq War.<br /><br />It is always difficult to distill anyone's entire life into a two and a half hour film, especially a controversial President.<br /><br />The movie starts in 1966 showing George W. Bush at a Yale initiation pledge.  The story of his early life continues showing his drinking problem and wild ways.  In 1977 he announces at a poker party he is running for Congress in Texas, but loses the election.  When he turns 40 Bush becomes a born again Christian, gives up alcohol and becomes closer with his father who asks him to help with his presidential campaign.  He says he will do it but feels slighted that Jeb is running for Governor of Florida.  He felt his father only asked him because he was available to help out.<br /><br />Eventually Bush runs and wins his campaign for Governor of Texas.  After some thought, he feels God wants him to run for President and wins.<br /><br />The director, Oliver Stone, in large part created a fascinating character study and the supporting actors do their jobs well.  W is hard to forget, a "good ole boy" who had a lot handed to him, but also heavy burdens and hard decisions he felt God wanted him alone to have.<br /><br />Overall a fascinating story.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone directed-movies are usually on the kooky side, but this one is not filled with so much archive footage this time.<br />  Oliver Stone was able to get an all-star cast for this film.<br />  Josh Brolin portrays "George W.

He calls his father, George H. W. Bush (James Cromwell) to help him out of jail. Congressman George Bush already has his hands full with Jeb, Neil, Marvin and Doro. "Poppy" will help him this one last time. George must be one honky-tonk, hell-raiser of a young man.<br />  As the movie jumps around to George W. as President of the United States to flashbacks of his young adult life, we see Bush has had it up to here with an oil rig job. An intense, dirty job I am sure he was all too proud to get fired from.<br />  Destiny would prevail.<br />  In 1977, George W. decides he wants to run for Congress in Texas.

What a transformation.<br />  Stacy Keach as "Rev. Earle Hudd" blew me away with his performanace. I have never seen him in such a role before.<br />  Richard Dreyfuss is a scene stealer as well as Jeffrey Wright.<br />  Jeffrey Wright was fun to watch as "Powell".

I'm hoping it's mostly the truth, as to how he went from alchoholic to team player, to 43rd US President.<br />His father-Bush senior, in this film anyway, was always criticizing him into his middle aged years, I had/have a fatherly figure, in the form of my g-pa, so I can understand why he had a hard time loving his dad, although mine was mia half the time.<br />I still don't agree with the 2nd Iraq war, but now I somewhat understand why it had to start, but if they never found WMD but they found Saddam Hussein who is now dead, still looking for Bin Laden, whom at this point, I'm not sure they'll ever find...alive, that is.<br />After he was elected, I was very angry, saying that he stole the election from Gore/Kerry, calling it a fiasco, but now I think I may have been unfairly critical of him. I hope they do a movie on Obama in a few years letting you draw your own conclusions about him, much like this one does, sometimes that works better. However, I'm not sure it's owners material for everyone, regardless of your political views.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>When I first heard about W., my initial reaction was that there was no way it could be a good movie.  Oliver Stone is a good director who has sometimes made great films.  However, when it comes to the Presidential movies he's made, JFK and NIXON, his record is atrocious. It's also a well known fact that Stone is not a fan of President George W. Bush and Stone isn't really known for keeping his politics out of his movies.  I admit that the trailers for the movie piqued my interest, but instead of watching the movie in theatres I waited until the DVD release to watch the movie.  I was very surprised by what I saw.<br /><br />The movie is not told in a linear fashion and instead see-saws back and forth between President Bush's life. It begins in 2002, then flashbacks to 1966, then flashes forward to 2002, then to 1969, then to 2003, etc.  Sometimes such a storytelling device is difficult to follow, but it works well in W.  The movie basically follows George W. Bush as he goes from being a rowdy, drunken college student with a famous father to being a meandering journeyman traveling from one job and profession into another until he eventually feels led to enter politics.  He becomes the governor of Texas and, of course, ultimately the President of the United States.  The portrait that is painted is not one of a man with a hidden agenda and a plan to remake the country and world in his image, but instead of a man blessed with gifts who kept screwing up his life, but finally turned it around and decided he wanted to make the world a better place.  It presents us with a man who truly wanted to do the right thing and believed in what he did.  It's a very human look at our ex-President.<br /><br />That's not to say the movie doesn't make fun of Bush, because there are times that it does.  The movie spends a good deal of time (probably a third all total) showing Bush's drinking problems and womanizing.  There are scenes where the President is talking with one of his staff, particularly Vice President Chaney (Richard Dreyfuss) and it's obvious to the audience that the Vice President is just using Bush to meet his own goals and fulfill his own agenda.  In scenes such as these, the Bush is presented as a bumpkin who is in over his head.  The movie also tries to present the case that everything that George W. Bush did was to earn the approval of his domineering father, George H.W. Bush.  Still, despite the negative aspects the movie shows of his personal history and character, overall the movie presents a complex and interesting view of our 43rd President.<br /><br />Some elements of the film have been dramatically fictionalized, others taken directly (and at times quoted) from history.  Some people might be angered by the mixing of history and fiction, but most great biopics do that.  No matter how famous people are or how interesting lives they lived, for a movie things have to be condensed and sometimes in order to connect loose ends an anecdote or scene has to be made up.<br /><br />In my opinion, the main reason that W. is so compelling is because of the performance of Josh Brolin.  Brolin wasn't Oliver Stone's first choice to play the title character, but it should have been.  Brolin has proved himself time and time again that he is an amazing actor with an incredible amount of range.  His performance as President George W. Bush is flawless.  Ever mannerism, accent, and quirk of Bush are replicated perfectly.  Brolin is matched in his performance by James Cromwell portraying Bush's father George H.W. Bush.  Cromwell's characterization is far from the uncanny performance given by Brolin.  However, he does do an excellent job of illustrating how the movie sees Bush Sr. as the foil for W.  The only other noteworthy performance is that of Toby Jones as Karl Rove.  Rove often is presented in a negative light, but just like President George W. Bush, the movie actually paints Rove in a more positive light--instead of an evil mastermind he's just a wunderkid who's really good at number crunching and reading a political landscape.<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss has received all kinds of praise for his portrayal as Dick Cheney, but in my opinion it's horrendous.  Cheney is definitely the villain of the movie and Dreyfuss seemed to have taken an intense amount of glee in portraying a would-be criminal mastermind.  In my opinion the performance is completely over-the-top.  The humanization that Brolin, Jones, and to a lesser extent Cromwell bring to their roles is completely ignored by Cheney.  It's not that Dreyfuss isn't capable of such a feat, because he is, but he just chose not do so.  As for the rest of the cast, all of the other major performances aren't very good and are just characterizations.<br /><br />I really enjoyed W.  It's a much fairer portrait of President George W. Bush than would be expected from Oliver Stone and it's also an entertaining movie.  Sadly, however, those on the political left will probably continue to ignore it because it isn't negative enough while those on the political right will ignore it because they've been led to believe it is too negative.  If you can put aside your political beliefs and watch the movie for what it is, I believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>****1/2<br /><br />When attempting to dramatize well know events from the recent past - especially those involving public figures who are household names and faces - a filmmaker runs the risk of slipping over into caricature and parody if he isn't careful.  This is particularly the case when the subject is someone like George W. Bush, whose twangy folksiness and propensity for verbal gaffes have made him a prime target for mimicry and ridicule on the standup-comedy circuit.  Yet, in "W.," a biopic of the 43rd President, director Oliver Stone and writer Stanley Weiser have largely avoided falling into this trap by providing us with as fully rounded a portrait of the man as one could reasonably expect under the circumstances.  Indeed, those anticipating a slashing satire or a Bush-bashing screed from the left-leaning Stone will be sorely disappointed by what they'll find in this film.  By keeping the cheap shots down to a minimum, the filmmakers allow us to see Bush more as a figure of tragedy than of scorn, a son who could never fully live up to the expectations placed on him by his father and who, as a result, spent his entire life engaged in a kind of Freudian drama of trying to prove himself to the old man.  In W's case, he also had to contend with competition from a younger brother, Jeb, a golden boy who was altogether smarter and more articulate than George, and clearly the apple of their father's eye.<br /><br />The movie starts off in 2002, just as Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, Rice, Rove and Wolfowitz are making plans to "sell" the Iraq war to the American public.  Using this time period as his outer framework, Stone then delves into a series of flashbacks stretching all the way back to 1966 when Bush was a frat-boy spending most of his time partying at Yale.  From then on we see him as a largely rudderless young man, drinking heavily and unable to hold down a steady job, always looking to daddy - then Senator Bush - to bail him out of his scrapes.  When he hits the age of forty, he undergoes a life-altering, "born-again" religious experience that inspires him to give up drinking.  By stages, we see him turning to a career in politics, losing his first election to Congress, but then picking himself up off the floor and becoming a successful contender for Governor of Texas, surrounding himself with savvy political consultants like Karl Rove, who would ultimately help to propel him into the White House (interestingly, the run for the presidency and the voter debacle in Florida are not documented in the film).<br /><br />It's true that the movie doesn't have much "good" to say about Bush - and even less about Cheney who appears as a Mephistophelean figure throughout, the obvious puppet master pulling the strings in their relationship - but Bush is portrayed more as a victim of his upbringing and of circumstances than as an evil or even ill-intentioned person in his own right.  Much of the success of the film lies in the brilliant performance by Josh Brolin in the lead role.  Not only does Brolin have Bush's mannerisms and vocal intonations down pat, but he makes sure that we see the inner workings of the man beneath all the swagger and bluster.  Brolin's thoughtful, sensitive work here helps us to understand how Bush's dogmatic and stubborn nature might actually be the product of his overcompensating for feelings of inadequacy and a poor self-image.  Of course, it is this very dabbling in speculative psychology that is most likely to drive the president's supporters apoplectic with rage while watching this film, but for the rest of us, such an approach actually makes Bush MORE appealing as a person not less so.<br /><br />Beyond Brolin, there is fine work by James Cromwell as "Poppy" Bush, Ellen Burstyn as his mother Barbara, Elizabeth Banks as his wife Laura, and Richard Dreyfuss as the perpetually smarmy Cheney.  There is only one truly awful performance in the film and that is delivered by the normally wonderful Thandie Newton, who turns Condaleeza Rice into a bizarre combination of twisted facial expressions and ear-grating vocal stylings.<br /><br />As director, Stone's use of tightly-knit close-ups and a persistent - but not distracting - handheld camera brings a much needed quality of immediacy to the movie as it hurtles  through the years at a near-lightning pace.<br /><br />The script includes many of Bush's most notorious and fondly ridiculed malapropisms and tongue-tied moments - "Is our children learning?" "Fool me once...you can't get fooled again," "people are always misunderestimating me" - albeit in settings and contexts different from the ones in which they actually occurred.  Critics of the film might view this as yet another example of Stone and Weiser playing fast and loose with the facts, but the goal of "W." is not to provide an etched-in-stone biography of this one specific man but rather a portrait of an individual who engages the audience with his all-too-human frailties and weaknesses.  And at that it succeeds very well.  I can't guarantee how any diehard Bush fan will react to this film, but if you are fair-minded enough to take the plunge, "W." may make you see the man in a somewhat different - perhaps even more favorable - light.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>Considering Oliver Stone's reputation as an unrepentant Bush-loathing liberal, "W.", the director's film about our 44th president, is surprisingly well-balanced and even sympathetic as it portrays the failures of both Bush the man and his administration. The fact that Stone considers the man's reign in the White House a disaster does not mean it lacks objectivity. Except for a few partisan republicans, who can possibly look at the wreckage this man has left behind and not reach the same conclusion?<br /><br />Josh Brolin's performance holds it all together. He may not look much like Bush, but he captures the man perfectly, from his smirk to his swagger, and, of course, his hilariously inept use of the English language. Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney and Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld are also expertly cast. Some of the other players are a little less convincing. James Cromwell is one of my favorite actors, but he's too sincere and likeable for the role of Bush's two-faced father. Thandie Newton, on the other hand, is downright bizarre as Condelezza Rice. She sounds like Lily Tomlin as Ernestine, the loony phone operator ("One ringy-dingy, two ringy-dingy"). But it's nice to see Stacy Keach, sans mustache, as the Reverand Earle Hudd, a composite of several evangelical ministers who supported Bush's presidential ambitions when his own family did not.<br /><br />Okay, so Stone imagines incidents in the life of Bush, the private citizen and the commander-in-chief, but this is drama, not documentary, and even the best documentaries are shaped by their makers to express a point of view. Like Stone's other political films ("J.F.K.," "Nixon"), "W." is the work of a man with more on his mind than box-office success. That alone makes it worthwhile.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_W._ (2008) starring Josh Brolin is yet another of Oliver Stone's films detailing the lives and presidencies of the American presidents.  W. of course is a examination of the presidency of George W. Bush.  It details his life and early career, beginning with his induction into the ultra-secret Skull and Bones society at Yale, his involvement in various jobs and his attempts to run a major league baseball team.  The film shows Dubya as largely constantly under the influence of his father who he constantly tried to escape.  The film also shows Dubya's struggles with alcoholism, drugs, and women and his eventual conversion and rise to power.  The film then shows Dubya's decision to enter Iraq as president under the belief that WMDs were to be found there and the influence in particular of such advisors as Dick Cheney (the Vice President), Karl Rove, and Condeleeza Rice.  The film does show for example that Colin Powell opposed the war initially but went along with it because of pressure from the other advisors.  The film does not show that Bush I opposed the war as well privately.  However, it does show the problematic relationship between Dubya and his father.  The film attempts to show widescale incompetence in the Bush White House and ends by showing a clueless Bush unaware about the lack of WMDs in Iraq.<br /><br />It seems that there are two theories of the Bush presidency.  Some see Dubya as stupid and incompetent while others see him as evil.  This film seems to be a farce showing an incompetent president unable to deal with the situation in Iraq.  The film shows how the events of September 11 were used to propel the U.S. into war with Iraq, which had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  I'm not sure this theory is accurate or that the film is accurate in this respect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Like 1995's "Nixon", "W." is a character study of a disgraced conservative president by the famously leftist Oliver Stone that is fundamentally sympathetic to its subject's emotions but unsympathetic to the President's actions. "W" doesn't have the depth or nuance of "Nixon", however. Written by Stanley Weiser, the film was shot in only 46 days. Stone calls it a "trim-down movie" in which scenes and procedures are simplified and sets less elaborate than they would be in reality. The film takes us through George W. Bush's adult life, starting in 2002 with the President's preparation for his "axis of evil" speech and backtracking to his college days at Yale. It proceeds in this way, alternating between preparations for the Iraq war and Bush's earlier life until the two converge.<br /><br />"W" draws on books written about the 43rd president to present George W. Bush (Josh Brolin) as the black sheep of the Bush family, a man driven to take on more than he can handle by his need to impress his disapproving father (James Cromwell), but constrained by a critical lack of intellect: An amiable imbecile who easily falls prey to less amiable men, like Vice President Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) and Karl Rove (Toby James), who need to put a friendly face on their sweeping agendas. Josh Brolin's performance is adequate, but I felt it relies too much on mannerisms. The supporting cast is generally impressive, but Richard Dreyfuss deserves special mention for his interpretation of Cheney's overbearing self-belief. Although the film clearly sees Bush as incompetent and his inner circle as lunatic, there is a darkly comic undertone to their conversations. It's making fun of these people.<br /><br />The DVD (Lions Gate 2009): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (1 ? min), a documentary by Sean Stone called "Dangerous Dynasty: The Bush Legacy" (17 min) which interviews people about the increasingly authoritarian Bush presidencies. There is a feature commentary by Oliver Stone in which he speaks mostly of George W. Bush's life and what he chose to include in the film, but some about the performances and filming. If you're interested in the film's source materials, the disc is a DVD-ROM (Mac or Windows) containing a "Filmmaker Research and Annotations Guide" in PDF. This is 108 pages of annotations and sources (books, articles, television, press conferences, etc.) for the scenes and ideas in the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>That was George W. Bush. He was the dim, alcoholic brother of the Bush clan's rising star, Jeb. W's a constant disappointment to his father, never measuring up to daddy's high standards. Maybe it is Oliver Stone's telling but when he presented Cheney, Rumsfeild & Rove I got a slight whiff of Goering, Himmler & Goebbels. Albeit on a much smaller scale, Germany & The United States both launched a war based on lies & a false pretext. They both participated in illegal & massive surveilance of their own citizens. They incarcerated & held innocent people without due process. These people couldn't even rise to the level of POW's. Let's not forget interogations & torture. Very Gestapo-like. When you think of the German Army, you think of Blitzgrieg. Our signature move was "shock & awe". Not exactly the same, but you get the idea. The movie shows that W is not really stupid. He made it thru Yale & Harvard although Poppy helped. He had no intellectual curiosity & never had an original thought. He had Dick Cheney & Karl Rove for that, suggesting evermore egregious actions. He was a fast learner. He learned dirty politics in his first & only losing campaign, for congressman. According to Mr. Stone, he was reponsible for the Willie Horton ads (with Rove's help). His father won. These type of tactics helped him to the Govenorship of Texas & later to the presidency. These are mostly events we lived through. History will have to decide if he deserves his place in the rank of presidents,ahead of Buchanan & Harding.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>First, the movie:<br /><br />Oliver Stone delivers not a scathing expose, but instead a relatively nuanced portrait of a character. As he says in the commentary, he is as much a humanist as he is a film director. George W. Bush doesn't wake up in the morning thinking "I'm a bad guy." So Stone sees his job as painting as accurate and true a portrait of a character as possible, one which is both true internally as far as motivation as it is true externally in terms of results. I think he achieves this goal in "W."<br /><br />He is aided by some truly wonderful performances. Josh Brolin is great as Bush. Toby Jones is a creepy, terrific Karl Rove, and Richard Dreyfuss is a revelation as Dick Cheney.<br /><br />Also very helpful is good, crisp writing, and a surprisingly brisk pace. Stone's movies usually top 3 hours - this one clocks in at two. And while there are some condensed and created scenes, Stone takes pains to point out that he has citations and sources for everything, if not the exact moment being portrayed, then for the characterization of people and moments in the "composite scenes." The disc contains an annotation section which lists sources, kind of like a scholarly article.<br /><br />In the end, this movie is entertaining as a character study, and as a study of the effects this kind of character has in our kind of society. We live in a nation which has lost its appreciation for wisdom - and is brimming with rich dullards who have the power to take it over. In such a climate, we are subject to the whims of the character of the people who find themselves in power - and I think Stone has hit the nail on the head by pinpointing the flaws in Bush's character which led to the various catastrophes of the years 2001-2008. You might disagree with this or that based on your politics, and you might reject the thesis of the movie. But I think you'd have a hard time faulting this *as* a movie. Stone knows how to keep a viewer's attention, how to create a scene, and he has all of his powers at his command in "W.", much as he did with other recent films such as "World Trade Center."<br /><br />Now, as for the Blu-Ray:<br /><br />This is a solid if unspectacular transfer. It looked pretty much identical to the theatrical presentation. Detail can be strong in spots, especially with faces and cloth textures, but this is not the disc you'll pop in to show off your system. I will say, I appreciate the fine film grain which is present throughout - this movie was thankfully not scrubbed clean by DNR.<br /><br />Extras include a fine commentary track by Stone. It's a tad dull in spots, but he does a very good job presenting his case for why he made this movie the way he did, and his general thesis in doing so. Deleted scenes are presented in 1080i with optional commentary. Two documentaries, one about the film and one on "W" himself, round out the special features. Overall, it's a fine batch of features.<br /><br />Quite annoying are promos at the beginning of the disc which each must be skipped individually. I'd like to find the people that sell movie companies on this idea, ring each and every one of their doorbells, and present them an unskippable knuckle sandwich right in their stupid monkey faces. I can't imagine a more irritating way of punishing someone who has paid good money to own your film.<br /><br />If I were just rating the movie, I might be tempted to give it five stars. It isn't as epic as a film like Stone's "Nixon" or "Alexander," but then, the subject matter isn't as epic as those men, either. If you are a fan of Stone's, the disc is a no-brainer. It's a very watchable movie with a lot of replay and entertainment value. Political history buffs also likely will get a kick out of it. This might not be the movie to get that religious conservative Blu-Ray buff you know. So, given the film's strengths, the average HD transfer, the decent extras, and the annoying trailers, I say 4 stars all around.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>W. was easily a four star movie which pulled no punches about our X president, but with few exceptions painted a sympathetic portrait of the man.  I think this film was well done and an excellent transfer to Blue Ray DVD. The DVD also included some very interesting historical background for the film, as well as some speculative source material from which it drew. It depicted the president as a very likeable and sociable man who only wanted to do what he sensed was in the best interest of the country.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>I enjoyed "W" greatly.  However, in the United States, I suspect that views of the movie will be seen through the prism of whether one is a Republican or a Democrat.  In my case, as I am not American and merely an outside observer, I think I can be reasonably independent.  So, at the outset, I will state that I both enjoyed the film and believe that George W Bush was a buffoon who brought disrespect to America that is most unwarranted.  America is the great democracy that is seen as the leading nation of the free world.  It is a great pity that it had to endure the eight years of W.<br /><br />Obviously, Oliver Stone had an axe to grind.  Any viewer of the film should understand this explicitly.  He portrays Bush as a miscreant.  Bush is the son of privilege; the child born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth.  This is true and should not be a point of debate.  Indeed, it is to Bush's credit that he was able to overcome his wayward past, sober up and then successfully run for public office.<br /><br />Josh Brolin plays W and is excellent in the role.  He looks like W and, more importantly, sounds like W.  Only Richard Dreyfuss is more convincing as Dick Cheney.  Yet, it is the story that is more relevant than how closely individual actors picked up the various idiosyncrasies of the main protagonists.  And, it is on this point that Stone succeeds.  He outlines the background to W from his time as frat boy at Yale to the emerging failure of the Iraq war to locate weapons of mass destruction.  But to be fair to Bush, Stone completely glosses over the war in Afghanistan which was arguably essential and achieved success.<br /><br />As mentioned at the outset, many people will reject this film simply because they know of Oliver Stone's point of view.  This is a shame.  "W" is a very good film that, although broadly critical of George W Bush, his policies and his verbal malapropisms is, nonetheless, a rollicking good ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>W. is a film that does not hold back its political opinions, nor does it take pleasure in reaming the former president. It attempts to portray a side of the president that allows the viewer to culminate opinions into something that can help explain why an event played out. But the introduction to its characters are filmed more like a comedy, that is light hearted and silly.<br /><br />I will try not to be too free with my opinions here, but you should not always believe what you read in books, and for movies, you shouldn't believe anything at all. It is another reason why this film was confusing for me. It is at times presented in a very serious, documentary feel, but then it sways into rounds of comedy.<br /><br />This movie does not tell us anything, and in fact led to more confusion than anything. Bush is being judged, and for many has been judged. This is not a great movie. It is a necessity for directors to capture their audiences, but I believe the acting in this movie to never commit to a certain degree of seriousness that W. needed. It is obscured with nonsense, and pays more attention to young, immature avenues. I do not think that this movie to be well made. It should have been more serious, and more demanding of the facts. Presenting a more complete picture of a man that is not fiction, but of history.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>I am giving this film 3 stars for two actors, Josh Brolin and Richard Dreyfuss. As George W Bush and Dick "Vice" Cheney, they convincingly portray their still contemporary counterparts without seeming utterly unlike their subjects and without falling into parody. Unfortunately for the rest of the movie, that can't be said for the bulk of the characters.<br /><br />Frankly, Thandi Newton's Condoleezza Rice is one of the most annoying things to land on a contemporary film since JarJar Binks. Speaking in a pinched nasally whine, she completely misses Rice's intelligence, even as she captures the Secretary of State's well known sycophanphropy. And as everyone knows, Karl Rove is a big obese blob of a man, but Toby Jones looks like a wimpy elf. As George Herbert Walker "Poppy" Bush, Oliver Cromwell bring an air of Aristocracy to the Elder Bush, but little of his mannerisms.<br /><br />The movie itself lacks drive. "W" is little more than a standard biopic about a boring spoiled kid with sibling rivalry problems and Daddy issues. While it grazes the deep cynicism that permeates our political system (W ran for office so he could show up Jeb?!?), it fails to generate any heat. Given the volatility of the topic - and I am 100% comfortable in predicting that history will record 43 as The Worst President Ever - Director Oliver Stone decided not to exploit many of the easy targets and tries for subtlety.<br /><br />Which makes "W" a big bore. The far-left will cry that it doesn't go far enough; the Bushie-Loyals will scream that their heroes aren't bold or celebrated enough. The one scene that shows any real conflict (Colin Powell snapping about a "Five time deferral" VP making War policy and a confrontation that ends with Cheney on the receiving end of an f-u bomb. Yet even that is left hanging, as Bush seems to be more engaged than is often reported. The film makes George W Bush human. Most humans are dull people. That may be W.'s biggest sin of omission. It's a boring movie about a dullard of a man that has all the impact of a Biography Channel documentary. Given Oliver Stone's usually flamethrower tactics, that's a letdown.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>i really enjoyed this movie. its well directed and the ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. while the movie works as fine docudrama about the events that made Bush who he is, it also works as a biting satire on the sheer stupidity of our government's decision making process. while the film is not without its flaws, mainly, the pacing and lack of a crystal clear focus, this is an excellent film which needs to be seen for Josh Brolin's performance alone. Oliver Stone is getting his career back on track.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>In this movie George W. Bush is depicted in his early years as a hard-drinking, opportunistic, ne'er-do-well who bumbles through life riding the coattails of his distant, disapproving father.  Later on, after a moment of conversion, he is shown as a simplistic, religious fanatic who bulls his way to the presidency and who seeks nothing more than a kind word from George Sr.  Each of the characters is instead a caricature and the movie is full of misrepresentations and giant leaps of assumption about the interactions and motivations of the major protagonists.  "W" is depicted as a cowboy who jumps on his horse and rides it to the bitter end, insisting that he is always right and never makes a mistake.  Oliver Stone's comment that this movie is not political is ridiculous and is only superseded by his assertion that he got "into the skin of George Bush".  The sad truth is that he never even scratched the surface.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>Who would have thought that Oliver Stone, creator of the paranoid conspiracy flick, "JFK", would ever come up with a largely empathetic portrait of our recent president? "W" chronicles the life of George W. Bush beginning with his days as a drunken frat boy through his days in the Oval office dealing with the War in Iraq and its aftermath.<br /><br />"W" is most successful when we're treated to the 'behind-the-scenes' look at Bush's personality and his interactions with those around him. The most fascinating scenes are the flashbacks which deal with Bush as a young man and his gradual maturation and leap into politics. Josh Brolin does an excellent job capturing the essence of George W. Bush with all his goofy mannerisms. Bush actually comes off as a sympathetic character. Brolin emphasizes Bush's fixation on seeing the world with rose-colored glasses. For Bush, everything is a simple contest between 'good' and 'evil'. His inability to deal with complex issues ultimately leads to policy consequences he's unable to control.<br /><br />The film is on shakier ground when Stone strays from his tone of behind-the-scenes black humor to heavy-handed political propaganda. This occurs when Stone focuses too much on Colin Powell (who becomes Stone's mouthpiece), with his long-winded dissents over the administration's decision to go to war in Iraq. It's these talky cabinet meeting scenes (particularly in the second half) which slow the movie down. By dealing with dry and familiar political issues and failing to focus on the IDIOSYNRACIES of the characters, one feels as if one is listening to an academic lecture as opposed to viewing scenes fraught with engaging dramatic conflict.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a mixed bag. Richard Dreyfuss is a dead-ringer for Dick Cheney and does an excellent job of conveying Cheney's 'take no prisoners' philosophy. Toby Jones is less successful as Karl Rove, playing him much 'softer' than he is in real life. I was most disappointed in James Cromwell as George Bush Sr. Whereas Stone made a great effort to have most of the actors resemble those who they were playing, Cromwell doesn't look like George Bush Sr. nor did he make any effort to imitate his voice or mannerisms. Cromwell is better at playing bad guys like in 'L.A. Confidential' or 'Clear and Present Day'; but real life characters need to remind us much more of the real thing. Thandie Newton looks and sounds like Conde Rice but her part is completely underdeveloped. We never get a sense of what she's like as a person (I would have liked to have seen her in a scene where she's playing some classical piano!). Ellen Burstyn as Barbara Bush was okay but seemed a tad bit too young for the part. Elizabeth Banks looks a lot like the young Laura Bush but she never seems to age by the time she's living in the White House. I thought the scene where W. and Laura meet was quite realistic especially with Laura being depicted as opinionated and not willing to be cowed by W. But she never seems to grow as a character in the later scenes (what about all the talk about trouble in their marriage? Or did that come later?)<br /><br />One gets the feeling that screenwriter Stanley Weiser had access to a a great deal of personal stories about W. and his family which made the film compelling. But he lacked the requisite behind-the-scenes stories concerning the other characters (particularly the cabinet members such as Rumsfield and Colin Powell, who are just there for the history lesson).<br /><br />"W" is an affectionate look at the strengths and foibles of our current president. Oliver Stone is to be commended for examining the life of George W. Bush with empathy which makes for compelling drama. Some of "W" is talky and preachy but despite its shortcomings, it's definitely worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone directs an absorbing if somewhat fanciful bio-pic of George W. Bush.  It is not quite a hatchet job but will be enough to irritate Bushies.  The plot line of sibling rivalry between W. and brother Jeb is pure speculation, eclipsed by an Oedipal conflict with Bush the elder.<br /><br />The cast is extremely strong, especially with Richard Dreyfus channeling the essence of Dick Cheney.  Josh Broland as W. turns in a masterful performance.<br /><br />Many more years are needed to offer a fair perspective on the Bush era.  In the meantime, Oliver Stone's over the top "adaptation" is entertaining and likely to hold your interest, whether you are a fan of The Decider or one of his detractors.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>W. is a film not many people want to see or even discuss because of the subject matter - the career of the country's most unpopular President, the debacle of the Iraq War, and the decimated economy. There is a certain 'guilt' that comes with criticizing the leader of the country, from both conservatives and liberals: it is not polite to condemn our elected leaders.  But now with the Bush legacy daily being pushed into the past (though the after burn of that embarrassing 8 years will never completely go away), it is time for biographers to examine why the Bush version of Presidential autonomy occurred.<br /><br />Oliver Stone has examined Nixon and JFK on film and now with a terse script Stanley Weiser he summarizes the life of George W. Bush, from his early bad boy drinking years and inability to hold a job through his family collisions (brother Jeb being the obvious successor to George Bush, Sr.), to his bull headed drive toward absolute power to finish the war his father didn't finish - securing the Middle East oil fields to be held by American control by fabricating the infamous Axis of Evil and Weapons of Mass Destruction as drivers to light the preemptive blundering war against Saddam Hussein and Iraq.<br /><br />In lesser hands this film might have become too prejudiced a view of a president.  But Oliver Stone's technique of telling a story makes this film work: we see the rise and fall of a pitifully misguided man whose judgment and lack of intelligence brought us to where we are today.  Much of the success of the film is due to the casting of Josh Brolin as W., James Cromwell as Bush Sr., Ellen Burstyn as Barbara Bush, Richard Dreyfuss as the terrifying Dick Cheney, Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush, Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld, Toby Jones as Karl Rove, Bruce McGill as George Tenet, and a puzzling performance by Thandie Newton as Condoleeza Rice.  Their characterizations are remarkable and give an insider's view as to the tehniques used to change a democracy into an oligarchy.<br /><br />Many people may find this film either too biased and cruel (conservatives) or too watered down (liberals), but at least Oliver Stone has once again placed a key figure on the screen for us all to ponder. In time this film will be better accepted, once the smoke clears from the past 8 eight years.

Get it at Amazon.]<br /><br />Vain because he thought he was the decider and that God had chosen his ear in which to whisper.  Little as measured by his talent compared to others who have held the office.  But more than that, the tragedy of George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States, is a direct result of a sociopathic personality that this film was not able to fully capture.<br /><br />That personality belonged and belongs to Dick Cheney, Bush's prince of darkness-like vice president, a man who was able to manipulate W. as a puppeteer might manipulate a puppet by playing on W.'s vanity and insecurities, and on his vainglorious lust to outdo his father and to shine brighter than his brother Jed.<br /><br />Or is it George W. himself who has the sociopathic personality?  How can you approve the torture of people to find a justification to invade another country knowing full well that thousands of people will die because of your actions?  Can you tell yourself you are bringing democracy to another land when in your heart of hearts you know that your motive is to be able to run for reelection as a wartime president or one who has just won a war and thereby upstage your father who was not reelected?  I think the question of whether George W. was the more manipulated or more the manipulator has not yet been answered.<br /><br />This film is curious in what it shows and where it would not go.  We do not see W. as a boy blowing up frogs with firecrackers.  There is no snorting of cocaine.  We see him as a fraternity pledge at Yale ticking off the names and nicknames of his fellows, but what is missed is the significance of the nicknaming for George W., which is to control others through the threat of demeaning them with an embarrassing tag.  We do see how nicknaming allows him to simplistically regard others, as he calls Cheney "Vice" (yes!) and slaps derogatory names on foreign leaders who fail to come into his war coalition.  But the psychological essence of calling other people names is to boast a personality suffering from a poor self-image.<br /><br />So the 43rd president was simultaneously a vain and self-conscious man acutely aware of his limitations, always working to boast himself up.  He went to all the best private schools, knowing of course that only his father's money and prestige got him in, and of course as a C-student felt his miss-measure against the others.  Yet he is that C-student who became the most powerful man in the world, and yet he had no idea how to use his power.  He became isolated and controlled by the office of the presidency and by those in his inner circle.<br /><br />There is always the danger when making a film focused on a putatively despicable character that you will by showing his all too human attributes and behaviors make him into an anti-hero with whom the audience cannot help but identify.  I'm sure Oliver Stone was aware of this trap, but nevertheless he fell into it.  We see George W. on the John, watching ballgames on TV, in domestic embrace with his wife.  We see his father favoring the other son.  We see George W. fail and fail again, and then we see him give up drinking and become a rousing political success as he helps guide his father's winning campaign for the presidency, as he wins the governorship of Texas and as he becomes president of the United States.  In some ways--at least as far as intelligence and compromised morality goes--he rose from greater depths than perhaps any other American president.<br /><br />But of course without the intervention of his father and being the son of a powerful man, George W. would probably have amounted to little.  And so his triumph in becoming the 43rd president is tainted by the full knowledge that, as this film makes clear, he couldn't have done it without his father's influence and his father's name.<br /><br />The real truth of the phenomenon that is George W. Bush lies not in him or the political dynasty he derailed or the shame he brought on America, but in the fact that so many Americans actually voted for him.  He is the product of his times, and these were the times of great moral corruption in America, times in which preemptive war and torture became accepted practice, times in which the Republican Party became the property of people like Karl Rove and Rush Limbaugh, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, Dick Cheney and the neocons, until in 2008 it became a parody of itself with Sarah Palin and Joe the Plumber.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is convincing in capturing the contradictions in W.'s personality while Richard Dreyfuss makes for a surprisingly apt Dick Cheney.  Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush is as pretty as pretty can be, and James Cromwell as the senior Bush is very true to type.  Thandie Newton captured well Condoleezza Rice's quality of quiet, submissive loyalty while being able to keep her hands clean.  The unavoidable weakness of the casting however is that the characters unfortunately do not look enough like the characters we have seen on TV to fool our eyes.<br /><br />The script by Stanley Weiser, who also co-scripted Oliver Stone's Wall Street (1987), and Stone's direction are competent but undistinguished and a bit shallow.  The right way to make this film in my not so humble opinion is to really show us the evil of George W. Bush, the evil that was tragically the man, and the harm that he did to this country and to the people of Iraq, and to show us how America itself, from the Congress to the media to the pulpit and pew, was manipulated and complaisance in bringing about the tragedy.  Instead Stone and Weiser emphasize George W.'s little guy vain personality and the irony of his rise to power.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>Then again, perhaps it is important to focus on his budding personality flaws before we assess all of the damage he has done to America's image with them. Somehow, Jr. has become something of an enigma-is he evil, or stupid? Stone leans toward stupid, but really, he portrays W as a misguided soul with inner conflicts that played into the hands of major power brokers with their own ideas about the future of the country. In light of all of W's early failures in most of his occupational endeavors, it's a convincing GUT of how Dub worked. Stone takes some of the sting out of all of W's recklessness and blundering and presents you an American portrait instead, which may prove infuriating to a good swath of viewers who are expecting a savaging of the Shrub. Brolin is fabulously all over his role as W, everyone else is solid save for Thandie Newton's mousey take on Condoleeza Rice. She had the look down, but her voice coach should have been flogged.<br /><br />A special note to idiots: there is no "agenda", no ideology, no "belief system", no "liberal take", or whatever phraseology you've been taught to mouth like automatons in the film. There is no doubt in any rational persons' mind that W's presidency is one of the most controversial to take place in modern history, and it deserves all of the scrutiny it gets. The real effect will be studied much further down the line, but it looks to me like Stone wanted to do a character/personality study rather than put focus on the horrendous mistakes he has made which may take decades to reverse, perhaps more.<br /><br />It's W the man, not W the monster. You can read a bazillion books about his policies-there is far less journalism on the boy king's inner workings, and we should welcome this angle as a compass to finding out a little more as to why he has done what he has done.</p></br><a href="../users/A81P47EIXM8HA.html">A81P47EIXM8HA</a><br/><p>Its interesting how time takes its toll on art, music, movies and the truth. I was happy that Oliver Stone rushed this film into theaters in hopes that its extremely unfavorable painting of the current President would help John Kerry defeat him. Theater goers stayed away in droves....maybe due to the poor reviews maybe because they felt they were living it and too close (my reasoning)and others maybe pulled the plug on believing Oliver Stone could make anything relevant a decade before.<br /><br />Now that we have plenty of accurate accounts of the events portrayed in this film its clear it was historically wrong (a book could be written on that alone) and on top of that poor film making. Oliver Stone's cement style heavy handed approach seems directed to either left wing haters or those in the audience with IQs in the double digits. This story should, and still could, be done in a way which is less black and white and much much more in the mid tones. Stone's portrayal of these individuals is extremely one dimensional and often comical! For a glimpse at how ridiculous this movie is just listen to the actress playing Condi Rice for five seconds and you can get an accurate gauge on the entire movie.  These are real life people and yet the screenplay and movie inject less into them than a good movie with imagined characters!  How can you take this movie maker seriously when he refuses to inject any humanity into anybody in the story he does not like?<br /><br />Its almost impossible to make a movie of events while they are still unfolding...and Stone's joke of a film W. proves that. Stone is chasing relevance with his film making for some time  and continuing to fail....football, 911, George Bush,  and more recently Wall Street again.<br /><br />If he has to keep making movies perhaps he should find another Tarantino (who scripted Natural Born Killers) and just direct a brilliant script by somebody who actually HAS a voice. His chasing trends instead of setting them ...has failed.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy train wrecks and car crashes...because that is what this is.<br /><br />If you want to have fun at George W Bush's expense...then watch the hilarious Will Ferrell DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VEJK6Y">Will Ferrell: You're Welcome, America. A Final Night with George W. Bush</a>  Its much funnier than this joke.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>There was a time, very long ago, that Oliver Stone made relevant movies, granted he always had an ax to grind, but his movies were not provocative, just to be provocative.  W. is a perfect example, it's obvious Stone is no fan of the former president, but he tries I suppose in his own warped way to understand Bush, and im sure he feels he was fair, but really this is just a badly filmed pseudo intellectual mess.  The performances are all over the place, it's like the actors are as confused as the director.  Brolin is passable as Bush, but he really doesnt ever make you forget that you are watching a caracature..the rest of the cast does sort of bad imatations, with the execteption of the singular Cromwell as Poppy, not really sure 41 was like this, but it's a riviting performance none the less..but really there is nothing to recommend here..it's Stone at his most indulgent..granted this mess is not as bad as Alexander..high praise indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2.html">A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2</a><br/><p>Watching this jumbled, poorly motivated movie, baffling where it tries to be funny and hilarious where it tries to be straightforward, I have to ask: why?  Why did a director of Oliver Stone's standing feel the need to make this mess?  Why now?  And why did any studio think it would be a good idea to release a movie about a sitting president who isn't up for re-election?  I have no answers.  And I'm out more than two hours of my life.<br /><br />This movie isn't bad.  I almost wish it was, because I could say something funny and demeaning about it.  But it doesn't have the courage to pull out all stops and really, really suck.  It reminds me of a Saturday Night Live version of the Bush administration, with people whose resemblance to the actual figures is close but rings hollow.  And, like nearly all feature-length SNL films, this feels like it would have been funny at six minutes, but is interminable as it is.<br /><br />The most surprising trait of the movie is how sympathetic Stone is to President Bush.  The jumpy cutting of the movie trailer makes it look like this will be a farcical mockery of the current administration, but Bush actually comes out looking like an honest guy who really can't figure out how things spiraled so far out of his hands.  Bush here becomes an upright guy with perhaps an excess of credulity, surrounded by a small army of leeches sucking off his good character.  Stone blatantly dislikes Bush's cabinet, but seems remarkably fond of the man himself.<br /><br />But the movie ends with the ball still up in the air, quite literally.  The story ends in late 2003.  I can't help but wonder if this movie began life as a script for a TV film that was supposed to run before the 2004 election, and Stone hijacked it.  At this date, running the Bush story without any mention of his re-election campaign or his second term seems frivolous.  And why now, anyway?  We don't have the historical perspective Stone had for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019QEXYS">Nixon</a>, and it can't influence anybody's election bid, so why waste our time and ticket money just now?<br /><br />The resemblance of many actors to their characters can charitably be called approximate.  Elizabeth Banks' resemblance to Laura Bush is downright remarkable for its accuracy, and Bruce McGill's George Tenet is nearly spot-on.  But Richard Dreyfuss seems to think that face prosthetics and a snarl is all it takes to capture Dick Cheney.  Scott Glenn's Donald Rumsfeld is so far afield that I didn't know who he was supposed to be until someone told me.  James Cromwell looks not one bit like Poppy Bush.  And Thandie Newton doesn't so much look like Condi Rice as a Rice impersonator in a low-budget zombie film.<br /><br />That's to say nothing of Josh Brolin as Bush.  His accent is so broad, and his repetition of Bush's keystone gestures so redundant, that he seems to go out of his way to remind us that he's an actor playing Bush.  Though most of this film centers on Bush's presidency, flashbacks in his life go back as far as 1966, and watching the forty-year-old Brolin portraying a teenaged fraternity pledge is a marked strain on credibility the movie never entirely shakes.<br /><br />Speaking of shaking, this film is so full of jittery handheld camera work that I frequently had to shield my eyes to ward of motion sickness.  On the one hand, I understand why Stone wants to create the impression of cinema verite in this film.  On the other hand, the current movie fad for nausea-inducing cinematography can't end too soon for me.<br /><br />And why does this movie seem so thoroughly cribbed from Michael Moore's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SINT52">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>?  I mean, apart from the fact that it uses a lot of the same news footage, transplants a huge number of Bush quotes (often entirely changing the context), and has the same organizational structure like a filmed version of a five paragraph essay?  I already have that DVD, I didn't need to pay theater ticket prices to see it remade.<br /><br />In sum, this movie will disappoint Bush supporters, Bush detractors, film buffs, political devotees, and... well... everybody else too.  With a director like Oliver Stone and a cast of stars of this magnatude, we expect better than this.  Whether you agree with its basic thesis, disagree, or wait to be persuaded, you will walk out of "W" shaking your head and asking yourself, "Why?"</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"W." is brilliant!

And did Chris Crocker write the script? Because this movie is too sympathetic. In fact, it should be called "Leave Bush alone!". Granted, Brolin's performance is great. It's almost like watching George W. himself play the role.<br /><br />I agree this movie had lots of potential. It's a look at George W. Bush's presidency, and I admire Stone for trying to do that. Howver, just because you did it with "JFK" (which is a fantastic movie IMO), doesn't mean you should do one for Bush. That said, this movie fails to reach its potential because the whole time it seems as if it's trying to get us to sympathize (sp?) for Bush.<br /><br />There are some good moments in the film and they do highlight some of the actual events in Bush's reign. But other than that, unless you actually do sympathize for Bush, this movie is a complete waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>On a side note, I hope Oliver Stone was joking in an appearance he made on The Colbert Report when he praised George W. Bush's presidency and said he was the greatest president in history. He scares me sometimes, Stone does.<br /><br />On another note, the movie does not feel much at all like an Oliver Stone-type movie, though it has enough of his style in it: frequent and non-chronological flashbacks (Alexander, JFK, Natural Born Killers, etcetera), and a perpetual Father/Child conflict (Natural Born Killers, Platoon, Alexander).<br /><br />For the cast, they did the best they could, and most of the actors very much look and sound the role, from Richard Dreyfuss whose resemblance to Cheney is marred only by Dreyfuss's liver spots and slightly darker skin, to Thandie Newton's Condoleeza Rice, and Bruce McGill's George Tenet.<br /><br />The others fall a bit short, such as Scott Glenn, who's much too skinny, shrimpy, and sleazy Richard-Belzer-looking to pull off a convincing Donald Rumsfeld; he looks more like an older version of that guy who hosted Beat the Geeks on Comedy Central. Josh Brolin gets Bush's voice and movements down perfectly without looking or sounding like a comedic parody, while James Cromwell manages to encapsulate gravitas, but is pretty much a completely different person than George HW Bush. And Toby Jones's face is too misshapen to fit much like Karl Rove.<br /><br />The movie in itself takes a very straight-forward, unbiased approach, which while offering some mildly interesting insights (such as Bush's first experience with attack ads in his first run for Governor of Texas, to his incorporation of them in his father's Presidential campaign), these only remain MILDLY interesting; the movie just shows us things we would have heard about in the news or read about in biographies or writings. The more personal moments have a sort of disappointing factor about them in that they are complete and utter conjecture, and they STILL fail to provide more than just superficial filler or exposition.<br /><br />Humor is so light and toned-down as to be nonexistent; very little is funny here beyond slight chuckles or snortles.<br /><br />For the character of George Bush itself, the movie only serves to humanize him in a way that could have been done with a simple documentary maybe half as long: For example, his early party and drinking days are dished out in such a way as to show him not as a nasty, crude, misogynistic, college frat-boy like you might see in bad teen comedies like "Sorority Boys" (or the frat guys in "Borat"), but as a regular guy who makes friends in a fraternity, drinks a lot, and has simple dreams of doing this or that, oblivious to the fact that only his father's wealth and influence gets him there.<br /><br />His presidency is treated in such a way that Bush is both distant from the darker and more shady aspects, while always on top of everything as "The Decider"---there is the lunch scene where he agrees to an "enhanced interrogation" measure simply by seeing that the measure is three pages long, and thus he'll trust Cheney to carry it out humanely, and then proceeds to exert clear power over Cheney by sternly telling him he wants this treated responsibly.<br /><br />In another scene in the war room, Cheney and Rumsfeld go off on tangents regarding Iraq and Iran, and a seeming future fantasy of an American Empire dominating the Middle East. Bush quashes this and brings everyone's focus back on Iraq.<br /><br />The movie portrays Bush as almost as much of a victim with regards to the Iraq War as the American people were---George Tenet is the one frustrated by the severely questionable evidence for Saddam's WMDs, and yet Cheney pushes for its inclusion in official reports to a degree that Tenet simply gives up and allows it to be passed as solid intelligence. By 2004, Bush is seen angrily demanding from his top officials why no WMDs have been found and questioning if there even were any to begin with.<br /><br />Little else really happens, and the direction is very clear on focusing on Bush's turbulent relationship with his father as his motivation for almost every major decision in his career, always to seek his father's approval without an undermining addendum (If only I could have attended two inaugurations this year, Bush Sr. says to that effect before George W.'s inauguration as Governor of Texas, after Jeb Bush lost his run in Florida).<br /><br />In total, the film is only controversial in that some people will claim it's boring and other people will claim it's bullcrap. It does a highly successful job of making Bush a human figure and a likable person, while at the same time doing a complete spin-job by making him seem utterly unaccountable for any of the bad things that had happened throughout his administration, and giving absolutely no background information on the supposedly close relationship with George Bush and Karl Rove. Considering how he is portrayed as the Ego to his Administration's Id (Cheney and Rumsfeld, and to a smaller degree, Rice) and its Superego (A highly tragic Colin Powell, portrayed by Jeffrey Wright fantastically, George Tenet, and others), this can only amount to either top-notch spin, or such a powerful desire to overcome a controversial reputation as to go in the complete opposite direction of a "hatchet-job" as to accidentally do just as bad a thing in making a hero of a man who is neither hero nor villain. He's just Bush.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>When those little arm band looking black "W The President" stickers were ubiquitous on SUVs and over-sized pickup trucks and luxury cars in my mind "w" just stood for wrong.

Actually I'm not sure why I rented this movie because Bush is out of the White House finally and I'm not interested in him. Colin Powell is presented as the voice of reason, the "moderate" or whatever. As for as I'm concerned he's the worst out of them all for not resigning in protest IF the portrait presented by Stone is accurate. Also, what up with the accent Jeffrey Wright gives Colin Powell? Lol. Look, the movie is somewhat entertaining. A highlight was the portrayal of Condoleezza Rice. A nice little loyal lapdog. Shame on them all.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>GODDE!

Bush as a psychological basket-case.<br /><br />And this is fine.  W. was and is a personality of feeble intellect and stunted, 7-year-old emotions.<br /><br />But that's all Stone does.<br /><br />He leaves it at that.<br /><br />Imagine if a movie were made about Hitler or Stalin and only covered their psychological problems.  No doubt they had them.  But the only reason people would care is the enormity of their crimes.<br /><br />Same here.<br /><br />SOME time should have been devoted to W's idiotic, murderous, neglectful, help-the-rich and kick-the-poor policies.<br /><br />On the other hand, Thandie Newton is terrific as Condoleeza Rice; and Richard Dreyfus is superb as Cheney.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's "W." is one of the year's most absorbing films, and that's because, as the tagline suggests, it reveals that George W. Bush has been greatly misunderestimated. Watching this film, we see not the forty-third President of the United States, the former Governor of Texas, or even a politician in general. From my perspective, we're being told about an insecure man who reaches too far in an attempt to earn his father's approval. This movie is not a political commentary--it's a character study. Better still, it's a character study that's more or less historically accurate, with Stone and writer Stanley Weisner relying on published works and in-depth reports for the screenplay. Liberties were obviously taken; after all, there's no way anyone could know exactly what was said behind closed doors. But all the basic scenarios are well documented, which is to say that the film never once felt contrived. The end result is a compelling, complex, and occasionally funny examination of a person who always has something to prove.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is perfectly cast as the title character, flawlessly capturing the mannerisms and diction we've become so familiar with over the last eight years. We see him as a determined but incompetent man who claws his way up to the presidency without the necessary skills. Pay close attention to scenes featuring W. in staff meetings; it quickly becomes clear that political heavyweights like Dick Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss), Karl Rove (Toby Jones), Condoleeza Rice (Thandie Newton), Colin Powell (Jeffrey Wright), and even the infuriated Donald Rumsfeld (Scott Glenn) are making all the important decisions. As for W., well, let us not forget that the real President Bush publicly declared that his faith in God influenced his foreign policy decisions. In the film, he ends every meeting by having everyone bow their heads in prayer; I expected nothing less from a man who found God at age forty, when he was in the thick of his AA treatment. In 1999, he tells his pastor (Stacy Keach) that, even though he had no desire to be President of the United States, it was God's will that he campaign.<br /><br />The film also takes some time to develop the relationship between W. and his wife, Laura (Elizabeth Banks), who he met at a friend's barbecue while running for Congress for the first time. In the film, Laura Bush is sweet, understanding, and patient, and it's easy to believe the love she feels for her husband. She seems to regard W. the same way a mother regards a baby taking its first steps: She encourages him endlessly, and she's always there to support him if he should trip and fall somewhere along the way. At that pivotal stage of W.'s life, the world of politics is so new and challenging that he needs all the support he can get.<br /><br />One of the most interesting things about this film is the structure. Rather than a complete chronological biography, Stone opted for non-linear fragments, starting in 2002 but then flashing back to 1966 before going to 2003, and so on and so forth. He also chose to omit specific events in Bush's life; we see neither the 2000 nor the 2004 election, and we're spared the tragedies of September 11, 2001 and Hurricane Katrina. This will undoubtedly frustrate certain audiences. I didn't have a problem with it, and that's because this film is about his personality, not his political career. As the pieces of the story come together, we discover the man behind the president: he was a C-average college student who spent most of his time getting drunk; he gambled and went through women; he seemed to take no interest in holding a job; he was always at odds with his disapproving parents, who seemed to favor his younger brother, Jeb.<br /><br />There's a moment in a 1970s flashback when W. comes home drunk and announces that he was accepted into Harvard Business School. When his mother (Ellen Burstyn) demands to know why he never told them, he admits that he never intended to go--he just wanted to prove to his father (James Cromwell) that he could do it. This doesn't please Poppy Bush very much, and that's because it was his own string pulling that got his son accepted in the first place. There's a definite rivalry between the two, one that W. drags all the way to 2003, the year he decided to invade Iraq. Colin Powell, who in 1991 oversaw Operation Desert Strom along with Dick Cheney, makes it clear that Saddam Hussein had no hand in the 9/11 attacks. That doesn't matter, decides W.; he wants to finish the job his father failed to finish back when he was President. Besides, there's evidence to suggest that Hussein is concealing weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />But I'm not convinced he actually believed this to be true. It seemed more likely that he was just going along with what others were saying. Oliver Stone describes George W. Bush as a Western hero so one-tracked, he refuses to back down even when he's wrong. "There's just no examination of the interior life," he said in an "L.A. Weekly" interview. "He doesn't look back. He doesn't regret. He doesn't seem to read very much--or think very much--about what he does." Some may be compelled to take pity on W. after seeing this movie; it paints a picture of a man who wanted nothing more than to own a baseball team. Others, I'm sure, will not have their minds changed one bit. Whatever your reaction, I personally feel that this is one of the year's best films, presenting us with a fascinating character study rather than a scathing political commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Not too bad a bad movie (and not too inaccurate, I suspect) but at the end, a wasted opportunity. Brolin's performance is OK and he does most of Bush's mannerisms fairly well but I failed the understand the need for the cartoonish close-ups Stone gives him throughout the movie or for some scenes like the one showing him having a lenghty conversation with Laura when he's in the toilet (what was the point there ?). Personally I would have been a lot more interested to see what happened in W's own election night rather than in the one his father lost to Clinton but the way Stone handles the meetings between W and his staff in which crucial decisions were discussed in almost trivial and casual ways and which later brougth such dire consequences throughout the world, are more than enough reason to recommend this movie. Most people in the audience will come away from W with the certainty that Jeb would have been a much better president but with the repercusions to the Bush name after these 8 years, it is fair to say it is highly improbable we'll ever get to find out. The biggest WMD shown inthis movie ?: a pretzel. Now THAT was ironic.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>It's not that I don't believe that every single one of the incidents in W. didn't take place, it's just that Oliver Stone discredits himself by making Bush 43 look SO unrelievedly puerile and SO utterly incompetent that Bush almost gains the viewer's sympathy---a difficult feat, considering that Dubya had to be most inept and unfit man ever to sit in the Oval Office, at least since James Buchanan.<br /><br />Stone's "Junior" starts out life as a drunken frat boy who is constantly bailed out of trouble by his supercompetent Daddy, and Junior largely remains that kid all his life, except for the fact that he quits drinking somewhere along the way. Regardless of going dry, W.'s mind never sharpens. He never truly matures and he never adopts a measure of success other than that of his own advancement. By his own lights, Stone's George W. Bush is the most phenomenally successful man in the world. And I'm sure that's true in real life, anyway.<br /><br />Unfortunately for America, Bush's dream job was to be the Commissioner of Baseball, not the Commander-in-Chief. He runs his White House and manages his foreign policy with all the subtlety of Leo Durocher and Billy Martin's three-headed love child.<br /><br />Bush's Administration is the hideout of cultured barbarians and frat Nazis whose main focus in life seems to be keeping themselves the main focus of everything. Surrounding himself with smarter sycophants like Karl Rove and Dick Cheney (whom he calls "Vice" rather than "Dick," as if it matters), Bush sets his compass by that most egotistical of lodestones---What God wants. It's incredible how well W. knows just what God wants, considering he's never even seen the Guy.<br /><br />With no intellectual curiosity and little real intellect, Stone's W. is a frightening nitwit who has his hand on The Button. Whether the real one is less of a nincompoop, Oliver Stone has set the biofilm benchmark on this President so low that the film adaptation of Bush's seemingly-eventual War Crimes Trial will show him in a better light.<br /><br />That's tough to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>George W. Bush is a man who was unqualified for every single job he's ever held.  This would not be such a big deal if his chosen profession were as a shoe salesman or a bartender, but the job he hoodwinked people into thinking he could handle was none-other than President of the United States of America.<br /><br />This is an inquisitive film which delves into his hellraising days at Yale (where he seemingly did everything BUT study) on up through to his ascension to governor & eventually president.  I knew about his "issues" with trying to out-do dear-old-dad as prez, but I was unaware about the familial jealousies he had regarding his brother Jeb.  Without holding a palavar on Dubya, Oliver Stone has done an impressive job in this film of psycho-analyzing what is perhaps the least intellectual president this country has ever seen.<br /><br />The casting of the film was quite good, featuring James Brolin as Dubya and Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney.  Dreyfuss carries an uncanny resemblance to the former VP, and they both capture the mannerisms of their characters nicely.  Elizabeth Banks is a top notch actress, but her portrayal of Laura Bush was not ditzy enough for my liking.  This is not a knock on Banks, but is rather a knock on the writers of the film.  If the film were truly accurate, Laura Bush would have been depicted as being as clueless as Dubya more than 1/2 the time.<br /><br />There are Conservatives who will scream that this movie is a hatchet-job.  They can scream all they want, but they still can't change history. That the incursion into Iraq was a debacle is as clear as our involvement in Vietnam.  The movie doesn't even go into Dubya's blunders in Katrina or his de-regulation & out-sourcing initiatives which led to the economic crisis that we now find ourselves in.  If anything, the film actually makes us a little bit sympathetic to a man who got in WAY over his head.<br /><br />As a Liberal, I can admit that Jimmy Carter was not a good president.  It amazes me that there are still(!) so many Conservatives out there who want to defend Dubya's reputation at all costs.  Sadly for all of us, the Bush administration was the most incompetent administration since that of Herbert Hoover, and the most corrupt administration since that of Richard Nixon.  George W. Bush was the most ineffective leader of any American president since Franklin Pierce.  This film tells the story of Dubya.  It's not pretty, but it's accurate.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Lionsgate / Region A<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / AACS / High Profile 4.1<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />Running time: 2:09:21<br />Movie size: 37,63 GB<br />Disc size: 47,39 GB<br />Total bit rate: 38.79 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 30.99 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  3606 kbps  7.1 / 48 kHz / 3606 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps<br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  1335 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 1335 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 2.0 / 48 kHz / 256 kbps / 24-bit)<br /><br />Subtitles: English / English SDH / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 16<br /><br />#Audio commentary with director Oliver Stone<br />#Dangerous Dynasty: The Bush Presidency featurette<br />#No Stranger to Controversy: Oliver Stone's George W. Bush featurette<br />#Deleted scenes</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>Here's an odd little movie.  It's a kitchen sink drama about a sitting President of the United States.  Yes, it's got stock footage of the Iraq war, and an all-star casting playing members of the Cabinet, and it's got a greatest-hits collection of everyone's favorite George W. Bush misquotes.  But it's also a sad, downbeat little drama about a man-child who failed at everything he ever did, and then became President just to prove a point to his father -- and failed at that, too.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's movie has been praised so far for not being overtly political, and for being somewhat sympathetic to its subject.  Still, the director doesn't pull punches on showing "W"'s hard-drinking past, and he lists all of the man's life failures prior to becoming owner of the Texas Rangers.  There are a few trademark manipulative Stone moments -- for example, a pan over the infamous "Mission Accomplished" poster quickly jump-cuts to a montage of Iraq insurgent bombshells and wounded veterans.  We also get the moment where the Prseident nearly chokes on a pretzel while watching college football on TV.  And, even though Bush did win the 2004 election, the movie stops short of that in order to end on a surprisingly downbeat note.  This movie is sympathetic to Bush, but it's also quite critical.  There's a fleeting image of John McCain, too, lest we forget the choice we have to make in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />The cast is almost uniformly superb.  Josh Brolin, playing Bush both in his hard-living 20s and his Presidential late 50s, carries off the role so effortlessly that it's easy to overlook how hard he had to work to make this movie work.  And it does work, thanks to Brolin.<br /><br />The aces of the supporting cast include James Cromwell as George H.W. Bush -- giving the man a true gravitas that pop culture denied him 15 years ago, when he was being parodied by Dana Carvey and "The Simpsons".  Jeffrey Wright is heroic as Colin Powell.  Finally, Richard Dreyfuss's interpretation of Dick Cheney merits serious Oscar consideration.  No over-the-top trademark Dreyfuss moments here.  He is superb lurking in the shadows and lording over a map of oil wells in the Middle East.<br /><br />I only had two disappoinments walking out of the theater.  One was the limited scope of the movie.  There's no mention of what history will really recall about the Bush presidency: the questions surrounding the 2000 and 2004 elections; the moment of triumph at Yankee Stadium shortly following 9/11; the Hurricane Katrina debacle.  Of course, by including all that Stone would have been wide open to charges of political bias, and then this wouldn't have been a family film about a son vainly struggling to impress his father.<br /><br />The other disappointment was Thandie Newton.  With a vicious sneer on her face and a strange choice of enunciation, her Condi Rice is more a caricature than a portrayal.  Had the movie been more overtly political or had the other supporting actors also mocked their characters, I might not have noticed.  But here, Thandie was as overshadowed by the rest of the cast as has George W. Bush been overhshadowed by his father.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone establishes at the beginning of "W." that's it's fictional, with George Jr. imagining he's the Texas Rangers centerfielder. Conversations are invented, facts altered, important players eliminated, composite characters presented as real. Later, there's a dream sequence where Jesus tells Dubya to run for president, him drifting off to fantasy land during a strategy session and a nightmare of Pappy Bush challenging him to a fistfight.<br /><br />He's portrayed as two-faced: gregarious with the public but a bully with staff and team members. Bush eats like a pig: with his mouth open, takes a dump in a small hotel room with the bathroom door open and wife Laura nearby. He's too stupid in a press conference to answer a simple question: what's your biggest regret? Fumbles with it for two minutes. Stone relishes such bad light moments as Bush choking on a pretzel or fighting with his parents.<br /><br />At the end, after it's learned there were no WMDs in Iraq, and that the president has antagonized the world by his invasion and overthrow of Saddam Hussein, he blames everyone but himself. The last scene mimics the first: Dubya stands at the centerfield wall, looking stupidly for an invisible fly ball. (You dropped the ball, George!)<br /><br />In the director's commentary track, he never once pronounces Donald Rumsfeld's last name correctly. Why is that?<br /><br />It's no surprise that "W."  is as big a hack job as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019QEXYS">NIXON</a> (1994).<br />The only worse Stone films may be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AF4Y9G">NATURAL BORN KILLERS</a> (1995) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PLLNQ">ALEXANDER</a> (2004).<br /><br />Recommended: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005AUJR">SALVADOR</a> (1986), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004X13U">TALK RADIO</a> (1988) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767805763">U TURN</a> (1998).<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.5) W. (USA/Australia/Hong Kong/Switzerland/China-2008) - Josh Brolin/Elizabeth Banks/James Cromwell/Ellen Burstyn/Richard Dreyfuss/Toby Jones/Jeffrey Wright/Scott Glenn/Bruce McGill/Thandie Newton/Noah Wyle/Stacy Keach</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>The basic problem with the film's narrative is that it simply goes nowhere for no reason, and this is summed up in the film's final dream scene- and the film is so pointless that my iterating its end will not matter one iota. W. dreams he is playing centerfield for his old baseball team, the Texas Rangers. A ball is hit, he runs back to the centerfield wall to catch it, as he did in an earlier dream scene. Except, this time the ball never comes down. W. just looks up into the heavens with a goofy look on his face, clueless as ever. While the ending may simultaneously capture the real confusion of the real President as well as Stone's caricature, it also recapitulates the superficial glibness of Stone's whole film. It is shallow, dull, and cannot even induce the hatred inspired by the real W. Yet, even if one accepts that there is no `there' there, inside of the President, could not Stone have at least turned his guns on the American electorate for electing such an idiot? In an earlier film of Stone's, Natural Born Killers, Stone really tore the American consumerate a new hole. Granted that film was over the top where this film is too reserved, even as both are broad in their portraits. But Natural Born Killers, at least, had balls, and skewered the average American. W., by contrast, is a eunuch, and Joe Average gets off as easily as W., the real man, has.<br /><br />  That stated, the two extremes mentioned in those two films are not the only way Stone could have gone. As example, look to Nixon, and the scene where Nixon (Anthony Hopkins) forces Secretary Of State Henry Kissinger (Paul Sorvino) to pray with him during the Watergate tumult. Now, if there were ever two real men ripe for parody (especially at such a moment) it was Nixon and Kissinger. Yet, the scene, as played and filmed, is actually quite moving. Granted, part of this is because Hopkins and Sorvino are great actors, whereas Josh Brolin and the bulk of this film's cast are not. But, the screenplay was also far better, and showed Nixon as a complex if base, man. W., by contrast, is the aforementioned cipher, and, given that so much of this film relies on the fact that its audience will know much of the political minutia, for having lived through these years, this does not bode well for future viewers to whom Bush's usual suspects will seem bizarre creatures from another dimension.<br /><br />  Often, in art, a work of art is esteemed as great, not because it is technically, aesthetically, nor creatively, great, but merely because it represents a great break, or a great step forward, from what the art form offered before. What it does is not as important as what it symbolizes or represents, ideatively. Examples of this can be seen in the rather rote epopee of Homer and Virgil, the bloated religious didacticism of Dante or John Milton, the predictable comic convolutions of Charles Dickens, or some of the lesser works of Cubism, or any other school of art. Oliver Stone's latest film, W., oddly seems to invert that truism. It is a regression from not only Stone's earlier, greater films, but from satire itself. It also represents a regression for Stone even as the film is, on the surface, more entertaining than his recent offerings. But, this is a man capable of greatness, and a greatness of Shakespearian levels.<br /><br />  This film's failure, then, most likely is Stone's unwitting admission that his slow descent into irrelevance and artistic anomy will be unabated. The same thing has occurred to other great American filmmakers like Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese (despite his recent `career' Oscar for The Departed), but it makes it none the less sad and frustrating for his viewers. If only he had shown the nerve to try, this time out, one might have been able to forgive him his failure. But, Stone's own uninspired direction and effort can only elicit a shrug from fans of his work. Like breeds like- a point Stone seems to have wanted this film to make, but....yawn.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>I have seen George W.

I could not even identify the character I have seen on TV with the actor. I then read up on George W. Bush in the Wikipedia and I do not think that this movie is a fair representation of the man.<br /><br />The acting itself is not particular good.

Not that it was a complete bust, but with the talent of Oliver Stone and the richness of material on it's main character, it just seems like it should have been more than what it was. Josh Brolin does a decent George "W", but at times reminds one of Timothy Bottoms' or even Will Ferrell's just as good versions played years ago. W. also flashes back and forth from the first signs of the Iraq War showing it's cracks, to W's upbringing from a young college 20 something, then back again, then to being the owner of the Texas Rangers, back to the War, then to his running for Governor, and back again...well, you get the impression that you better take a look at the color of Brolin's hair to figure out just what year it's currently in. Secondary cast members range in acting and appearance from decent to spot-on but not one of them seems too fleshed out within the film's 2 hour and ten minute run time. Strangely, the one secondary character that gets alot of screentime is James Cromwell as Bush Senior, played off as a mean, disapproving father who never really favored W. best. Overall, if your looking for a "best Of Bush" storyline, there's a couple of scenes here to please, but alot of it you already knew from the countless news stories of the past eight years to be engaged by it so soon again. And even though when the film was made, even Bush's own presidental ending hadn't been written yet, it could have been better perceived than what ended up here. But even if Stone had a larger budget or more time (or a later one) to work on it, I doubt it could have been any better. It's a decent rental, but highly doubtful for re-election in your player again. Has a commentary and 17 minute "expert" look back at the Bush Legacy (which is bias and boring), but not nearly enough to recommend blind-buying, even if you did vote for him again in 2004 (thanks alot...).<br />(RedSabbath Rating:6.5/10)</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Here's a movie from Oliver Stone that turns out to be very restrained, somewhat drawn out, and ultimately not that compelling.  There was so much more that could have been done here, but too much time was spent on W's daddy issues and his ballpark fantasies.  Also, there should have been some mention of W's bungling of the Katrina hurricane disaster.<br />That said, Josh Brolin got the inflections down just right, while Richard Dreyfuss virtually stole the show as Dick Cheney.  The flashbacks were not confusing, and the choices of songs were perfect.<br />A mixed bag.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>Josh Brolin stars as our 43rd President in "W." (pronounced "dubya"), and he does a damned fine job.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is rather muddled.  The plot hews fairly closely to the most widely-known material and accepted facts from Bush's life - his early partying ways, his mediocrity as a businessman, and his meteoric and surprising rise to Governor of Texas and then President.  The most controversial aspects of his life are left out here, which makes the movie adhere more closely to a "typical" biopic.<br /><br />Therein is one of the fundamental problems.  Oliver Stone is known for being a liberal-minded director who isn't afraid of stirring up controversy and even fluffing up conspiracy theories (see "JFK"). His nerve seems to have failed him here or else getting older has made him more moderate; "W." is not the brutal skewering some people are likely to expect.  Bush is portrayed as a lovable buffoon, and it's a rather timid depiction.  Indeed, the tome of "W." is uneven, with some of the actors seeming to play their roles as broadly satiric (Thandie Newton's spot on "impression" of Condoleezza Rice would fit in nicely on SNL) whereas others take a more realistic approach (Richard Dreyfuss is unrecognizable as a power-hungry Dick Cheney).<br /><br />Likewise, the movie's tone lies uncomfortably in the middle, neither condemning Bush nor adding much understanding of his character.  The only aspect of his life that it explored that hasn't been examined much previously is the allegedly rather contentious relationship between Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush; who is portrayed here as profoundly disappointed with his son every step of the way, even when he is elected President.  This depiction is at odds with the public persona of George H.W. Bush and his comments about his son, but it could explain certain aspects of W.'s personality.<br /><br />In the end, "W." is likely to frustrate equally people who like Bush and those who despise him.  Perhaps it was simply too soon for this type of movie.  Although "W." only covers Bush's first term in office, most people do not yet have the distance to gain perspective on Bush and his Presidency.  Stone's commentary track suggests that he does - he discusses the intense hatred he had toward Bush during the first term as dimming.  However, this perspective has seemingly resulted in a muddled movie unlikely to make anybody very happy.  "W." was interesting and even somewhat enjoyable, but it shed little new light on our most recent ex-President.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>First, this was not as good as Oliver Stone's JFK (not even close).  That said, "W." takes a good look at how simple George W. Bush truly is.  A simple man who makes simple decisions, who doesn't understand the complexities of the world and who was always trying to get into his father's good graces by trying to out do his brother Jeb.<br /><br />The other actors in the film (most of them top notch in their field) seemed to have trouble fitting into their roles - they all seemed stiff (those who played Condi, Rummy, Colin Powel, Cheney, etc.), but perhaps they were just meant to be background for Josh Brolin (who's performance is Oscar worthy).  I guess the title of the movie should tell me who the film is ultimately about, but I expected more from the supporting cast who came up short (in my view).<br /><br />There were a few laughable moments.  One scene that stands out is when Dubbya is standing in front of his high level White House staff angrily asking where the Weapons of Mass Destruction went in Iraq which is why they decided to go to war in the first place.  He stands up shouting like a 10 year old asking his staff to tell him who was in charge (LOL).  Unbelievable.<br /><br />If you've been paying attention to American politics since the 2000 presidential election, then nothing in this movie is going to surprise you.  There's no smoking gun here.  If you haven't been paying attention or just like George Bush, you're not going to walk away with anything stunning either because you're just as 1 dimensional as he is and just won't/don't get it.  Still, "W." is worth seeing for an interesting look into George Bush's psyche... and there ain't all that much there!  It was entertaining enough and Josh Brolin's performance was spot on.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>When making a semi-biographical film, there really are two ways that one can go about the task.  The first method would be to try to be as objective as possible in trying to present all sides of a person's life and public reception equally.  Sadly, that method was most definitely not used by Oliver Stone in the making of "W".<br /><br />Upon just a surface-level viewing of the film, one might think that, objectivity-wise, it isn't really too bad.  George W. Bush is portrayed both at his worst (the college years) and at his best (the 9/11 response), including pretty much all his important life events in between.  Yet, for viewers who did not feel that Mr. Bush was the root of all political evil while in office, they will be able to see the framework from which Stone is portraying our latest departed President.<br /><br />Basically, the #1 problem inherent in "W" is that it clearly takes the stance that Bush is an idiot, no matter what the time period, situation, or office he holds.  For example, instead of the strong leadership ability that was the Bush administration's "claim to fame", Stone projects G.W. as a stupid, bumbling idiot who was nothing more than a puppet of a few of his more superior cabinet members (such as Vice President Dick Cheney).  Then there is also Stone's take on George W. Bush becoming a born-again Christian.  Instead of perhaps even hinting at the fact that Bush might have made a sincere and heartfelt transformation towards God, Stone portrays the revelation as just emboldening Bush to keep blundering through life, as now he supposedly has God to back him up.<br /><br />Unfortunately, those two examples do not stand alone...the entire film is just dripping with the "idiot Bush" mentality.  It seems to be as if Stone's thought process behind the film was not "let's make a live-action biography of George W. Bush" so much as "let's show how idiotic Bush is and yet he stills becomes President".<br /><br />Now, with that being said, the movie wasn't (by far) the worst that I have seen in terms of political favoritism/non-objectivity.  Essentially, Stone just examines the life of George W. Bush through a single prism: that of a bumbling fool who somehow became President.  Is that correct?  Who's to say...it's just one possibility.  I just wish that Stone would have widened his view a bit.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's latest film, W. is one that will, not surprisingly, attract a lot of controversy. How you feel about it will likely depend on your political views. Me, well, I'm a total flaming liberal, and I found the movie... enjoyable. Great, but not perfect.<br /><br />The movie might as well be called "George W Lives in His Daddy's Shadow", since most of the movie centers around the feelings of inadequacy that young W feels. We see him going through hazing at his fraternity, running for office in Texas (and having the Democratic candidate to him what he would go on to do to others so very well), and eventually see him getting to the White House.<br /><br />One at the White House much of the story centers around the lead up to the Iraq War. We get glimpses back to the early 1990's showing why the first President Bush didn't go all the way to Baghdad, we see George Tennant (played by the wonderful Bruce McGill, who could also play a dandy Bill Richardson), trying to explain, repeatedly, that there's no evidence of nukes in Iraq, and we see Cheney's master plan for the USA to control as much of the world's oil as we can.<br /><br />Josh Brolin is really excellent as W. He doesn't have the look, but rather like Anthony Hopkins in one of Oliver Stone's other, better films, Nixon, he does capture the body language and the voice of Bush 43. Other notable performances are Jeffery Wright as Colin Powell, Richard Dreyfus as Dick Cheney and, in one of his better performances, James Cromwell as Bush 41.<br /><br />The movie lags at parts and frankly I would've liked to have seen more about Bush as President than Bush as booze-hound or Bush as born again Christian. Still and all, it was a decent enough film and worth seeing, if for no other reason than my favorite line from the film where Bush Sr tells W something along the lines of, "You can't spend your life drinking, partying and chasing women! You're not a Kennedy, for God's sake!"<br /><br />And he's right. George W Bush is many, many things, but he's certainly no Kennedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>All movie attempts to present Bush Jr. as a cheap shadow of his daddy, Bush Sr., look mostly like the funny bubbling of own kid nasty sometimes but always "own bastard".<br /><br />Oliver Stone's speculations of Iraq and Afghanistan wars would much more convincingly sound if for start the predominant majority of American voters reject, once and forever, a non-stoppable usage of their personal cars in big cities to ease dependence on energy sources well feeding terrorists back on the American soil de-facto absorbing increasingly for "humanitarian reasons" new waves of terror breeding seed.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>but even that is cutting.

It is amazing that the man is barely out of office and film about his 8 year presidency and political career is already out.  Josh Brolin gives fantastic performance.  This actor seems to be getting better with age.<br /><br />Stone cowers everything that there is to cover about Bush Junior: from his fraternity days at Yale to failed business enterprises, his meeting Laura Welsh who became his wife, chocking on the pretzel - just about all major snafys we know about the president from his public appearances.  I particularly liked the subtle display of W.'s inability to speak proper english, use of words that only W. could come up with (such as "misunderestimated").<br /><br />While Oliver Stone is taking it easy on Laura Bush, young idealistic librarian who trades her convictions for a comfortable life with the wealthy Bush heir; he takes Bush's cabinet down with the vengeance. No one is spared from his cabinet.  Not that either one of them deserves it.  They are all sellouts who trade their integrity for the access to power.<br /><br />Surely, once you have seen this movie, you will be dazed and confused just as W. himself.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>I bet you cannot watch this movie without asking yourself, "How much of this is true?" Not just what's verified and what is speculation, but how accurate do you suppose the guesses are? It's very spooky, this movie. Holding a mirror up to what we have just lived through, and at a time when we did not yet know whether Obama would win and change things, or McCain would win and continue the basic plan.<br /><br />For one thing, most of the people who play well-known figures look quite like their roles, even Richard Dreyfuss as Darth Cheney. In fact, Josh Brolin as W. and James Cromwell as H.W. are the only two who are not particularly look-alikes, in that both actors are rather more lean and angular than the presidents were. Thandie Newton is positively spooky as Condi Rice. Toby Jones is a little smaller than Karl Rove, but just as slimy. Jeffrey Wright does not at first look all that much like Colin Powell, but he grows into the role -- or his makeup does.<br /><br />The early part of W's life is the only part we have not seen before, although we certainly heard about it. We see his fraternity initiation, but not his Skull and Bones one. We see him chatting up a Texas gal and persuading her that he's going to marry her, and then later hear that his father had to "take care of her" when she came up pregnant. He's in jail for reckless driving, and his father bails him out. But in his job in the oil fields, his try at Wall Street, and especially his lack of focus more generally, H.W. is deeply disappointed, and says so. In real life and in W.'s nightmares.<br /><br />We are also "treated" to his drying-out from alcohol, his born-again experience, his belief that God was calling him to run for president. Still, there seems to be more of the whiff of brimstone than the odor of sanctity about the man, especially ending every cabinet meeting with a silent prayer. If it was not phony, I almost wish it had been.<br /><br />The decision to invade Iraq, the Cheney power hunger, the way everyone in that cabinet room could go along with Cheney's plan to take over the entire middle east by surrounding and then conquering Iran; it's all so spooky that I simply cannot help asking myself: how much of this is the truth?<br /><br />It's a well-made movie about a very unsettling topic, and I would have preferred if the two men who portrayed the Bush presidents looked a little more like the real Bushes. Can't have everything. I would also have like more about some topics and less about others, but on the whole, the story hangs together as the biography of a man who never should have been elected to any office, let alone the presidency.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`W' follows George W Bush's path to the Whitehouse and when there, the path to war with Iraq. He comes across as a spoilt, rich boy desperately seeking his fathers approval and who slowly starts to believe his own hype and propaganda. This film shows how much influence Cheney actually had and also how much Karl Rove manipulated and lead Bush throughout his political career. The war is shown to be about oil and imperialist ambition and although Bush believed in what he was doing, he is shown to be misguided and flawed in his world view. This film is well directed with excellent performances from both Brolin and Dreyfuss. Thandie Newton, on the other hand, was terrible, her accent and overall acting is very wooden and lacks any skill whatsoever. Bush comes across as a very religious man and ultimately he let his religion influence his politics, to the detriment of world political stability and this film shows that aspect very well. This isn't the most flattered bio-pic of George W Bush but it does give a deeper understanding of his character, even if it does reinforce your negative opinions of him and his deeply flawed administration. Worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>What holds back Oliver Stone's film recitiation on the life of President George W. Bush from being better is simple: the film was made too soon, while Bush was still in office, and it excludes the final humiliation of his presidency, the decline and collapse of the employment, stock, housing and oil price markets that occurred in the shattering late summer and autumn of 2008, wrecking America's economy and making way for the Obama presidency and the revolution that followed.<br /><br />There is a certain irony about this film that director Stone, using techniques and storytelling similar to what he captured in his cinematic view of Richard Nixon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063V8K">Nixon - Collector's Edition</a>, has seemingly mellowed with age. His last notable film before this about 9/11 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLTRIQ">World Trade Center (Full Screen Edition)</a>, was even mellower in tone and less political. To say W. is not political would be wrong; but to say it is not sympathetic to its leading figure would be even more inaccurate.<br /><br />A second irony is in the casting. While Josh Brolin, a veteran of many great recent films incluidng <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00118T63C">No Country for Old Men</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011V7PSC">In the Valley of Elah</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011HOEY4">American Gangster (2-Disc Unrated Extended Edition)</a>, plays the second President Bush on film, it was his father, James Brolin, that portrayed the father of modern Republicans, President Ronald Reagan, in Showtime's biopic of his presidency <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001US6CI">The Reagans</a>. Unlike that film, where Judy Davis's portrayal of the first lady stole the show, the younger Brolin is the star here, delivering the goods as if the real W. were the handsome Hollywood actor we see on film, DVD and television.<br /><br />Assembling a group of veteran Hollywood stars to fill the critical roles around President Bush -- that includes Richard Dreyfuss as Vice-President Dick Cheney, Scott Glenn as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, Thandie Newton as Condaleza Rice and Toby Jones as Karl Rove, the conscience and political mentor of the president, the film goes far to re-enact the days of decision-making prior to the second Iraq war in 2003 and the misguided beliefs about weapons of mass destruction the country was alleged to hold. It is the realization that, after war began, the Bush administration learns there never were such weapons in the country that is the president's disgrace and the film's abrupt and untimely end.<br /><br />For W. is an incomplete film, must as much as that class you took in school were you dropped half way through because of illness and never completed, getting the I on your report card. For it was the summer and autumn of 2008 that defined the presidency of George W. Bush, just as much as it was the recession of 1991-92, and not the success of the first Iraq war, that defined his father's presidency.<br /><br />Another disappointment for me was the film's failure to address development of the "Bush doctrine" that was not borne in the White House by the Bush team, but was birthed in the office parks of Washington and suburbs by non-elected pundits and consultants. The film led one to believe W. was in control of events and policy. Whether true or not, the full impact of those policies, including the policies that led to deregulated financial markets that destroyed the housing and stock markets in September 2008, is what's not in this movie. Shame on a filmmaker of Ollie Stone's history and reputation for doing half the job.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>It is clear that this movie was made by a Bush Hater I watched it out of curiosity and did not find the movie as entertaining or factual. Once again a movie that portrays conservatives as idiotic and evil.However it was well acted, Josh Brolin does a good job, however looks old when he tried to play W in college. Oliver Stone stumbles badly because he tries to hate the President and tries to suggest that all his decisions were driven for the approval of his father. I would recommend it only if you miss Bush. I know I do....I used to love Oliver Stone but he has not made any notable movie lately, to make matters worse he is recycling his old movie material watch out for Wall Street 2.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone brings his undeniable talent to this biopic of George `Dubya' Bush.. supported by one of those to-die-for casts he seems to have at his beck and call.  There's no question this is slickly put together, and that Josh Brolin is completely convincing as the title character .... but as a movie experience there is just something missing.<br />Stone presents Bush as a follower rather than a leader.  Someone who is driven by being under the shadow of his brother in his parents eyes, and whose political drive to succeed is a mirror of his drive to succeed in his father's eyes.  Surrounding him, we have a veritable who's who of Hollywood acting as all the well known string pullers behind him and around him - most of whom are thinly drawn, not being the centre of attention - but of all of them, Richard Dreyfuss does a surprisingly good job of fleshing out Dick Cheney.  There's a little jolt of energy whenever he has a moment on screen, particularly sparring with Colin Powell.  But these are asides, with W's evolving character being the focus, and so as the movie goes on, we see Bush at different times of his life.  From College pranks through trying to find a job he wants to keep, meeting Laura, becoming born again (watch out for a great Stacey Keach turn) and starting his political career.. all told non linearly, interspersed with the period of time that will dominate his place in history - going to war with Iraq.<br />With all those fine ingredients however, it seems that something has been left out - some excitement, some dramatic hook to draw you in.  Frankly, Bush's life, rather like his presidency some would argue, is rather dull.  In the end, the enjoyment of the movie is in the details.. enjoying watching for Hollywood well known faces playing political well known faces, learning a little about Dubya's earlier life.  But we don't come away much richer for the experience.  Stone's interpretation of the man is valid, but never feels insightful enough or definitive, neither does it have the cinematic or dramatic energy of, say, `Nixon'.  It's not a disaster, but neither does it sparkle.  Sometimes interesting, never fascinating.  Perhaps it is too soon, and looking back in twenty years or more this will be regarded in higher esteem.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The spiritual successor to Stone's "Nixon" (and a better film, in large part because it's an hour shorter), W. is a surprisingly empathetic biopic that follows the classic Greek tragedy form of a man undone by his flaws--in this case, that he's just not smart or strong enough to be President--to tell an interesting, if probably largely fictitious story; if you're interested in Oliver Stone or the Bush presidency the film may be worth looking into.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>Great performances abound in this mildly interesting doc about the inept boozehound that stole the throne in the Oval office.  It shows you a glimpse of his party life in college, his pathetic attempts at sustaining a "real" job, and his incessant family afflictions.<br /><br />But W avoids being too political, much like Dubya did himself.  Although it comes off at times as somewhat critical of the president, it also avoids much of the controversial and significant moments in his presidency.  Like the doubts surrounding the election, the speech to rally public support for the War on Terror, and the inexcusable reactions to Katrina.  By dodging these topics, it leaves you feeling disappointed and manipulated.  Another well-made but ambiguous version of the truth by Oliver Stone.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>Josh Brolin carries this movie and embodies George Bush brilliantly.  You get wrapped up in his portrayal without it being a distraction.  Isn't that what's most important when taking on a role like this?  I think the movie remained fair and accurate without being overly liberal, considering most of the talent involved I'm assuming, were not Bush Fans!  The old quote "just reportin' the facts, folks" comes to mind.  I think this film put a face on how George Bush operated and functioned as a man and as our Commander In Chief.  I'm sure republicans will only deny most of the films accuracy, but I think we all know this was just a tiny slice of what really went on in that man's world.  Actually he was probably WORSE than what this film portrayed, I think they were being NICE and in the end, generous to George Bush as not too humiliate and slander him any more than what he's already done to himself.  The end scene plays out in a prolific statement that the sport he so loved baseball, was how Bush saw himself in the field of politics.  And when it really counted, that last chance at catching a home-run ball, the moment eludes him, the ball flies over his head and all he can do is sit there and look dumbfounded.  Such as his 8 years in office.  This film confirms my belief that George Bush really was a terrible man and comes from a spoiled arrogant family that seems to think they are entitled to the world on a platter.  Humble he was not which is a contradiction to his religious lifestyle.  This film is a testament to the worst presidency our country has ever had the misfortune to endure.  A special shout-out to the actor who played Colin Powell.  There was one scene that added some much needed comic relief when he told Cheney to f@#$ off.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I will say this for Mr. Stone; he is a very brave man.  He's known as one of our most controversial directors and he continues to push the envelope, not only with subject but also with construction.  Because of that he is a very `love him or hate him' kind of director.  Look at his work on films like `World Trade Center', `JFK', `Platoon' and `Natural Born Killers'.  These are all films that are so strongly opinionated and controversially designed that the illicit in the audience a reaction of acceptance or repulsion.<br /><br />Case in point; I hated `World Trade Center' yet I consider `JFK' to be one of the strongest character biopics I've seen.<br /><br />So, continuing his quest for offence, Stone decided to make a biopic on the man we all have grown to unabashedly condemn as the single worst human being brought into power in the history of the world.  Okay, so not everyone feels that way; and personally I won't even go there (since this particular subject is such a sore spot) but the general consensus is that Bush hacked up the country.  The fact that Stone wanted to do Bush's biopic is not the controversial part.  What is though is the fact that Bush was still serving as President when the film was released.  He didn't even wait for the term to end before he jumped in the director's chair and publicly critiqued the man's life.<br /><br />He may have been the most hated, but technically he was still the most powerful.<br /><br />Well, after seeing the film I can finally weigh in on how I feel Mr. Stone has done.  Stone and I have had a rocky past.  I've publicly denounced his seemingly vapid attempts to shed light on the atrocities of 9-11 or his attempt to humanize a certain rockstar, and yet, as I mentioned, he floored me with his powerhouse of a film called `JFK' and a recent viewing of `Platoon' has cemented the film in my soul.  So, lets say that I was excited to see what he could do with Bush, yet I wasn't getting my hopes up too high.<br /><br />I liked this much more than I thought I would have.<br /><br />Stone was smart in his construction here, which totally helps with the films pacing and storytelling ability.  Instead of telling the story chronologically, Stone opted to tell the story in vignettes that shift back and forth from college years to Presidency to his time as Governor.  This way the film always stays engaging.  I was shocked, but the film also never felt confusing, which sadly can happen with this style of storytelling.  The script is centered enough to keep the focus grounded and keep our attention.  I'm not a very political person and even I understood everything that was going on.  The inspired casting is also a huge bonus.  Much has been said of Brolin's performance, which is close to perfection here; but he isn't the only one.  Richard Dreyfuss, James Cromwell and Toby Jones all deliver understated yet powerful performances (Newton may have nailed her character, but she does so at the expense of the film, creating a caricature as apposed to a genuine person), especially Cromwell who embodies Bush Sr. with a sense of self-centered sympathies needed in aiding ones understanding of Bush Jr.<br /><br />So, with that said, Brolin delivers the performance of his career as President George W. Bush.  What is so impressive about this film is that while it never condones any of the horrific decisions Bush made, and it in no way shape or form paints him to be an intelligent or considerate person, it allows the audience to sympathies with the man's very human issues.  We see him being manipulated by the people around him and his genuine feelings.  Whether he is striving for his father's approval (I felt the films opening and closing with Bush in the roaring baseball stadium were perfect symbolisms of his desperation for acceptance) and struggling to find his own voice amidst the suggestions of others (that last press conference is a sublime example of this man's utter loss of individuality), `W.' paints Bush as a man, plain and simple.  No matter what your feelings are on this man and what he has done to the world, Stone delivers a sympathetic look at what could have led things to go as wrong as they did.  I was very impressed with this because it would have been very easy to spend two hours condemning a man for his mistakes.  Instead, Stone chose to point them all out yet he (along with Brolin) give this man enough of a soul that we can almost sympathize with his failure.<br /><br />What is so commendable about Brolin is that he doesn't just deliver mimicry but embodies this man with passion and uncovers who he really was, or at least who Stone perceives him to be.<br /><br />So, regardless of how accurate this one is (Stone has always been more intent of delivering his personal interpretations, which is what any visionary director SHOULD do) it is still a very insightful, enlightening and engaging portrait of a man we all think we know.  It has its flaws (some of the scenes can feel like a series of overlong conversations strung back to back) but it also has its shining moments.  If you can take the good with the bad (or visa-versa) than this is a film you should see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>No one has ever accused Oliver Stone of being subtle. However, once more people see his film concerning the life and times of George W. Bush, I think the perception about the director, which is that he is a rabid conspiracy theorist who rewrites history via Grand Guignol-fueled cinematic polemics, could begin to diminish. I'm even going to go out on a limb here (gulp!) and call W a fairly straightforward biopic.<br /><br />Stone intersperses highlights (is that the right word?) of Bush's White House years with episodic flashbacks and flash forwards, ostensibly beginning in the late 60s (when Junior was attending Yale) and taking us up to his second (interminable) term.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Stone doesn't take a point of view; he wouldn't be Oliver Stone if he didn't. He's caught flak in some corners for the amount of screen time spent dwelling on Bush's battle with the bottle (I will say that the manufacturers of Jack Daniels must have laid out some serious bucks for the ubiquitous product placement throughout the film). Bush's history of boozing is a matter of record. It's part of his story (and could explain a lot of things). Some have taken umbrage at one of the underlying themes of Stanley Weisner's screenplay, which is that Bush's angst (and the drive to succeed at all costs) is propelled by an unrequited desire to please a perennially disapproving George Senior. I'm no psychologist, but that sounds reasonable to me.<br /><br />As usual, Stone has assembled a massive cast with a bazillion speaking parts (I daresay he matches the late Robert Altman in this department).  His choice of Josh Brolin for the lead initially struck many people as an odd selection (including yours truly), but now that I have seen the film, I have to say it was a smart move. Brolin is nothing short of brilliant. He doesn't go for a cartoon caricature, which would have been the easy route to take; I think he pulls off a Daniel Day Lewis-worthy "total immersion" quite successfully. It is interesting to note that Brolin (tangential to Junior) has been accused of riding into a Hollywood career on the coattails of his dad (James Brolin) and stepmother (Barbara Streisand); if Stone chose his leading man with this in mind, he is a very canny operator.<br /><br />Some of the other standouts in the cast include Toby Jones ("Infamous") as Karl Rove, James Cromwell and the great Ellen Burstyn as President and Mrs. Bush Sr., Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell and Richard Dreyfuss (perfect!) as Dick Cheney.Scott Glenn isn't given an awful lot to do as Donald Rumsfeld, but he has the evil squint down. The only misfire is an overly mannered Thandie Newton as Condoleezza Rice; it is like she dropped in unexpectedly from a Saturday Night Live sketch. Perhaps it is not entirely her fault, because they put so much prosthetic on her face, she can barely move her lips.<br /><br />If the Bush administration had never really happened, and this was a completely fictional creation, I would be describing Stone's film by throwing out superlatives like "A wildly imaginative look at the dark side of the American Dream!" or "A vivid, savage satire for our times!" But you see, when it comes to the life and legacy of one George W. Bush and the Strangelovian nightmare that he and his cohorts have plunged this once great nation into for the last eight years, all you have to do is tell the truth...and pass the popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's "W" had the most uncomfortable effect upon this viewer of generating actual pity for George Walker Bush, a man who has wreaked more destruction and sorrow on the planet than any President in the history of the United States.<br /><br />My basic attitude toward any Stone film is "big deal" without necessarily seeing the film.  I've never understood the OS phenomenon.  Particularly with respect to his "political" films, filled with disinformation so far reaching and absurd that one is tempted to call them propaganda.  (The film "The Doors" was absolutely awful and a complete waste of a great subject. It's "success" is a consequence of the naivete of the viewers and the "music video" strain in early 90's film.) "JFK" was entertaining in a horror/intrigue sort of way, but at no point was it remotely in contact with reality.  "NBK" was just futile depravity shot in really "cool" hues of studio light.<br /><br />This film, though, garners some real respect.  There is not one scene in this move that is sensationalistic or cannot be verified factually.  All one need do is crack open a respected bio(psy) of George W.'s reign of terror to corroborate information. "State of Denial" by Bob Woodward was obviously a big influence.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is an actress who has a talent for playing women in some scary/miserable situations.  One recent example is "Requiem For A Dream", playing a drug addled mother imbibing speed constantly to avoid acknowledging her son's rapidly escalating heroin addiction.  I maintain that I would rather be the mother of the demon possessed Regan MacNeil in William Friedkin's classic "The Exorcist" than the mother of George W. Bush or Bush Sr's wife.  As the woman who once told the press that there was no need for her to waste "as beautiful a mind as her own" on the messy business of body counts launched by her husband's insurrections, Burstyn does a fantastic job.  All steel.<br /><br />The madness of the Bush/Cheney administration is given a by turns comical, depressing, and sad treatment.  Josh Brolin looks nothing like Bush, but he acts *just* like him: the baseless self confident monkeylike confidence in his every word and physical movement, the innocent Texan swagger which would eventually shoulder it's way through the constitution and economy, and, of course, his complete lack of reading comprehension or intelligible communication skills.<br /><br />Brolin gives a devastating performance as a never truly grown man who makes every wrong decision possible, all in the interest of pleasing "Poppy", Bush Sr.  All he wants to do is please his father, also played brilliantly by James Cromwell. Since he has neither the talent, ambition, intelligence or political skills to do so (as his father gently indicates when Bush bullies his brother out of the Florida Governor's election) this becomes his one goal in life.  To be what he cannot be.<br /><br />When I'd originally heard that Richard Dreyfuss was playing Dick Cheney I laughed. Real loud.  The guy from "Jaws" affecting that chilling growl of a voice and hawklike blade of a gaze seemed absurd.  (A little like Tommy Lee Jones wearing a dead racoon on his head as Clay Shaw.) I was wrong.  He pulled it off, and then some.  Cheney casts a dark shadow over every meeting, using every opportunity to push this confused man child's aggressive impulse to "even score with Saddam" and thus outdo his father.<br /><br />And it works.  There's a bit of the "unholy trinity" here: Scott Glenn cuts down Jeffrey Wright's reasonable minded Colin Powell at every opportunity, Toby Jones is fantastic as Rove, the power minded minister of propaganda who teaches Bush the four food groups: and then Cheney, who swoops down every attempt at avoiding war like a starving bird of prey biting into his first newly born worm.<br /><br />This is a chronicle of failure seen through the eyes of the man held responsible for it as unemployment rises and we slide in to a recession unprecedented since the time of Roosevelt. Millions have died in a senseless war.<br /><br />The last shot is of a George W. Bush in a baseball field while it rains.  He is holding a a glove open, eager to catch the ball.  He doesn't.<br /><br />I felt terrible for Bush by the end of this movie.  Do I now, a few days later?  No.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Something I have recently learned about Oliver Stone movies: They make lousy theater flicks - but they're great to watch on DVD.<br /><br />Think back to JFK, Alexander, and now W. all of these films are too long for a theater showing. Even W., clocking in at 2 hours, seems to stumble on forever.<br /><br />But they're good on DVD because you can turn them off and go live life, and come back to engage once again.<br /><br />W. stars:<br /><br />Josh Brolin as George W. Bush<br />Toby Jones as Karl Rove<br />Jeffery Wright as Colin Powell<br />Thandie Newton (MI:2) as Condi Rice<br />Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld<br />Richard Dreyfuss as Dick Cheney<br />and James Cromwell as George H. W. Bush<br /><br />This film documents George W Bush's rise in politics, his family life and the process that led to the Iraq War.<br /><br />I like how they spun this film: Like him or love him, George W Bush is one of the most controversial persons of our time.<br /><br />This film doesn't cater to any one point of view; they show his drinking problems, they show his turn to faith in Jesus, they show his presidency.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film, but next time, I'll be sure to hit the pause button a few times.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Wasn't <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CDL93">JFK</a> a great movie?  Sure, there was some artistic license taken here and there by Director Oliver Stone.  Actually, quite a lot!  But there were JUST ENOUGH snippets of truth to make you, the viewer, think that this was a plausible course of events.<br /><br />Then came W.  Same pattern... snippets of truth and gobs of speculation.<br /><br />But why not?  In lieu of having actual documentation about the care and feeding of George W. Bush (played well by Josh Brolin) and the development of his political career, we have... speculation.  Oh, and Oliver Stone can speculate.  BOY, can he speculate!<br /><br />I think Bush detractors will give this movie a thumbs-up, and Bush supporters will give it a thumbs-down.  As a movie, however, it was fascinating, engaging, and engrossing.  It's the Republican-bashing version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227973">Primary Colors</a>.<br /><br />And since we shouldn't only be exposed to the movies and books which already mirror our worldviews, W. should be seen, and discussed, by many.<br /><br />The conversation afterwards will be... interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Let me start off by saying that I am not a Republican nor did I vote for either Bush.  So I started off viewing this movie expecting to see W skewered.  I am pleasantly surprised that did not happen.  Instead, I saw a complex portrait of the shaping of a man and a president over many years.  I won't go as far as to say I am now sympathetic to Bush but I understand him and his choices better now. First, I was surprised to see how poorly W wore the Bush mantle.  It was clear that everything W did was less than his father or grandfather or brother Jeb or any other Bush had done.  He couldn't fail to miss this as his parents told him this constantly.  What Bush senior failed to see though was that W could get in touch with the common man yet hold onto the elitist ones with some very conflicting personality traits.  He became a born again Christian as a way of coping with his substance abuse problems.  Somehow he managed to blend being born again with being a guy who had been to all the right schools, joined all the right clubs and gravitated to all the right people for his time in history. His parents were repelled by some of his choices: his being born again set up their Episcopalian backs plus his use of the death penalty repeatedly as governor of Texas was not something they'd want sitting in their own personal biographies.  Clearly, Phi Beta Kappa Jeb who behaved like a true Yale man was more the Bush son they liked to embrace.  Yet the very way W talks in his down home voice, loves baseball and follows it religiously, is a guy anyone would "like to share a beer with" and is the life of the party at any frat party or down home barbeque--all of this serves W very, very well with the voters.  In short, he is not off putting like the rest of the elitist Bushes. W seems to genuinely love his country and wants to restore it to bigness.  He goes about this more like a guy who owns a baseball team than a President, which is actually what he did for a living and what he loved doing.  Thus, by the end of the movie when he is in the outfield with his mitt, eternally ready to catch that long baseball hit, the look on his face is one of total all out bewilderment. He is also entirely alone out in the outfield.  This is W by the end of his presidency in a nutshell.<br /><br />Actually, W's underlings come off a lot worse than he does in this film.  Right at the top of the heap of awfulness is Richard Dreyfus playing Cheney and, boy, does Dreyfus nail Cheney as a character.<br /><br />I should have realized Oliver Stone could pull this off.  Josh Brolin does a heck of a job as W.  He has become an incredibly fine actor and I am looking forward to each and every performance of his.  I liked this movie the first time but I thought it was terrific the second time. Oliver Stone rarely disappoints as a film director.  A lot of people detest him but they fail to view him solely as a film director, rather than as an obnoxious personality in real life. He shoots himself in the foot every time he opens his mouth off set and would do himself a big favor if he stopped giving interviews.  As a director, he is still one of our finest talents.</p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>You never know with Oliver Stone,  whether you will get his penchant for exaggeration, or his ability to bring a character into sharper focus. There wasn't much of the first, but there wasn't much of the second either.<br /><br />Only a few of the dozens of Bushborne, misfired, verbal synapses came across the screen, but usually in the wrong context, and almost as an afterthought. Stone instead tries to tell us about Bush from his college days onward where we learn of his ability to memorize the names of his fraternity brothers, in short order, without memorizing much else from his four years at Yale. This left me feeling a little cheated. I knew these things. For the person I watched it with, I was hailed with a number of, did-he-really-say/do-that. It was a revelation for her, and this film was much more to her fulfillment and amusement than mine.<br /><br />One reviewer found the right phrase that I couldn't muster more than a Bushism for what it was lacking. It's as if this movie wasn't sure if it was a comedy or a drama. Josh Brolin does a superb Bush characterization, as does Dreyfus as Dick Cheney, and the one in the role of Karl Rove as the turdblossom toady. The characters for Rice, Powell, and Rumsfeld are less believable, and Powell's one-man fight against the others underscores his departure after one term.<br /><br />Oliver Stone brings out some of the worst of George who got a woman pregnant back in the days when he still believed in a woman's right to choose. No time is spent in his Air National Guard days, and there is no mention of Bush's pathological childhood behavior, or his slovenliness when he left his apartment with rent unpaid and substantial repair required. We learn how he met Laura Bush who had a profound impression on him--because he started changing his socks everyday rather than three. We do see his early lack of impulse control when Laura confesses that his speech was bad, and he reacts by smashing the car into the driveway door. On an earlier occasion, we see Georgie, three sheets to the wind, driving his car onto the front lawn, amd making a drunken challenge to his fight his father.<br /><br />What Stone wants to convey is that Dumbya is a loser in spirit and intellect, that his name, his father's accomplishments and contacts bailed him out of one social or career misadventure after another. George showed little patience and even less aptitude for Wall Street or oil drilling while harboring the unrealistic hope that there was some future for him in baseball. It is little wonder that the family put their hopes in his brother Jeb.<br /><br />This is comedy light and drama light fare that is not bad to watch, but not one you might want to see a second time, especially if you are hoping for some depth and insight in discovering how such a maladjusted personality and such an underachiever could have ever reached the White House. That means it is probably better as a rental from a service or library, rather than as a purchase.<br /><br />I rate this as a stone's throw above a three.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"W." is a look at the 43rd President of the United States (Brolin), and is told in a non-linear fashion.  The main story takes place from about 2002 onward, while flashing back to key points in Bush's past, including his time at Yale, meeting Laura (Banks), working for his father (Cromwell), and his decision to run for governor of Texas.  In the "present", Bush is dealing with the Iraq war and its ramifications.<br /><br />"W." is an odd film that sometimes tries to be a serious drama, and other times branches off into satire territory.  It is interesting, looking at Bush's "daddy issues" and their motivation for the man he becomes.  But then, performances like Newton's Condoleezza Rice are downright campy and take away from the overall effect of the film.  Also, dream sequences undermine the factual elements of the film, since it is unlikely that President Bush had any input into this film.  Brolin's performance is solid enough to make this worth seeing.  Bush does not really come off that bad, the same cannot be said for Cheney.  Liberals will think it doesn't go far enough, conservatives will think it went to far, and those in the middle will probably find it the most interesting.  Any way you look at it, "W." will have you talking.</p></br></body></html>

The character Eastwood portrays as a former auto worker was very much like my grandfather.  His values are tested when someone attempts to finish his new neighbors.  I have to reccomend this one because we get to see a sensitivity that Eastwood ever revealed to his viewers in a long time. If your expecting Dirty Harry, look out, it's far different than I'd ever thought it'd be.  An excellent contender for an Oscar. If you can buy this one.  You'll want to watch it more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film a lot. Clint Eastwood does a great job as both actor and director, and the story challenges to viewer - it's not regular Clint fare, but it is both entertaining and moving. The approach to an old man winding down his life, and a young man entering manhood works fantastically. Strong stuff, well worth a view.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>"Gran Torino" is actor/director Clint Eastwood's best film, hands down.  The way he coordinates the demands of his increasing age with the remarkably bitter and yet deeply decent character, Walt Kowalski, reflects a man rigorously dedicated not only to his art but to making sense of the ruthless, ultra macho image that has been created around him since "Dirty Harry".<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is an embittered Korean veteran who lives in a bad area of Detroit with the Humungs, a group of Koreans who fought with the United States in Vietnam and relocated to various economically impoverished areas.  Walt liberally uses the terms gook, spook, dragon people, and an assorted list of racial epithets that fire off so easily one can't help be amused by them.  He's a man of a different generation and is not a "value racist": this is how he has emerged from warfare and 1950's Americana.<br /><br />Walt is in some ways like a ghost.  The values he cherishes--extreme masculinity, tribal patriotism, family, and even the proper way to approach the tabernacle in the Catholic Church--seem to be disappearing before his eyes.  His faith is also questionable at the beginning of the film. After his wife's funeral, he tells a young priest that he has no desire whatsoever to confess to an "overeducated 27 year virgin who holds the hands of old women and promises them eternal life."<br /><br />His Korean neighbors reciprocate his feelings of animosity.  There are parts of this fim that are drop dead funny because political correctness is dropped entirely.  Walt is not unlike the racist grandparents some of us have had, and if we have, we immediately feel a mix of repugnance and adoration for his absolute certitude in all situations.  Including putting an M-1 to the head of a gangster who steps on his lawn.<br /><br />Thao, a young Korean who lives near Walt, is pressured by his cousin to join the local gang.  After mistakenly trying to fit in with the gang and steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino, which he built himself,<br />they see him as a punk but still insist he try another criminal act to be initiated into the gang.<br /><br />The rest of the film is a meditation on mortality, self sacrifice, and what it means to love another group of people regardless of race, ethnicity, or anything.  The ending, though sad, is also beautiful.<br /><br />One of the top ten films of 2008.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>Walt is a foul-mouthed, bigotted, ex-autoworker, veteran of the Korean war. The movie starts with his wife's funeral. The funeral brings in Walt's estrangement with his family and grandchildren. Walt bemoans that his neighborhood is becoming non-white. What the movie does well is portraying how Walt is brought into a relationship with the Hmong family next door. The movies exposes the bigotry of Walt, but what Walt respects most is character. The kid next door is a doormat, but he show compassion for his neighbor. Tau's sister, is spunky and brave, and Walt learns to respect and like her. Walt gets pulled into their community because they need him and in turn he needs them. Food plays a key role in this movie like it does in most communities.<br /><br />All the acting is superb. The movie is deadly serious, but there are some really funny scenes in the movie. Walt's relationship with his barber is hilarious. The relationship with the old lady next door is funny as well.<br /><br />The continuing dialog between Walt and the persistent priest is very good. Walt dislikes the priest at first, but Walt starts to admire him for his intelligence and compassion.<br /><br />This movie confronts bigotry far better than "Crash" and without all the heavy moralizing and coincidences. This movie gives its characters actual personalities and intelligence not just cariacatures.<br /><br />Clint looks old in the movie, but he creates a very memorable character. The movie has very limited special effects, no flashbacks, and limited conversation. The movie centers mostly on Walt with very few side trips. The movie really works with the sparse direction.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwoods' post production period on "Changeling" (2008) is when he apparently found the time to craft "Gran Torino". Only an institution as archaic and delusional as the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences could neglect this work of art during awards season, and like "Changeling", this too was shut out in all major categories (and sadly, even from the minor categories). What this says about the members' cinematic tastes one can only speculate upon, but chances are they haven't properly understood the depth and brilliance contained within this concise motion picture.<br /><br />As one reviewer aptly stated, this film is not about the car (1972 was a good year for Ford), but the car does come to represent the very essence of the lead character. He plays a mean-spirited old man who is racist, conservative, rude and anti-social, but at the heart of it he seems to be the very opposite of all these things. The film casts him as the sole white resident of an increasingly ethnically diverse lower-income neighborhood, and his attitudes (as vintage as his car) seem to reflect a dying America that seems unable to cope with the diversity brought about by immigration.<br /><br />The film also pays homage to the Hmong people, a true group of Eastern people who were displaced early on, and who have found pockets of solace within America. Even within Eastern societies, this particular group of people have been looked upon as overly conservative and traditional, a fact that the film lovingly pays tribute to, without hitting you over the head with it. Many mainstream publications seem to indicate that this film is about tackling racism and overcoming color lines. Well, that is but part of it, and in many ways not even. Race becomes a very secondary issue here, and by the end of the film you find yourself unable to find the issue relevant at all.<br /><br />Ultimately, the story is about a widower who finds he has no purpose in life, but he also has a difficult past, having been in the military at one point. There are thousands of such veterans all over the world, and this could be their story. Whats incredible is that even though most of our lives are far removed from the lead characters', you will find yourself empathizing with the character, and his racist attitudes seem almost humorous (it also seems that he is less racist than he is territorial).<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is not a thriller or a fast-paced action film as its' misleading cover might indicate. Hardly. There are a few scenes of violence and one unnerving segment featuring a female lead (a great acting job by Eastwood here), but other than that, this is largely dialog driven. Its' most affecting segments come when Eastwood tries to integrate with his Eastern neighbors - largely humorous, but you'll find yourself relating to these scenes in ways you hadn't imagined. The standout performance is by the young lad who plays Thao, who plays the second lead - its an innocent, camera-friendly performance that relies more on fortitude than actual acting, but he does a commendable job.<br /><br />This is also clearly not a film for everybody. Some may find it heavy-handed and unbelievable, but the end of the film is so moving and apt, that it should get to the most jaded viewer. Prime bits of trivia also litter the films sets, and more educated audiences will have fun trying to pick up on them. For the record, this also marks the debut of Clint Eastwoods' youngest child, a 21 year old actor. Try to find out where he features - its one of the standouts of the entire film for many reasons.<br /><br />Four and a Half Stars. A beautiful work of cinema, and testament to the fact that Clint gets better with age.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>If, as I've heard rumored, Gran Torino turns out to mark Clint Eastwood's final film role, he'll at least have gone out with another memorable performance to add to his long list.  Portraying the unlikely friendship that develops between a disaffected 70-something Korean War vet and the son and daughter of a Hmong family that lives next door, the movie is a surprisingly affecting and at times even funny story of personal redemption and cultural collision.  With a backdrop of urban decay and gang violence, it also makes for an interesting portrait of the continuing decline of the American city, even if its ultimate focus is more personal.  Much like The Wrestler, another of the past year's best films, Gran Torino provides a look at the kind of people and areas many of us don't see in our daily lives, let alone in movies, and portrays its characters sympathetically without neglecting their flaws.<br /><br />The film is largely carried by Eastwood, whose well-established tough-guy identity gets a new twist in the form of Walt Kowalski, a retired Ford worker who stubbornly clings to his house and his old-school ways in a Detroit neighborhood that's rapidly being taken over by immigrants and a larger world that no longer seems to be his own.  In a way, Walt represents the flip side of Eastwood's iconic characters and persona: he's The Man With No Name turned into a dinosaur, Dirty Harry rendered irrelevant by changing times.  We first see Walt snarling his way through his beloved wife's funeral, angered by the various signs of modernity he sees around him and the lack of respect shown by his descendents.  As the movie goes on we get a better idea of the reaons for Walt's anger: his sons have grown into suburban yuppies with overprivileged brats for children, and his middle-class neighborhood has come to be dominated by minorities, especially Hmong immigrants whom he describes using a variety of disparaging epithets.  This is clearly a guy who's not too familiar with the concept of political correctness and who feels no need to discard the prejudices he's taken for granted his whole adult life.<br /><br />It would be easy, especially at first, to dismiss Walt as a simple crank and bigot, and while that description wouldn't necessarily be inaccurate it wouldn't tell the whole story either.  In his own way, Walt is an idealist, one who believes in certain values--patriotism, self-sacrifice, hard work, proper lawn care--that he believes (rightly or not) aren't shared by his new neighbors.  As we see through a series of conversations with the well-meaning local priest, Walt has fallen victim in his old age to a combination of cynicism, alienation, and racial hatred, born of his harrowing experiences in Korea and a mounting disgruntlement at a world that's relentlessly changing around him.  The film does do a pretty good job (largely through Walt's growled declarations to himself) of allowing the viewer to see the world through the eyes of an aging man who's surrounded by the unfamiliar and having a hard time adjusting to it.  Charged at age 78 with largely carrying the film, Eastwood has the difficult task of turning Walt from a caricature to fully fleshed-out character over the course of two hours, a feat that few others could pull off but that's helped immensely by his natural gravity and his own gritty, stark direction.<br /><br />While Walt may seem like a giant ball of hate at first, he does eventually start to warm up to his teenaged Hmong neighbor Sue (Ahney Her) and later to her brother Thao (Bee Vang), even after Thao tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation.  The bond that gradually emerges between Walt and Thao may be unlikely at first based on Walt's obvious hostility toward other races, but it eventually comes to seem perfectly natural because they're both committed to maintaining their integrity in a world that doesn't seem to have much room for it.  Thao is trying to make his own way in an immigrant society of limited horizons, with few options for the future beyond taking a menial job or joining his cousin's gang, when Walt sees enough potential in him to try to help him overcome the limitations of his surroundings.  Vang has to turn Thao into a real, conflicted person rather than just an idealized symbol of his people, and while he's not as good as Eastwood he still does an admirable job of keeping up with his legendary costar.  Scenes of Walt developing a comfort level with his Hmong neighbors carry an almost sociological fascination, along with the irony of a cranky old racist getting absorbed into the world of Asian immigrants while his relationships with his own family become increasingly strained.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of a few flaws, Gran Torino manages to be a largely excellent movie.  The opening scenes of Walt expressing his seemingly all-consuming bitterness and hatred can get a bit tiresome, and the ending is a little over-the-top and dramatic compared to what preceded it, but there's still more than enough quality material to make this film worth watching.  The slower, more contemplative middle section is actually the most interesting part of the movie, as we see the challenges faced by both the aging Walt and the coming-of-age Thao in their daily lives, as well as the slow, awkward process of Walt letting his guard down enough to become a mentor to Thao.  Those looking for a change of pace from the never-ending stream of remakes and TV and comic-book adaptations coming out of Hollywood could certainly do a lot worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>GRAN TORINO<br /><br />***** Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- December 12th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 116-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- Nick Schenk<br /><br />Director- Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Starring- Clint Eastwood, Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Christopher Carley<br /><br />2008 was a great year in the legendary career of Clint Eastwood as he delivered two of the best films of his career with Changeling and Gran Torino; both of these movies were two of the very best of 2008 and I fail to understand how neither of these movies received a best picture nomination or best director. If Gran Torino is Eastwood's last acting gig he sure as hell went out with a bang with what just might be the best performance of his career.<br /><br />Gran Torino is vintage Eastwood he's made a career playing the tough guy and he is the last of the ultimate film tough guys with Bronson and McQueen no longer with us. Even in his late 70s Clint can still pull the tough guy role off to perfection; Think of Clint's character as maybe an older Dirty Harry in terms of the tough guy persona. Again even at his age you never doubt that he's still the ultimate tough guy. And again this is vintage Eastwood.<br /><br />Gran Torino gets off to a solid start, but there isn't anything that really stands out, but as the movie goes on it simply gets better and better and by the end of the movie I was blown away by how amazing of a movie this was and it had me in awe. Gran Torino is an instant classic and one of the best movies in Clint Eastwood's career both as an actor and as a director.<br /><br />The screenplay by Nick Schenk was slightly clich&eacute;d in some spots, but overall it worked well with some truly great characters that are also very well developed, which is something rare these days in Hollywood. Gran Torino may not have the perfect screenplay, but it's a very good one. The dramatic scenes play out well and there is also some comedy and both these elements really work very well. Like I said the characters are fleshed out and developed and all the main characters will get a reaction from the viewer. So even if Gran Torino is slightly clich&eacute;d in spots, Nick Schenk makes up for it with some truly great characters.<br /><br />As director Clint Eastwood knocks it out of the park with a truly gripping and touching movie. At first I wasn't really a big fan of Eastwood's direction. I never felt he was a poor director well outside of maybe The Rookie, which was a bit poor. But I never felt he was a bad director, but I never really got into his direction. But over the years I have found a new appreciation for Eastwood as a director and he's by far one of my favorite directors now. What makes Eastwood such a great filmmaker is his simplicity, which can sometimes bring a filmmaker down, but Clint doesn't try and be flashy and simply tells the story.<br /><br />Gran Torino again was truly gripping and touching; Eastwood hits all the right spots in terms of drama and comedy and really brings you into this world and makes you care for the characters. The action sequences are brief, but all pack a punch and aren't overdone, but done in a simple way that makes them all the more powerful. It seems like the Academy always nominates Eastwood every chance they get, but why he was snubbed for Gran Torino and Changeling is beyond me. Gran Torino is everything it's been made out to be and more. As filmmakers get older normally they don't get better. But Clint is just as great now as he ever was and maybe in some ways better.<br /><br />About the only real flaw one can find with Gran Torino is possibly the acting. While none of the performances are terrible, but some are a bit wooden. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, but he doesn't have a lot of range. He pretty much plays a variation of the same character for the most part and by no means is that an insult. Eastwood is possibly the best at the role he plays. Outside of Bronson and McQueen nobody can play the tough guy like Eastwood and I'd say he's a better actor than Bronson, but sorry I'd have to give McQueen the edge. But while Clint may not have the most range he's still a fantastic actor, but here with Gran Torino his performance was mind blowing. In terms of acting I think Unforgiven and Gran Torino were his two best as far as range goes. As Walt Kowalski, Eastwood is funny, sympathetic and very likeable. Eastwood shows a great deal of range and I truly believe an Oscar nomination should have come his way.<br /><br />Making their film debuts are Bee Vang as Thao and Ahney Her as Sue and both actors show some potential. Bee Vang does well and while his performance is by no means perfect and a little rough around the edges in some spots, but he handles it well and his character was likeable. Again it was his film debut so you cannot expect perfection, but overall he does well even if a little stiff at times, but since the character was likeable I'll give him the passing grade. Ahney Her however steals the show with a really great and energetic performance and what she has going for her is charisma. Each scene Ahney was in she really lit up the screen and brought a lot of fun to the character.<br /><br />Gran Torino was no doubt one of the best movies of 2008 and Eastwood's performance is one of the best if not the best of his career. Despite some clich&eacute;s Gran Torino works on every level and is a must see for all Eastwood fans.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release for Gran Torino was simply just ok; the picture quality is excellent and no complaints there; the sound was alright, but nothing really special. The features though are quite weak the Blu-ray has an exclusive feature about the making of the movie, which was pretty cool, but such a great movie and such a poor release just isn't right.</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>Clint, back in form, playing a familiar but new dark hero who is older, grouchier and less PC than Superman and Green Lantern.

My personal favorite will always be the said UNFORGIVEN but GRAN TORINO is definetely in my top 5 favorite Eastwoods. The sight of the boy driving the car by the lake at the very end should have you smiling from ear to ear. Just great.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood did it again. Another fine effort from the man that has given excitement in many of his movies. This times he tackles life in a neighborhood that has changed with new immigrants.During the movie you find his relationship with his family is rocky and his wife's priest interesting at times. It also features moments that Eastwood is known for...his stand for what is right against being double crossed and for standing up for friends. One of his lines in "Gran Torino" is "I'm not a hero"...to me Eastwood is a hero of good cinema fare! I enjoyed G.T.!</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This film, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is nothing short of a delightful gift to those of us who have loved Clint Eastwood through the years.  Here, he plays the role of a nasty old Korean War veteran who thinks like it's still the 1950s and is angry all the time.  His wife has just died, his two sons don't respect him and his granddaughter wears a belly ring and wants his vintage 1972 Gran Torino car which he, himself, assembled when he worked in a Ford plant many years before.  Also, a young-fresh faced Catholic priest keeps hounding him to go to confession.<br /><br />Clint lives alone in a neighborhood that is fast becoming multicultural and he hates his Hmong neighbors which he refers to as "gooks."  But things change when he catches the teenager, Thao, from next door trying to steal his prized automobile.  The teen's sister, Sue, convinces Clint to let the boy work off his debt and soon a begrudging respect seems to soften Clint a little as he see how hard the boy works.<br /><br />The neighborhood is rife with gang warfare and drive-by shootings are common.  So is the constant recruitment of the gangs for new members and the Hmong gang wants Thao.  Clint starts to train Thao for a job in the construction industry so that he doesn't have to join the gang and this leads to some of the funniest scenes in the film as he tries to teach Thao to "act like a man" and throw ethnic insults at everyone.  Thao becomes his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Clint becomes friendly with the Hmong family, especially when the women keep bringing him food.<br /><br />Soon, though there is a crisis and Clint, who we soon discover is probably dying, must prove himself as a hero.  I knew he would do something but was surprised at the complexity of the conclusion, which made the film work as a whole and ended in an extremely satisfying way.<br /><br />I loved this film.  I laughed out loud at times and also felt real emotion as Clint grows to accept the present world in which he lives and winds up emerging a hero.  I have nothing but accolades for this production although I know that some might cringe at the racist insults and find it a little too violent.  But that's what a Clint Eastwood film is about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I was shocked that the Academy virtually ignored this fine film and heaped praise upon the over-rated "Slumdog Millionaire" when this film explores the important issues of assimiliation and gang violence as well as "Slumdog" did but with so much more power.  If Eastwood is implying that this is "farewell" movie than he couldn't choose better one to sign off on.  Yet as one reviewer stated you could nit-pick that neighborhood Clint's character lives in is basically Africain American but doesn't deflate what the movie is about.  Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is probably one of the most complex and ambiguous character that he has ever played.  No wonder that the National Board of Review voted him "Best Actor of the Year"----and this is from a nation-wide survey of critics across the country.  Like another perennial Oscar best actor loser, Peter O'Toole, Clint may just have to accept a "Achievement Award" from the Academy. Anyway, shame on you Academy--it's really about politics and not about quality since how can an Italian comedian (Roberto Benigi) win for the atrocious "Life is Beautiful" (probably thanks to the Weinstein's constant promotion).</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>I love this film and ,when seeing it in the theater, it was nothing like I expected and everything I hoped for.  The 5 stars go to an incredibly moving, dramatic and humorous film that should have won an Academy award for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best everything.  That said, there are plenty of reviews here already doing a book report on the plot so I will refrain from that.<br /><br />So lets take a look at the Blu Ray version and how it stacks up to the Standard version which I also own. The Standard DVD version was not bad to begin with.  The Blu Ray video transfer is good, not great.  There is a scene early in the film when a car pulls up and you can clearly see aliasing/stairstepping in the cars chrome grill.  Seeing this, I look for those artifacts in other areas of the video transfer but failed to find them.  As this is a dark film, somewhat  desaturated in color, the shadows retain depth and detail as a blu ray transfer should, but, then again, so did the standard def version.  The Audio is DDHD and, as this is a very dialogue driven film, there was little use for the surround speakers or sub. There was some use of the front side channels when cars were driven but that was about it.<br /><br />The extras were the typical commentaries, and an interesting and informative 'making of' with a good amount of discussion regarding integrating the Hmong culture and actors within the film.  This was well worth watching.  Really don't see the big deal about BD Live...does anyone really use it?  I would have rather space been used for deleted scenes, of which there were none, out takes and the like.  You were able to see some original audition clips for the parts of Sue and Thao and I would have liked more of this.<br /><br />I buy movies on Blu Ray for a serious upgrade of both video and audio.  While this movie gets 5 stars because it is a great film, for those who have the standard def version, I do not believe that you will see a significant difference between it and the blu ray version.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

It is undoubtedly one of the best films. The story is about an elderly man, an award winning veteran of the Korean War, an atheist, who has never been found contentment in life, whose wife just died, and who, knowing her husband's problems, asks a young parish priest to look after him. He lives in a neighborhood that has changed, surrounded by Orientals who he calls gooks, whom he doesn't understand and dislikes intensely. He is very possessive of what he has and wants to be left alone. He becomes involved with his neighbors when they are attacked by a gang. Everything about the film is great, the story, plot development, acting, pacing, suspense, scenery.<br /><br /> Viewers can be stimulated to ask lots of questions about the many issues raised in the film. These include: the problems of growing old, death of a spouse, illness among the aged, getting along with children, grandchildren, and neighbors, handling neighborhood gangs, prejudice, bad and belittling language, finding meaning in life, the existence of life after death, the impact of wars and killing, revenge, are clergy equipped to address problems they never faced. Most significantly is the issue of change: can an irascible discontented elderly man, who has no ability to interact with his own family, find meaning and love from strangers?</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>Wow, this was a great flick with a cool ending that I didn't see coming.

So when "Gran Torino" came out, I knew I will have to see it.  This film is a work of genious on so many levels. It is setup in the working class Detroit that inevitably like most cities, keeps changing.  Eastwood's characted Walt Kowalski is no so keen and eager on adjusting.  It is the death of his wife and her funeral that break heart watching this growling man come to terms that the term "dysfunctional family" has a whole new meaning for his own.<br /><br />Alone, retired and left to his own devices, Walt is forced to accept his Hmong neighbours who in turn take care of him in their own way.  How can a man so full of bitterness, prejudices and contempt for the world around him adjust to this arrangment?  Well, you have to see the movie because it will break your heart.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is building his own legacy that will remain a legend on its own.  This is one of the best movies I have seen lately.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Please note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't comment on the video quality.<br /><br />Gran Torino is perhaps both Eastwood's best movie and his best acting performance yet. He plays a crusty, grumpy, hardened Korean War veteran who doesn't take you know what from anybody. He brings a brooding, smoldering intensity to the character of a retired, working-class white man who doesn't like how his neighborhood has been taken over by various minorities and gangs over the years, becoming crime ridden and the homes falling into disrepair. In fact, he seems to be the only white guy left. But despite his racist feelings, he dislikes bullies and senseless violence even more, and when he comes to the aid of the neighboring Hmong boy when he's victimized by the local Asian gang, he unwittingly and unwillingly becomes a hero to the boy and his family.<br /><br />Eastwood strikes up an awkward friendship with the boy, and teaches him the old fashioned values he grew up with: hard work, self-reliance, independence, discipline, and integrity, values that he sees very little in evidence in his now fallen neighborhood. The scene where he teaches the boy "to talk like a man" is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in any movie, so despite the overall serious tone of the movie, it's not without its humorous moments too. Overall, it's a remarkable performance and movie from Eastwood and a fitting cap to a great career. Even if he retires after this he will have gone out at the top of his game. Not many people who are still working at age 78 can say that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Well, after all the hype, I can say with complete honesty- this movie moved me in the way I was hoping it would.<br /><br />For the last several months I've been trying to find a way to watch Gran Torino.  All year long it was like the number one movie on my mind that I felt I simply HAD to watch.<br /><br />All the awards the film won, all the frequent mentions of Clint Eastwood blowing us away with his performance, and...<br /><br />the film was actually as good as most people said it would be.  This doesn't happen very often!<br /><br />I was seriously moved by the engaging storyline from beginning to end.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood playing the role of a stubborn old man that none of his family seems to care about and becoming bitter and angry at the world as a result was delivered *flawlessly*<br /><br />I'm a bit surprised the storyline focused so much on Clint's character building a relationship between his neighbors and himself, and less on the part about trying to protect his home from the never-ending gang fights taking place outside.<br /><br />The actual gang fights were about 50% of the film, while the other half dealt with Clint and the young boy from next store getting to know each other better and building a friendship through patience, hard work and a willingness for Clint to finally open up and accept his neighbors.<br /><br />This is truly a great movie with an ending that might move you in a way you've never felt before.  It's a bit of a shocking ending to me, but I guess the more I think about it while typing up this review, it's the kind of ending to be expected.<br /><br />I can't think of another way to make the outcome more realistic, while also keeping in mind that the intention of the writers while putting together this film was to make an impact on the viewers, let's put it that way.<br /><br />There's a couple hidden messages behind the storyline as well- always accept others, don't be so quick to judge, and never follow through with your initial reactions.  There's also a message that you can in fact change people who are always in trouble with the law.<br /><br />Overall, yeah, this movie is simply terrific the entire way through.  A brilliant job by everyone involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Gran Torino(WideScreen Edition DVD):<br /><br />Let me start by Saying I am a big Clint fan, however I won't go see Invictus because it seems to be typical Mandela Propaganda(he's a Communist/castrolover), So I am disappointed Clint Directed that Film,That Said, This movie Should Have won Best Movie! I am not one for Redemption movies, but Thought Clint did a Great job, The Car,Sadly A Ford Gran Torino 1972, (I like Vettes.then Chevy/GM) doesn't do much nor do you hear the engine roar(or Sputter?-Ford)But the point is the movie, the Acting, The Main Character's Family, and how they could care less about him and just want him to croak or live in a Old Folks Home*Near Typical American family* is very sad.People don't have any morals or respect anymore,especially the youth(and Btw I am 27,was raised different).

While I think it is too easy to describe him as a racist, he is of the glib, crusty, irascible curmugeon type.  Indeed, he reminds me of my father - hard-edged and seemingly offensive (some people would get hurt and insulted, to be sure), but in fact with a good heart and natural nobility.  Eastwood plays it with unmistakable charisma.  I marvelled at the skill with which Eastwood pealed away layers of his character, from his crudeness to his soul-searching and ethic of community.<br /><br />The situation is that, his wife having died and his sons alienated, he is wondering what to do with himself.  He is rude to his Hmong neighbors, but comes to see them as truly worthy people in need of help and nurturing.  His evolution from suspicion and a playful hostility with the Hmong grandmother are totally believable.  In particular, he befirends a boy who is at a crossroads, even taking him to a barber in order to teach him how to trade manly insults.  Their chemistry as it evolves is beautiful, to the point of bringing tears to my eyes.  When his plans to help go awry, he hatches a very clever plan.<br /><br />I watched this twice and was moved each time and noticed more detail.  It is a masterpiece and an unusual story for Hollywood to do.  Warmly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>"Gran Torino" is a gem of a movie that once again affirms Clint Eastwood's brilliant abilities. From beginning till end, I found my attention transfixed on the screen, the story is that compelling.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski who has recently been widowed. He seems irascible, perpetually squinting in disapproval, basically a curmudgeon. He does not seem to have a loving relationship with his two grown sons who are both married with families of their own. Walt is also something of a racist, spewing some racial slurs at the Hmong family that has moved next door.<br /><br />Within this setting, Walt's path crosses that of the Hmong family next door with some surprising results - the young Hmong teenager, a boy named Thao [Bee Vang] is an alienated teen who is being pressured by a group of Hmong gang members to join them. Although Thao is disinterested, he is forced by the gang to steal a prized 72' Gran Torino from Kowalski's garage. The attempt fails when Thao is interrupted by Kowalski, and this acts as a catalyst for all the events that follow.<br /><br />The gang members, infuriated by Thao's failure, return to bash him up, but are faced with Kowalski's wrath instead [he just wanted them off his lawn]. Later, Kowalski rescues Thao's sister, Sue [Ahney Her] from being harassed by a group of black guys and she worms her way into Kowalski's good graces, taking all the slurs in her stride and eventually gaining Kowalski's genuine affection. Gradually the Hmongs next door cease to become just another group of "gooks" but like a real family to Kowalski, something he has never really had, except with his beloved late wife. But, the Hmong gang refuses to let Thao alone and this sets off a chain of events that truly reveal the depth of Kowalski's bond to the family.<br /><br />There are so many complex themes explored in this movie - aging, loneliness, racism, peer pressure, evil , faith, courage, alienation, and many more. Yet, in Mr Eastwood's capable hands, these myriad themes are all linked together in a seamless fashion, giving viewers a movie with real soul - insightful and deep, and thought-provoking. The climax when it comes, is simply mind-blowing and so very beautifully executed, delivering a powerful message.<br /><br />The movie is definitely carried by Eastwood's portrayal of Kowalski as the old racist war vet who in fact embodies real courage, steely determination and plenty of heart. The actors portraying the Hmong seemed rather stilted in their performances, especially Bee Vang's Thao, though I liked Ahney Her's portrayal of the acerbic and candid Sue. There was also another highlight performance, that of the Catholic priest, Father Janovich [Christopher Carley] who seems initially way out of his depth in trying to get Walt to confession [as per Walt's late wife's wishes], and whose baby-face actually belies a strong character, determined to do the right thing.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is a gem of a movie, and is one of those rare dramas of substance that had me pondering about issues long after the credits rolled.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>This was a very good movie. It's pretty much about how an old grump, who lost his wife and gets caught up in a neighborhood war. When he catches a young boy trying to steal his prize car, who is being forced to join a gang. The old grump screws up the young boy's initiation and saves him in the process. Which makes him a hero to the whole neighborhood. However, the gang wants retribution and is willing to do anything, to get it. So, the old grump must figure out a way to protect the boy, his family and the neighborhood from the gang's revenge.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>Gran Torino was a surprisingly emotional experience for me, both due to it being one of Eastwood's most affecting and human movies, and because my Dad loved Clint and we used to see all his films together. Clint has made some real classics, and this ranks with any of them in its own unique way.<br /><br />Schenk's script keeps getting better as the film moves along; the opening scene is almost ham-handed exposition, telling us everything we need to know right away instead of showing it. That's the weakest moment of the film, though, and as we dig into Walt's character Clint informs him with many perfect and telling details, visually and verbally. Eastwood is totally inside this role, an absolutely masterful performance that should have won the Oscar hands down, and his direction is equally crisp. Rarely has a director acted so well, and vice-versa.<br /><br />There are many perfect moments here, from Walt's family trying to make sure they're in his will but never spending time with him, Walt's exchanges with his barber, his love of his talismanic Torino, and above all his growing love towards his Hmong neighbors. One of the best things about the blu-ray version is the extra doc about making the movie, a very fine little piece with some great Clint interviews that makes clear how careful he was to get all the cultural details right in this (very rare) cinematic look at Hmong culture in the US.<br /><br />Here we see a very mature Eastwood, in all the best ways. Dirty Harry has progressed into the sort of quietly loving being that was his destiny all along, and I believe that's what my Dad always loved about Clint: under all that toughness and edge is a truly intelligent and compassionate man who knows that the underdog is oft worth fighting for, and that the values we carry in our hearts are what define us in our most difficult times. The old Clint revenge motif is as usual in full force, but this time there's more soul in it than is sometimes the case, and the unexpected ending truly makes it clear that Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name have learned a lot in the past four decades.<br /><br />We've been watching plenty of films this very hot summer (thank goodness there's no global warming! It would really be hot, not just 105 most every day for the past month), and this is one of the only ones I can recall where about halfway in I suddenly hoped the movie would never end. I wanted to see Walt grow and develop; Clint's performance is just that good, certainly one of his best.<br /><br />There is also a lot of wonderfully wry humor, especially if you know any semi-bigots who are deep down very just and decent people. Clint's not afraid to poke fun at himself or Archie Bunkers or anything else by this point, and there are some hilarious lines that come out of nowhere. Walt's little grunts say more than any dialogue. I don't think Walt would ever say "colored guy", but Clint's knowing that the N-word would unnecessarily offend a lot of folks makes that line acceptable if unrealistic in this context. It's one of the film's few odd moments but doesn't detract at all.<br /><br />The music is also very fine, simple but moving, and Eastwood's son Kyle (what a great name, another sign of Clint's genius) has progressed a lot in the last 20 years. If Clint's basic but heartfelt singing over the credits doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you're a stronger man than I, and welcome to it. When Clint makes you cry you know something special has happened; this is a long way from Detective Callahan and even Unforgiven, another masterpiece.<br /><br />But the best thing here is the growth of Clint's love for Thao and Sue, his young Hmong neighbors who show him more real love than his own family. The bond between Walt and Thao is one of the more touching screen relationships I have ever seen, and it really becomes affecting as the film evolves. Wonderful acting from both of these hitherto unknown players makes this movie glow with a feeling unlike anything Eastwood has ever done, and it's seeing one of our great American film heroes become Walt so completely that makes this movie truly special.<br /><br />I had no idea this film would be anywhere near this fine, and rarely have I missed my Dad more since his death. He would have loved Gran Torino in so many ways, and I can't recommend enough that any fathers and sons out there see this film together. It has a lot to say about men and how we relate to each other and ourselves. It made me realize yet again that my old man knew what was up in many ways that only getting older can reveal to me, and that I sure was lucky to have him for a father. Any film that can bring that home so forcefully, and with so much laughter amongst the pathos, is nothing other than a true classic.<br /><br />This movie will live a long life and eventually be seen as one of the finest of our era. It's a fitting end to Eastwood's stellar career, one of the American cinema's most interesting. Or is it the end? Clint, man of many surprises, may still have one or two up his sleeve....<br /><br />Not bad for a 78-year-old old man.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Walt Kowalski is a disgruntled widower, a grumpy old man who despises the sedentary lifestyle his children and grandchildren live, who resents the ethnic intrusion into his once all-white neighborhood, who is angry at the God who took his wife away and the priest who tries to comfort him.  Walt just wants to be left alone; his idea of happiness is sitting on the porch with a beer and his dog.<br /><br />But that changes when a Hmong gang enters the neighborhood, hell-bent on recruiting the boy next door.  Walt intervenes, and from then on the neighborhood takes a shine to him, whether he wants them to or not.  It is a relationship that will draw Walt out of his shell...with some funny, emotional, and tragic consequences.<br /><br />GRAN TORINO is spectacular.  It is easily Eastwood's finest directorial piece, and I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it features his best performance to boot.  The flaws here are few and far between; the main flaw is that, in his quest for authenticity, Eastwood hired an all-Hmong supporting cast, many of whom aren't professional actors (and you can tell).  It's a small price to pay, however, for a movie that hits you on all emotional levels: it's funny, suspenseful, and heart-breaking.  There aren't very many emotional punches, thank God, but when they come they are knockouts.  If Eastwood were to stop making films now (and let's pray he doesn't), he could rest easily on the laurels of GRAN TORINO, content in the fact that he has made an American classic (again).</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Even after watching Gran Torino for the third time I still believe it's the best film of 2008. It remains the most profound and heartwrenching moviegoing experience I've had with any film of 2008 and, beyond that, it's the rare kind of film that can truly make you laugh while simultaneously packing an emotional wallop. Despite a large box-office take and all sorts of accolades from moviegoers, the film escape any sort of awards for it's elderly leading man and poignant script. The Academy missed a real winner this year.<br /><br />Director Clint Eastwood stars as racist Korea veteran Walt Kowalski. The film opens at the funeral of Walt's wife, where he growls and sneers at the sight of his grandchildren and even his own grown children whom he views as disappointments. As one of his sons comment, "Dad's still living in the '50s."<br /><br />Walt lives in an area of Detroit populated by gangs of various demographics and next door lives a family of Hmong people. Thao (Bee Vang), one of Walt's neighbors, is pressured by a local gang to try and steal Walt's vintage, 1972 Gran Torino. Thao's attempted theft of the car is what, essentially, kickstarts the rest of the film in which Walt reluctantly grows to both like and appreciate the Hmong family next door.<br /><br />This poorly written synopsis sounds like the set-up for a typical movie exploring racism in the 21st century and it's consequences, but Gran Torino is thankfully much more than that.<br /><br />The film has many great scenes; Eastwood's "get off my lawn" line has already been immortalized but it is the lines that follow that are truly memorable. I, unfortunately, am unable to quote them here. Other scenes, like Walt confronting a trio of black men harassing Thao's sister and, of course, the ending come to mind, at least as a way of comparing the way the film balances humor and pathos.<br /><br />The ending packs one hell of a wallop although some people may see it as a sort of anticlimax. I was even disappointed with the ending briefly but it's really the most appropriate way for it to end. It's both beautiful and brilliant.<br /><br />There's nothing elaborate about the film; no showy cinematography, no elaborate set design. It's really a simple movie that is not without it's flaws. The scenes with Walt and Martin the barber (John Carroll Lynch) for example seem unrealistic and serve no real purpose beyond comic relief. As the scenes are quite amusing though, it's only a minor flaw.<br /><br />The other complaint I have is about the acting, particularly by those playing the Hmong characters. Much of it is very unsatisfactory and unconvincing. In fact, many of these actor's almost seem to reading off of far away cue cards.<br /><br />This is balanced out however by Eastwood, who has said this will be his final screen performance. He's a real revelation here. It could be argued that he does little more than growl, sneer, and spit venomous/humorous racial remarks and, yes, he does quite a bit of that. However, besides being very convincing, Eastwood can do more with a growl than some actors can do with an entire Shakespeare soliloquy. Despite the ignorance and overall bigotry of the character, Eastwood makes Walt human, sympathetic, and ultimately lovable. It's not only one of the best male lead performances of 2008, but one of Eastwood's all time greatest performances.<br /><br />Overall, Gran Torino is a great film in the purest sense of the word. You may not agree that it is the single best film of 2008 but you'll be hard-pressed to find a film that will make you laugh and cry equally as hard in a span of less than 2 hours.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was Gran Torino starring Clint Eastwood. This one came from the 5-dollar rack at Wall-Mart and was quite a good movie. Of course, I've always liked Clint Eastwood and have a big collection of his movies. In this movie, Eastwood appeared quite old. He played a veteran of the Korean War, and his true age is just about right for the part.<br /><br />Eastwood lived in a decaying part of an older big city. His wife had died and he was now all alone. Most of the original residents of his neighborhood were gone and the new wave of people were mostly Asian. Some Hmung people lived next door, much to his dislike, and the area was plagued with gangs. The "Gran Torino" of the title was for an aging but very-well-kept-up 1972 Pontiac he had stored in his garage. The car was coveted by some of the young hoods of the neighborhood. Eastwood was the old Eastwood and had a few guns and issued a few Eastwood-type threats that kept the hoods at a distance.<br /><br />Eastwood was an aging curmudgeon and angry with seemingly everything in the modern world. Several times he helped the next door family out of threatening situations, for which they were very pleased, and they gradually and grudgingly became friends. Eastwood befriended the young boy and trained him and helped him to get a construction job. It was an uplifting story, probably played over and over in modern America, and well worth watching. Everything about the movie was first rate, but I'd expect that with an Eastwood movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>"Gran Torino" is a remarkable film that is difficult to characterize.  Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War veteran who, after seeing combat in Korea, worked on the Ford assembly lines until he retired.  His particular neighborhood has slowly become predominately Vietnamese, and this culture at first neither appeals to him any more than his new neighbors understand him.  Slowly, however, each side comes to appreciate the virtues of the other and therein lies a humorous but also poignant storyline.  Clint Eastwood turns in his usual stellar job as the grouchy, politically-incorrect "Walt".  The big surprise here is that the mostly unknown Vietnamese cast is extremely good and they turn in excellent performances as well.<br /><br />There are some ethnic slurs in this film and normally I do not approve of such.  Perhaps the film could have dispensed with this, but who am I to second-guess Clint Eastwood?  In my opinion this film may be forgiven that, because in the context of this film it is a legitimate device to bring the viewer to the ultimate message of the film, which is one of mutual respect and ultimately, friendship.

I had no idea what it might be about and the cover suggested it would be an action movie. With Clint Eastwood being almost 80 years of age at the time, I couldn't see how it would work.<br /><br />It turns out that it isn't an action movie at all. The main themes include age, the loss of a loved one, racism, friendship, family, religion, and personal growth.<br /><br />Walt Kowalsky is a Korean war veteran and one of the last white people in a neighborhood mostly populated by Hmong residents. The film opens with his wife's funeral. He's suddenly friendless and alone, but for the unwanted attention of his two sons and their families, who see him as a burden and wonder what he'll leave them when he dies.<br /><br />The local priest (Carley) promised Walt's wife that he would keep an eye on Walt and try to get him to go to confession. His immediate neighbors annoy him; especially when their boy, Thao (Vang), tries to steal his beloved '72 Gran Torino. To complete Walt's misery, he's coughing up blood and may not have long to live.<br /><br />That all sounds pretty miserable, doesn't it? Despite the grim situation, Gran Torino has a great deal of (intelligent) humor. Walt doesn't pull his punches: he refers to Asians as Gooks and Blacks as Spooks. He tells the persistent priest that he's an "over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promise them eternity." He speaks in grunts and snarls and seems to hate every person he deals with.<br /><br />Walt is a complex character. His neighbors convince him to accept Thao's apology for trying to steal his car by offering the boy's labor for a week. Thao works hard and earns Walt's respect. The two actually develop a friendship of sorts and Walt also likes Thao's sister, Sue (Her). As unlikely as it may seem, from Walt's perspective, he finds that his neighbors are decent people and takes an interest in their lives. He finds that he has more in common with them than his own family.<br /><br />I won't give away any more details, but the story shows how people still have the capacity for change, despite advanced age and a lifetime of behaving in a certain way. The humor is frequent, with Eastwood timing his lines perfectly. At the risk of sounding dramatic, this might just be Eastwood's best acting performance. It's certainly my favorite performance from those that I have seen.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>It appears this might be eastwood's final staring role in a movie and what a great way to end a long successful career.

Clint's gruff old man sneers and wheezes made me laugh repeatedly. He is so miserable that it's comic. He reminds me of Charles Bronson's old 1970s "Death Wish" character, a grizzled man who sets out to take revenge at any cost. Then it slowly morphs into a PC tale about a Hmong gang in Detroit taking shots at a next door family of Hmongs that Clint befriends after first finding them annoying and repulsive. It gets a little violent at times. The Gran Torino of the title is an actual 1972 Ford that was never one of the better cars of its day. Here, because it looks pristine, there is a certain attractive quality to it.

Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do. I highly recommend GRAN TORINO!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>I remember Clint Eastwood from tv on RAWHIDE at the start of his career.  I remember him in a musical western PAINT YOUR WAGON in 1969.  I remember him in all of those westerns plus his first foray as DIRTY HARRY.  I remember his getting fired from the studio he worked for as a tv star, not for bad behavior but for lack of talent.  I was one of those same stupid people back then that thought this guy was just coasting on his good looks and as soon as those were gone his career would be kaput.<br /><br />Well his good looks are gone but he has so much talent that he is bigger than ever as both a director and actor.  Having seen the Oscar winner, Sean Penn in MILK, recently, I really think it should have gone to Eastwood instead.  Not that Penn doesn't do his usual first class job.  No, it is that Eastwood inhabits every nuance of a truly original fictional character which I tend to appreciate a lot more than biography.  Further, Eastwood hits America right where all the people in it live emotionally and economically in this moment of time whereas MILK looked back to a brief shining moment in gay rights history in San Francisco.<br /><br />Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old recent widower and Korean Korean War veteran.  He is a retired auto worker in Detroit who still lives in his old neighborhood much to his family's consternation.  His proudest possession is his completely restored 1972 Gran Torino automobile.  The attempted theft of this auto by the Asian youth who lives next door sets off a richly nuanced relationship between the two, which slowly ripens into a friendship.  They each have their separate problems too.  Walt is hitting the end of the road medically as he coughs up blood and discovers his serious prognosis.  The youth and his family are being terrorized by an Asian gang to which his cousin belongs.  They want him to join them and when he won't, they ratchet up the violence towards the entire family.  We know how Dirty Harry would solve the problems in this movie.  Walt is not Dirty Harry.  He lives in the real world and has to find real world solutions to the problems before him.<br /><br />Eastwood is just wonderful as this character.  The movie itself is a fine piece of writing which Eastwood himself superbly directs.  Such a fuss was made about his CHANGELING (which he directed with Jolie in the lead), which came out in the same year.  Now that I've seen both, this is the better movie. The Walt character is just everything you've got to love long range about America and what we are so close to losing.  It's true.  They don't make them like Walt anymore.<br /><br />Eastwood himself closes the movie by singing in his Walt voice a song about his Gran Torino over the closing credits. Here, truly, is the man who has done it all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EARN5PUVIF1S.html">A1EARN5PUVIF1S</a><br/><p>By my reckoning (and as of this writing), this is Clint Eastwood's third masterpiece as a director and star.<br /><br />The first two were "Unforgiven" and "Million Dollar Baby".<br /><br />What's Clint's secret to making such outstanding films?<br /><br />Simple -- he doesn't give a fig for what some studio suits think will be commercial.  Instead he looks for a good script.<br /><br />The script for "Gran Torino", like U and MDB, is simply impeccable.  Yes, it's filled with vulgarity and racist language such as you may never have heard onscreen, but that doesn't diminish its command of story and character.<br /><br />The truth is, I wasn't very keen to see this movie when I saw the commercials.  Ho hum, Clint playing another crusty old codger.<br /><br />But then I saw an available copy of GT at my local Redbox kiosk and took it home.<br /><br />Like MDB, the film gets under your skin, and it had me bawling like a baby through the last half hour and crying some more the next day.<br /><br />To say this film is surprising and deeply moving is an understatement.  If you like great movies, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.<br /><br />I have deducted one star just because of the paucity of special features on the DVD -- no director's commentary, no behind-the-scenes making-the-film featurette, just some stuff about cars.<br /><br />I hope that this deficiency will be rectified soon with a better Collector's Edition...  The film certainly deserves deluxe treatment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>A local talk show host here in Bakersfield (Ralph Bailey), who happens to be an African American, and a moderate conservative, often says something to the affect of "Folks born before WWII get a pass for saying "knucklehead" racial epitaphs because they lived through the era of segregation an the Civil Rights movement. However, those of us born in or after the "Baby Boom" should have learned better by now. We had the benefit of growing up watching shows like "All in the Family", and "Sanford & Son" to poke vicious satire at bigoted thinking, and so we hope at least to have moved on.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is a great film that gives us some great lessons in dramatic form. Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a man from that earlier generation and he throws epithets out without ever thinking there is anything wrong with it. He hits white ethnicities as much as he does people of color, and it was weird for me to remember that there was a time when speaking like that was common.<br /><br />But here's the thing, Walt is a good man, prejudiced perhaps but still a good man. Walt is forced to consider his racism when he unwillingly gets to know his neighbors. When he asks his young lady neighbor why her people came to America, she explains that her people (the Hmong), fought in alliance with the USA in the Vietnam war, and when America quit, they left the Hmong high and dry, and would be slaughtered if they stayed behind. It seemed to me to click a connection in Walt's brain, then he began the friendship that became closer than family to him.<br /><br />In "Gran Torino", Eastwood continues to swing his message away from violent solutions in his films. This is probably my favorite after the "Unforgiven", of Eastwood's films promoting this message. It is a thoughtful, well written, well acted and well directed film. That really surprised me in the end.<br /><br />One of the best films I've seen in a while!<br /><br />5*<br /><br />Now there is a missed opportunity however, not with the film, but rather with the DVD, There was a great chance to do some documentary work on the change of demographics in American Culture as well as a specific opportunity for some history about the role of the Hmong in the Viet Nam War. Instead there are some rather banal pieces about America's love affair with the Automobile. My first car was a '73 Gran Torino, so if anyone should have liked what they did, it might have been me, but I seldom watch DVD extras, and I still think they missed a great chance to do some more good with this excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>I got this movie on a whim, in part because I am tired of seeing Americans turning into either fat blobs or pussies afraid of their own shadow (or worse, self-righteous morons who really think government is the answer to everything.<br /><br />Eastwood might hate the comparison, but this is a collage that goes well beyond <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800179501">The Karate Kid</a> meets <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000YTP02">Secondhand Lions (New Line Platinum Series)</a>.<br /><br />It most assuredly is right up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JVUHY">Million Dollar Baby (Full Screen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731959">Absolute Power</a>.<br /><br />It's hard to sum up this movie so I will say just three things:<br /><br />1.  He weaves every possible American hard-ass self-made man image in as gracefully as it could be done.<br /><br />2.  He does for the hill people of Viet-Nam what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094AS9U">Bride and Prejudice</a> did for India but without the music, love, and dance.<br /><br />3.  The ending is spectacular--Eastwood's voice in the background, slow singing against a visual as the Gran Torino drives toward the future with its special passenger who inherited from the master.  For this alone I would rent or buy the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Spoilers.....<br /><br />Many parts of this story are hard to watch--there's a brutal Hmong gang which does terrible things even to their leader's own family members.  The subject matter is very provocative, as it pertains to a crusty old Korean war veteran who must learn to live with his Hmong neighbors in the deteriorating suburbs of a Michigan city.  A young man is burned with a cigarette, and his sister is gang-raped.  It ends up in a showdown between Eastwood and the dangerous and deadly gang.<br />There is no easy way out of this mess and no clear-cut solution. This is why I call it fearless.  There is no totally happy ending here where everyone finally learns to get along and live happily ever after.  Thank goodness--we get too much of that dreck already.<br />It's not easy viewing, but it is worth consideration.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>Amazon, why won't you post my review?

Movie is humorous, tough, and tender at the same time. Brilliant script.  Eastwood hits all the right notes.  A story with character that isn't totally PC, but certainly sends the right message veiled in a devil may care heroine.  There isn't a wasted scene in the movie.  If the language puts people off, they never spent much time with their grandfather or great uncle.  Much less about rascism or violence than I expected and firmly focused on love, loss, and purpose.  Easily one of the year's best movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>XXXXX<br /><br />"A Mexican, a Jew, and a coloured guy walk into a bar.  The bartender looks up and says, 'Get the [common vulgar word] out of here!'"<br /><br />The above "joke" is said by this movie's main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood, who also directed and produced this movie.)<br /><br />This story follows Walt, a recently widowed Korean War veteran who is alienated from his family and angry at the world.  Walt's young Hmong American neighbour Thao (or "Toad" as Walt calls him) tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Torino (or, more specifically, a Ford Grand Torino Sport Sports Roof) on a dare from his cousin for initiation into a gang.  Walt develops a close relationship with the boy and his older sister.  The gang does something to the older sister and Walt vows revenge declaring that "They won't stand a chance [against me]."<br /><br />(Hmong or Mong Americans are residents of the U.S. who are of ethnic Hmong decent.  Indigenous Hmong are specifically from the mountainous regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma. The Hmong are also one of the subgroups of Miao ethnicity in Southern China.)<br /><br />Despite the movie's deceptive simplicity, it evolves into something complex, powerful, and even tender.<br /><br />For those who like lots of mindless action in their movies, this movie can become tedious.  However, those with patience will be rewarded by this movie's end.<br /><br />This movie marked Eastwood's return to leading actor status after four years (his previous leading role was in the movie "Million Dollar Baby").  The then 78-year old delivers a superb performance in what he has said is his final film as an actor.<br /><br />Eastwood can make "Get off my lawn" (while aiming an M-1 rifle) sound as menacing as Dirty Harry's "Make my day."  When he says, "I'll blow a hole in your face and [then] sleep like a baby," he sounds as if he means it.<br /><br />Beware that despite some moments, Walt's toughness is more verbal than physical.<br /><br />This movie features a large Hmong American cast.  Even though the actor who played Thao (Bee Vang) and the actress who play his older sister (Ahney Her) had no previous acting experience, they hold their own with Eastwood and give convincing performances.<br /><br />(Note that Eastwood's young son, Scott, also has a small part in this movie.)<br /><br />The song in the movie titled "Gran Torino" was nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song.  This music was a collaborative effort of four people that included Clint Eastwood (who sings briefly during the end credits) and his oldest son, Kyle Eastwood, who wrote the music.<br /><br />This movie was recognized as one of the ten best films of 2008.  Eastwood's performance gained recognition winning "Best Actor" from the National Board of Review.  As well, this movie has grossed almost ten times more than what it cost to make.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is simply a remarkable movie.  I leave you with what Walt says to a young priest, the priest who presided over his wife's funeral:<br /><br />"I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life."<br /><br />(2008;  1 hr, 55 min;  wide screen, 29 scenes;  rated 'R')<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>The incisive reviews for this film are numerous, and I remove my hat to them. For the interested dvd-buyer, I have a few words. Also, I wish to speak to the cinematic merit of this film.<br /><br />Being an Eastwood fan since "Paint Your Wagon", and a veteran watcher of his spaghetti Westerns, Eastwood can do no wrong by me. As a director/producer, his seminal work on jazz musician Thelonious Monk in "Straight, No Chaser" will stand as hugely in the future as "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil".<br /><br />"Gran Torino", in my view, does not meet the standards of the two abovementioned films. In the still-lambent light of "Million Dollar Baby", it is a rather trivial little thing. What strikes me most is that you will love this beginning to end if you love Eastwood; otherwise you might think you just been had by yet another overblown after-school-special-type flick.<br /><br />Still, I have to admit no one could do this sort of thing except Eastwood. No one would have the balls, no one would have the talent or the know-how. This brings me to ask, "Why didn't Eastwood make this film better?"<br /><br />I know there are intense comments in other reviews about how great this is as a statement about racism...somehow I wonder if Eastwood really meant it exactly that way. After all, the story IS about him, a crusty, nasty old Korean War vet with a big guilt complex about "killing gooks". It is always all about him. Perhaps this film is more geared toward the way we change our prejudices. I know the character reminded me of myself--perhaps that's why I'm one of the few who's NOT raving about the movie.<br /><br />Take this review as-is. It isn't in my purview to tell you to avoid the film: I say buy it and watch it 100 times--Eastwood deserves that much, and it is worth watching at the end of the day. Cinematically, it's as perfect as one can get: the cinematography is gorgeous considering the setting. Finally, I'd take a cue from this movie and study up on the Hmong Tribe, very important real-life people living in this country.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>Saw this one in the theater.  Clint Eastwood is a kinda older Dirty Harry persona, with a little bit of Archie Bunker in him--he is not a policeman this time.  He is actually a retired car salesman and former soldier.  The movie begins at his wife's funeral.  He stands in the church, assessing his relatives.  They are just not up to his expectations (granddaughter with piercings and belly hanging out, etc.).  Clint is definitely a character.  He tells it like it is and has a biting sarcastic way of doing it.  He saw his share of "action" as a Korean War veteran, and is not afraid to stand up to people.  He has guns, too.  Clint has a Hmong (Vietnamese) family living next to him and they become part of the story line, as they eventually become friends.  Clint also stands up to gangbangers and tries to help some neighborhood folks out.  There is also a young, baby-faced Catholic priest that pesters the heck out of Clint because Clint's wife had asked the priest to look after Clint before she went to the other side.  I cannot tell you anymore without ruining the story for you, but it is a great storyline with fine acting.  And you know Clint is one of those actors that can say more than words with just a look. It was a very enjoyable movie.<br /><br />By the way, Grand Torino is a restored Ford.  I think they said 1962-- a beautiful car that Clint's character restored in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I have enjoyed most all of Clint Eastwood's movies whether he's the actor, director, or writer.  He is, with Woody Allen, one of the two best contemporary American directors.  He is also the John Wayne of our times.  Eastwood gets credit for exploring the soul (and the society the poor soul lives in) in a manner that leaves us with a lot to think about.  In "Gran Torino" Eastwood tackles the issue of prejudice by showing how a man beyond repair can still come to see the light.<br /><br />The opening of the film tells us all in a few short scenes; elderly widower, unhappy with the world, uncommunicative with his well-meaning sons and their families, staying in a community that "changed" into one where he is alone in isolation.  A man whose major life-changing event was the Korean War where he killed Asian enemies who, in turn, had killed his American buddies, he looks out around his Detroit neighborhood and finds himself surrounded by Asians who are, in this case, Hmong refugees.  Either way they are just Asians to him.  Now, all alone after the death of his wife, what is there for him other than his mint condition Gran Torino.<br /><br />Obviously this movie creates a series of events that gets Eastwood off his front porch and involves him with his neighbors.  (Otherwise this would be a pretty boring film).  The manner in which things happen are presented in a believable manner.  The metamorphisis we see happening before us may seen a bit sudden at times but we'll just let that pass as the handiwork of the local (and youthful) priest.  Cultures and generations are heading for a collision and the results leave us with a bittersweet taste.  Heroism takes many forms and we get to observe one form not often portrayed these days.  Given the clerical involvement it may be fair to suggest a few Biblical parallels but I'll let you decide for yourself.<br /><br />I missed seeing this movie on the big screen.  It was in town just a short while and I heard mixed reviews about it.  I can see where some might not care for the ending and I have struggled with a 4 star or a 5 star rating.  I decided on 4 stars by rating "Gran Torino" against other recent Eastwood pictures.  It's not a "family picture" but it is certainly worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood has been a marvelous filmmaker throughout his entire career, and he continues to amaze us with his range and deep artistry.  He has also one of the most prolific filmmakers around, and in 2008 he made two features.  Whereas many directors in Hollywood can take years between films, Clint cranks them out with ease.  He's done this a lot in his career (1997, 1975 for instance), and here, the two films, Changeling and Gran Torino, are excellent.<br /><br />Gran Torino is the better of Clint's 2008 films.<br /><br />This may turn out to be one of my favorite Clint movies, as it's a real surprise of a film.  It's funny, sad, tragic, uplifting, and fascinating, and Clint packs it all into a running time of two hours (it's shorter than most of his other films, which usually hit the 140 minute mark). Clint gives one of his most memorable performances as Walt Kowalski, a retired auto worker living in the Midwest who is a racist.  Through circumstance, he befriends one of his neighbors, a Hmong teenager, and helps him through his life, leading to a stunning conclusion, one of the most surprising and moving in all of Clint's work.<br /><br />This is one of Clint's most surprising films, funny and tender, filled with great cimenatography, funny dialogue (much of which is very un-PC, but it totally fits the story), intelligent situations, and, for the most part, excellent performances.  The two lead Hmong actors overact on occasion, but all of the other performances are first rate. The film is also very respectful of the Hmong culture itself, and I myself knew nothing about it until this film.  This film is also the biggest box office hit of Eastwood's career, which is really wonderful and a bit startling, if you think about it.  When I saw it in the theater, the show had sold out!  I can't remember the last time that happened (lucky for me, the theater added another show an hour later, so I didn't have to wait too long).  It reminds me of when Bob Dylan's Modern Times hit #1 a couple of years ago (and his recent album, Together Through Life, hit #1 as well).  Years ago who would have guessed that Eastwood would have a #1 hit in 2009, especially when you consider most, if not all, his contemporaries are playing caricatures of themselves, are doing mediocre supporting roles, or rehashing old roles.<br /><br />It was a crime that Eastwood didn't get major Oscar nominations for this film (or Changeling, except for Jolie).  I have always wondered what goes through the mind of Academy voters when they nominate and award mediocre films (like this year's Slumdog Millionare, a decent film but hardly a great motion picture), and shut out much more thought provoking, challenging, and entertaining films like Gran Torino.  This film has been compared to Paul Haggis's Crash, but in a way that shows Gran Torino is the far superior film about race relations.  Crash is a bloated, self important, and preachy film.  Most people agree that Gran Torino manages to say more about race relations and tolerance than the ridiculously PC, overblown film Crash (ironically enough, Paul Haggis wrote several films for Clint Eastwood, all of which are better than Crash).  Methinks that the Academy is jealous of Clint, in that he's first an artist, and a celebrity second, and he just makes great films.  He should have gotten something for this film.<br /><br />Eastwood keeps surprising us and himself, making excellent picture after excellent picture.  His last six films, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, and Gran Torino, have been a remarkable run, and I can't wait for the next Clint Eastwood film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood gives us a multi-layered gem that some may find contrived and clich&eacute;d, but under the hood of this slick and powerful film lies an all too truthful look at what our world has become!<br /><br />The film is gripping from the opening credits to the very end and even though at times it seems a little heavy handed, it's blatant truth is really the film's genius. Apparently, Clint Eastwood can do no wrong, as I can't see anyone else getting away with this film. It's really a wonderful piece of work that speaks volumes about the world we live in.<br /><br />The film is full of wry wit and I laughed through much of this entertaining, but sad film. At times I couldn't help, but think of Dirty Harry and like the Duke in 'The Shootest' this film seems like a beautiful tribute to one of our most endeared actors. This film is not just a shinning classic muscle car, but a dark and deep drama that echoes the reality of our world today.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this "in your face" look at our sadly deteriorating society and also a film that doesn't apologize for using "politically incorrect" language. Of course we learn that you can't judge a book by it's cover and that stereotyping is unfair and wrong, but it's a part of society and it shouldn't be swept under the rug.<br /><br />I can only hope some spineless moron in charge of content for films released on DVD will not alter this film years from now.(Yes Disney I'm referring to you!)<br /><br />The DVD has a very good transfer, but the extras are disappointing on this single disc edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Synopsis: Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a bitter, aging Archie Bunker-like Korean War veteran and widower who seems to hate just about everybody and everything. That is with the exception of his '72 Gran Torino. When he finds himself pulled into a gang related situation terrorizing his Asian neighbors he finds himself invested and connected to others for the first time since the death of his wife and reevaluates his life and what he should do to better things for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Critique: 'Gran Torino' is a hard hitting contemporary drama that mirrors many of the attitudes and social problems plaquing American urban society; loneliness, ignorance, racism, uninvolvement, hostility and gang violence to name a few. Clint Eastwood delivers one of his best film performances (my personal favorite is 'Pale Rider'). The dialogue is sharp and bitting, the storyline edgy and contemporary and the acting is honest and believable. This is hard-hitting cinema that is both enjoyable and meaningful. Recommended viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood portrays Walt, an average everyday retired auto worker & a veteran of the Korean war.  He lives in a run-down section of Detroit (please pardon my redundancy!).  Walt is a crotchety old hermit who would like everyone to believe that he is cold & heartless.  Just one problem:  in spite of a rough exterior, Walt has a heart of gold!<br /><br />At his wife's funeral he finds that his two sons & their families are selfish & narcissistic.  They only care for Walt insofar as the property they will inherit from him after he passes away.  Not exactly solace for a man who has worked hard all of his life!<br /><br />Juxtaposed with his self-centered family are Oriental neighbors who live around Walt.  After inadvertently rescuing a young man from the attack of a gang, Walt becomes something of a hero to his neighbors.  Unlike his own family, who could care less about him, the racist retired Ford worker finds them to be eternally thankful to them, and much more gracious than his own family would  ever dream of being.<br /><br />This is the outline of the film.  In some ways, it is a little bit like a raw, violent, downtown Detroit version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ASOC">Finding Forrester</a>.  To be sure, the thugs in the film are unreasonable in every way ~ straight out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012XIGXC">Gangland: The Complete Season One</a>.  They're not much in the brains department, but their anarchist approach to life makes them scary dudes.<br /><br />One of the more remarkable things about this movie is just how ordinary all of the characters are.  These are people all of us have dealt with in our everyday lives ~ both good & bad.  There are no supermodel actresses in the film, & there is no lush scenery.  It's just Clint Eastwood and the drab scenery of the city of Detroit (I've been there myself, and it's hardly a scenic locale).  These aspects are not a negative of the movie, but rather they just drive-home how much the film depicts the life of everyday personas.<br /><br />I swear that Clint Eastwood's scowl is every bit as much of a cinematic icon as the starship Enterprise, Andie MacDowell's smile, "shaken, not stirred" & "I'll be back."  Clint is about the only thespian I know of who can wear a frown on his face the entire movie and still(!) portray a likeable character.<br /><br />So, if you're a fan of Clint's, this instant-classic is a must-see.  For myself, this is my very favorite CE movie.  If you're not a big fan of his style, this DVD just might compel you to change your mind about the big fella!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Gran Torino' is quite simply one of the best films I have seen in quite some time. Directed by, produced by and starring Clint Eastwood, this film has a feeling of gravitas and meaning from the word go. This follows Walt Kowalski, who is a Korean war veteran, and how has he seen the neighbourhood around him change over the years and how he has seen a rise in violence and intimidation. It also looks at how he faces his own prejudices about his Hmong neighbours and strikes a relationship with the family next door. It is touching to see Walt develop from the archetype grumpy old man, to seeing someone with a softer side and with a great deal of compassion for those who are in a worse situation than himself. Clint plays Walt gruff and old school from the outset and you often laugh at his up front honesty, especially when confronted with a do-good catholic priest, but he isn't a one trick pony and manages to show his considerable acting (and directing) skills throughout. This may be Clint's swansong film, but considering the calibre of films he is making at the moment it would be a great shame if that was so. This has a powerful ending that will resonate long after the credits have rolled and will have you coming back to it in your mind at odd times in the days after you watch the film. This may be a scathing indictment of modern life in some cities, but it also has a well written storyline with impact and power. Needless to say, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood stars and directs this film  He is a graying, craggy, cranky Korean War Vet.  He lives in a tough neighborhood all alone (widower, agnostic, angry) and loath to become neighborly to a teenage boy next door, and his Hmong immigrant family.<br /><br />The movie is set in Detroit.  The economics of the times are clear and Clint plays Walt Kowalski as a racist that knows all the slurs in the book.  He is wrathful, prideful, and refuses to leave a neighborhood he is familiar with.  He sees the neighborhood deteriorating, but perseveres in holding his place.  He was well-trained in war and alert and ready for the neighborhood gangs as attempts are made to steal his prized possession, a Pontiac Gran Torino.<br /><br />This is a racial morality story, but also about personal bonds that form as we learn to live together in a changing world. There is bitter humor and deep caring as the characters learn to know each other and forget stereotypes.<br /><br />In the end, Walt gives wisdom and strength to a struggling immigrant family, as well as his most powerful performance.<br /><br />A film you will not forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>This is a movie that is more about redemption than about sheer race issues.  Kowalski lives in a run down part of Detroit, where he is a retired auto worker and Korean War Veteran.  He is a surly old man who despises everything and seemingly everyone.  His nieghborhood is totally Hmong with the only exception being him.<br /><br />We view him with his family, and interacting with his neighbors and then as you have seen in the trailers, his dealings with the local youths.  He starts a relationship with Thao and Sue, young Hmong neighbors who he builds an affinity for.  Totally politically incorrect, Kowalski spews racial and ethnic slurs in almost every sentence.  He is a bit of a loaner, especially since he became a widower, but he enjoys his car and his home and wishes his world had not changed so much.<br /><br />Kowalski calls everyone names, to their faces and he really does not care what type of rise it gets out of people.  He basically offends evryone, whites, blacks, hispanics, asians.  But you see the youth gangs from a variety of ethic perspectives and their own racism.<br /><br />Thao and Sue are like those you hear of in the news, the kids who have trouble come upon them, simply because they live in these areas.  Kowalski gets to know the Hmong, and they him.  He defends his home, his property and his friends.<br /><br />Realism although surreal, has our senses impacted when you see the results of fighting.  At times, it leads to more of the same.  Kowalski, though is a figure of redemption, he impacts everyone who knows him eventually, yet the most impact is on the viewer of Gran Torino.<br /><br />The extras in the DVD are good, more about cars than about society.  Wish there was more on the inner city and gang problems in this to complement our love affair with the big muscle cars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>I have been a fan of Clint Eastwood the actor and the<br />producer-director for most of my life and this man very rarely<br />leaves his audience disappointed!--He is a master storyteller<br />and embodies his characters wholly and completely!--This movie,<br />about a gruff, bigoted man who's neighborhood is changing in ways<br />that he doesn't like is classic Eastwood contridiction with<br />an undercurrent of humanity and a message about the<br />values of tolerance without being all "afterschool special" on us!<br />And of course, there's plenty of Clint Eastwood at his<br />butt-kicking best! I don't like to give scene by scene rundowns<br />in my reviews because I want you all to see and judge it<br />for yourselves. But this is a brilliantly acted and directed film<br />and a definite MUST HAVE for your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>Eastwood's character, Walt Kowalski, is a deeply flawed man...a man seared by all the traumas that have burned him during his many years of life.  Perhaps, the most deeply felt of his traumas, is his experience during the Korean War in which he killed...at least...thirteen of the oriental enemy, some little more than kids.  They were a lot like, or so Kowalski painfully speculates, his young Hmong friend.<br /><br />This is a tale not so much about redemption [although it could be confused as such] as a tale about the difficulty of interpreting...or judging...a person by his surface demeanor.  Kowalski is in a very real sense, every man, grown bitter and cynical with age.  He is us, filled with the prejudices which...despite all our denials...structure all of us.  Despite this, Kowalski, again like most of us, is a thoroughly decent human being.  He reacts to injustice but, like very few of us, he does something about it.<br /><br />He attempts to protect his Hmong neighbors from hoodlums.  Unfortunately, one of his actions against these punks results in reprisals in the form of a driveby shooting and a brutal rape.  Disgusted with himself and even more disgusted with the gang members, Kowalski acts deciseively to end the terror and protect 'his' oriental family.  It is, perhaps, not the ending favored by most Eastwood fans, but is all the more potent because of its simplicity.<br /><br />I enjoy he way Eastwood deals with 'racism' in this film.  Through his character, Kowalski, we see a decent man clothed in the camoflage of superficial racism.  Conversely...and I think there is a 'conversely'...we recognize that there are politically-correct individuals, who would never let an ethnic comment slip through their lips, who aren't decent people at all.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>After reflection, discussion and further reflection, I'm raising my rating from  4 to 5 stars for this late-career Eastwood achievement.  Of the films I've seen in the new millennium, "There Will Be Blood" stands out as the most "artful"--a nuanced, complex, serious piece of moviemaking that pulls out all the stops--scripting, acting, and cinematography (above all, the creative, even daring, use of montage and mis en scene to "tell the story" rather than the usual reliance on script, close-ups, and talking heads).  By contrast, "Gran Torino" breaks no new ground and demands far less of its viewer as a reader of film per se: instead, it demands a viewer who can handle a serious social issue and accept as "heroes" characters largely viewed as non-sympathetic by the majority of the American public.  But above all, "Gran Torino" required a director with Eastwood's deep convictions about fair play and his sympathies with the underdog--so much so that he was willing to put his name and money on the line regardless of the outcome at the box office.<br /><br />I viewed the film at the recommendation of my son, who no doubt was, like most viewers, initially attracted to it by the title.  Equally certain is that he, like most viewers, was moved by more than the car (though it's a nice car, not unlike a few big old Fords we've had in the family).  But the actual subjects in this film are tolerance, redemption and community--and Eastwood, as is his custom, finds it in an unlikely place--or rather, among an unfamiliar people--the much misunderstood, maligned, and even demonized Hmong people.  Clint's character is that of a crusty old Korean war veteran who interprets the world around him according to the bible of Archie Bunker, stereotyping people at every opportunity, cracking politically-incorrect jokes, and talking in a profane and scatological argot ironically not unlike that of the young minority gang-bangers he views as a nemesis. The primary "action" is not the predictable violence, beating and shooting stemming from the vigilante justice that is a trademark of Eastwood films but the conversion of Clint from flint to "father"--not of his distant, materialistic biological children but of a Hmong boy who suffers from low self-esteem while seeking significance and stability among even his own people.  Eastwood's character and the Hmong boy (originally an unwelcome neighbor who lives next door to the recently widowed Eastwood who, with the exception of his old dog Daisy, experiences a chosen isolation not all that different from the boy's).  Eventually, Eastwood becomes a virtual family member among the Hmongs and gets the son he never had (though at the price of his life), and the Hmong boy in turn gets an affirming father along with the latter's coveted '72 Gran Torino and, through his newly acquired self-confidence, the Hmong girl he had been too shy to look at, much less go after.<br /><br />These are commendable sentiments, and even without the twist of the Hmong neighbors, Eastwood's skills both as a director and actor assure a result that rises above the plot of what is basically a formulaic film, with a number of developments most likely conveyed to a good share of the audience well before they occur.  What's somewhat regrettable is the appearance of the film at a time when the nation is so splintered (bifurcated, may be the word) into two camps, one respecting poltical process and the highest office, the other seemingly thinking some sort of vigilante justice is a defense against terrorism rather than a contributor to it.  It's appalling to read polls suggesting that half of the nation has regressed to two "basic needs": Give me my guns, and don't tax me.  Even more disturbing is reading of political rallies to which people are drawn while packing firearms.  (Undeniably, that's one solution to the current problems with the economy and its failure to provide sufficient jobs: kill enough people, and eventually demand will come into closer alignment with supply.)<br /><br />In literature courses, teachers often try to discourage students from falling victim to the "intentional fallacy" ("Shakespeare wrote to entertain theater-goers and REALLY meant to say to be or not to be a ticket buyer is the question"; or "You're making too big a deal out of the poem.  Maybe all Frost meant to say was that he went on a walk, came to a fork, and took the less-traveled one to be different.").  But once a literary piece (or film) is born, it takes on a life of its own.  Attempts to read the author's mind are naiive, presumptuous and beside the point.  So even though Eastwood's character ends up with a cigarette lighter in his right hand rather than the magnum pistol it's assumed he's reaching for, the strange hold that guns have, especially on Americans, the potential of guns to "equalize" us all, quickly and decisively, is a stronger, more lingering image, I'm afraid, than the restored Gran Torino.  If Eastwood makes one more film (he had vowed before "Gran Torino" to do no more acting), I can't imagine a stronger, more valuable or memorable closer than a movie exposing guns for the anachronisms they have become in a civilized society.  But given his love of jazz and American music, I know that he would support, instead of guns in young people's hands, a musical instrument, preferably one that is not a synthesizer.<br /><br />I viewed the film in Blu Ray, though Eastwood's preference for a "noirish" cast, even to his color tones (witness a first-class Eastwood film noir gem like "Tightrope" from 1985), makes normal DVD an equally compelling choice.<br /><br />[Coda: An undeniable item of curiosity (apart from its critical importance to the plot) is the cigarette lighter that replaces the handgun in Eastwood's final scene.  At a point midway in the film we see him coughing up blood, and a comment by the Hmong boy (or is it his sister?) that he should stop smoking strongly implies that he's suffering from lung cancer (given his stubborn character, a doctor would be the last to know).  So either way--a gun or a lighter--the object in his left shirt pocket is emblematic of his end, the only question being whether it will be instantaneous or prolonged. It's even plausible that he knows his days are numbered and chooses what he believes is the best way out for all concerned.]</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>Ok so the car ..uh kinda cool... but come on .. could have been better.. but the story was very strong. Eastwood is brilliant when it comes to storyline and direction. He is a tough old man that is very prejudice.. it is his struggle to deal with his prejudice in the face of serious injustice. Justice is served in classic Eastwood fashion... I only took 1 star away for the choice of his vehicle and some poor acting with some of the cast..lol but he ties why this car is his baby.. another great Eastwood film.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>Since so many reviews here have provided a plot summary, I'm just going to write comments...<br /><br />There were many, many points in this movie that made me cringe, expecting to be run over by sentimentalism and stereotypes.  For example when Kowalski takes Thao with him to teach him "how to be a man"---I thought they'd wind up in a bar with a bunch of K's buddies competing to see who had the biggest wanger, but no something else entirely (not all that believable, but at least it was rather original) happens.<br /><br />So this movie is a lot like that.  It directly addresses and traffics in some all-too-common racial stereotypes and bigotry, yet somehow manages to transcend them in a way that is not hopelessly corny or preachy.  The ending is rather surprising, kind of Buddhist in fact---true self-sacrifice, a little idealistic perhaps, but at least not the usual macho-superhero-vigilante fantasy.  Considering Eastwood's filmography and iconic image, "Gran Torino" is actually very subversive, in its quiet and understated way.  There is a subtle element of satire and parody here, which most viewers will probably miss: Eastwood is actually poking fun at cranky aggrieved old white guys and their cartoonish ideas about masculinity.  At the same time he presents an alternative scenario in which that bitter old geezer finally becomes a TRUE man, i.e. a FULL HUMAN BEING, by growing beyond his own petty prejudices and, at the surprise ending, transcending his own ego and truly sacrificing himself wholeheartedly and voluntarily---in contrast to being a frightened overgrown boy forced to play soldier by the Army.<br /><br />My only reservations, and the reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars, is that Eastwood could have been a better director in terms of eliciting better performances from his two Hmong leads, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, who reminded me of kids acting in a school play.  Bee Vang is especially amateurish, especially in the last part when Kowalski locks him in the basement to prevent him from following.  Surely Eastwood could've hired acting coaches to better prepare and train these two?<br /><br />I was also disappointed with the Special Features on the DVD...basically it's a vintage car fan's wet dream, and there's lots of sophomoric babbling about cars and "masculinity"---but what about for the rest of us?  A little mini-documentary snippet on the history of the Hmong and their dealings with the US military in Indochina would have been much more interesting and apropos. Well, unless all the macho car gushing is part of Eastwood's hidden joke.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Indeed, Walt Kowalski says he's no hero, and he isn't.  Except that he is an old man deeply troubled enough by his acts in the Korean War to stand up for those unjustly persecuted.  The story is compelling, but considering Eastwood's brilliance and success behind other films the star quality just did not convey in this one.  Kowalski was well-acted, though it was Ahney Her as Sue who shone.  She was the only one who seemed to be in the part and not just acting it.  The flow of the film was a bit slow and its transitions quite choppy.  The editing just did not seem to be on par, which resulted in some of characterization of Kowalski seeming contrived if not completely off.  Despite its patchy qualities this film delivers a powerful story, that while potentially predictable does not detract from its power.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Thanks, for showing me that good movies are still being made, and great<br />actors still have the passion to make them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>I may be one of the few to think "Gran Torino" to be an over-rated movie. But watching Clint Eastwood play a cranky old racist who finally gets melted by a pair of adolescent Asian immigrants felt wholly contrived to me. Walt (Eastwood) has shiftless and greedy family members who he can't stand, neighbors that disgust him, a young priest who he treats like a punk and a few old cronies at the bar he can make racist jokes with. But when he discovers the kid who first tried to steal the Gran Torino of the film's title ain't the gang-banging type, Walt decides he will make a real man out of the kid and make up for the failed sons he thinks he didn't teach right.<br /><br />Which makes him the Cop from the even worse movie, "Crash." "Gran Torino" earns its fourth star based on Eastwood, who plays Walt with such effortless slyness that he manages to coast through the movie on sheer force of will. The other is the teenage Hmong sister Sue (Ahney Her), who has picked up American spunk and sasses to Walt in a manner that makes him learn acceptance (sort of). When Walt stops a bunch of gang members from attacking Sue and her brother (with the infamous "Get off my lawn" trailer quote), Walt becomes their reluctant hero...and the gang's new enemy.<br /><br />As the conflict builds and Walt moves towards the inevitable gang showdown, "Gran Torino" stumbles. I could guess the ending from a mile away, and seeing the previously stone-cold racist Walt suddenly make this kind of turn-about felt too "feel-good" to not ring false. Anyone but Eastwood would have made this a car-wreck, but in his skilled hands, "Gran Torino" remains a decent movie to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran.  GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on our American Family.<br /><br />GRAN TORINO as written by Nick Schenk and Dave Johanson and as produced, directed and acted by Clint Eastwood is not a film easy to hear or watch in its early portions.  Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is burying his wife, only to return to his long term home in a neighborhood that has become a sanctuary for Hmong people (an ethnic  group  from the mountain regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma who supported US troops and were evacuated to the US after the Vietnam conflict).  Kowalski is a prejudiced bigot who loathes the presence of the (unnamable epithets) neighbors.  Next door is a family that includes a young loner boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his worldly sister Sue (Ahney Her) - two young people caught up in the Hmong world where the girls go to school and become employed and the boys go to jail.  Kowalski reluctantly befriends a gang threatened Thao and the neighborhood rewards him with endless gifts of flowers and food.  Gradually an event secures Kowalski's attachment to Thao and Kowalski grows to understand and respect 'the enemy' - people who are genuinely kind and loving despite Kowalski's personality and lonely bitter veteran's life.  The transformation of Walt Kowalski as played by Eastwood is genuinely touching and the way in which the movie ends is surprisingly sophisticated.<br /><br />There are moments in this bumpy script that are so trite and repetitive and stereotyped that the film becomes almost unwatchable.  But it is to the credit of the cast and Eastwood's direction that eventually the repeated verbal slurs of racial hatred make the resolution of the film even more powerful.  There are many lessons to be learned by listening and watching this film, not the least of which is insight into the psyches of war veterans from all wars.

Having at one time or another been called every vile term his Walt Kowalski levels with complete ease at his Hmong neighbors, I know the film ain't lying about the generally overlooked and often discounted racism against Asians in the U.S., but at the same time, I've never met anyone, let alone anyone Polish, with the unceasing vitriol that defines Walt's very existence.  In this, he falls into that narrow range of choices Hollywood makes for ethnic groups; if Italians must be gangsters and pizza makers or the Irish cops and bartenders, then Walt has to be the stereotypical racist, drunken, blue-collar Polack.  (He has plenty of company -- for starters, think Marlon Brando in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and Mickey Rourke in "Year of the Dragon.")  Oh, make no mistake, factory workers, including ones in my own family, could put away the beer, but Walt might well put two or three of these red-blooded guys under the table, even if I can't for the life of me remember any of them ever even contemplating reaching for a Pabst Blue Ribbon.<br /><br />But all this is understandable because despite its illusion of grit, "Gran Torino" exists in a gauzy fantasy space that allows suburban moviegoers to confront the real ugliness of bigotry, even their own, from a safe, artificial distance, like staring down that lion at the zoo that in the wild would be feasting on their bones.  Once again, Walt falls into another familiar Hollywood trope: the flawed white guy who must overcome his prejudices to help beleaguered minorities who can't help themselves.  Oh, and he's haunted by a war with Asians.  And his family is a bunch of jerks.  And he's dying, too.  If it sounds like I'm being too hard on "Gran Torino," a film that's wowed both critics and audiences, perhaps I am, but it's mostly because I truly like and expect more of Clint Eastwood, even moreso now that he's deservedly come into his own as a filmmaker with fare like "Letters from Iwo Jima."  Even here, he gives a performance that rises above the predictable story and hokey setups that too often mar the intent of "Gran Torino" to be taken seriously as a drama rather than a melodrama, and more importantly, a meaningful statement on racial harmony.  But I'm also struck by the nagging feeling that if it wasn't for the presence of Eastwood, playing what in many ways is a geriatric version of Dirty Harry, the same people lauding the film might not be shrugging at its mediocrity (and, no, I'm not referring to the sincere but sometimes uneven performances of his Hmong co-stars).  What's left are a lot of funny lines, mostly because of the brazenness of Walt's racism, a few touching moments between Walt and Sue and Tao, the two kids he will grow closest to, and an ending that's a "gotcha" you'll see coming from a mile away.<br /><br />Still -- and this is part of the surreality -- seeing an 80-year-old Eastwood sticking an M-1 rifle in a punk's face and snarling "Get off my lawn" is almost worth the price of admission alone.  It, too, is a cliche, but one of the few that the writers manage to cleverly turn on its head.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood is a powerful presence in this film, as Walt Kowalsky, an elderly Korean war veteran trapped in his hyper-masculine, racist, emotionally bared down persona. He is a widower, lonely, seeks refuge in his Gran Torino sports car and practical domestic tasks. He oozes growling, simmering fury at the invasion of his neighbourhood by Asian families 'Gooks, eggrolls, Charlie Chans'.<br /><br />The plot is a sort of grand redemption, road to calvary message as Walt finds himself unwillingly ensnared in the lives of the Korean youngsters next door to him, in particular Thao, a young man who initially tries to steal his car but emerges as a vulnerable youth in need of work and a father figure which Walt provides in his brusque, no-nonsense way (including a great scene where he educates the young Korean in savage, ball busting banter with his local Argentinian barber).<br /><br />As the tension develops, Walt, with his finger always metaphorically if not literally on the trigger of one of the guns he keeps in his bedroom, takes on a local gang of Asians with a much nastier tone than the ones in his immediate neighbourhood. He becomes a sort of white man protector figure, a chiselled, classical, superannuated hero who uses his old fashioned virtues to one last effect to save the new immigrant influx. The result is powerful, if a little simplistic, with bombast and symbolism overwhelming much subtlety.<br /><br />This film is noteworthy for being, supposedly, Eastwood's last screen role. And the finale perhaps gains a little resonance from that fact.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood directed, produced, and starred as Walt Kowalski in this drama about life and death in a changing America. He's more like his character type than ever before. Kowalski is a snarling Polish racist, bitter retired auto worker, and haunted Korean war veteran who despises the Hmong "swamp rats" who've moved into the dilapidated house next door. The film opens with two clashing cultural rituals--the church burial of Kowalski's wife, and the strange Hmong customs that welcome a new baby. The film ends with another funeral that we never expect, this one the result of a deliberately redemptive act. Early on we surmise that the gruff and grumbly Kowalski will be won over by his Hmong neighbors. But there's far more to the film, as Kowalski can't stand idly by and not help the Hmong negotiate their own cultural obstacles, namely, Hmong gang members who try to recruit their son Thao. Large portions of this film are explicitly religious as Kowalski experiences a dramatic conversion.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Gran Torino" begins with a grim, crusty, bigoted Clint Eastwood (Walt Kowalski) who has just become a widower. Living with him must have been an act of penance for his devoutly Catholic wife. A very persistent boyish-looking priest in his late twenties has promised Clint's wife that he'll get the old codger to confession.<br />He has two sons and some grandkids who are self-centered, mean, and hateful, but they are also rubrics rather than real people. With a patriarch like Eastwood, it's little wonder they turned out so nasty.<br />He lives in a well-kept single family home in a nice neighborhood that's been taken over by Southeast Asians (Hmongs). Clint's prize possessions are an antique Ford Gran Torino (he worked on the Ford Detroit assembly line for many years) and an M-1 rifle from his service in Korea.<br />Over the years Eastwood's voice has grown hoarser, more gravelly, more strained and harder to distinguish. He's a dinosaur of the American film industry but still a national treasure.<br />The plot is formulaic, melodramatic and predictable. Eastwood is gradually won over by his Asian neighbors, especially the son and daughter next door. He becomes a mentor for the son and has to prevent the boy from becoming prey for the local Asian gang. Eastwood at first resorts to his guns with vestiges of his Dirty Harry image coming to the fore.<br />Eastwood has perfected a screen persona that is difficult for him to step out of. Even his walk is iconic. It probably would be better for him to let someone else direct a picture like this so it wouldn't turn into a star vehicle.<br />The ending is a surprise in a movie that needs a jolt of originality. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This is a somewhat interesting movie, although a little too pat in places. It's almost as if Eastwood placed himself at a carnival shooting gallery, with the bad guys popping up at predictable intervals for him to shoot down. The gang of hooligan Hmong teens pop up to try to roust their cousin to join their gang. Then they pop up to roust the young female teen in the family. As in Death Wish, there almost seem to be too many timed gang threats for the lead character to prove himself against.<br /><br />Then Eastwood's film children pop up in predictable, self-seeking fashion to urge him into the dullness of a retirement home. He shoots down these threats in turn - not with a gun this time, but verbally.<br /><br />There is also a certain predictability to the character that Eastwood plays. He is the gruff Archie Bunker bigot with a heart of gold. However, he does evolve, albeit again, a little too neatly on cue.<br /><br />But the film ultimately takes the viewer to some interesting places. And we learn something about the Hmong culture along the way. The Hmong are a group of Southeast Asian hill people whose story has rarely been told on the screen.<br /><br />There is no Director's commentary on this DVD, but there are a couple of bonus features centering on the 1972 Gran Torino that's the star of this film, and on classic muscle cars in general. Some of the men involved in the making of this movie and some others reminisce about their first cars and their dream cars. We get to see a Detroit rally of classic cars along Woodward Avenue in the process - an especially poignant parade since the Detroit scene has so altered in the months since this movie was released.<br /><br />With all these elements - insight into Hmong culture, classic cars, and a new dimension to classic Eastwood toughness - there are a number of reasons to check out this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>I should have saved Gran Torino for Father's Day, this coming weekend, and watched it together with my son, maybe as a double feature with The Great Santini. Looking over the reviews of this film here on the Big River, I find that the stars are closely correlated with the reminiscences of ornery old bustard fathers. Mine was one. In fact, my Dad looked almost exactly like Walt Kowalsky, Eastwood's character, at the same age. He dressed the same, walked the same, drank almost the same (slightly better taste in beer), and definitely hated the same. Only his accent was different -- my Dad's -- being a weird acquired country-western drawl on top of his still-Swedish pronunciation. He worshiped, like Kowalski, in the great American Church on Wheels; he was a car mechanic most of his life, and he had a Plymouth Barracuda that he cared for more tenderly than either of his two children. He was washing his car one afternoon, at age 91, when he had a stroke and died with the hose running. Neighbors found him a few hours later when the water started to flood their yard. Those neighbors were Salvadore&ntilde;os rather than Hmong, as in Eastwood's film, but the neighborhood dynamics were equivalent.<br /><br />Some critics have 'explained' Walt Kowalsky's bitter racism and self-hatred as the consequence of his experiences in the Korean War. Eastwood himself expresses that through his character's mouth and through the starchy dialogue between Walt and the young priest who tries to 'understand' him. Honestly, I don't think the atrocities of war were necessary to create a Walt Kowalsky. My father was of an age to have fought in WW2, but he didn't. He dodged, and the rest of his life he did his best to pretend he hadn't. In the '60s, he "disowned" me - temporarily - for refusing service in Viet Nam. I see this exoneration of Walt Kowalsky, as a victim of PTSD, as a slight weakness in the concept of Gran Torino, a too-easy excuse for the racism and xenophobia of "our" fathers' generation(s).<br /><br />The most touching moment of Gran Torino comes when Walt murmurs that he feels more in common with his g**k neighbors than with his upwardly-mobile sons and their families. That's not a unique perception. Garrison Keillor has expressed it time and again in his Lake Wobegon sketches. Farmers in Iowa, according to NPR, have been finding themselves sharing more with their hired Guatemalan help than with their college-gone heirs; they end up selling the farm to the newcomers and staying on as guests.<br /><br />But my own father never had Walt Kowalsky's epiphany. Tragically, he remained a ranting rightwing racist till the end. The virtue of this film -- this re-examination of 'Dirty Harry' by the actor who made "dirty Harry' an iconic figure -- is Clint Eastwood's powerful affirmation of a new integrated America, the land where diversity and assimilation can be reconciled. I wish all our fathers had gone that route.<br /><br />Artistically, cinematographically, Eastwood's performance in the role of Kowalsky is the only five-star feature of Gran Torino. The script is no masterpiece, and the other actors range from "not bad" to "well, I've seen worse." Clint Eastwood is his own most iconic story, from his spaghetti westerns to his comedy surliness to his current confessional maturity. I wonder who has the film rights to produce "The Eastwood Chronicle" when he dies...</p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>If watching a film over and over again is any indication of a great story, this one merits such praise.<br /><br />Always playing a quintessential American, he repeats such a performance here as a recently widowed retiree and Korean war veteran who resents the HMong Asians that are taking over his neighborhood. His well-kept home and mannicured lawn adorned with an American flag represent his values, and stands as a beacon in a neighborhood that is being overcome by neglect and overrun by gangs. Wanting to be left alone, his contempt for customs, dress and language of his neighbors is palpable in word and facial expression. He shares almost as much contempt for his neglectful sons, and his granddaughter whom he despises for her dress and lack of manners.<br /><br />A strange relationship develops when he finds out one of his neighbors attempted to steal his pristine, 1972, Gran Torino that he helped build in his assemly line career at Ford Motor Company. The boy's mother insists he make restitution for the family's honor. The man who just wants to be left alone is drawn to the would-be thief and the family he disdains. We see him as a curmudgeon who pays them compliments with insults such as "I could use some good gook food," when invited for dinner. In fact his character, Walt Kowalski uses all of them under the Sun (Yat Sen).  Yet, their respect for such a disrespectful man grows, as he takes the boy under his wing and becomes the protector of the rest of his family.<br /><br />This is where Eastwood's performance soars. He appears to be in constant conflict with his prejudice against his sense of justice and fair play. He goes over the edge when one of the family members suffers at the hands of a local gang. Justice must be served and sacrifices must be made. Their mutual devotion replaces the lack of the same with his own family.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has delivered such memorable characters as Dirty Harry and Josie Wales with great lines such as, "Go ahead; make my day" and "Dyin's not much of a livin'." Like a good wine or scotch improves with age, Eastwood becomes equally memorable as a director. When he directs and acts, it is topnotch entertainment from a very simple story of a complicated human being. His supporting cast is also superb, and this film may launch future careers to prominence. The score, if you can call it that, is mellow and almost haunting.<br /><br />There is not a dull moment in this film in what starts off as a seemingly bland plot. With a penchant for a wandering mind for average stories, I was not only transfixed watching it, but watched it two more times to pick up nuance I might have missed. I was never bored.<br /><br />I don't think you will be bored either. Order it here, or drive to your nearest outlet to rent or buy it, even if you don't have a 1972 Gran Torino to get there.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I don't think I've ever heard so many racial slurs in a movie, but dang, that was good. I loved Eastwood's hard-nosed character and how he wouldn't take crap from anyone, and whipping Thao into shape and helping him down a better path. The ending was rather bittersweet but appropriate.<br /><br />If my own family was like that (talking about taking me to a retirement home on my birthday!!!) I'd be the same way towards them. The poem 'Do Not Go Into the Good Night' came to mind when I finished watching this film because of Eastwood's character and his toughness. Overall great movie, 4.5/5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be! It had a great storyline, good message, some funny moments, and some heart-breaking moments. Clint Eastwood was awesome as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is very cranky, grumpy, and racist. He lives in a neighborhood dominated by poor Asian immigrants and infested with gangs. A young Hmong boy named Thao Lor who agrees to an initiation which requires him to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, but Walt stops him. Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do. I highly recommend GRAN TORINO!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I thought the acting by Clint Eastwood was a bit contrived and over the top. There were too many racial slurs and slangs which made me feel uncomfortable at times.  Just too much name calling!  The filming was a bit dreary, it was depressing to watch.  The climatic end was touching but it left me feeling empty.  There hasn't been a really good movie released in over a year, what's up???</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Betty, I know you are going to hate me for this, but I have to be honest here.  This movie was just horrible.  It's hard for me to put into eloquent words all of the missteps this poor little film made, because part of me just feels like rambling off a list of bad decisions.<br /><br />First, I'll lay out the plot.<br /><br />Walt is a bitter and grumpy old man who is an unapologetic racist dwelling in a community overrun by those with which he has hatred for.  His family has all but written him off, and this visibly irks Walt.  When his neighbor, young Thao, attempts to steal his Gran Torino (as part of a gang initiation), Walt finds himself in a situation (with individuals) he never foresaw.  After inadvertently saving Thao from the clutches of his cousin's gang, Walt is further introduced to Thao's family, and despite being hesitant he begins to warm to Thao after he officially apologizes.  Walt then has Thao become his `handyman', putting him to work around the house doing odd jobs here and there.  Things seem to go well for the two, and a bond is formed, but if we know anything about gangs we know that this will not be the end of things.<br /><br />The story felt VERY clich&eacute;d and it didn't really try to compensate for those obvious generalizations.  Some make remarks like "this is far better than `Crash'" but in the end they are both rather embarrassing reflections of racism to be quite honest.  I'd like you to explain to me HOW this is better than `Crash'.  I won't say it is worse (although I gave `Crash' a C, my feelings for that film have dropped considerably), but it is hardly better.<br /><br />So let's take this apart, shall we.<br /><br />I'll start with the script.  Like I said, there are clich&eacute;s that pretty much mount one on top of the other here, from the formulaic way in which Thao's family is represented to the ridiculously generic way that Walt is presented to us.  There is nothing genuine about his character.  Everything feels pulled from another performance or character developed in an Eastwood movie.  This is Eastwood playing Eastwood.  He is grumpy, and everyone knows it, and his family has distanced themselves from him (who can blame them) and yet we are supposed to feel an urge of sympathy for him because he overcomes his racism and befriends Thao and his family?  I found the scene in the barbershop with Thao to be rather ridiculous too.  Yes, this is the type of guy that Walt is, but it's nothing to feel all chummy about.  The way the film ended I thought was (somewhat) clever, and then it went all Hallmark sentiment with the final frame, which I found a tad squeamish.<br /><br />How about the direction, since that is what Eastwood is all about?  Honestly, this film lacks tremendously in that regard.  Now, for all of you out there (yes, you MKIA) who think that I am an Eastwood hater and that I'm blowing this out of proportion, realize that I gave `Million Dollar Baby' an A+ and still highly regard that film (and it's direction), not to mention an A for `Unforgiven', and despite not caring for it collectively, I gave pretty high marks to `Changeling' as well.  This film though, is just poorly constructed and realized.  The direction is very stagy.  Look at the scene when the family is worried about Sue and she comes in the door, and Walt drops his drink.  Watch how the camera zooms into a closeup of the drink, telling us that Walt is going to drop it before he does and then, what does Walt do...he lets go.  It's not a `disoriented slip through his fingers' drop, it's an `open my hand and make a statement' drop.  It just feels fake.  Decisions like that one give this film an air of unnaturalness that ruins any connective tissue.<br /><br />But, the acting takes the cake here.  Casting `non-actors' is kind of a vanity thing for a director, but in the end there are moments where it works.  This is not one of them.  Bee Vang has to carry about as much of this film as Eastwood (we'll get to him in a minute) and so he needed to be more authenticated.  I love how one reviewer makes the statement that while Vang comes off wooden, "there is no substitute for authenticity."  Sorry, but that wooden quality strips the performance of authenticity.  He's obviously trying too hard.  Eastwood, like I mentioned earlier, is just playing himself.  Yes, the script is at fault for handing him a caricature (I don't care what you say about his character arc, it just boils down to a mess of generalities) but Eastwood doesn't put any real life into it.<br /><br />Snarling and growling and looking all mean and stuff is not really emoting, like at all.<br /><br />In the end, this overcooked film is just a mess.  I'm sorry Betty, I know you love your Clint (and I won't hold that against you if you don't hold this review against me) but this film is just plain bad.  Maybe the whole racism subject should just be left alone, since no one can really seem to get it right (is it just me or was this another one of those `white guy saves the day' kind of message films), but then again it is a potent subject that has potential to really create something poignant.<br /><br />This is not poignant.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I'm not crazy about this movie. I think the best part of the whole movie is the ending. When Walt leave's his house to the church. Instead of his son's family. They don't deserve that house after the way they were to him. I'm also happy that he gave his car to that chines kid instead of his granddaughter. She also doesn't deserve anything,</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>A surprisingly shallow way for Clint Eastwood's cinematic career to draw to a close, Gran Torino may have been better served with a more thick-witted title, something along the lines of "Bitter Old Man Points Guns at Minorities." Not that there isn't fertile ground for exploration along these lines; Eastwood's isolated, closed-minded widower could have been an excellent vehicle for prodding a number of inherent stereotypes present in modern American suburbia. Instead of meeting those issues head-on, though, it spends most of its time stalking up and down the sidelines and, often, reinforcing the kind of bull-headed resistance to different cultures that, at the outset, it seemed ready to confront. I had a hard time accepting any of this film's main players as anything more than thin caricatures, especially considering the bland, straightforward dialog they're given to work with, and that resulted in a major emotional disconnect during the climax. Eastwood's jaded war veteran never seems to move completely beyond his biases and, shamefully, the film's resolution only serves to prove him right. A plodding, incomplete picture that will only be remembered for the single quotable line heard in its trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Disappointing tale from Clint Eastwood. Clint plays an grumpy old racist who learns to love his next door immigrants. Yeah, it's just as bad as it sounds. I have to say, I thought the first half was absolutely HILARIOUS! Clint's character was just so over-the-top, I figure it had to be camp/caricature. The way he comes up with new way to insult everyone? And goes around growling like a dog? Too funny! (And here's hoping that it was supposed to be funny, otherwise the movie's worse than I feared.) The second half of the movie really goes downhill, and becomes a kind of 'Karate Kid' in reverse (this time, the adult is American and the kid is Asian). The lone bright spot of the movie is the teenage girl who lives next door - she's a firecracker, and the movie is better every time she is on the screen. But otherwise, this is boring and predictable, something you don't usually get from Eastwood.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>Gran Torino (2008) is a movie that is so brazenly anti-p.c. that I am surprised it was even made.  The movie shows the reality of gang warfare and the futility of trying to stand up to these thugs.  The epithet hurling Eastwood finds he has more in common with the hard-working and tradition-based Hmung than with the sniveling whiners who make up his own family.  Eastwood's character takes on the young boy "Toad" and teaches him important lessons.  The best scene in the movie occurs when Eastwood appears with a gun and tells the gang of street thugs to "Get off my lawn!".  It shows real attitude.  Anyone who has ever stepped out of the ivory tower long enough to witness the operations of these types of gangs can certainly appreciate this.  Ultimately the film features an epic showdown in which Eastood must take on the gang harassing Tao's family.  There is little left for him but to be put into an old-folk's home by his own superficial and parisitic family or to go out fighting.  As always, Eastwood chooses the tough guy's way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>In what promises to be Clint Eastwood's valedictory role as an actor he once again reimagines the Man With No Name-Dirty Harry persona so that's so burnished in our collective psyche.  Walt Kowalski(Eastwood) is a retired Ford worker who can be best described as grizzled, profane, and just a little bit Archie Bunker-ish in his worldview.  Not the least bit misanthropic he feels more of a connection to his '72 Gran Torino than he does his own family.  Dig a little deeper, though, you find a man bearing the scars of his service in the Korean conflict.  Walt has an ingrained perception of the American dream but finds that being challenged by the changing face of his Detroit neighborhood particularly his reaction to the Hmong family who live next door to him.  Through a series of events, though, Walt developes a connection daresay a deep-rooted respect for the Hmong. Walt also feels, even in his dotage, the obligation to serve as protector to this family in an ever increasing hostile environment.  I harken back to "Unforgiven" when Eastwood re-evaluated his Western persona.  Here, Eastwood does a re-examination of his more reactionary film characters.  This film was cleverly advertised by it's makers as a geriatric action extravaganza.  For sure justice is meted out in the end but not remotely in a way you would think.  This film definitely stands out in the canon of Eastwood's illustrious career.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>This is a great story with a lot of themes.  It contains racism, bitterness, accountability, kindness, heroism, and redemption.  And that is just in the main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood).<br /><br />Walt is a cantankerous Korean War vet who is a recent widower.  His next door neighbors are a Hmong extended family.  A teenage boy in the clan, Thao (Bee Vang) is being pressured heavily to join a street gang to which his cousin belongs.  He is resistant, but eventually succumbs.  As an initiation rite he is required to steal Kowalski's prize possession, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino.<br /><br />In typical Eastwood fashion, he is a heroic tough guy even at 78 years old.  He stops Thao from stealing the car.  Eventually he takes the lad under his wing.  The story of inter-generational friendship between them is strong and very well done.<br /><br />This is really a great show.  The language and racial slurs are a bit rough so it is not a good one for younger viewers, but it is a very good one for the adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>This is a remarkable movie. --Richard T. Jameson, taken from the product review<br /><br />If you are Clint Eastwood, you can make a movie how it should be made. As grand, iconoclastic Dirty Harry, Eastwood stood up for those who would make America better and stronger. As Walt Kowalski, he fiercely faces down a neighborhood gang and rescues young Thao, brother of Sue, his sassy new Hmong friend and neighbor.<br /><br />This is the point where Eastwood becomes Walt--racist, mouth filled with racial epithets spilled forthrightly on the objects of his racism. But it is not a purposeful racism, just one of habit and habitat. As with any meaningful exchange with those different from us, he begins to see that the Hmongs are people--and Americans, as he is, but in a different cultural context. It is actually liberating for Walt to make this connection (he doesn't have one with his sons and their families).<br /><br />My first thought after seeing this movie was disappointment mixed with respect. "Gran Torino" did not produce the thrill I expected, but instead delivers compassion and redemption and sacrifice, inestimable values in the big picture of Life. Ol' Walt had more in common with the priest's boss than first meets the eye.<br /><br />I wondered why Eastwood specifically chose Hmongs to be his neighbors (were they initially scripted in?). Developing genuine concern, compassion, and finally affection for his neighbors, Walt shows how Archie Bunker could have been 20 years down the road of American cultural dynamics.<br /><br />This, I thought, was Eastwood's purpose. America is changing; let's acknowledge it, accept it, and embrace this change. How my heart swelled with respect and fondness for this new icon--a Walt embracing his own mortality by acceptance and finally redemption.<br /><br />This is a remarkable movie--<br />Judy Polhemus.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>A superlative achievement, Clint Eastwood's "Gran Torino" (2008) charts new territory for the legendary actor-director while continuing his cinematic winning streak. The fact that Eastwood made this film and the powerful "Changeling" in the same year is nothing short of astonishing. Just when you thought Clint had retired from acting, he emerges with another classic portrayal as a redemptive veteran in a changing urban landscape. Hollywood rarely gets it right these days, but Eastwood delivers the goods. "Gran Torino" represents the movie icon at his absolute best.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>If "Gran Torino" actually proves to be Clint Eastwood's final appearance as an actor (and he has said so), I can't think of a more fitting swansong; his portrayal of an antisocial, racist widower, facing his own mortality while relearning compassion from his hmong neighbors, is a magnificent performance, certainly one of his best. It combines elements of many of his classic characters, with the subtlety and depth 50 years on both sides of the camera has taught him. Some will howl at his language and obvious bigotry, but without this coarseness, we would not truly understand his pain, or fully appreciate his spiritual rebirth.<br /><br />This may sound crazy, but I found myself comparing "Gran Torino" with "The Shootist", John Wayne's final film. Both films involve protagonists who are dying of cancer, mentoring boys, and ultimately ending their lives while ridding society of a dangerous element. With due respect for Wayne, I believe the Eastwood film is far superior; Eastwood's characterization is much deeper, the 'community' is portrayed in a kinder fashion, and the resolution is both smarter, and more effective. The film offers humor, as well, an element largely missing in the Wayne film.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is a film guaranteed to be on the short list of Eastwood's finest; I'm proud to have it in my DVD collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood pulls double duty as director and actor here, starring as Walt Kowalski, a mean, cranky old racist who has a change of heart in "Gran Torino".  The journey Walt takes is just one of several making up the movie though.<br /><br />  It starts with the funeral of Walt's beloved wife, who we never see but gather was somewhat of a kinder soul than Walt, and probably a positive influence as far as keeping his nastier character traits at bay.  In the days following the funeral we see Walt as alone and bitter, estranged from the rest of his family and seemingly unable to make emotional connections.  One of the things making him so bitter is that his neighborhood is becoming increasingly Asian in character.  North America is changing, and places that were once almost exclusively white are now more multi-racial or in some case dominated by one particular ethnic group.  This neighborhood has an increasing number of Hmong (a Southeast Asian ethnic group), and it's safe to say that Walt hasn't been overjoyed to see their numbers increasing over the years.  At the start of the movie, he's a racist, not just 'old and set in his ways', not just 'narrow-minded', but outright racist.  The fact that the movie doesn't try to sugarcoat it makes the character's transformation much more powerful.<br /><br />  There are two main interpersonal 'pulls' in the movie - one is Walt's being pulled against his will into the fabric of the neighborhood, the other is a Hmong kid of around 15 (I estimate), Thao (Bee Vang) - Walt's next door neighbor - being pulled against his will into a Hmong-dominated street gang.  He's cousin to one of the heads of the gang, and therefore, as the gang expands further and further from their traditional stomping grounds and into the suburbs, Thao gets invited to join.  In classic gang style, it's an offer he can't refuse.  So little by little he's getting sucked into this lifestyle that he very much wants to avoid, but appears powerless to.  His initiation feat into the gang is to steal his neighbor Walt's classic Gran Torino car.  When he's caught in the act and the other members flee, his family decides his punishment is to 'help out' Walt with yard work, household chores, etc. for the next little while, as atonement.  Walt isn't interested and refuses the deal, but Thao is pushed to try and make ammends anyway.  Not long after, an incident in the neighborhood involving the gang occurs, and Walt becomes the neighborhood hero by running a couple of gang members off.  To Walt's horror, this seems to spur the Hmong community in the neighborhood to 'adopt' him, arriving with gifts and baskets and food, always greeting him warmly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that Walt doesn't like them very much.  Of course, despite his hostility towards Asians, he's never really known one outside of his experiences in the Korean War, where they were on opposite sides (he seems to have plenty of recollections of Koreans as the enemy, but few of the South Koreans as his side's allies).  As he's unwillingly drawn into the community, his feelings toward his Hmong neighbors slowly begin to change...<br /><br />  This may sound cliched or contrived, but absolutely nothing in the movie comes off that way.  Every characterization and interaction - good or bad - feels very genuine.  During this time we see Walt trying and failing to re-establish some kind of connection with his biological family; we also see him being very shocked with himself that he's becoming so close to his 'new' family, particularly Thao and his older sister Sue (Ahney Her), to both of whom he seems to be filling some kind of uncle of even fatherly role.  Meanwhile though, the other pull is still going - the gang's determination to recruit Thao, seemingly motivated primarily by the fact that they're offended by the idea of anyone turning them down.  Thao is increasingly determined not to go that way, but that just seems to make the gang more insistent.  Gran Torino gives a really good picture of the hard spot someone like Thao is in when he's targeted for recruitment like this by a gang that might do anything at all if he doesn't go along with them.  It's a predicament his family sees, and that Walt comes to recognize as well.<br /><br />  The movie becomes extremely intense in its end stages, building up to a tremendously powerful finale.  What's more unexpected is all the humor and, for lack of a better word, 'warmth' that starts coming in about a third of the way through.  These elements don't clash with the tension, but provide a counterpoint.  And as we see in the movie, things can turn from very 'happy' to very, very grim on a dime.<br /><br />  An ability to juggle seemingly disparate tones, and universally excellent performances, help make Gran Torino a great movie on all levels.  For a skillful blend of drama, tenderness and vicious suspense, you can't go better than this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>Walt Kowalski is a man who seems nearly impossible to get along with.  His kids make attempts (albeit poor ones), his self-involved granddaughter, and even a 27-year-old "virgin" Catholic priest.  It seems that the only person who had any kind of deep connection with him, was his wife.  Any of us who have never been involved in a war, couldn't possibly understand what it does to a person.  It becomes clear that Walt is carrying tremendous guilt about the things he's done in the Korean War.  He can't let it go.  He buries himself in his anger and contempt for nearly everyone else, especially including a Hmong family who has moved in next door.<br /><br />Right from the get-go, it's clear that Walt can't stand them.  They remind him too much of the people he fought against in Korea.  Walt is so used to insulting nearly everyone he meets, that it's practically second nature to him.  It's his defense mechanism, so that he can never have to have a deep connection with anyone.  The only people who can stand him are a couple of drinking buddies at a bar, the town barber, and the town construction supervisor.<br /><br />One night, Thao, the young son of the Hmong family, is pressured by a Hmong gang to attempt to steal Walt's car (the 1972 Gran Torino) as part of a gang initiation.  Walt catches him in the act, which only seems to cement his hatred of them.  When Thao resists doing anything else for the gang, he is threatened by them, and lo and behold, his "savior" happens to be Walt holding an old-style rifle used in the Korea War.  Walt, of course, couldn't care less about Thao, but simply wants them all off his lawn.  Little does Walt realize, that this simple act of protection has opened a door, he never sees.<br /><br />Sue is Thao's older sister.  It's clear that she likes Walt, despite his offensive remarks.  Through Sue, Walt begins to find a connection with the Hmong.  "I have more in common with these people than I do my own family!" he quips.  He's invited to a Hmong gathering, and strange enough to Walt, he's enjoying himself.  Thao is forced to do odd-jobs for Walt to pay off his debt for his attempt to steal Walt's car.  This gives Walt yet another connection...ironically enough to the boy who attempted to steal his car.  Walt sees that Thao isn't like the kids in the Hmong gang, but that this boy actually has a chance to do something with his life.  Walt realizes that this probably won't happen as long as the Hmong gang continues to terrorize Thao and his family.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is arguably one of the best directors in the business.  Some people have complained about the acting of the Hmong cast.  I didn't have a problem with it.  They aren't professional actors, and that is okay.  Instead, it's as if they are simply playing themselves.  Their lines almost seem improvisational and not from a script.  For this film, it works well.  I was especially impressed by young Ahney Her (Sue).  I felt that she wonderfully created the bridge between Sue and Walt.  She's tough, and yet kind and sensitive.  That is a pretty good balance to achieve for a first-time actress.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is carrying a heavy burden of guilt.  The priest attempts to help Walt, but as Walt explains to him, "You know nothing about life and death, kid."  The priest realizes that Walt is correct.  The priest has never been in a war, nor has ever been asked to take a life because it was his job; and to learn to hate a group of people to help you perform that job.  Like a poison, the anger and guilt is eating Walt up.  Despite what Walt says to the contrary, it's evident that Walt loves Sue and Thao as if they were his own kids.  He helps them, looks after them, and protects them from something he never wants them to ever have to be a part of.<br /><br />Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's last acting job, and boy, does he end his illustrious career with an incredible film.  It's about the power of redemption; about finding a way of excising yourself of the demons that nearly everyone carries; and how holding on to that guilt, eats you up like a cancer.  Some scenes are difficult to watch, and strangely enough, we get used to Walt's constant racial slurs.  I think the reason for this is, that to most of the audience who knows and understands Walt Kowalski, he doesn't really mean it.  He simply doesn't know any other way to communicate.<br /><br />Gran Torino may not seem like a masterpiece, but is really comes close.  For Eastwood's final curtain call, Gran Torino has a lot of power in its message, and many may well view it as a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>Clint Eastwood is still a badass, even in old age, and Gran Torino (2008) proves it.  We've all seen him in so many roles that have him playing a tough guy over the years - from his western movies, to Dirty Harry, to Escape From Alcatraz, to this movie, Eastwood always plays a badass tough guy and plays it well.  Clint Eastwood directed, produced and acted in the leading role in this movie.  Eastwood plays the role of Walter Kowalski, a retired factory worker and Korean War veteran who lives near Detroit.  He's old.  He's one of those old, crabby guys that's mad at the world.  He's a racist.  Or at least he starts out this movie as a racist.  His neighborhood has gone from being lilly white to multicultural and overrun by gangs.  His family doesn't have close relations with him.  He's very much alone.<br /><br />His young punk Hmong neighbor, Thao, tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino out of his garage one night.  Kowalski catches him in the act, but Thao escapes.  The stunt was supposed to be for Thao's initiation into a local gang.  Walt realizes it was his neighbor Thao that tried to steal his car.  Kowalski calms down a bit and has Thao work for him to sort of redeem himself for the crime he almost committed.  The two become friends and from that point various bad things happen to Thao's family that are the result of being victimized by the gangs.  Kowalski's anger toward the gang boils over to the point where he personally wants to see to it that the gang pays for their crimes.  The gang's demise and destruction is Kowalski's ultimate goal.  In the process, his racism evaporates as the movie progresses.  I don't want to reveal the ending.  Watch this movie to see for yourself what happens.<br /><br />I like the character Eastwood plays.  He's rough around the edges, in declining health, hardened by war and his own neighborhood's decline.  He has a filthy mouth.  Only Clint Eastwood can deliver the lines he does in this movie and make them work.  They're so Clint Eastwood-esque.  I find his lines very humorous.  The way he carries himself in this movie is classic.<br /><br />If you want to see a very unique movie that can touch you in some ways, see this movie.  It's not overly complex.  It's very simple but very entertaining.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YVDY3TISDRE1.html">A1YVDY3TISDRE1</a><br/><p>Crusty, "set in his ways" Korean War vet Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) confronts a threat of gang violence in his community and his own prejudice when he tries to help his next door neighbors who are Asian.  Everything has already been said about this film--- just watch it.  Great movie about family, life, loss, and relationships and opening your heart to others.  Another Eastwood hit!!!!<br /><br />***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED***</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>...And not many can pull that off. I pride myself in having seen every Clint Eastwood movie. Some were good, some were so-so, some were outstanding. Before watching "Gran Torino" I had no idea what to expect. All I knew was it was about an aging Korean vet living in a neighborhood with Asians. A clash of cultures, prejudice and especially war memories. Eastwood's character doesn't respect Asians; in fact he hates every aspect of them as well as their culture. But he learns as he gets to know them. The friendship between Walt and the Asian boy develops as the movie progresses. I am not going to spoil the end of this gem of a movie but I want to say that the ending could make you feel sad, but it doesn't. Very weird but that's the magic of movie making and Eastwood proves yet again he's a pro before as well as behind the camera.<br /><br />I can't recall having enjoyed a simple movie like this over the past couple of years. It's a delight to watch. Yes, Clint is older, but he's not ready for a retirement home, meaning he can still kick butt (and does so)! In fact his character could be described as an old and cranky Dirty Harry but with moral standards and a touch of humanity.<br /><br />Even if you're not an Eastwood fan, this is truly a great movie from start to finish. I would even go this far in saying that it surely ranks as one of the zeniths of his career. Thank you Clint. You were and are a giant!</p></br></body></html>

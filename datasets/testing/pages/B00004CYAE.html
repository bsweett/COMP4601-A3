Veteran troupers Ed Wynn, Reginald Owen and Arthur Treacher lend colorful support, and Van Dyke is an appealing song and dance man, though his Cockney accent fails him. The real draw of course is the irresistible Andrews, who won the Oscar in her first starring role. Best for younger children, and young-at-heart parents.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Robert Stevenson<p>"Mary Poppins" is one of the most beloved movies of all time, and for good reason.  This truly is a magical film.  It is a mixture of live action and animation and is a wonderful musical and is quite possibly the perfect family film.  Nominated for 13 Academy Awards and it was the winner of 5, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews in her feature film debut.  <p>"Mary Poppins" is the story of, well, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews).  Mary Poppins is the new nanny for Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Matthew (Michael Garber) Banks.  As a nanny, Mary Poppins is "practically perfect".  She floats down from the sky holding on to an umbrella and convinces George Banks (David Tomlinson) to give her the job as the nanny.  George is flustered by Mary and of course he gives her the job.  The lives and experiences of the children are about to change because there is something magical about Mary.  With a song and a dance amazing things happen around Mary.  She can clean up a room with nothing more than a snap of the fingers and can take a journey into a picture drawn with chalk on a sidewalk.  <p>"Mary Poppins" perfectly mixes animation (the penguin waiters!) and live action to create a magical world that is an incredible change from the London that Jane and Matthew think they know.  There are excellent acting performances and the over the top Dick Van Dyke is charming in how sweet he is.  The whole movie is sweet, charming, funny, and fantastic.  This is a highly recommended musical for the whole family</p></br><a href="../users/A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF.html">A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF</a><br/><p>This is a great film for any kid and a complete dream come true to have a baby sitter this fun Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke team up together and they seem to have a great time together entertaining the kids and I love to see Julie with her umberella a good friend have gave me a figurine of her holding her umbrella I really did like this movie it is witty, fun, enchanting, and entertaining!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time.  Mary Poppins is a wonderful story about two children who want a nanny who is cruel or cross.  Somehow they get Mary Poppins.  She instantly turns their lives around and brings the entire family closer together.  This movie is great for all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TD7B0CT1NHO4.html">A3TD7B0CT1NHO4</a><br/><p>How can one not give this film more than five stars?  How about 20 stars!! An incredible feat, this first film to incorporate animation with live action.  Dick Van Dyke and ensemble, not to mention Julie Andrews, who I believe is so credible as Mary Poppins, and she's so likeable, laughable that it's a shame that no other movies came along with her, but that was before sequels.  I'd say that this is at the top of the heap of all the best and the brightest of movies.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!  And after you've seen it, you'll all want to "...go fly a kite," as the song said.  Inspiring, romantic, and it makes you feel good, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>Probably one of the greatest works of the late Walt Disney himself. After this film the Disney studio completely lost their touch in creating a great film."Mary Poppins" is everything that is fun and is wonderfully acted by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. The colors, the music score, the story, costumes, set design is all a wonderful tribute to the greatest creative artist of all times, Walt Disney.  The likes of him will never be seen again. The DVD version is also wonderful, the quality is excellent and is still one of my favorite films of all times. This is truly a classic for both young and old.</p></br><a href="../users/A11C43I615R52G.html">A11C43I615R52G</a><br/><p>Mary Poppins is one of my all-time favorites. Is fantastic film that is perfect in every way. the actors are excellent, the animation superb and the songs are unique. five years ago, Disney released a 40th Anniversary Edition DVD with 2 discs. It was one of the best DVDs editions that Disney had released with everything that we need to know about the movie besides the fantastic restoration of the film.<br /><br />This January, Disney released a 45th Anniversary Edition. While some people like me will think that was too soon for another re-release, Disney as usual, wants to gain more profits. This new DVD has the same picture and sound than the original. Nothing is shinier, crispier or anything. Is exactly the same. Disc one holds the same bonus material as the 40th Ann. Ed. Disc Two presents us Disney on Broadway, a bunch of featurettes that shows us the new Mary Poppins musical. This is completely a waste. We are concern about the movie itself not the musical so this is unnecessary. The other bonus materials are the same that the ones in the 40 Ann Ed. But, in order to put this Broadway featurerette, Disney dropped some good material about the movie that are encountered on the previous DVD. This material is: a game (not such a loss), the deconstruction of a scene featurette that was fun but most important of all, the Party where it shows the party after the preimiere of the film in 1964. What a shame that they dropped this extras to put things that have nothing to do with the film. So this is a very unnecessary DVD so my suggestion is don't buy it, and if you haven't bought Mary Poppins on DVD yet, buy the 40th Anniversary Edition which is still available and is the same price of this new Edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>"Mary Poppins" is one of that select group of films that can truly be called 'Classic', a project conceived in love and filled with so much child-like wonder that it will never grow old or 'out-of-date'. Certainly the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's remarkable career, the "Mary Poppins" 40th Anniversary Special Edition is simply magnificent!<br /><br />Based on P.L. Travers' tales of a magical nanny who arrives to bring families closer, the rights to the stories had been pursued by Disney since 1938, but Travers had seen what studios had done to other authors' works, and withheld her approval unless she could maintain some creative control. Years of negotiations only whetted Disney's desire to make a definitive, truly 'special' film, and by 1960, despite the box office failure of another fantasy-themed 'pet' project, "Darby O'Gill and the Little People", he was more confident than ever in the story's potential, bringing together a remarkable array of talent, including songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman, production head Bill Walsh, and the brilliant artist Peter Ellenshaw to 'visualize' 1910 London through his matte paintings.<br /><br />With Travers' grudging approval, casting began. While American stage and TV star Dick Van Dyke was an odd choice to play a Cockney chimneysweep, he was a gifted mime and physical comedian, and had such a wholesome exuberance that Disney knew British audiences would forgive his shaky accent. Popular British actors Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson would play the preoccupied parents, with Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber (from "The Three Lives of Thomasina") as the neglected children. Veteran stars Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, Reginald Owen, Arthur Treacher, and Jane Darwell (as the Bird Woman, in her last screen appearance), headed the strong supporting cast.<br /><br />But it was the casting of Julie Andrews, in her first film, as Mary Poppins, that truly 'made' the film! Passed over by Jack Warner for the movie version of her stage hit, "My Fair Lady" (he opted for Audrey Hepburn), Disney caught her performance in "Camelot" on Broadway, knew, instantly, that she was the right 'Mary', and approached her for the role. "But I'm pregnant," she told him. "No problem," he replied. "I'll wait!"<br /><br />And thus a Classic was born!<br /><br />A multiple 1964 Oscar winner (including 'Best Actress' for Andrews, who got to share the stage with her "Lady" costar, Rex Harrison, who won 'Best Actor'), the film was a major hit, worldwide, and quickly achieved the legendary status it holds today.<br /><br />For it's 40th Anniversary, Disney's heirs have put together a spectacular package; along with the digitally-remastered film (it looks and sounds SUPERB!), a second disc of additional features includes a joyous reunion of stars Andrews and Van Dyke (who both seem ageless!); reminiscences of Robert Sherman, who sings a cute ditty cut from the final film; a fascinating 50-minute "behind-the-scenes" documentary about the production; featurettes on how the FX were achieved in several key scenes; and much, MUCH more! As the owner of several "Special Edition" Disney DVDs, I can honestly say, THIS is the BEST, yet!<br /><br />With the holidays fast approaching, I can't think of a finer gift to give, or to get!</p></br><a href="../users/A8S11VP9Z36D6.html">A8S11VP9Z36D6</a><br/><p>Is there really much new to say about this classic Disney film that helped launch the movie career of Julie Andrews? Probably not, but for the handful of people who haven't seen this film, this DVD is a must-buy. Strangely enough, Disney is not releasing a Blu-ray version just yet, so this edition will have to tide over video buffs until that occurs. The 1964 classic is based on the books of P. L. Travers, with a few Disney liberties thrown in. Travers' nanny, Mary Poppins, is somewhat more harsh and unpleasant in the books than in the film version. However, it is obvious that she is hiding a heart of gold inside and that she truly does love the children she takes care. Two of the children did not make the transition from the book, but they are definitely not missed. Julie Andrews is able to bring out the many facets of Mary Poppins without compromising the character, and of course her voice is legendary. The Sherman Brothers whipped up some of their most memorable tunes including  "Jolly Holiday," "Spoonful of Sugar," and "Let's Go Fly a Kite."<br /><br />In a nutshell, the story is about a magical nanny who swoops in to take care of the Banks children, Jane & Michael, and also help their father realize what he is missing by ignoring them the way that he does. Along the way she treats the children to adventures with a street performer/chimney sweep, Bert (Dick Van Dyke) as well as her Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) who loves to laugh. One of the most memorable and touching sequences is the "Feed the Birds" numbers, with veteran actress Jane Darwell making her final screen appearance. One of Walt Disney's favorite songs, it is sure to bring a tear to many eyes.<br /><br />For those that have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VEPRQ">Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition)</a>, here's what's missing on this edition:<br /><br />* Deconstruction of a Scene: Jolly Holiday & Step in Time sequences are examined thoroughly.<br /><br />* "I Love to Laugh" Game (not a big deal for me!)<br /><br />Here are the extras that ARE included:<br /><br />Backstage Disney<br /><br />* Disney on Broadway (All New to DVD)<br /><br />- "Mary Poppins from Page to Stage": The story of Mary Poppins from book to Broadway as the creative team and cast prepare to take the long running show on tour. A very well-done documentary on the stage production of "Mary Poppins," detailing almost every aspect of the production that began in London. Especially interesting is how P.L. Travers did not want any "Americans" involved in the stage production, as she was truly not happy with what Disney did with her books. This feature takes you all over the globe: interviews with the 2 leads are held in NYC at Sardi's restaurant; an interview with one of the Sherman Brothers is filmed in Beverly Hills; interviews with the stage productions composers George Stiles & Anthony Drewe are held in England (they did a fantastic job of blending their compositions seamlessly with the Sherman Brothers' songs from the film). You'll also hear from Bob Crowley, the scenic and costume designer, detailing how he came up with the sets (inspired by the book's illustrations) and changes he made for the touring production. All in all, a very fascinating extra!<br /><br />- "Step in Time": The Broadway cast of Mary Poppins performs the number "Step in Time" from the show. This is a nice glimpse into the stage production. Although it doesn't quite have the pizzazz of the filmed number (what a tough act to follow), the choreography, sets, and costumes work together to create a fantastic production. Especially effective is the use of costumes and make-up to create the illusion of the chimney sweeps are in black and white, making Mary Poppins in her red dress stand out even more.<br /><br />- Step in Time - Downloadable MP3 featuring the Broadway cast of Mary Poppins singing "Step in Time," featuring Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins and Gavin Lee as Bert.<br /><br />- Video Intro By Scenic & Costume Designer, Bob Crowley<br /><br />- Bob Crowley's Design Galleries: Concept art, costume designs, set designs and set models for the Broadway musical<br /><br />* Audio Commentary: with stars Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice and songwriter Richard Sherman. There are a few archival comments included from Walt Disney and others. Fantastic track that really adds to the enjoyment of the film. Especially interesting is the "Feed the Birds" number, where Sherman talks about Mary Poppins instilling social responsibility into the children by planting the idea of feeding the birds with tuppence, thus setting off the important string of events at the end of the film. It is refreshing to hear that so many years later, both Andrews & Van Dyke (as well as Dotrice) still have a fondness for this film and the experience of making it.<br /><br />* Poppins Pop-Up Fun Facts: View fun-filled facts about the creation of the movie during viewing. Mirrors some of the information from the commentary track, but still enjoyable to learn some of the behind-the-scenes info as you are watching the movie.<br /><br />* "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins": The definitive behind-the- scenes look at how this unique and beloved film came into being.<br /><br />* Movie Magic: A look at the special effect techniques used to bring the magical world of Mary Poppins to life. This one is interesting, but appears to be geared more towards the young ones and early teens. Doesn't really go very deep.<br /><br />* The Gala World Premiere: Footage from the Red Carpet. What a feast this is; a few different rolls of film (mixing bw and color) have been edited together to recreate as much as possible of this magical evening. See Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Wynn, Cesar Romero, and so many more classic stars. Even Walt & his wife are on hand (it even appears that Walt is gently chastising the costumed Mickey character at one point).<br /><br />* Dick Van Dyke Make-Up Test for his role of the elder Mr. Dawes. On the commentary track, Karen Dotrice (Jane Banks) admits that during filming, she was not told that Dick Van Dyke was playing the elder Mr. Dawes. She thought it was just some old smelly man who was close to death!<br /><br />* Trailers, Ads and More from the Original Release and Reissue of the Film<br /><br />* Mary Poppins Still Art Galleries<br /><br />Music & More<br /><br />* Disney's Song Selection: Sing along to "A Spoonful of Sugar," "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and any of the film's other memorable songs as the lyrics pop up on screen.

Travers' sequel "Mary Poppins Opens the Door." Julie Andrews hosts this short done in the style of the whimsical chalk drawings from the movie "Mary Poppins." Vocal talents of Sarah Ferguson, Tracey Ullman, and David Ogden Stiers.<br /><br />* Deleted Song: "Chimpanzoo": A reconstruction of a song that did not appear in the movie using original storyboard and concept art, accompanied by a new rendition of the song performed by co- composer Richard Sherman. Personally, I agree with the deletion of this number!<br /><br />Specs: Video is original aspect ration of 1:66:1, and audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound with French & Spanish language tracks & subtitles. The picture, as in the 40th release, is fantastic. Colors bright, image sharp. The 5.1 mix is fantastic, especially during the musical numbers--all of your speakers will get full use! I read another review on here that only seemed to get front-speaker action, but I clearly heard music and effects loud and clear from my rear speakers, giving a very nice surround effect.<br /><br />There are also sneak peaks into the next Tinker Bell installment as well as other upcoming DVD/Bluray releases (Monsters Inc and Pinocchio this Spring and Beverly Hills Chihuahua).</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>In 1964, Walt Disney Pictures, under the directorship of Robert Stevenson, released what became a timeless, musical, fantasy called "Mary Poppins".  Starring Julie Andrews as the mysterious & magical Mary Poppins, the film is a fictional account of a dysfunctional family living in London circa 1910.  The father, George W. Banks (David Tomlinson, who played Emelius Browne in "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" in 1971), is obsessed with his job at a prestigious Fidelity Fiduciary Bank and with maintaining a professional atmosphere at all times at home.  The mother, Winifred Banks (Glynis Johns, whose film career began in 1938), is preoccupied with demonstrating as a suffragette and maintaining a clean home.  Their young children, Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber, who died at the young age of 21 in 1977), are allowed minimal time with their parents, who prefer to have a nanny look after and raise their children for them.  Unfortunately, Jane and Michael rarely like any of their nannies, who regularly quit after the children do something mischievous to each of them.  Also working for Mr. & Mrs. Banks are the maid Ellen (Hermione Baddeley, who played Mrs. Cratchit in the 1951 classic "Scrooge") and the cook Mrs. Brill (Reta Shaw, who played in "Pollyanna" in 1960 and "The Ghost & Mr. Chicken" in 1966), neither of which have the time or the desire to look after Jane and Michael.<p>Following the departure of yet another nanny, George decides to hire an appropriate nanny himself.  Jane and Michael write their own advertisement for a nanny, but George regards their innocent description as rubbish as he intends to find a nanny that will uphold his every professional expectation.  Mysteriously, the children's advertisement, that George tossed out, comes to Mary Poppins.  When a very lengthy line of perspective nannies are seen at the Banks' front door early one morning, all of them are blown away by a strong wind.  Coming down from the sky via an umbrella is the magical Mary Poppins.  Expecting a rush of perspective nannies to race through the door, only Mary Poppins waits to enter the Banks' home.  George interviews Mary, but he is quickly confused by her wit and unexpectedly hires her.  From that point on, nothing is quite the same in the Banks home and the children get a nanny that not only fulfills their expectations, but becomes something much more to them.  Along the way, the children are also introduced to several interesting people, including the handyman Bert (Dick Van Dyke, who starred in his own 1961 TV show and starred in "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"), Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn, who also played the toy-maker in "Babes in Toyland" in 1961) and the bird woman (Jane Darwell).<p>Many of the songs in the film are well known by people who have never seen the film, including:<p>* "Sister Suffragette" (4.5/5, Glynis John).  Winifred calling for the rights of women to be able to vote.<br />* "The Life I Lead" (5/5, David Tomlinson).  George describing his life and what a British home should be.<br />* "The Perfect Nanny" (4.5/5, Karen Dotrice & Matthew Garber).  Jane & Michael telling what they want in a nanny to their parents.<br />* "A Spoonful of Sugar" (5/5, Julie Andrews).  Mary encouraging the children to clean their rooms upon her arrival.<br />* "Pavement Artist (Chim-Chim-Cheree)" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert's carefree life.<br />* "Jolly Holiday" (4.5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert describing how wonderful it is to be with Mary Poppins again within the sidewalk chalk painting.<br />* "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" (5+/5, Julie Andrews & Dick Van Dyke).  A word you use when you don't know what else to say.<br />* "Stay Awake" (5/5, Julie Andrews). A lullaby to Jane and Michael.<br />* "I Love To Laugh" (4.5/5, Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Ed Wynn). Uncle Albert is visited who is suffering from incurable laughter.<br />* "A British Bank (The Life I Lead") (5/5, David Tomlinson & Julie Andrews). Mary telling George that he'll be taking the children to the bank with him.<br />* "Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)" (5/5, Julie Andrews). Mary describing the life of a poor woman who enjoys feeding birds.<br />* "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke and David Tomlinson) Mr. Dawes Sr. (also played by Dick Van Dyke), the CEO of George's bank, sings praises to the British banking system with George to Jane and Michael.<br />* "Chim-Chim-Cheree" (5/5, Dick Van Dyke).  Bert describing the carefree life of chimney sweep.<br />* "Step in Time" (4/5, Dick Van Dyke). Song and dance upon the sooty rooftops of London.<br />* "A Man Has Dreams" (4.5/5 Dick Van Dyke and David Tomlinson) George singing his woes to Bert.<br />* "Let's Go Fly a Kite" (4.5/5, David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns). George & Winifred spending time with Jane and Michael.<p>It is not surprising that so many children and adults alike love "Mary Poppins".  It's catchy songs and fantastic situations propel the audience into a magical world of laughter and love that can be watched many times while never becoming tiresome.  It also made Julie Andrews a household name with her unforgettable performance as Mary Poppins.  Julie Andrews went on to play leading roles in "The Americanization of Emily" (1964), "The Sound of Music" (1965), "10" (1979) and "Victor/Victoria" (1982).<p>I highly recommend the purchase of "Mary Poppins" on DVD, where it can be fully appreciated in its widescreen format.  I rate this DVD with 5 out of 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>This is a 5-star movie crammed into a 1-star DVD. If you're renting a movie, you only plan on seeing it once... when you buy a movie, you have bought the right to see it whenever you please for as long as you want.  This DVD has FORCED COMMERCIALS! You can not skip them and you are forced to fast-forward through them.  Instead of endearing you to the movies featured in the trailers, you eventually get so mad that the thought of those films makes your blood boil... especially if you already have purchased those films on DVD and you don't need to be coerced into buying them in the first place.<p>There is no excuse for this. Disney should offer refunds and/or replacement discs to those who purchased them on good faith.<p>In addition to the forced commercials, the tech specs are misleading and plain wrong. While the film is widescreen, it is NOT anamorphic as is claimed... this means that while it is in letterbox format, it is not in proper proportion and the images are slightly distorted.<p>Just throwing a movie on a round disk does not a DVD make and this is proof. <p>The movie is fantastic despite these shortcomings... but as the title of this review states - this is a DVD review, not the film. I'd advise waiting until a collector's edition comes out. A collector's edition is likely to contain more features such as interviews with the cast, out-takes and scenes from the Oscars for that year... and (one can only pray) no forced commercials.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>A fantastic and magical family film, "Mary Poppins" continues to be a Disney classic that would win five Academy Awards and would be remembered for being a film that combined Disney's cartoon animation and real characters, the film debut of Julie Andrews but most of all, the spectacular chemistry and musical dance numbers featuring songs that continue to be classics.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />Mary Poppins was digitally restored and remastered in this 45th Anniversary Special Edition.  Although an older film, the remastering does look good for a film of its time.  Granted, I would love to see how this film would look on Blu-ray but  for DVD, the video looks very good.<br /><br />As for audio, the film's music and the dialogue comes out quite clear on my home theater.  Audio is presented in either Dolby Digital 5.1 or Original 2.0 Theatrical Mix.  The film sounds wonderful via Dolby Digital 5.1.  Music really comes alive but I didn't really notice all channels being utilized for those who were wondering but I did notice certain instruments being used in my front left and right channels of my stereo system which was nice.  But this is pretty much a dialogue and music-driven film and both come out quite clear.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This 45th Anniversary Edition of "Mary Poppins" is absolutely loaded with special features.  Included are:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary--Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice and Richard Sherman recall the making of Mary Poppins.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke did a commentary one one day, Karen Dotrice (plays the daughter in the film) and film and songwriter, Richard Sherman did a commentary on the following day.  Both commentaries are spliced together and done quite well.  What I found so fantastic is that Julie Andrews has not watched the complete film since the premiere back in 1964, so this was her first time watching it completely since then.  And to hear these talents just commenting on different parts of the film and what they remember of doing those scenes was just nostalgic and informative.  What a great commentary!<br />  * Poppins Pop-Up Fun Facts--Select this option and fun-filled facts about the creation of this classic film pop up during viewing.<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />  * Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins--The definitive behind-the-scenes.  This 50+ minute featurette takes a look at how this unique and beloved film came into being.  Featuring interviews with the cast and learning so much about the film.  A great featurette.<br />  * Movie Magic--A look at the special effect techniques used to bring the magical world of Mary Poppins to life.  For 1964, to combine both animation and live action film together and create this magical world was a technical marvel.  So, this featurette was also great to watch!<br />  * The Gala World Premiere--Footage from the Red Carpet.  This was aired on television as a one hour special but the footage had been lost.  Several minutes (not the complete version) of the archived film of this premiere was found in two countries, a black and white version and color and it was pieced together to create the 17+ minutes of footage from the red carpet premiere.<br />  * Dick Van Dyke Make-Up Test - How Dick Van Dyke was made to look like the very old bank owner with make up and all.<br />  * Trailers, Ads and More from the Original Release and Reissue of the Film - From the original 1964 trailers, TV spots, Julie Andrews theater greetings and the re-issue trailers from 1974 and much more.<br />  * Mary Poppins Still Art Galleries - A lot of art was created for this film.  So, these are the still art galleries.<br /><br />Music & More<br /><br />  * Disney's Song Selection--The whole family can sing along to "A Spoonful of Sugar," "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and any of the film's other memorable songs as the lyrics pop up on screen. Each song can be selected separately or while watching the film.<br />  * Magical Musical Reunion--Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and songwriter Richard Sherman reminisce about making Mary Poppins and the music that makes it so special.  A fantastic featurette especially to see them sing once more.  Fantastic!<br />  * A Musical Journey with Richard Sherman --A delightful magical journey through some of the film's locations with co-composer Richard Sherman, who reveals surprising secrets about the music of Mary Poppins along the way.  Another fantastic featurette with Richard Sherman revealing some tidbits about the songs used for the film and how Walt Disney reacted to some of the songs.<br /><br />Bonus Short<br /><br />  * The Cat That Looked at a King--Live action and animation bring a chapter of P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins Opens the Door to life! Julie Andrews takes viewers into a magical animated world created in the style of the whimsical chalk drawings in Mary Poppins.  This segment is about 10 minutes long.<br /><br />Deleted Song<br /><br />  * "Chimpanzoo"--A reconstruction of a song that did not appear in the movie using original storyboard and concept art, accompanied by a new rendition of the song performed by co-composer Richard Sherman.<br /><br />Backstage Disney:  Disney on Broadway<br /><br />  * Mary Poppins from Page to Stage --First a beloved children's book, then a classic movie and now a smash hit Broadway musical! Fans can follow the story of Mary Poppins from page to stage as the creative team and cast discuss the creation of the musical production and preparations for the upcoming North American tour*.<br />  * Step in Time--The Broadway cast of Mary Poppins performs the never-before-filmed number "Step in Time" from the show.<br />  * Step in Time - A downloadable MP3 featuring the Broadway cast of Mary Poppins singing "Step in Time," featuring Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins and Gavin Lee as Bert.<br />  * Video Intro By Scenic & Costume Designer, Bob Crowley<br />  * Bob Crowley's Design Galleries--Concept art, costume designs, set designs and set models for the Broadway musical<br /><br />"Mary Poppins" is definitely a true classic.  The film was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and eventually winning five academy awards for Best Actress, Film Editing, Music Score, Music Song for "Chim-Chim-Cheree" and Special Visual Effects".<br /><br />It's hard to believe that in 1964, there were two major musicals being created "Mary Poppins" and "My Fair Lady", "My Fair Lady" which eventually went to Audrey Hepburn and "Mary Poppins" going to the unknown actress Julie Andrews.  It was probably a blessing that Julie Andrews wasn't cast for "My Fair Lady" since "Mary Poppins" really jumpstarted Andrews career and eventually winning her the Academy Award for Best Actress.<br /><br />Of course, actor Dick van Dyke was popular with his television series "The Dick Van Dyke Show" but these two talents and their musical performance were well done.  I was quite impressed by how both would nail their dances and have them in sync and Julie Andrews would comment how the most difficult part of the film was syncing their mouths to the song and making sure their foot would match for that moment.<br /><br />This film back in 1964 introduced a family film with state of the art technology at that time. Real life actors working together with animated humans and animals, the actors flying around and most importantly, the music that came from this film.  Classics such as "A Spoonful of Sugar", the award winning song "Chim-Chim-Cheree", "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and "Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)", to name a few.  But what I discovered by watching the special feature was how important it was for Walt Disney.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins" by P.L. Travers was created back in 1934 and for 20 years, Walt Disney would try unsuccessfully to get the rights for the film.  But he eventually managed to and while on one hand, really making sure the cast and the staff were well taken care of, it was quite surprising to know how much P.L. Travers actually detested the film (she wanted the animation to be eliminated).  So, there are interesting tidbits including audio that appears on the special features of Travers showing her discontent as an adviser to the film.  So, you get to learn more about this through a featurette on the DVD.  But it shows you how much Walt Disney really wanted "Mary Poppins" and how he tried so hard to get the rights to it.  But you really learned how much love went into the creation of this film and how much Walt Disney wanted this film to be loved.<br /><br />Just interesting details of how special he wanted this film, from giving people a chance such as signing Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman (the Sherman Brothers) to a contract to write and compose music for "Mary Poppins" (and future Disney films), casting an unknown Julie Andrews which Walt Disney loved her performance in "Camelot".  Disney wanted her to be Mary Poppins and despite her being pregnant at the time, he waited for her until after she gave birth to become part of the film.  Another tidbit was while meeting with Julie,  Walt Disney met her husband at the time, Tony Walton (a costume and set designer) and eventually giving him a chance to work on "Mary Poppins" (who also eventually inspired the Sherman Brothers for the music of "Winnie the Pooh").  And my favorite tidbit, of Walt Disney casting well-known actress from the early 1900's Jane Darwell in the "Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)" in what would be her final role, which was his way of giving her a special thank you to her for her accomplishments in film.  These are just among the few interesting tidbits from behind-the-scenes that one will learn through the various featurettes included on the DVD.<br /><br />As for the DVD version, there has been four previously released versions of "Mary Poppins" on DVD.  When Disney released the 40th Anniversary "Mary Poppins" on DVD back in 2004, it was hard to imagine how Disney could top that with the 45th Anniversary edition.  Surprisingly, Disney managed to pull of another spectacular release with the 45th Anniversary edition with even more special features than the original.<br /><br />The new feature added to the 45th Anniversary edition of the DVD  features the all-new "Mary Poppins: From Page to stage" which includes a fantastic documentary on the making of the Tony Award winning musical produced with Cameron Mackintosh.  Despite P.L. Travers really disliking the Walt Disney film, "Mary Poppins" was eventually given a musical treatment after P.L. Travers gave Cameron Mackintosh the OK but of course with certain guidelines in her will and testament before her death.<br /><br />The primary guideline was that a musical could be created with the understanding that only English born writers and no one from the original film production could be involved with the creative process of the musical.  The musical was a great hit in the UK but when it came to doing the musical in the US, this is where things definitely gets interesting and Disney manages to create a lengthy featurette on the process of creating the musical in the US, also a featured performance of a "Step in Time", an opportunity for people to download the MP3 and also a chance for people to see Bob Crowley's designs for the musical.<br /><br />The original film will always be magical and in the hearts of those who truly were captivated by it but this musical was amazingly done.  The costumes, the stage setup, the designs, everything looked spectacular and sure enough, the musical received rave reviews in the US as well.<br /><br />So, you really get all the fantastic special features from the 40th Anniversary including the bonus short animation "The Cat That Looked at a King" which stars Julie Andrews (and can be considered a short sequel) plus the new bonus features from the musical on this 45th Anniversary Edition.<br /><br />Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment managed to successfully pull of another spectacular release for the 45th Anniversary Edition.  This is the definitive version to own!  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is probably one of Walt Disney's best films, if not the best. It is the most excellent realized combination of live action and animation. It  contains eternal charm, wit, and magic as it introduces us to the  &quot;practically perfect&quot; nanny who brings profound change to the  Banks family of London in the early twentieth century. Every song composed  by Richard and Robert Sherman is pure magic. The believable visual effects,  the heartfelt scripting, and the solid performances by Julie Andrews and  the heart rendering Dick Van Dyke are truly eternal. Every element of  production came together at their zenith to create a treasure of cinematic  endearment. The DVD is excellent. The supplemental material is very good  and nostalgic. One of the best films ever made. The superb cast also  includes: David Tomlinson, Glynis Johns, Elsa Lanchester, Arthur Treacher,  Ed Wynn, Hermione Baddeley, Reginald Owen and Jane Darwell as The Bird  Woman. Director, Robert Stevenson is at his best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"Mary Poppins" is back and I am glad that she is: all spiffed up, digitally remastered, looking young and fresh once again.<br /><br />It has been many years since I've seen Mary (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) and if anything the film is more fun, the songs more tuney and beautifully performed than ever.<br /><br />In many ways "Mary Poppins" is aimed at adults, rather than children: the Suffragette story line of Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) and the honor-your-children-as-human-beings story line of Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson).<br /><br />In other words, "MP" is more profound, deeper, thoughtful and sadder for adults than it would be for children. It works on at least two levels and that's more than you can say for some of the tripe being released recently.<br /><br />At the finale when Mary's duty is completed and it is time for her to move on to another family, I shed a tear for good old Mary and particularly for Julie Andrew's performance as Mary: you can have your current pop icons, I'll take Mary Poppins... no spoonful of sugar needed.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>That's how the incomparably magical nanny Mary Poppins describes herself with nary a boastful smirk on a revealing tape measure in this still charming 1964 Disney classic musical set in post-Victorian London circa 1910. I was five years old when it was originally released, and I managed to convince my mother to take me to see it six times. I just saw it last night for the first time in over four decades on the big screen in a sing-along version similar to what has been done with "The Sound of Music". I still feel a genuine warmth about this movie as an adult. Such was the impact of Julie Andrews in her big screen debut, as she epitomizes the title character with equal quantities of starch and sugar.<br /><br />With her unyielding posture, coltish stature and perfectly clipped diction, Andrews found her archetypal role before she even blossomed as an actress, an intractable goody-goody image she sends up mercilessly 17 years later in her husband's savage Hollywood satire, "S.O.B." There is no getting around the fact that she is ideal as the indefatigable Mary in charge of Jane and Michael, the two moppet children of neglectful banker George Banks and his flighty suffragette wife Winifred. With the help of devoted friend Bert, a Cockney jack-of-all-trades and one-man-band, Mary sets out to inspire the children's imaginations while keeping a firm though kind-hearted hand on their behavior. What I notice this time as an adult is how Mary wields a similarly positive influence on George albeit after much patriarchal consternation and sexist-driven protest.<br /><br />There are so many delightful scenes that it's hard to choose which to highlight, though one of the best ones has to be the fantasy animated sequence through Bert's sidewalk painting. This is where Bert dances with the penguins, Mary leads Bert and her charges on liberated carousel horses through a foxhunt and a horserace, and both sing two of the best songs, "Jolly Holiday" and "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious". Another wonderful scene is the "Spoonful of Sugar" room clean-up scene with obviously mechanized robins and a bevy of stop-action effects. Using an overemphatic Cockney accent as Bert, Dick Van Dyke - who was then starring in his classic sitcom - is an endearing presence and a dexterous comic dancer. He also clowns around in heavy make-up as the very aged president of the bank at which George works.<br /><br />David Tomlinson plays George with appropriate gruffness under his gentlemanly demeanor, while Glynis Johns lends her ingratiating quality to Winifred. The children are played without affectation by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber. Veteran character actors fill the rest of the roles expertly in what amounts to extended cameos - Ed Wynn as the eternally laughing and perpetually airborne Uncle Albert; Elsa Lanchester as Mary's frustrated predecessor, Katie Nanna; Arthur Treacher as the kindly Constable Jones; Reginald Owen as the delusional sea captain next door, Admiral Boom; Hermione Baddeley and Reta Shaw as the Banks's constantly flustered maids; and most touchingly, the 85-year old Jane Darwell (Ma Joad in "The Grapes of Wrath") as the bird woman on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral.<br /><br />The songs by the Sherman Brothers, Richard and Robert, are truly enchanting and memorable after all these years, especially the haunting "Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)", the wistful "Chim-Chim-Cheree", and the almost "My Fair Lady"-sounding "The Life I Lead". I still have a few quibbles, for example, the "Step in Time" dance sequence is exceptionally choreographed but too darkly lit and goes on a bit too long to enjoy fully. Moreover, at 140 minutes, the movie drags a bit toward the end especially as George meets with the board of his bank. Regardless, director Robert Stevenson, who made many of the live-action Disney films of the 1960's, along with screenwriters Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi, have concocted what has to be one of the best family-oriented confections to come out of the Hollywood studios.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>This reviewer recently watched "Mary Poppins" for the first time since its original theatrical release in 1964, and found the movie, now in its 45th Anniversary Edition, has lost none of its ability to charm and entertain.  A sweet-souled children's fairy tale disguised as a Walt Disney musical, "Mary Poppins" won five Academy Awards for its songs, its then-cutting edge mixture of animation and live action, and for the performance of a young Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins.<br /><br />In the movie, adapted from the stories by P.L. Travers, Mary Poppins magically arrives at the Banks home in 1910 London to serve as nanny to the two rather neglected Banks children, Jane and Michael.  Firm but fair, the "practically perfect" Mary Poppins restores order to the nursery through a combination of song and magic, and then begins to open the eyes of the children to the posssibilities of life and their own imaginations.  In company with the multi-talented chimney-sweep Bert (Dick Van Dyke), Mary and the children embark on a series of adventures that end up transforming the whole Banks household.<br /><br />Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were in their prime as singers and dancers, and their talent shows in a series of musical sequences, many with animated accompaniment.  The climactic dance sequence "Chim Chim Cher-ee" takes place on the rooftops of London, as Bert and his fellow chimney sweeps perform for Mary and the children.<br /><br />The movie is a marvel of subtlety, as Mary and Bert use song, humor, and compassion to persuade the harried banker Mr. Banks and his fervent suffregette wife that family should come first.  The sources of Mary's magical powers are left a pleasant mystery, as is the relationship between the prim and proper Mary and the clownishly charming but earthbound Bert.  This two disc edition includes some superb "making of" featurettes and interviews with the surviving cast members.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins: 45th Anniversary Edition" is very highly recommended as outstanding entertainment to Disney fans of all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>This film is never disappointing. It allows you to immerse yourself in a simpler time when magic still seems like a possibility.<br /><br />And clearly I was not the only one impressed by this movie. It was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards in 1965 and proceeded to win 5 including: Julie Andrews for Best Actress in a Leading Role; Peter Ellenshaw, Hamilton Luske and Eustace Lucett for Best Effects, Special Visual Effects, Cotton Warburton for Best Film Editing, and Richard B. Sherman and  Robert B. Sherman for Best Music, Score - Substantially Original, as well as Best Music, Song. It also won a number of other awards including Golden Globes, Grammys and BAFTAs. Dick Van Dyke, who unfortunately didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, was nominated for the Best Actor award in the Golden Globes, but was unsuccessful.<br /><br />Julie Andrews is Mary Poppins who, by unusual circumstances and highly original transportation, arrives at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to take up the role as nanny to Jane (Karin Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber) who are the children of banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns). Mary Poppins, together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a local street musician and chimney sweep, proceeds to take the children through a magical journey. Along the way she teaches George something about his values, and what the truly important things in his life are.<br /><br />Mary Poppins showcases excellent performance by all the leading players, and is a classic movie by any standard.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>For its time, this was a creative movie, and they managed to merge the animation in with the live-action scenes pretty well. Keep in mind that this is quite different from the book in some ways, but to be honest, the book is a bit bland compared to the movie. The film has more color, more fantasy, it's pretty awesome, and Julie Andrews does a simply wonderful job as Mary Poppins.</p></br><a href="../users/A41I67QYRAOSQ.html">A41I67QYRAOSQ</a><br/><p>I saw this movie many moons ago when I was in grade school.  I thought it was a magical, entertaining story.  I bought it for my 2 and 3 year old as something I thought they'd enjoy when they got to grade school.  I was surprised to see them riveted to it for most of the program.  I was doubly surprised they wanted to watch it over and over again!  I'm pretty sure it was the singing and dancing that held their attention.  This is definitely a classic that even little ones will enjoy now!</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>This is Disney's best live-action/animation movie! Better than all of the studio's more recent live-action films (films based on rides are boring and shows a sign of running out of ideas. Teen musicals are a passing fad). Julie Andrews is, of course, "practically perfect" as Mary Poppins. Her voice is excellent on every song she's in. Dick Van Dyke is also brilliant and I applaud him on his Cockney accent. At least he tried compared to other movies that take place in another country and they cast an American (here's looking at you, the most convincing German ever, Tom Cruise). The songs are as memorable as ever. When you're older, you realize how well the songs fit and are relevant to the plot.<br /><br />The features were wonderful to watch (I didn't buy the previous release). And now I'm gonna sidetrack but I'll make it relevant. I'm going to New York and I was planning on what shows to see like Chicago and Mamma Mia! I was planning on doing a Disney one but Little Mermaid seems too implausible to be realized on stage (I also saw a clip of the ending somewhere and it's really lackluster compared to the film. I know it would've been a big budget thing, but still) and for The Lion King, I wouldn't be sucked into the story because I'd be totally aware I'm watching people, not animals, on stage. So that leaves the Mary Poppins adaptation. Judging from the clips on this DVD, THEY TOTALLY SCREWED IT UP! I know you need to adjust it for the stage but they changed to much and added too many new songs. "Practically Perfect" seems to be the only new one to fit. They put the end song of the film at the beginning of the second act and they totally eliminate Uncle Albert. They change Mrs. Banks from a woman's suffrage leader to an actress trying to please her husband! This is one thing Disney should've left as a movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>A different sort of review this, for it invites YOUR participation!<br /><br />Haven't seen MARY POPPINS since 1964, and finally watched it again yesterday. The colors on my VHS copy are vivid and the film's condition quite excellent throughout.<br /><br />Random impressions:<br />Seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful, and Dick Van Dyke without all the shaggy white hair, and Ed Wynn alive and giddy, was an absolute delight!<br /><br />There are SO many songs in this picture! It's practically an operetta.<br />The live action/animation sequences are quite clever.<br />That choreographed chimney sweep number is magnificent!<br />Dick Van Dyke is a helluva dancer, and Julie Andrews keeps right up with him.<br /><br />It's not mentioned in the closing credits that Van Dyke has a dual role: as Mary's friend Bert and Mr. Dawes, the elderly chairman of the bank board.<br /><br />Finally, an invitation to some shared speculation---<br /><br />What exactly IS Mary Poppins? Is she a witch or a spirit made carnate?<br />We initially meet her as she sits on a cloud, powdering her nose. Later, to better see her face she wants a larger wall mirror, then appears within it to sing a duet with and even outdo herself. A third looking glass moment occurs in the chimney sweep sequence-- Mary uses a compact to touch up her dirty face with more soot!<br /><br />Clearly, the young lady is vain. She "hmmph"s when her mirror image outsings her, so she's also jealous, and when she refuses to answer her employer's questions, it shows Mary to be headstrong.<br /><br />So, IS Miss Poppins "practically perfect"?

Pat O'Malley)</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Just recently, I watched this film with my younger sister, who is pretty much obsessed with the whole "High School Musical" phenomenon.  I wanted to show her the musical that defined MY childhood, but wasn't sure how she would react to the dated graphics and themes.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that she found the film to be very entertaining, from the goofy songs to the crazy characters to the wacky animation.<br /><br />In all honesty, though, what is not to like about this charming film?!  The areas in which the movie excels include:<br /><br />Plot: Simple enough (Nanny swoops down from above to take care of somewhat-neglected children) for children to understand, but with just enough political undertones to keep adults' attention, something that does not occur in HSM (in that series, either you buy into the catchy tunes or you don't...there's no middle ground).<br /><br />Acting: Julie Andrews (as Mary Poppins) and Dick Van Dyke (as chimney-sweep Bert) turn in incredible performances that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and there isn't a member of the supporting cast that doesn't bring something interesting to the table.<br /><br />Music: Of course, a musical film is ultimately judged by the success of its musical numbers, and in that case "Mary Poppins" is a rousing success!  It would take too long to rate all the musical numbers in this movie, but suffice it to say that they offer something for everyone.  I personally love the chimney-sweep's "Step In Time" upbeat dance, while my younger sister's favorite was, as she would said, "the one with the dancing penguins!".<br /><br />Overall, "Mary Poppins" is a movie that can be enjoyed by any and all ages from now until the end of time.  Please watch the film to sustain your own craving for nostalgia, then introduce it to your children/relatives to show them that musicals need not be set in high school.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>I received a special preview copy of the 40th anniversary of Marry Poppins DVD edition.

Reminiscing about the music, production and even Mr. Walt Disney himself. Also on the track is Karen Dotrice (Many Lives of Thomasina) who plays young Jane Banks and composer Robert Sherman (All the Disney Classics). They all seem to speak fondly of the shoot, the cast and crew and especially have some funny memories of the production itself.<br /><br />A MAGICAL REUNINION: There is a great walk down "memory lane" with Robert Sherman, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews. They musically review through stories and example of the songs and how the evolution occurred. Dick van Dyke is amazing enthusiastically about his part as Bert. Julie discusses everything from the children to learning about making her very first film ever.<br /><br />THE MAKING OF MARRY POPPINS: Is an amazing visual and educational look at the making of the film. This is the longest of the extra features and goes in depth of the time, energies and efforts into making this Walt Disney classic. Filled with outtakes, behind the scenes footage and commentary from Julie and most of the cast, crew and musical influences of the film. It is hosted by - Dick Van Dyke (Bert) himself!<br /><br />Other features include Dick Van Dyke's original MAKE-UP test, THE GALA WORLD Premiere at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and one of my favorites the DECONSTRUCTION of two scene that include the break down of special effects and animation and their elements being combined.<br /><br />I LOVE TO LAUGH - A game for the kids who have watched the movie and handle some visual trivia from the film.<br /><br />THE CAT THAT LOOKED AT THE KING: Finally there is an extra bonus of a great little new animated short that is from one of the original P.L. Travers books. Julie Andrews herself takes you through the adventure in a very "Marry Poppins" sort of way. Guest voices include David Ogden Stiers (Beauty and the Beast, M.A.S.H., Pocahontas), Tracey Ullman (The Tracy Ullman Show, I Love You To Death, Once Upon A Mattress) and England's own Sarah Ferguson.<br /><br />The film directed by Robert Stevenson  (Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Love Bug, The Absent Minded Professor)  is an amazing piece of fun, entertainment and a true lesson in life and the love of family. Richard and Robert Sherman's score, music and songs will leave you singing long after the movie is over! This is an Amazing DVD with tons of extras for the family to enjoy. Sentimental moments, very funny moments and some very heartwarming emotions get this one before it disappears like Marry Poppins herself does! I loved it!

For children, no other movie provides the sheer exuberance or delightfully  conveyed good messages.  For adults, there is a Puff The Magic Dragon theme  throughout that comes over you when you watch it as a grown-up; I think it  is that twist of sadness and of time passing by that keeps Mary Poppins on  the top of the list.  Julie Andrews is arch perfection in a role she plays  with no sentiment at all; her Mary is as spit-spot and no-nonsense as in  the books; and again, it is that air of authenticity that wins you over --  completely.  Dick Van Dyke displays his many affable talents here in  spades, and the children are absolutely adorable.  The London locations are  a dream come true, and provide a visual backdrop for the adventures at hand  that keeps unfolding with wit and creativity. Though the final scenes in  the bank do drag on a bit, this movie is whisked along by some of the  Sherman Brothers' best music, which conveys not only spirited fun and  frivolity, but also sweet melancholy -- Chim Chim Cheree creeps up on you  by surprise, and at its conclusion you are moved to a place of wistfulness.  Joyful and enduring.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>Disney or not, this is simply Julie Andrews at her very best. Everytime I watch it, I keep thinking how much trouble Mr. Disney had to get the rights to film the project, plus his discovery of Julie in Broadway production of Camelot. They were ready to cast her, but were crossing their fingers for the outcome of the "screentest". Low and behold she took over the cinema screen with a "snap" of a finger.<br />Another comment I might add, is that some might look at the animation sequence as outdated by today's standards, but to follow the story at a closer level, the animation in this movie is about entering a drawn fantasy world via Mary Poppins. The drawing in the story is a pavement picture among many accomplished by an jack of all trades. He even apologizes for any shortcomings his drawings may have to the home audience in mild references. So, with that in mind, it would be out of character (if you will) to have the animation suddenly appear a phenomenal rendering by today's animation standards because in the story it has been drawn by an apologetic part-time artist. And with that, take a better look at that background forest and the architecture of the colorful bridges, they still leave many animators in the country dust!<br />Mary Poppins is, and always will be, Mr. Walt Disney's "crowning achievement". . . make no mistakes.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>This is the first Disney film released after I was born.

Fortunately, one arrives on the wind in the form of Mary Poppins.  She's everything the kids want, fun and magical.  But while she's taking them to chalk painting countrysides and tea parties on the ceiling, their father is less then happy.  Can he be made to see beyond the end of his nose?<br /><br />Ok, so this movie is really little more then an excuse for song and dance numbers.  It's still great!  The plot is paper thin, and you loose site of it in the middle of some of their fantastic scenes.  Of course, part of that is because the movie is based on a book that is really nothing but short stories.  Still this movie is more about fun then anything else.  And it has that in spades.  What kid wouldn't have fun imaging that they get to do all the things that Jane and Michael do in this movie?<br /><br />It's said that Walt Disney poured everything he had learned into making this film, and it shows.  Many of the special effects hold up remarkably well today.  There were some I still hadn't figured out until watching this special edition.  And the music!  Any fan of Disney knows these songs by heart.  And you can't help but find yourself humming "A Spoonful of Sugar," "Jolly Holiday," "Let's Go Fly a Kite," or "Chim Chim Cher-ee" for days after seeing it.<br /><br />Those wanting to own a great DVD of this film won't be disappointed in this two-disc set.  Disc one features the movie in all its wide screen glory.  I can't see how it's ever looked better.  The soundtrack has many different options, but the Home Theater mix will blow you away.  It's fantastic.  There is also a commentary track featuring Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane), and Richard Sherman.  Sprinkled in are archive comments from others, including Disney himself.  Also included are some pop up facts to read along with while watching the movie.  Disc two features a new documentary on the film, a deleted song, and more on the music with Julie, Dick, and the composers.  And be sure to check out the animated "The Cat That Looked at a King," a tale adapted from one of the later books in the series.<br /><br />One thing that comes through loud and clear in this set is how much fun everyone had making it and how much they respect Walt Disney.  The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testament to his genius.

GRIN Finally, a QUALITY two DVD set of this awesome classic Disney picture! I remember seeing Mary Poppins when I was much younger and this release does not disappoint! It is loaded with extras and the quality of the picture and sound is excellent!<br /><br />The plot of the movie involves Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, a magical nanny who becomes the governess of the Banks children who have a stuffed shirt father. (By the way, this part is similar to the role Julie would play the following year as Maria in The Sound of Music.) How Mary finds out about the job is in itself magical since the father of the Banks children had thrown away the letter they wrote asking for a nanny! We never get to know where she came from, either! Mary uses her love and natural powers to bring joy to the Banks children without ever being too overbearingly "preachy." Later on in the movie the father is faced with the possible loss of his job and the moral of the story is delivered to the audience in a very well done fashion.<br /><br />The acting is superlative and the musical numbers are unforgettable. To this day "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" remains an extremely catchy song and the other songs like "Chim Chim Cher-ee" and "A Spoonful of Sugar" are completely enchanting!<br /><br />But there's more! This DVD set is loaded--and I mean loaded--with valuable extras that will entertain you and raise your understanding of how the film was made as well as its history. For example, there's "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins" - a new 50-minute documentary, footage of the "Gala Movie Premiere," and a make up test for Dyke Van Dyke. There are songs and games for children (and the children in us), too!<br /><br />After you see this you will understand why the movie got Julie Andrews a Best Actress Oscar (in her film debut, no less) and why Dick Van Dyke is so talented and perfect for his role as Mary's boyfriend. (Look for Van Dyke also in the role of the senior officer of the bank!) All together the film received 13 Oscar nominations including Best Song for "Chim Chim Cher-ee!" Although some of the technical effects are not the state of today's art, the film did receive Oscar awards for technical effects and music. Simply put, I highly recommend this two DVD set for Disney fans, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke fans, and fans of musicals. This edition of Mary Poppins will not disappoint!</p></br><a href="../users/ABH4G7TVI6G2T.html">ABH4G7TVI6G2T</a><br/><p>The all-new 40th Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is definitely a must-own for all fans of the movie, and has been well worth the wait.  As the editorial review states, this is the third DVD of MARY POPPINS to be released.  The last edition (on the Gold Classics label) featured a great print but scant extras and fans simply knew that the Disney company should have done a better job remastering and releasing one of their most beloved films.  Our prayers have been answered!<br /><br />This brand-new MARY POPPINS features a state-of-the-art new digital restored print (similar to that done on the SNOW WHITE Platinum Edition), and a veritable carpetbag-full of extra features, the big highlight being an audio commentary by Dame Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Karen Dotrice among others.<br /><br />It is indeed a thrilling movie experience.  Out of the dreary London skies soars Mary Poppins, who sets about restoring the love and friendships in the fractured Banks family.  Along the way Mary leads us through many magical adventures including a 'Jolly Holiday' inside a pavement chalk picture, a tea party on the ceiling with Uncle Albert and a dance on the rooftops with Bert and his chimney-sweep pals.<br /><br />Other 'Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious' extras include a sequence deleted from the picture ("Chimpanzoo"), to an all-new retrospective documemtary with interviews with all the surviving lead cast-members.  Julie Andrews (who has renewed her ties to the Disney family with her role as Queen Clarisse in the PRINCESS DIARIES films) also has a lovely chat with Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman as they reminisce about making the movie.<br /><br />If you own the earlier DVD edition and think you've seen MARY POPPINS think again!  This all-new 40th Anniversary tribute is the ultimate testament to this magical Disney masterpiece!  Buy it today!</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>This 40th anniversary edition of "Mary Poppins" is absolutely fabulous.  The picture quality and new soundtrack in 5.1 is stunning.  A far better picture/sound than in the previous two issues.  I even watched disc 2, and I never watch the second disc.  It features one deleted song, and it was rather charming.  Other features include jumping to a song, or just watching all the songs with optional subtitles.  This is a great feature if you are trying to teach your kids those wonderful, loving songs.  This is one of the best discs Disney has ever put out, and its about time that "Mary Poppins" gets the same treatment as any other "Vault Classic."</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>First let me say that I like this movie. I'm British by birth so I am duty bound to deduct one star for the most unsuccessful attempt at a British accent ever to be immortalized on film. It shows how much the standard of acting has improved when you hear the flawless British accents of actors like Rene Zellweger or Johnny Depp. Dick Van Dyke simply can't do a British accent and should never have been cast in the part. There was a British actor/singer at the time called Tommy Steele, who already had an impressive stage and screen resume and who would have been perfect in the role. However, he was overlooked for the bigger name (in the US) of Van Dyke. Ironically, Julie Andrews was passed over a year earlier for the movie of 'My Fair Lady' for the non-singing, but better-known, Audrey Hepburn (whose cockney accent was almost as bad as Van Dyke's). Andrews showed what a mistake that was by winning an Oscar for this film. However, that quibble aside, this is a joyous, entrancing movie.<br /><br />The funny thing I referred to in the title of this review is that in most movie adaptations of books, like say the Harry Potter series, angry reviewers spend much time and energy complaining that the movies don't follow the books. Hardly anyone (I did find one such review) says that about 'Mary Poppins', even though the movie bears little resemblance to the book and, in particular, the character of Mary Poppins is completely changed.<br /><br />Personally, I've never felt that movie adaptations need to follow the books on which they were based. Movies are a totally different medium and the only criterion should be whether the movie works as a movie. In that respect, 'Mary Poppins' works admirably.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I wasn't raised as a Disney kid, so I was only peripherally aware of this film growing up, maybe saw some of it on TV a time or two, but never in the movie theatres or from start to finish.<br /><br />Recently, however, my kid and I read the first four "Mary Poppins" books and were thoroughly charmed by their odd, acerbic humor. So I thought, hmmmm, maybe we should try the movie as well, even though I knew, vaguely, that the Julie Andrews MP was much different than the mysterious faerie-nanny we had come to know from the books. Although the Disney Poppins isn't entirely sugary-sweet, she is much more benevolent and feel-good than the grouchy, cross nanny in the books. Also, though I love Dick Van Dyke dearly, having his character Bert in the film from start to finish is a big change (Bert only appears in two or three stories in the books) and he often overwhelms the rest of the film.  The Banks family is also greatly altered - instead of a spaced-out humbug, the father becomes a foreboding, socially retrograde prig, while the mother (also a space cadet in the books) is made more sympathetic, a foil for the crabby dad. (And the interjection of her being politically active, as a  voting rights suffragette, seems oddly out of place: the books were never about the parents, and they are made much more central here...)<br /><br />There is some innovative animation and creative, imaginative visualizing of the story, but far too many alterations and new material created out of whole cloth to suit a "Mary Poppins" purist, which I guess I am.  Since we love the books so much, I previewed this film alone, and I think I'll hold off for a few years before we give it a whirl as a family: I really think it would ruin the magic of the Travers text, and replace it with something much simpler, much cheaper, and far less wondrous.

After the first half hour I thought, "Wow, I can see why this is such a beloved movie" but after that it started to lag in a number of areas and the songs were just too numerous. It seemed to go on way too long.<br /><br /> Yet, it's a good film worthy of anyone's collection and the DVD transfer is very good: nice rich colors and reasonably sharp for a now 45- year-old film. There are some nice extras in here, too.  Andrews is wholesomely pretty and Glynis Johns, even with her strange voice, also is appealing. The kids are kind of stupid-looking, as are their parents.<br /><br />The other major character, the chimney sweep played by Dick Van Dyke, is a likable chap, but hard to understand with this cockney impression. However, on the DVD, one can use the English subtitles when he speaks. Van Dyke surprised me with his singing and dancing talent. I didn't know he was that proficient.<br /><br />The movie was one of the first efforts at mixing real life with animation and they did it well. It still holds up today.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>This was the first Disney movie released after I was born.

Now for the fortieth anniversary of this enchanting movie, it's been rereleased with a slew of bonus features -- and for lovers of this movie, it's worth every second.<br /><br />Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) have a tendency to drive their nannies crazy. So when their strict father (David Tomlinson) puts out a call for a new nanny, he's startled when only one woman comes -- and Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) answered the request letter his children gave him, which he threw away. Mary Poppins's magical talents and offbeat pals soon endear her to the kids, especially when they romp through a chalk painting and have tea parties on the ceiling.<br /><br />But things take a darker turn when Mr. Banks takes the children to the bank where he works (get it? Banks? Bank? Yeah, whatever). After the kids inadvertantly cause a riot, they are taken along by Mary Poppins' friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a goodhearted Cockney. And then things take an unexpected turn when Mr. Banks is in danger of losing his job, forcing him to realize what is really important in his life.<br /><br />Walt Disney (the man as well as the corporation) was at his peak when "Mary Poppins" debuted, starring rubbery comic Dick Van Dyke and Broadway star Julie Andrews. Even though the film was made forty years ago, the special effects and blend of animation and reality are remarkably fresh and undated -- from the cartoon foxhunt to the rival nannies being blown down the street by a strong wind. And the story is a timeless one -- family should come first.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the movie's more sober, melancholy second half makes it more palatable to adults. A spoonful of sugar may make the medicine go down, but you don't want too much sugar (ex. the cartoon chalk drawing, the goofy Uncle Albert who acts like he's on ecstacy) The fluff is toned down with the threat of unemployment and parental estrangement.<br /><br />What makes the bonus DVD worth getting? It seems to be mostly aimed at the target group (kids) rather than nostalgic adults -- there is a rather peculiar animated short, based on one of the Mary Poppins novels by the original author. There's also the "I Love to Laugh" game, which is basically answering questions to get Uncle Albert off the ceiling, a singalong, and a reconstructed concept-art song that was deleted from the final product, "Chimpanzoo."<br /><br />Fun for kids, but adults will skip right over to the audio commentary (Andrews and van Dyke) and historical reminiscing, which include a making-of featurette and a look at the musical creations in this film. A particular bonus is a reunion with Andrews, van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman around a piano -- it's just very relaxed, laid-back and well-made.<br /><br />One of the best things is that the entire film has been remastered. Half of "Mary Poppins'" charm is in the visuals and songs. So it's great to see the color and sound cleaned up and sharpened -- it has the slight fuzz of a film that needed a bit more work (or maybe that's my old TV), but overall the work is good.<br /><br />Forty years have passed, and "Mary Poppins'" charm is undiminished. So in celebration of that, the anniversary edition with all the bonus material is definitely worth getting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M3FG82ZE1J8I.html">A3M3FG82ZE1J8I</a><br/><p>Everyone knows this film, right?  It's essential watching for children of all ages.  Mary Poppins is the quinessential magical nanny, and Julie Andrews has become so identified with her performance in this film that  most people will always see her as Mary Poppins.<p>Anyways, I recently  purchased the Gold Collection DVD of this classic movie.  It is essentially  the same as the previous Disney release except for a few points.  First,  this one actually *has* a few extras, which most of the early Disney DVDs  lacked (shame on Disney!).  The transfer is the same, but in addition, we  now have a documentary on the film, a trailer, a short premiere featurette,  and a trivia game. It's still pretty sparse as far as extras go and nothing  spectacular, but it's an improvement for Disney.  Oh yes, and there are  those annoying trailers at the beginning of the DVD that Disney likes to  put on all its DVDs.  Oh well.<p>If you have the DVD already, don't bother  buying this one.  If you don't have the DVD, by all means purchase the Gold  collection Mary Poppins.  It's a classic film that can be enjoyed by the  family over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>Is there anyone left on the planet who does not know MARY POPPINS?  Made in 1963-1964, after a thirty year battle to convince a very stubborn and possessive P. L.  Travers  to give Walt Disney the rights to her book(s), it may be the Disney Studios' crowning film achievement.  It is a wonderful movie, a flawless blend of live action and animation, with some of the most beautiful and detailed matte paintings in movie history.  Julie Andrews, who won a Best Actress Oscar in her film debut, is the perfect nanny in 1910 Edwardian England to Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber).  And the movie won four other technical and music Oscars, with a still untopped thirteen total nominations.<br /><br />With chimney sweep/street artist/best buddy Bert (Dick Van Dyke in peak form), Mary Poppins leads Jane and Michael on many magical adventures.  These include a live-action/animation day in the park ("Supercalifragilisticexpealidocis"), a tea party on a ceiling with Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, the hauntingly beautiful "Feed the Birds" with bird woman Jane Darwell, and the Oscar-winning "Chim-Chim-Curree" on the rooftops of London.  (Peter Ellenshaw allegedly did 100 breathtakingly beautiful and detailed matte paintings for this movie, winning a well-deserved visual effects Oscar.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Banks family is controlled like clockwork by Mr. Banks (a perfectly cold and stuffy David Tomlinson, who turns 180 degrees over the movie's fast-paced 140 minutes.  (Cotton Warburton won an Editing Oscar.)  Glynis Johns is an ideal and likeable suffragette and feminist Mrs. Banks.  Mr. Banks works in the bank and constantly wants his kids to open a bank account, but they are always off playing with Mary Poppins or  Bert.<br /><br />MARY POPPINS is a fabulous feast of a movie, with some of the greatest visual effects and most beautiful matte paintings I have ever seen.  The cast is perfection, the writing something that even grouchy Pamela Travers should be pleased with.  And the 40th anniversary restoration on DVD has shimmeringly rich color, crystal-clear image clarity, and awesome 5.1 Home Theatre Mix THX sound to top any theater sound system.<br /><br />Disk 2 runs over three hours and includes composer Richard Sherman giving us deleted songs that ended up in other Disney animated movies, were cut for sheer length on a movie that runs almost two-and-a-half hours without them, and chats with Julie Andrews and Dick Andrews.  A full hour behind-the-scenes documentary shows how most of the magnificent visual effects were achieved, should you want the illusion spoiled.  We see the battle to get P.L. Travers to let Walt Disney film her precious baby of a novel over three full decades and working over the screenplay to make it all seamless plot-wise.  Finally, we have long lost footage of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre Los Angeles world premiere in August 1964 and various movie trailers for those who want to know how this very magical masterpiece was marketed.<br /><br />The two-disk 40th anniversary DVD of MARY POPPINS belongs in every house with kids--and kids at  heart.  With it, a hundred filmmaking aspects come together perfectly to create a masterpiece that gets my vote as Walt Disney's crowning film achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>The Banks family is in need of a new nanny for Jane and Michael.

David Tomlinson is both stuffy and loveable as Mr Banks, and Glynis Johns is wonderfully scatty as his wife. The two children are probably the least irritating in cinema history and were something of a casting coup for Disney, when compared with the horrid child actors in most of their output. But it is Dick Van Dyke who makes the film the fun it is. You can imagine, say a Petula Clark or a Diana Rigg as Mary Poppins, but only Van Dyke could play Bert the way he does. Leave aside the dodgy accent, and you're left with a great song and dance man who could carry the film even without the co-stars.

She introduces the children to Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a street performer who seems to have some history with Mary and they are off on a magical journey.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins", released in 1964, represented a magical blend of live action and animation that, at the time, was technologically very advanced. Disney just released a 40th Anniversary DVD, complete with a second disc of interesting extras.<br /><br />Watching the film again, I was struck by how rudimentary the special effects seemed. Then, remembering that this film was made in 1964, these same special effects became charming and wholly fitting for the story. The story is told through the eyes of the Banks children, and the use of these special effects helps to put us in their shoes. The story is set in Victorian England and it seems completely realistic that children in this era would see toy soldier marching into a toy box (stop motion), jump into a chalk drawing (2D animation) and watch their nanny sing to a bird (animatronics). The outdated look of these effects serves the point of view of the story beautifully and adds to the charm of it. We actually get a feeling that we are looking at a picture book as we watch the film. I can't even imagine how slick and uninviting the same film would be if it were made today, with CGI special effects coming out of the woodwork.<br /><br />Yes, the film is very saccharin at times, but this helps to define the viewpoint of the children as well. The story is told through their eyes. The struggles of their mother to win `the vote', their father's troubles at the bank, life in England at the turn of the 20th Century, are not going to be delved into too deeply. The children don't know about these problems. If the film started dealing with the mother's attempts to lead the suffragette movement, for instance, the viewpoint and the story would become off-balance.<br /><br />One of the most delightful things about "Mary Poppins" is the musical score containing many classic songs.  I've seen this film, or parts of it, dozens of times over the years. I think that even if you have seen it only once or twice, you probably remember many of the songs. "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", "Step In Time", "Spoonful of Sugar", "Jolly Holiday" and "Perfect Nanny" are all songs that I remember, and I can even sing a couple of lines for most. The true mark of a good Broadway musical is that you leave the theater humming the tunes. The same holds true for a musical film. All of the best musicals remain classics because we remember the songs. The Sherman Brothers created a great score of music and songs all of which served to enhance and supplement the story.<br /><br />Watching the DVD, the second disc contains a making of documentary, a musical reminiscence with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and the surviving Sherman brother, a new animated short with Julie Andrews taking her grandchildren into a new chalk painting where they meet "The Cat That Looked Like A King" and more. There is also a brief featurette showing how the live action photography of Van Dyke and Andrews walking along the path for the "Jolly Holiday" number and the live action photography of "Step in Time" was superimposed with animation. While watching the making of documentary, I learned an interesting fact. Disney wanted the film to look like a Broadway play. All of the sets were fabricated on sound stages, adding to the idealized look of the entire film. "Chimpanzoo", a deleted song is also included. Sung by Richard Sherman and illustrated by story boards for the deleted sequence, presumably, it would have been part of the "Jolly Holiday" number. It is probably better that it was left out of the film.<br /><br />There are a lot more features on the second disc, too many to list. As is the case with the best Disney DVDs, it appears that they have included everything they could get their hands on. This makes the DVD a must-have for film scholars and collectors. Essentially, the best Disney DVDs are encyclopedias on the making of the films. Filmmakers, enthusiasts and scholars have the opportunity to learn so much from these DVDs, even if a lot of the material is sugar-coated.<br /><br />This is Julie Andrews's first film. Before this, she appeared on Broadway and in a television version of "Cinderella". It is a truly remarkable, accomplished performance, amazing for someone acting in their first film. Andrews brings just the right blend of friendship, guidance and stern leadership to the role. Hand in hand as she enchants the children, she appears slightly annoyed at various points. And what is the relationship between her and Bert? These are questions left unanswered by the film, thankfully. If they were to remake this film, the filmmakers would probably feel it necessary to make her a former barmaid or tarted up boozer, make her back-story more explicit.<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke was a more established star at the time. His television show was in full swing and he had previously appeared in the Broadway and film versions of "Bye Bye Birdie". It might seem strange that a rising star would take what is essentially a supporting role, but I think he made a wise choice. He brings an unabashed enthusiasm to the role which is also very fitting. The entire film is meant to be seen through the eyes of Jane and Michael. Naturally, they would see a character like Bert as the neatest guy in the world. Van Dyke created a role that he will always be remembered for.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins" is a classic. Every spoon full of sugar helps the film remain a classic in each and every way.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>So, my daughter has become obsessed with `Mary Poppins'.  She wants to be her.  She watches this movie daily, sings all the songs, draws pictures of her, runs through the house with her umbrella, asks me CONSTANTLY what `supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' means...etc.<br /><br />Seriously, she is OBSESSED.<br /><br />Normally, her obsessions ware on me, and I'm sure that in time this one will too, but one thing that has come of this is that I've actually got to sit through the film a few times recently.  Now, I saw `Mary Poppins' years ago, and I've always held it in high regard.  I love Julie Andrews; seriously.  She's one of my favorite actresses and I've always held a special place in my heart for both `Mary Poppins' and `The Sound of Music'; her two most recognizable films.  So, with years behind me, I settled in to watch this film for the first time in a long time and I must say that I was astounded at how well this delightful film holds up.  It's still just as charming and magical as the first day I saw it.<br /><br />But my oh my, this is a long movie!<br /><br />Julie Andrews, who snagged an Oscar for her performance in this film, is just all sorts of amazing as the magical nanny who comes along at the right time to spread some joy and bring a family closer together.  The rest of the cast is also delightful, even Dick Van Dyke despite a horribly shaky Cockney accent.<br /><br />From dazzling set pieces to beautifully composed songs to sharply meshed animated sequences, `Mary Poppins' has so much to offer!  This is a great Anniversary Edition (I know that there has been a 45th released, but this is the one I own and I see no real need to upgrade) with loads of special features to keep you and your little ones occupied.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>One of Disney's very best musicals, Mary Poppins is an unforgettable children's classic. It combines memorable songs that get stuck in your head with the forward and sarcastic dialogue of the unsurpassable Poppins, and a psychedelic story that employs superbly integrated traditionally animated characters. Part fairy tale, part daydream, and all magic, the sights, songs and laughs propel this Academy Award-winning picture (Andrews took home the Oscar for Best Actress, and the film was nominated for a whopping 13 golden boys - the most of any Disney film) to the top of the lists for the greatest family films ever made.<br /><br />The story begins with Bert (Dick Van Dyke) playing the role of guide and narrator, ushering the viewer to the home at 17 Cherry Tree Lane (as if inexperienced in the technique, the camera cuts on several occasions during the trip, taking the viewer out of the notion of following Bert). The sixth nanny in four months is about to dash out the door, upset at the constantly preoccupied Winifred Banks and her two misbehaving children who have once again gone missing. When Mr. George Banks (David Tomlinson) comes home, he's furious at the disorder, blames the kids and his wife, and insists upon personally hiring the next nanny. The two children, Jane and Michael, create their own list of requirements for the prospective woman, but George scoffs and throws the paper into the fireplace.<br /><br />The following morning, dozens of elderly ladies line the front yard, waiting for an interview for the newly open position. But with a powerful gust of wind, the lot of them is replaced by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), who descends from the clouds with her umbrella and carpetbag and, mysteriously, the children's list of preferences. Banks is all seriousness and professionalism, but he's no match for the tricky verbal wizardry of Poppins, who not only hires herself, but initially agrees only to a trial run. After dismissing the befuddled man of the house, she slides up the staircase (in a peculiarly reverse Exorcist-like manner) to meet the children, and unpack her empty carpetbag (pulling out a hat rack, mirror, lamp and more).<br /><br />Poppins uses magic and singing (starting off with the very famous "A Spoonful of Sugar" song) to tidy up their room (tables, toys and doors all flap about in another playful scene reminiscent of The Exorcist), and the trio departs for the park. There they meet Bert, who is creating chalk masterpieces on the sidewalk, and with a little more magical help from Mary Poppins, embark on a fun-filled adventure into his artwork - firstly on a jolly holiday in a picturesque English countryside (the kids are curiously absent for the first two lengthy sequences with dancing penguins and barnyard animals) which segues into a merry-go-round horse ride through the park that transforms into a fox hunt and then a derby.<br /><br />At first it seems that practically perfect (and rather vain) Mary Poppins is there to straighten out the wily kids; as the film progresses it's evident that Mr. and Mrs. Banks are the ones she's there to fix; George is a well-ordered man absorbed with his work, and rarely has time for his children and their unseemly hullabaloo (or the sugary female thinking of his wife), while Winifred is leading women's rights movements - an act contrary to her subservient attitude toward her husband.<br /><br />A cheerful creativity surrounds the whole film, from the laugh-filled tea party on the ceiling of Uncle Albert's home, to the senile but punctual admiral who commands a ship atop his house, to the tongue-twisting silliness of "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." The songs are some of the best in any of Disney's films, the mixing of traditional animation with the live action characters is fantastic, and Andrews' performance is (spit) spot-on. Although the running time is noticeably lengthy for a family film (the following year's The Sound of Music was, of course, even longer) and the scripting of Poppins changed drastically from the original story by P.L. Travers (for the better), it is one of the most memorable and delightful musicals from Walt Disney - one that hasn't aged and remains universally entertaining.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Released in `64 `Mary Poppins' is without question one of the most beloved movies in Disney's vast vault of wonderful family film classics. I was twelve years old when `Mary Poppins' made its theatrical debut and I must admit that I immediately fell madly in love with Julie Andrews. Obviously I wasn't the only one considering the fact that Julie Andrews won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of the magical nanny.<br /><br />This film is what family entertainment is all about; singing, dancing, cute kids, attractive nurturing adults, a zany but lovable character here and there and a heavy dose of enchantment and childish wonder. This is definitely a keeper by all means.</p></br></body></html>

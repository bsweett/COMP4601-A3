It is, in most respects, a very good film.  But (and there is that pesky `but') there are elements of this film, key elements at that, that seem off-kilter.  Often referred to as that little Indie that could, `Winter's Bone' has achieved a lot of praise and accolades this Awards season; in fact, it's sitting pretty for some key Oscar nominations, including Actress, Screenplay and Picture.  For me though, this film kind of boils down to one person; Debra Granik.  With a script that can become repetitive and obtuse, to acting that runs the gamut from unapologetically stereotypical to downright sincere and believable (so, in other words, uneven), it all comes together thanks to Granik's marvelous direction.  She understands the chills needed in the atmosphere to get under the audiences skin and create something unforgettable out of a story that is, to put it bluntly, rather forgettable.  `Winter's Bone' has a lot of fans, and I am kind of one of them.  As much as I rag on some of the films generalities, I did enjoy it and certainly would recommend it.  Jennifer Lawrence has some very good moments as the determined Ree, even if I found her handling of some lesser scenes to be awkward and unbelievable.  John Hawkes is the star of the show, for he really creates someone phenomenally centered and conflicted and haunted from start to finish.  It's the dark and spooky climate the makes the movie though, and Granik manipulates it with stellar results.  While it doesn't emotionally connect like it claims to (it is notably cold and distant, but I feel that was intentional and even commendable, to a degree) it does leave an impression thanks to Granik's attention to detail.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>Life is harsh for 17 y old Ree. She lives in a cottage in poorest Missouri with two little siblings who depend on her, and a mentally ill mother: mom has given up, she did not have what it takes to face this life. Dad has run away. He is out on bail. If he does not show up for his court date, his bail will be lost and the cottage will be owned by the bail agent.<br /><br />Ree starts looking for her dad. She has nice neighbors who don't let the family starve. She has a good friend and an uncle, unfortunately a dope head. She runs into people who don't want her to go around asking questions. The social world of Ree's dad is about drugs and sheriffs and snitches and bail agents.<br /><br />Ree is a brave girl, she fights for her home and her family, but the world looks depressing and hopeless. Nevertheless, this little movie with no stars and no props and minimal budgets is truer than most Hollywood productions.<br />The story leaves you at a dead end. Ree wins a victory of sorts and her little brother is happy that she does not have to enlist in the army for the sign up money, but we know that this is a Pyrrhus victory. There is no hope to break the cycle. And yet, the film leaves us in an amazingly uplifting, though totally illusionary mood.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>If you are looking for a great Drama, you will be hard pressed to find a grittier more engrossing movie than Winter's Bone. It is a modern tale of life for mountain folk, who live by old codes, with new demons. Great great story for adult audience. For those who enjoy this may I also encourage you to watch a depression era movie about a different set of mountain folks <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059TGF">The Winter People</a>both movies are available on Video on Demand or DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>In the bleak, back country of Missouri there exists the country folk. Desolate rocky land, dirt roads, run down homes and people filled with despair, and in this case some of them filled with Methamphetamine. The new moonshine is Meth cooked in the ancient old lean-to or any old building around.<br /><br />Ree Dolly is a seventeen year old girl who is bringing up her brother and sister, and caring for her mother who is mentally unstable. Her dad has gone missing, he was noted for the good Meth he manufactured. He must have done it for laughs because God knows there isnt any money in the family. Dee is scraping dirt and bone to keep the family together. Sheriff shows up one day telling her that if her father does not show up for his hearing next week, the house and land will go to the bondsmen. He wants to know where her dad is and she tells him, she does not know. "But, says Ree, "I'll find him".<br /><br />What a remarkable film this is. This young woman, played by Jennifer Lawrence has taken this story, and it belongs to her. Her performance is outstanding. More than believable, this young woman doesn't give up, remains somewhat optimistic in the environment of a dark and dreary life. Ree goes to her relatives, her uncle, Teardrop, (where do they get these names?) played by John Hawkes is the ragged, thin, lifeless kind of man who is really all steel and nerves. No help from him or anyone who might claim to be family. Ree has a week and in between looking for he father, she provides for her family the best she can. Neighbors are kind and give her a part of what little they have. Ree perservers because she has to, there is no alternative. She finally wonders if her father is dead. It would solve the problem if he was- the house and land would be hers. Essentially she is alone. This seventeen year old girl is keeping her family alive, Her brother and sister play happily. not knowing what is really going on. What strikes me is that somehow this family knows they are loved, that is what keeps them going. Ree is in charge and at no point does she waiver.<br /><br />A really remarkable film, taken from a book and it looks like it is very true to the story. In this Missouri backcountry, Ree is ray of Hope and Light. It has to be that she is loved, what else could keep this teenager moving in the right direction. Ree will figure it out I am very sure of that. The tension and  violence that encompass this area of America has a tiny light.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 11-07-10<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0QL7I">Down to the Bone</a></p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Debra Granik's WINTER'S BONE is one of the better films of 2010.  It's an intimate portrait of rural Missouri, revolving around seventeen-year-old Ree, whose meth-manufacturing father has left her to care for two younger siblings and a sick mother.  Ree's father Jessup has gone missing, but he put his property up for bond.  Meaning, if Ree doesn't find her father within a week--either that, or proof that he is dead--she looses the house and the land.  Unfortunately, her father's extended family seems inclined to let sleeping dogs lie, to the extent that Ree finds herself in genuine danger.  Her only accomplice, if you can call him that, is her uncle Teardrop, who may be as dangerous as everyone else around her.<br /><br />As Ree, Jennifer Lawrence carries this film on her more-than-capable shoulders; she is the rock of the film, anchoring it down so tightly that even the other stellar performances--especially John Hawkes as Teardrop--pale by comparison.  A lot of the cast aren't even professional actors, which lends the film an extra air of authenticity (that, and the fact that it was shot on location).  WINTER'S BONE is, without a doubt, a small production; and while that can sometimes ruin a movie, here it helps.  The script is good though not wholly memorable; the real grit here lies in the actors' performances, without which this film would've been a mediocre idea and best forgotten.  As is, it's nominated for 4 Academy Awards, and goes down as one of the best films of 2010 (a year in which quite a few good movies were made).</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>A few years ago, I read Daniel Woodrell's WINTER'S BONE and found much to admire.  Set in the most destitute portions of our nation, the Ozark country of southern Missouri...it told the story of young Ree Dolly, a 17-year-old girl and her desperate efforts to find her missing father and bring him to court before his bail is revoked.  Because the bail her dad put up was the deed to the Dolly house and land.  This would have left Ree and her two young siblings and her mentally ill mother homeless.<br /><br />The book showed in great detail a land wracked by poverty and ruined by crystal meth.  An insular society where the only code is not revealing anything to the outside world, especially law enforcement.  But a society where women, especially teen girls, are not allowed to snoop and pry into the doings of the men.  A society in which being beaten or killed for asking the wrong question is tolerated.  A world of grinding poverty, poor health care and terrible education.  And in the midst of all this, was the heroic Ree...smarter than everyone around her, but also forced to accept a role beyond her years.<br /><br />The book was atmospheric and well-written.  But it was slowly paced and ultimately a bit boring.<br /><br />Now the film version has come along, and it captures the book nearly perfectly.  Both the successes and the failures.  The film does an outstanding job of capturing the landscape and the desolation.  There are many movies that show bleak landscapes and somehow make them beautiful.  WINTER'S BONE shows an area that is deeply unattractive and does not try to show any hidden beauty or stark nobility.  It's cold and it's covered with trash.  You look at the land, and realize that no one COULD ever prosper there...the poverty we see has bled into the land.  This is very effectively captured throughout the movie.<br /><br />Ree Dolly, who is in every scene of the film, is played by Jennifer Lawrence.  She looks a little like a young, cherubic Renee Zellweger.  It's her first major role, and she is thoroughly committed and accomplished.  Her accent is perfect, and she captures the great intelligence of her character.  It's an intelligence that has been muted by circumstance.  And she's also very brave, because she knows she has no choice but to succeed in her quest, even at the risk of her own safety.  Most other roles are fairly small, but all are played well.  I particularly liked John Hawkes, who played Ree's Uncle Teardrop.  A mildly dangerous man who feels compelled to help out his kin.<br /><br />So there was much to admire in the film.  It certainly treated the book faithfully.  And thus, the movie was slowly paced and boring.  It was frankly hard to care much about most of the characters.  Even Ree is mostly compelling intellectually, not emotionally.  Everyone tends to move very slowly, and there are just a lot of scenes of Ree walking from place to place.  Again, we get a GREAT sense of the place...but if I just wanted to look at landscapes, I'd watch a Terrence Malick film.  I want some compelling story, purpose or character to draw me along...and to a large extent, that is just missing.  And as with the book, the ending is anti-climactic.  It fits the whole morose, slow-paced tone of the story...but it also results in a film that never raises our pulse.  Honestly, I simply struggled to remain awake to the end, even though the movie is only 98 minutes.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence may get a well-deserved boost to her career with WINTER'S BONE.  And often, a good performance is enough for me to recommend seeing a film...I think good acting needs to be seen and appreciated.  However, the film has too many other problems, and I'd recommend passing by this dark, dreary journey.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Having made a strong impression two years ago as Charlize Theron's younger guilt-ridden self in Guillermo Arriaga's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S5N052">The Burning Plain</a>, Jennifer Lawrence brings such a primal, haunting stillness to her performance that she singlehandedly transcends the dispirited tone of director/co-writer Debra Granik's small-scale regional 2010 film. At first, the movie, co-written by Granik and Anne Rosellini, appears to concern itself with the spartan existence of a dirt-poor family in the Missouri Ozarks, but it turns into a far more personal story of one girl's intractable dedication to her family and how she faces life-threatening challenges in keeping her family home together. This is much more a tale of survival than spiritual uplift because 17-year-old Ree Dolly has to care for her two younger siblings while contending with a near-catatonic mother and a meth-making father who has apparently disappeared.<br /><br />Even though she harbors dreams of entering the military to secure the $40,000 promised in the recruiting ads, Ree has to deal with the harsh reality that her father has put up their house as collateral for his bail. If he doesn't show up for a trial in a week's time, dead or alive, they will lose everything. She is determined to find his whereabouts from his criminal relatives and associates despite the fact that she gets the same constant warning to mind her own business or face the consequences. In fact, her stubbornness is at such odds with tribal ties and local customs that she faces revelations she could not possibly be prepared to handle. While Ree remains undaunted in her search for the truth, she also discovers how she cannot break entirely free of her surroundings.<br /><br />Just as she did with an unknown Vera Farmiga as a coke-addicted mother in 2004's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0QL7I">Down to the Bone</a>, Granik extracts a sharply realistic, emotionally precise performance out of Lawrence. For example, when she listens to the soldier tell her to stay home to care for her family, she registers her character's resignation in a most economically searing manner. In smaller roles, John Hawkes etches a menacing presence as Teardrop, Ree's meth addict uncle who brutally warns her that her father may be dead, as does Dale Dickey as a plain-spoken woman who turns out to have more in common with Lady Macbeth. Michael McDonough's stark cinematography captures the bleakness of the rough, depressing terrain. The 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray includes a robust commentary track from Granik and McDonough, an informative 45-minute making-of feature, an alternate opening scene, and four deleted scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Alternately dangerous, dreary, and tense, "Winter's Bone" concerns a teenage girl (Jennifer Lawrence) trying to save the few worldly possessions enjoyed by her mother and siblings. Set in the Ozark mountains of Missouri, 17 year old Ree has to find her missing-in-action father and make sure he shows up for a court date; otherwise the bail bonds company will take the modest family house Ree's father put up as his bail collateral.<br /><br />Ree's search for her father puts her in contact with various dangerous types, most outright criminals and most, unfortunately, related to Ree. And everything is set against a social backdrop maybe one or two small steps above outright poverty.<br /><br />Despite the grim story and the grim setting, there are one or two rays of hope, a couple of sympathetic characters, and the small chance that things might just work out. I won't say any more, other than the movie isn't as relentlessly grim as the ads and trailers make it look. But it is mostly grim. Oh, I should also report that the story is well told, sensitively acted, and in its own understated way, elegantly produced. I enjoyed it and can see why it made the cut as one of this year's ten Best Picture nominees.<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" looks and sounds great on standard DVD and there are a variety of interesting extra features, including about 45 minutes of behind-the-scenes material that really makes you want to hand it to director Debra Granik.  Seeing what little she had to work with (small budget, people's actual houses and yards used as sets, the bulk of the actors picked up via a casting call held in a school gym, etc.), it's amazing that "Winter's Bone" turned out as well as it did.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I just watched this fine film, and I can only feel sorry for the others who said they were bored. A film this complex can only be appreciated if one can understand its rich wealth of subtext, motivation and family pride. Jennifer Lawrence's Ree isn't just looking for her dad. She has a desperate drive to hold on to her family home; her concern for her young siblings and ill mom are a powerful motivation. The almost animal-like behavior of the local folk is merely an age-old tradition of survival. These traditions are sacred, secrets abound, and we are along with Ree in her quest of discovery; her idea of family is more profound than most (since most of the folk are in-bred, referred to often). Ms Lawrence is riveting in her performance, a wisdom way beyond her years, a determination and zeal not willing to compromise and go quietly. She must certainly be deserving of an Oscar nomination. Excellent support from John Hawkes (her uncle, Teardrop) and the feisty Dale Dickey, a tough broad with more than she's telling. Debra Granik's direction is fine, with precision that flows seamlessly. Filmed in the Missouri Ozarks, many locals were used to fill other supporting roles, and they all succeed. The little kids were naturals, nothing forced or phony in their portrayals. The final resolution is a little unsettling, but wrought with a severity that almost unhinges Ree, but she stays strong to the bitter end. Not a million laffs, but loaded with talent; the Ozark setting is a character unto itself. Lots of good DVD extras. Music created added atmosphere, and was well-executed. I think this film is worthy on many levels.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>The theme of innocence unprotected, fighting for its life, is one of the oldest and most potent in fiction. Debra Granik's film "Winter's Bone," based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a bleak, unforgettable folk tale about a teenage girl whose struggle for survival takes her to dark places few people ever have the misfortune to see.<br /><br />Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), a 17-yer-old girl in the Missouri Ozarks, has dropped out of school to care for her younger siblings and her severely depressed, catatonic mother. Deserted by her methamphetamine-cooking father Jessup, Ree manages to keep the family going until the day the sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) shows up at their cabin. Jessup has skipped bail, the sheriff tells her, and he put up the cabin as surety. Jessup has one week to show up in court, or the cabin is forfeit.<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is the story of Ree's desperate search for her father to prevent her family from being thrown out into the woods. This search, without going into plot points, costs her dearly. The Ozarks are already a place where people learn early to mind their business and not to go snooping in other peoples'. Add meth dealing to the picture, and the situation turns deadly. Ree finds scant sympathy from her neighbors and even her own extended family. Her scary Uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes) makes it excruciatingly plain that her questions are unwelcome. Yet Teardrop's reaction is mild compared with that of the even scarier people he works for. "We warned you," Merab (Dale Dickey), wife of the local meth boss, tells Ree. "Why didn't you listen?"<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is a masterful film, seamlessly mixing delicate lyricism and white-knuckle suspense. The acting is superb down to the smallest bit part. Nineteen-year-old Jennifer Lawrence, in her first starring role, scarcely seems to be acting; she really seems to be this frail girl, armed only with courage and a fierce love of her family, facing down monsters. Blessed with an uncommonly smart, poignant music score from a number of Ozarks musicians, "Winter's Bone" is the best film so far this year, and it seems unlikely that any film will exceed it.It has already won major prizes at the Sundance and Berlin film festivals; here's hoping it can add an Oscar or two to the tally.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>Astonishingly good film.

No significant dramatic turns, or action sequences, but a powerful look at the difficulty faced by a girl who is trying to keep her family together in spite of the problems presented by her absent father.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>If one were to take the women from this film and combine them with the women from "The Fighter", you would scare the hell out of people.

But take a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>At times this two million dollar Best Picture Oscar nominee is a joyless albeit compelling journey, but for those who know the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316066419">story</a> that Daniel Woodrell adapted his amazing screenplay on, there is far too much vigor in these characters for it be written off as gloomy and not worth the casual film-goer's time.  The mortifying journey's destination is a lively reward indeed.<br /><br />Winter's Bone is without question one of the year's best movies in what amounts to be a very potent field of candidates.  It has been nominated for four Oscars altogether, one additional being the aforementioned adapted screenplay and the others being for performances by its lead Jennifer Lawrence and another for her co-star John Hawkes.  Both are worthy, but given the similar subtle cold determination in their characters I can't help but think it is much more than just things that tie these characters together, but the powerful style this film was intentionally created to possess.  There are very strong controllers behind the scenes here.  Those strengths and many more are directorial ones, and Debra Granik (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0QL7I">Down to the Bone</a>) might deserve the most credit of all.  She's been snubbed of an Oscar in my opinion.  The film's cinematography by Michael McDonaugh (who's also credited as a producer) as well as its editing also deserve tremendous praise.<br /><br />Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17 year old girl growing up in The Ozarks.  To say she's experienced a difficult life is an understatement.  Her father is arrested and jumps bond.  Her mother is likely a catatonic schizophrenic while Ree plays the role of surrogate mother to her two younger siblings.  Her father is soon about to cost them their home and he must be found to prevent an already horrible life from getting far worse.<br /><br />The obvious thing about this movie is the future stardom of Jennifer Lawrence.  She's going to be a big deal but in a good way.  The 20 year old is talented in ways that no actress of her generation has yet to display.  Her quiet and layered performance as Ree may not win her the Oscar but she sure does deserve it.  She's so deeply engaged in her character that in scenes where her face maintains a gaze of melancholy bravery, she manages to show us glimpses of what her character is feeling beneath it all.  I think of the fleeting look of joy while seeing a small country band at a birthday party play their fiddles and how badly I wanted to see her smile.  Her character's emotions are contained but apparent, as even her tears are inhibited before they finally see air.  She made Ree among the greatest heroes to appear in film in the last few years.  I hope Hollywood doesn't kidnap Lawrence and make her play superheroes but I fear it's too late.<br /><br />Perhaps the less obvious thing about Winter's Bone is that Debra Granik will go on to create more great movies, but I do suspect with confidence that will happen.  This film is certainly not to be missed.  Everything about it comes together beautifully to tell a very compelling story.  I can't recommend it enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>I was leery about seeing this movie, even though I had read and heard rave reviews about it, because I had enjoyed the book so much.  And, needless to say, you hardly ever find a movie adaptation of a book that lives up to your expectations.  Well, in this case, the movie far bypassed my expectations and I would be hard-pressed to decide which I liked more - novel or movie.<br /><br />Casting is superb in the movie.  Setting is very true-to-life.  This is not an easy or fun movie to watch - the subject matter is too hard.  But if you want to see an authentic movie about the lives of hardscrabble people, most of whom are living on the fringes of the meth cooking, distributing and using subculture, this is a movie to watch.  It is also a movie about rising above your circumstances and shining, which Ree Dolly does, even though she has terrible obstacles placed in front of her.  So even though this is a very dark movie, it is not a hopeless movie.<br /><br />NOTE:  Marideth Sisco provides much of the music for the soundtrack of the movie.

Based on the successful novel by author Daniel Woodrell who explains the choice of title explain at the back of his book: "The `Winter's' part of the title is obvious, and the `Bone' part comes from slang. It can be stated wryly, sarcastically, even tenderly, when throwing a sop to someone, `Oh, give him a bone.' In this case, it is winter itself giving a gift, a bone, to Ree Dolly. The season knows she has earned it, and the term suggests the double-edged aspect of the gesture and is suited to the novel,"  writer Anne Rosellini and writer/director Debra Granik have adapted this story for film and in doing so have presented one of the finest artistic successes of the year.<br /><br />The setting is contemporary Missouri Ozarks where people barely survive, especially during the winter.  Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in a stunningly sophisticated  performance) is seventeen years old, living in a shack with her clinically depressed mother and her brother and sister: her father Jessup is missing, having been arrested for his dealings in making Crank (crystal meth) - the only source of income for many of the folk in the area, folk who also are users - and posted bail using his house and land as collateral.  Ree has a tough time as the only responsible person for her family and when the local sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) visits to inform Ree that Jessup has skipped town and that if he doesn't show up for his court date, Ree's home and land will be absconded, Ree is devastated.  Ree seeks advice from her many relatives who adamantly refuse to help her out of fear of discovery of involvement in the drug business: Ree sets out to find her father.  She turns to every member of her family (it would seem that most everyone in this pitiful area is blood) she is turned down for help - especially from her father's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes) who hesitantly warns her that her father is dead.  She finally gains some assistance through her perseverance only to discover that that Jessup is dead and she is forced to dredge his body from the river to cut off his hands to prove to the court that her father is dead and the threat of evacuation is nullified.<br /><br />The casting of this film is a little miracle: down to the smallest role each actor is exactly right in creating the sullen and desperate atmosphere of this story.  There are rare moments when the tale is not grim, moments such as the gathering of banjo and guitar players in a Pickin' Session to accompanying the singing of a Marideth Sisco.  The cinematography by Michael McDonough  and the musical choices made by Dickon Hinchliffe  recreate the desolation of this pitiful community of people living on the edge in the Ozarks.  But towering above all of this is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence who will undoubtedly now rise to prominence. Grady Harp, October 10</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Deep in the backwoods of Missouri, 17-year old Ree Dolly has a hard life; she's raising her siblings, caring for her mentally-ill mother, and running the house all by herself.  Her father, a meth cooker, has jumped bail and the family will lose their home if he can't be brought in to the law so Ree must go to all of her kinfolk for help, even though she knows their code of silence is enforced by beatings - and worse.<br /><br />This low-budget film is excellent, reminiscent of "Coal Miner's Daughter" without the music and happy ending.  The harsh and utterly hopeless lives of the mountain poor are presented unflinchingly; I never felt anyone was acting.  Many of the smaller roles are, in fact, played by non-professional locals and they are all convincing.  Ree's courage in seeking out her father amid her brutal relatives is admirable and frightening.<br /><br />The top-notch script, direction, and acting make for a scary, depressing, but always riveting movie, a glimpse into a rarely-seen world.

The set decoration by Rebecca Brown (who also did the set decoration to the upcoming "Shelter" (2011) is brilliant! The costume design by Rebecca Hofherr is brilliant!<br /><br />This is a brilliant film that keeps you on the edge of your seat and thinking at the same time. This is a film that is different from the other recent films out there. Jennifer Lawrence gives the star-making performance of her career, which is already gaining her award recognition. This is one of the best films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>'Winter's Bone' is the best fiction film I saw in 2010.  [I put the 'fiction' qualifier in there because my favorite film overall was Lucy Walker's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CJQVQC">Waste Land</a>, a documentary.]  'Bone' deserved its Oscar nominations and Spirit Award wins.  There's a grittiness and realness present in this film that's lacking from a lot of Hollywood product.  Debra Granik and Anne Rosellini's outstanding screenplay - adapted from Daniel Woodrell's superb novel of the same name - indelibly documents the extent of the impact that the methamphetamine epidemic has had on rural communities.  It does that not only in terms of rendering the primary circle of addiction in stark relief, but also by depicting the wider, secondary circles of mistrust, paranoia and broken families it engenders.<br /><br />Director/co-writer Granik has tabbed an outstanding set of actors to depict this flat, colorless, frightening world.  It's now well-documented that Jennifer Lawrence shocked the daylights out of everyone with her performance as Ree.  Anyone who says they saw that coming is fabricating.  Excellent screenplay and direction notwithstanding, Bone's make-or-break rests on Ms. Lawrence's shoulders.  To say she nailed it is an understatement.  She buried that nail so deep, she shot right to the very heart of the Hollywood A-List.  To this viewer, it's clear that Lawrence's performance was enhanced greatly by the great work of John Hawke.  His 'Teardrop' is the single best thing about this uniformly excellent production.  Ree and Teardrop on the screen together make for the film's standout scenes.<br /><br />That's only topped by whatever scenes Dale Dickey appears in.  She's the first line of defense in local kingpin Thump Milton's rings of protection.  In countenance, physique and cadence, Ms. Dickey is pitch-perfect in every way.  She's downright menacing.  Her part in bringing Ree's quest to a very undeniable finality is not something you'll easily forgot.  She won an Independent Spirit award for her portrayal.  It was both well deserved and well awarded.</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>Adapted from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, WINTER'S BONE immediately sparked comparisons to last year's Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker.  Both films received limited runtime in theaters.  But I must say this is by far the superior movie in just about every aspect imaginable, unless you count overwrought machoism, slanted anti-war sentiments, and explosions as a category.  Don't get me wrong, The Hurt Locker was a decent film for what it was.  But it won't leave the kind of lasting impression like this story will.<br /><br />When you hear the word "backwoods", you might get the immediate impression of inbred, buck-toothed hillbillies wearing overalls and drinking moonshine.  This story doesn't succumb to exploiting certain exaggerated stereotypes just to grab your attention.  But these characters are definitely a little rough around the edges, to say the least.<br /><br />Filmed in the Ozarks of Missouri, this is a simple but riveting dramatic tale about family, danger, and perseverance.  Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17-year-old girl forced to grow up way too fast.  With her mother desperately ailing and her father somewhere hiding from the law, she struggles to support her younger brother and sister.  To make matters worse, a bail bondsman notifies her that her dad put up their home as his bail bond, then skipped out on court.  In order to track her father down, Ree is forced to enter a seedy, violent realm of paranoid drug pushers and users.  Many of them happen to be distant family members.  Family ties or not, none of them are too anxious to help her out.  The risks and desperation mount as she inches closer to the truth.<br /><br />The best part of this film is the character development and the acting.  It is so refreshing to see the young cast perform their roles with such controlled precision.  Especially Lawrence.  She puts many established Hollywood actors to shame here, I can't wait to see more of her work.<br /><br />WINTER'S BONE is slow paced, and might not appeal to many casual movie goers.  But it does have some moments of heightened tension that will leave you holding your breath.  It explores a certain drug culture and meager lifestyle that is rarely touched upon in movies.  Plus it makes some poignant, thought-provoking points about family devotion and the human spirit.<br /><br />It also was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic Film at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.  I doubt there will be a better film than this all year.  Brilliant filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The milieu the characters of "Winter's Bone" inhabit is truly a world unto itself: a rural land where grinding poverty rules, where clannish ties run thick, where guns and hunting are an integral part of daily life, where acts of brutality and violence alternate with simple acts of charity and kindness, and where outsiders are viewed with suspicion and paranoia.<br /><br />In this richly atmospheric film of the Daniel Woodrell novel, Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a dilapidated shack with her mentally ill mother and a younger brother and sister, whom Ree is essentially raising.  When the sheriff comes to inform her that her father, who's been arrested for crank production, has put up the family's home and land as bail, Ree goes in desperate search of him to ensure that he doesn't skip out on his court date.  However, as the young woman journeys through the area seeking information as to his whereabouts, she finds herself involved in a situation fraught with far more mystery and danger than she could have imagined when she first set out.  All this leads to Ree having to decide between strictly adhering to the "code of the hills" - in which the ties of blood trump all else - or of violating it and doing what is right for herself and her immediate family.<br /><br />Writer/director Debra Granik and co-writer Anne Rosellini immerse the audience so thoroughly in the Ozark setting that it takes us awhile to fully shake off the experience and to reorient ourselves to our own environment once the movie has ended.  It's a beautifully observed landscape of gnarled trees, car tires, chopped wood, rusted-out vehicles and hay bales, where the sounds of cattle lowing and coyotes howling compete with the twang of a banjo and country music songs playing mournfully on the radio.  Indeed, so cut off does this place seem from the outside world that many of the modern conveniences the rest of us take for granted - computers, cell phones, the internet - seem almost completely absent from the setting.<br /><br />In terms of storyline and drama, the filmmakers scrupulously avoid resorting to melodrama or clich&eacute;s to get their points across.  The events in the movie arise organically and naturally from the setting, and the understated performances add to the verisimilitude of the piece.  Lawrence carries the film with her insightful, dignified performance as Ree, a morally upright girl trying to do the right thing in a world almost totally devoid of resources and help.  Yet, it is Ree's determination to not give up and to try to make something decent out of her own life and the lives of her siblings that gives the film its overall tone of hope.<br /><br />Special note should also be taken of the stark, spare, haunting score by Dickon Hinchliffe that perfectly reflects the film's bleak and dreary background.<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is a harsh, unsparing film, but a memorable, mesmerizing experience all the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"Winter's Bone" is set in the Ozarks during a hard winter for a 17 year old girl taking care of her dirt poor family.  Her mother has had a nervous breakdown, and her father has jumped bail for charges of making methamphetamine.  The 17 year old, Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), has had to grow up fast, and take on parenting her two younger siblings.  They are living on the edge - almost starving - when she learns from the local bail bondsman that her father put a lien on their home.  The sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) informs her that her father, Jessup, has not shown up for his scheduled court appearance, and she only has a week to find him.  Ree feels the overwhelming responsibility of making sure the family can keep the land and home, their only asset and place to live.  She steels her spirit and is determined to keep the house and property.<br /><br />Ree sets out to find her father, knowing her life could be in danger as well.  She has many confrontations, and a physical beating by the local farmers to keep her off her father's trail.  The worst thing in the community is to be a "snitch".  She hears rumors that her dad was killed in a methamphetamine brewing session that went wrong.  She does not believe it, but continues to confront her father's pals in his drugged life.  Her Uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes) helps her in a round-about way, as well as a crusty old hag named Merab (Dale Dickey) who knows more than she lets on.  The whole community is covering up for the illegal drugs and bad habits of their "clan".  The ties that bind are revealed through their squalid, near Neanderthal living conditions.  The community reminded me of junkyard dogs all fighting for a bone, but bonded by blood and experience.<br /><br />Slowly clues add up for Jessup's fate and Ree's realization she has to carry the full responsibility of family.<br /><br />The movie is rough and tender, a fantastic story of strength when life is cold and cruel.  "Winter's Bone" is fabulous in all facets, the noir cinematography<br />and location all combine synergy with a great story and fantastic acting by the entire cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>WINTER'S BONE is one of 2010's most honored movies earning 4 Oscar noms including Picture, Actress and supporting actor---and they deserve it.<br />Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant in her emotionally mature performance as the determined Ree.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>This is hardcore storytelling with jolting characterizations, and Oscar-worthy performances. WINTER'S BONE is one of the finest pieces of American cinema I have seen in many a year, and not because it's uplifting, or full of soft-and-fuzzy sacharine. On the contrary, depression is a way of life in the stark, crank-infested Ozarks, and the hand that's been dealt to young Ree Dolly ( a truly magnificent Jennifer Lawrence ) is far from good. The straight-forward intensity of this incredible film may be to much for some.</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>A story is of the inherited, perhaps, from a colonial Mother-country's legislation allowing throwing a family out of a property owned by a single member in response to this person's deeds whether bail-related (as in this movie) or simply demented actions used expertly by the age care strangers-involved not in Australia, probably, only.<br /><br />A middle-U.S.A. short-of-usual-sports-cars-and-boyfrends seventeen year old girl growing up siblings and looking after a mentally charged mother searches for and finds an evidence of father's passing away to secure a family home targeted by the State as a bail refund for dad's not appearing at the hearing.<br /><br />It is a very educative story of a British system reality well survived two centuries of the U.S. independence.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>OK, starting off, you see my star rating for this movie? That rating means I thought this movie has a few good points and, *gasp!*, a good deal of bad points. And I'm not a cinema elitist who disregards every blockbuster ever made and thinks every indier-than-thou flick is by default great. I rate films out of honesty, and this is what I honestly think of Winter's Bone.<br /><br />First off I can't deny this film is gorgeously shot. There's some great and nifty camera work in the movie and the scenery is just pure eye candy. I loved the opening shots and ominous, dark tone... and then the characters started talking. Seriously, the dialogue is so overblown and tacky. I was laughing at pretty much 80% of the lines spoken in the film. How this was up for Best Screenplay is against me.<br /><br />What very little plot there is relies on the protagonist being ten times as stupid as the characters in most movies today. It's about a girl at risk of losing her home searching for her father. What feels like an hour of the film is devoted to silent footage of the protagonist walking through the woods. If you cut half of the "walking through the woods" out, the movie would be an hour long. And again, there was a lot of buildup but NO ENDING... it just ends.<br /><br />The actors do a pretty good job given the script, but this film is a massive bore. I don't even think hobos with shotguns could save this film. I honestly don't get all the praise this gets.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Wikipedia informs us that the classic 'hillbilly' stereotype began during the Great Depression. The image was one of "the poor, ignorant, feuding family with a huge brood of children tending the family moonshine still." Filmed in the Ozark Mountains, 'Winter's Bone' continues to advance the same stereotype--this time however, the 'hillbillies' are not making moonshine but rather cooking up the more deadly brew of methamphetamine.<br /><br />When we're first introduced to the film's protagonist, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), she's taking care of her almost catatonic mother and two much younger siblings. The family is so destitute that at one point they shoot squirrels and eat them. One wonders why no social services agency becomes involved with this family. After all, the local sheriff is quite familiar with the family's situation--that Ree, a 17 year old minor, is caring for the younger siblings and the mother is a virtual basket case. Wouldn't the sheriff have been obligated to report the family situation to social services so they could be placed in foster care? After all, if something happens to those kids and law enforcement was found to know about it, they could be held liable along with the county for not calling in various helpful authorities.<br /><br />The inciting incident occurs early on when a bail bondsman informs Ree that she has a week to find her meth-selling father who has used the family home as collateral to be released on bond. Ree seeks help from various relatives including 'Teardrop', her uncle, who at first wants nothing to do with finding brother Jessup, Ree's dad. Teardrop's strategy is to intimidate his niece, so that she won't get into trouble when the meth dealers get upset over her snooping around trying to find her father. It's established early on that people in town are scared of Uncle Teardrop due to his deep-seated anger management problem (Teardrop likes to smash car windows and refuses to get out of his own vehicle when ordered by the police).<br /><br />Ree eventually contacts other members of the community who she is supposedly distantly related to. One of these men is Thump who heads a group of meth-dealing bad guys.  He gets the word out that Ree should not be snooping around but she won't listen.  Because of the hillbilly code, he ends up sending the womenfolk to beat Ree up. Finally Teardrop levels with Ree, explaining that her father was killed because he was an informer. I had a hard time believing that Thump and his men didn't kill Ree outright as she was doing all that snooping around. You would think that meth dealers wouldn't give a hoot about some old hillbilly code about not hurting a woman. And then despite the fact that they outnumber Teardrop, Thump and his men somehow accept his word that Ree won't snitch. Unlikely. And then they capitulate and send the womenfolk to cut off Ree's father's hand, as proof that he's dead. And here his daughter accepts that? The point I guess is that people are so intimidated by meth dealers, that their spirit is completely crushed. So Ree makes a 'deal with the devil' in order to save the family. You've got to assume that law enforcement is so totally corrupt that they look the other way in every case. Here, Ree assumes the police know about what's happening and will take no action. So there's not one good person in law enforcement who might try to do something? So they're all completely intimidated and ineffectual? No higher authorities become involved in cases like these?<br /><br />Sure there are cases where people are intimidated and refuse to cooperate with law enforcement. But if everyone did that, the vast majority of criminals would get away with their crimes. So you have to buy this whole scenario and I have trouble doing that.<br /><br />The problem with 'Winter's Bone' is that most of the hillbillies are creepy, malevolent figures, reminiscent of some of the unpleasant characters in the film 'Deliverance'. Ree comes off as hardly heroic, refusing to rat out her father's killers in a desperate bid to save her family.  It's understandable but nothing to cheer about.  Similarly, we're asked to sympathize with Teardrop too as he's saved his niece from the clutches of murderers--but he too is complicit in his brother's murder.<br /><br />'Winter's Bone' was directed by Debra Granik, a Columbia film professor. She is to be admired for using some local talent during the filming and does a fine job in getting good work out of her director of photography and editors. Nonetheless, her big mistake was deciding to adapt the source material, a novel which apparently promotes the idea that there is a community in the Ozarks who are completely unlikeable and have little or no redeeming qualities, due to their association with the methamphetamine trade. Even if we accept the idea that there is an underclass of such people, how about humanizing those characters by giving them some kind of personality, instead of depicting them as suffering from a terminal case of uncontrollable hostility?</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>After high recommendations, I watched this film with a mixture of incredulity and disappointment.  John  Wayne saved "True Grit" for me, but even the controlled, memorable performance  of John Hawkes as the rough and inscrutable yet ultimately caring brother of the daddy being sought after by the young daughter-protagonist, Ree, can't rescue this film from its own excesses.<br /><br />Normally violent scenes of mid-life hillbilly families operating as blood-related (they ARE Southern country boys and girls after all) gangbangers would be the ideal material for that narrative sub-genre known as "Southern Gothic," especially given the potential for black humor in the grotesque climactic scene in which a couple of conscience-stricken witches of the clan take Ree on an icy, night-time fishing expedition--equipped not with tackle but a power chain-saw and  in pursuit not of big ole catfish but the submerged hands of Ree's father--the evidence she requires to save her house and family.<br /><br />In this movie, the viewer has the impression that scenes like this, along with a family's ultra-violent beating of our heroine in distress (right out of "The Lottery"), are played "straight"--the menacing characters, hurt-inflicting "set pieces," edited face-slaps, and scary camera angles served up, along with the detailed, candid glimpses of everyday life, merely to show us the way folks conduct themselves in the Ozark backwoods where moonshine distilleries have been replaced by stolid rustics cooking methamphetamine (and driving Caddies) along with "Mafia-justice" country-style.  (Wordsworth would be appalled.)  The filmmakers appear clueless to the enormous potential of this material to show the viewer so much more.<br /><br />Other Southern storytellers--Dickey ("Deliverance"), McCarthy ("That Is No Country for Old Men"), above all, Flannery O'Connor (not to mention Welty, Williams, Capote and Faulkner)--go much MORE "over the top" than this movie.  But for them every detail is integral with, or essential to, the careful construction of an epiphany in which the reader/viewer finally is led to a shocking, indelible moment of life-changing self-recognition.  Such revelatory moments, or "epiphanies," James Joyce insisted, are the most significant, distinguishing feature of narrative art worthy of the name.<br /><br />In response to a student's question about a seemingly exclusive preference for movies made before 1990, I could respond: In the new millennium I've seen 2 outstanding, life-changing films: "There Will Be Blood" and "That Is No Country for Old Men" (from the brothers who brought Southern Gothic black comedy to northern Minnesota comes a movie guaranteed to make you think twice before spending another precious moment in a theater).  After films like these, a viewer becomes perhaps overly astringent in his demands of a great film.  (I almost envy those who insist that a film must simply "entertain" and not present the challenges of a Blake-like visionary artist.) There are no real epiphanies offered the spectator of this formulaic, "True Grit meets Blood Simple," pastoral aberration. In the rite-of-passage skeletal plot, even Ree's coming of age is of little interest--she's plenty tough, savvy, initiated into the business of growing up and raising a family among white-trash neighbors-on-meth from the very beginning.  Eventually, she learns to place a little more trust in the bad guys who, after all, are her kin (notwithstanding they knocked off her snitching dad, a meth cooker who was at heart a good guy too).  We, in turn, learn to stay away from movies as full of cliches, character stereotypes, and unmotivated, pointless melodrama as this one.  Or, if like the filmmakers we become enamored of the undeniable fascination of some of the more realistic, detailed vignettes of these curious country folk and the stoic but connected life they share (mostly through song), we learn that one visit is enough.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I'm sorry but I just couldn't get into this movie.  It's billed as a "thriller" but it's nowhere near that.  It reminded me of "The Wizard of Oz" like Dorthey going all over the place to no end looking for the Oz, but here it's Ree looking for her father.  This film was quite dull and uneventful and nearly put me to sleep.  They didn't even show Ree chainsawing her father's hands off at the end.  At least show us something memorable and gory after we spent hours watching her look for this guy.  Another thing is I'm not into any movie that deals with the crystal meth thing.  I don't find it entertaining and I don't want to go down that road!  I guess I was disillusioned, especially hearing it had Oscar buzz and all that.  Different strokes for different folks.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Winter's Bone is one of those independent features released every year that gets massive notice from the general public and ends up on nearly every year-end list of best films. It takes place in the rural Ozark Mountains, showing a side of America we don't often see in films and uses gritty, unflinching realism in this stark setting while telling a genuinely exciting, plausible story.<br /><br />Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) is 17-years-old and responsible for the well-being of herself and her two younger siblings. Her mother sits in a catatonic state and her father Jessup, a meth cook, isn't around much. One day Sheriff Baskin (Garret Dillahunt) arrives to explain that Jessup has skipped bail and has put the family's house up for his bond. Ree vows to find him, but she lives in a town where almost everyone is involved in drugs and hardly anyone wants to talk. The effects of meth are apparent all through the area in both the rundown look of the houses and the weary, worn faces of its population. When even Jessup's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes) refuses to help her find him, Ree must navigate her way through the male-dominated realm of the backwoods to find her father.<br /><br />Although it takes place in the "backwoods," Winter's Bone avoids the stereotypes that generally characterize people in these areas although it seems that nearly every character is related in some way. The film demonstrates very strong characterization in that it doesn't stereotype these people but it doesn't beautify them either. All of the actors look and sound realistic for this setting. Even Ree, the determined protagonist, has only an average vocabulary and though pretty, looks like a girl that has more important things to do than worry about her appearance. Ree is one of the strongest female protagonists to grace the screen in some time. She's strong-willed and determined, but appropriately vulnerable. Roles like this one don't often come along for women, but Lawrence really makes Ree come convincing. She seems to really understand this character and she plays her with the perfect amount of bravado and realism.<br /><br />The film is really well-made, drawing you into the setting with the beautiful photography of absolute poverty-stricken areas and the use of a monotonous color palette. The film uses atmosphere very well to create a mood, but it doesn't emphasize atmosphere over plot. It's a family-drama that also operates as a mystery/suspense film. While I found the atmosphere created by director Debra Granik spellbinding, the plot is very suspenseful and very thrilling.<br /><br />There is one thing that I feel really elevates the greatness of this film that I've deliberately avoided mentioning and that is the revelatory performance by John Hawkes. I'm familiar Hawkes from several movies and television shows, but not until Winter's Bone did I realize the extent of this man's ability. I've read reviews where people will remark that they didn't even recognize an actor until the credits rolled, but I've never personally experienced that until seeing this film. Hawkes proves he's a chameleon and an actor capable of giving a dynamite performance. While this performance hasn't gone completely unnoticed by critics and audiences, it's been widely overshadowed by Jennifer Lawrence.  Hawkes not only brings a great amount of energy to the screen every time he's on it but he takes this character from despicable to ultimately likable. The scene between Teardrop and Sheriff Baskin is one of the most intense scenes of any film from 2010. It is this scene that summarizes why I think Hawkes should win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It's such an intense, captivating performance. When Teardrops asks the Sheriff "Is this gonna be our time?" It's a mesmerizing moment. Teardrop is a great role as written, but Hawkes brings something so powerful to it. It is Hawkes that made the biggest impression on me. While Lawrence is deserving of the overwhelming recognition she's received, I wouldn't call her performance a revelation. John Hawkes is simply that good.<br /><br />Winter's Bone is an exciting, suspenseful, and enlightening piece of filmmaking that has the capability to please even the most casual film-goer. Some of the most riveting cinematic moments of 2010 occur in this film. Despite the hype, Winter's Bone is not over-hyped...It's simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking, one of the best films of 2010, and it has my vote for the best supporting male performance of that year as well. This film is definitely worth your time.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in an impoverished and very rural part of the Missouri Ozarks. She has to look after her crazy-sick mother and two younger siblings; her father Jessup has vanished. We learn quickly that Jessup cooked crystal meth - the major means of support for many of the families in this area - and that he had been caught a couple of weeks previously, and put up his house and property for bond. Now he's disappeared, and the house and land will be taken away from the family if he can't be found, so it's up to Ree to find him. Unfortunately, even though nearly all of the exhausted, depressed and sullen people she comes across in her odyssey through the gloomy, blighted yet beautiful landscape of rocky hills and scrubby forests are related to her, very few of them are willing to give her so much as the time of day. Suspicious of the law, they're unwilling to even help one of their own stave off homelessness - and some of them are more than willing to show her what comes of asking too many questions.<br /><br />This is a really powerful and stark, unsentimental look at the underbelly of American rural life. Most of the characters here are really unpleasant, even downright hateful, prone to quick violence and selfish and paranoid in the extreme - at least, on the surface. One of the most brilliant facets of this excellent film, cowritten and directed by Debra Granik, is that it slowly reveals a modicum of humanity in most of these gruff exteriors - and also shows that for all of Ree's bearing as someone who stays away from drugs herself and is trying to keep her family going, she's just as much a part of this tragic and beat-down culture as the rest of them. It's sad but not surprising for example that she never even THINKS to go to any authorities to help find her father - even once she starts to suspect that he's been killed, and knows who the killers are likely to be. Even when she's been beaten half to death, she relies only on herself and, eventually, her uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes), a frightening and clearly very violent man who nevertheless has a streak of decency as regards his own family, and a pride in helping out those who need it.<br /><br />Hawkes is getting a lot of justifiable praise for his performance, which should end up winning plenty of Supporting Actor awards as the year goes on, but the 19-year-old Lawrence does just as good a job in a much less show-offy role, always convincing as a determined and still vaguely hopeful young woman just on the cusp of learning that life isn't going to be good for her if she stays here. All of the women and men we see who are significantly older than her seem prematurely aged - Teardrop looks close to 60 but is probably supposed to be in his early 40s, and the women look even more haggard and abused. And yet there's never any question that Ree is going to leave her family behind; even when she goes to an Army recruiter, we know that she's only going because she doesn't really know how it works, a naivete that she'll soon lose, along with, most likely, her hope and dreams.<br /><br />Shot digitally but hauntingly beautiful and never feeling "cheap" despite it's obvious low budget, this is a film that respects the people and the landscape even if it's frustrated with them, and saddened. I expect this will be in my year-end top 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>"Winter's Bone" is a compelling and emotional viewing experience. Set in the rural Ozarks in southwestern Missouri, the story centers around 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence in an amazing performance)who struggles to keep her family afloat in desperate circumstances. Ree's father Jessup is on the run from the law, having skipped bond, and has left Ree to care for her mentally ill mother as well as a younger brother and sister who are too young to fend for themselves. This is the least of Ree's problems however. The family home has been placed as collateral for Jessup's bond and if he does not turn up for the court appearance, Ree will lose everything.<br /><br />Driven to desperation, Ree decides to risk her own safety and track her father down (she calls it "hunting" in the movie). This proves to be a great challenge, and most of the movie actually focuses on Ree's attempts to get her neighbors and kin to reveal her father's whereabouts. This includes a taciturn uncle with a cruel streak, Teardrop (John Hawkes in a haunting performance). The fact that Ree's father was a "cooker" who cooked meth, and that this appears to be an important means of making money for the community which is portrayed in this film, makes things even more dangerous. There appears to be some sort of code of silence surrounding Jessup's whereabouts and fate, and the harder Ree pushes, the more walls she comes up against. The impenetrable veil of silence attests to the strong bonds within the community even when one of their own may lose everything.<br /><br />The movie is a harsh coming-of-age tale as the main character Ree plods through life with stoic determination, refusing to yield even when the situation appears hopeless. Jennifer Lawrence portrays her role with a high level of credibility, with her haunted eyes, and grim appearance. This is a difficult movie to sit through - there is hardly any light-hearted moments, even the scenes of Ree's younger siblings playing around some hay bales is portrayed in grayish and bleak hues. The effect of meth on some of the inhabitants in this region is shown through the gaunt appearances and the undertones of tension and barely suppressed anger/violence.<br /><br />The cinematography is achingly beautiful, so at odds with the grim portrayal of life in these parts. The music is amazing, and perfectly captures the spirit of a paradoxical community - one which sticks close together yet can also turn on each other. "Winter's Bones" is a beautifully-filmed, and credibly acted drama that illuminates one young girl's journey towards closure and hope.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Ree has enough to deal with, even before she finds out her house is due to be taken away. She's just seventeen, and stuck running the household, with two younger siblings to feed and a catatonic mother to care for.  "Don't never ask for nothing what ought to be offered" is the motto of this resourceful and proud young woman.  She does a good job, given meager resources - but her father's been away a long time, out on bail for cooking crystal meth, and he put up the house and the land as collateral.  The only thing for it is to find him, and nobody wants to help, and she comes to see that knowing can be dangerous.<br /><br />For a small-scale, low-budget, independent feature, the film looks great: the desolate beauty of the landscapes, the delicate montages of the two innocent and largely unaware siblings engaged in resourceful play, the authentic settings, and the seasonal lighting.  The film as a whole is richly imagined, with strong performances and an unsettling mood.  The story is strong, managing to convey without exposition or voiceover the tension that exists in this region between a rich folk tradition and a stark economic necessity that has driven many of the locals to support themselves through the illegal drug trade, and the tension between familial loyalty and the need for self-preservation.  At times it felt like perhaps the screenplay undercut the realism - it aimed so deliberately at economy of exposition that the characters become something like vernacular poets, implausibly tending to convey a wealth of details with a minimum of words, rather than just being reticent  Still, the sense of mystery that drives Ree's exploration is sustained throughout, and kept me on the edge of my seat and caring throughout.  This isn't a masterpiece, but is solid storytelling that creates the right atmosphere, and makes the most of limited resources.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence immersed herself thoroughly in character as Ree, and her uncle "Teardrop" was brilliantly played by Tom Hawkes, who always seemed more vulnerable in other roles I've seen him in, such as Deadwood, but he's fierce here, and convinced me as someone you wouldn't want to mess with.  What I found perhaps most fascinating was the characterization of some of the other women in the story, who serve as gatekeepers to the clan leader, Floyd.  They seemed at first heartlessly vicious, but it struck me later they didn't like to be violent and saw their brutality as a kind of kindness, intended to protect.  A powerful film, that stands up well to similarly powerful films about surprisingly strong individuals facing impossible circumstances in the midst of destitution, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027EU2S2">Trouble the Water</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R4T3K">Undertow</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>The plot is fairly simple. Ree Holly (Jennifer Lawrence) is at home taking care of her mother, who takes happy pills and is menatlly out of it. She also cares for her two siblings. She is 17. She goes to school and chops wood too. Clarence Carter's "Patches" lived in a dream world compared to her. Her father is missing and it appears he will miss bail. The family farm has been put up for bond. Ree searches for her father, who made and sold Meth.<br /><br />The movie is shot on location in Southern Missouri, Jesse James country. It captures impoverished rural America. The accents are remarkably well done and not overdone like so many films. Jennifer Lawrence gives us an Academy Award performance. The movie also captures the independent spirit of the people, their general disdain of law enforcement, and their willingness to help each other in a time of crisis, in spite of a certain code of silence.<br /><br />Like many small isolated communities, most folk are somehow kin. Ree uses the kin card to elicit help. Her uncle, who refused to help her, eventually does so after Ree displays bravery and persistence. Remarkable performances by the entire cast, including the child actors. There are no super heroes walking tall or high action scenes. It is realistic, which translates into scenes some might consider boring, although I personally found them interesting as we worked with Ree to unravel a simple mystery, one which everyone seems to know the answer, but no one is telling.<br /><br />There is no sex or nudity, but it does show people with a meth spoon up their nose.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Winter's Bone, an adaptation of Daniel Woodrell's 2006 novel of the same name, is about the ravages of meth in rural communities of America. Although this is a very depressing subject, ultimately this is a movie about hope and strength, a story of a kid's transformation from a girl to a woman, when she has to fend for her siblings as their father abandons them. This is a good story and has been directed well but after a few days after having seen the movie, the performance of the lead Jennifer Lawrence lingers forever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IY9M330NKBW6.html">A2IY9M330NKBW6</a><br/><p>This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen and it isn't even a horror movie. It's set in Missouri near the Ozarks and it deals with a teenaged girl who has to track down her dad. He's due in court on drug charges. He used their house as collateral on his bond. If he doesn't show, sis, her younger brother and sister and vegetablized mom are out on the street (or in the woods as it applies here). So she sets out to find his old haunts, friends and family (very little difference there) so she can track him down.<br /><br />This is a powerful film. And it's lean. No fancy sets or special effects. It's all writing and acting. Jennifer Lawrence plays the lead. She's a nice girl, but she's street smart, tough and nobody's fool. She confronts all manner of people unflinchingly to get the answers she needs. John Hawkes is one of her dad's cousins who knows the kind of trouble she's getting into but helps anyway. Garrett Dillahunt plays the local cop who really screws things up. These are just a few of a really fine cast that infuse nearly every scene with a sense of menace.<br /><br />They bring the "everyone's related, trailer trash" thing to the fore and do not even attempt to make it politically correct. These are dirty, nasty, drug making, drug selling, drug using, mean spirited people who are no strangers to death and killing. Most of the people she talks to are related to her to some degree or another but would kill her if they had to.<br /><br />Most of it takes place outdoors, during the winter, or in these nasty shacks. That alone puts the viewer on edge. Add to that all the other assorted foulness and this becomes a very scary movie.<br /><br />I love these kinds of movies because they remind me of how much can be done in film with so very little. The right script, actors and director and you have a gem like this. Try putting this on next Halloween instead of your favorite horror movie and see how well you sleep that night.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Winter's Bone," adapted from the novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a stark, raw, and gritty masterpiece of storytelling, a thoroughly absorbing detective story that goes above and beyond the reliable conventions of mystery solving. It's a quiet, harsh, and unflinching societal drama set deep within the Ozarks, a world of cold forest lands, small houses that look slopped together from spare parts, cars perpetually hoisted on cinderblocks, and distrustful mountainfolk who all seem to be related to some degree. In these desolate backlands, we find seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), who has taken her mother's place as a homemaker for her younger brother and sister. Her mother is still there, but only in body; her mind is somewhere off the beaten path, having strayed after an emotional trauma she could never come to terms with.<br /><br />Ree's father, Jessup, was arrested for cooking meth, which seems to be what most people do around these parts. Why? It certainly can't be for the money, considering the abject poverty in which some of them live. Whatever the case, Ree learns from the local sheriff that her father skipped bail and has gone missing. Worse yet, he put his own house up as a way to meet his bond, apparently having no other assets at his disposal. He now has one week to turn himself in. If he doesn't, Ree and her family will be thrown out of the house. Ree, with remarkable understated determination, vows that she will find him. Thus begins a door-to-door manhunt, Ree visiting the homes of Jessup's known associates. It's a journey that will prove more dangerous than it may first seem; these people are just as wary of their own kind as they are of outsiders, perhaps even more so. Family means nothing. It's all about survival.<br /><br />Ree definitely knows how to survive. She does the best she can with her siblings - feeding them, clothing them, educating them, showing them how to hunt and prepare food with what little she has to work with, including welfare and the occasional helping hand from neighbors. She keeps them as happy as she can, and indeed, they seem unaware of how disadvantaged they truly are. If they are aware of it, then they don't seem all that bothered by it, not as long as they have Ree to keep them in line. So selfless is this young woman that one can't help but wonder where she learned it from. Certainly not from her mother, who can do little more than stare vacantly into the distance, thinking whatever she thinks. I guess some of us are naturally inclined to be self sufficient. Maybe we need more people like her in our lives, if not for friendship, then just for the satisfaction of aspiring to be like her.<br /><br />As she journeys forward, she crosses paths with her uncle, Teardrop (John Hawkes), a meth dealer who may or may not have something to do with Jessup's disappearance. He's intimidating and mysterious, distrustful and bitter, scarred and hopeless - simultaneously Ree's greatest obstacle and greatest ally in getting to the bottom of things. Hawkes, in the tradition of great actors like Al Pacino and Marlon Brando and even contemporary figures like Johnny Depp and Viggo Mortensen, completely disappears into his role, turning out a flawless balancing act between fearsome and forlorn. Teardrop is a hardened man who I seriously doubt has ever been happy, or at the very least, contented; the words themselves may be foreign concepts to him. Watching him as he progresses with Ree, I was torn between being frightened of him and feeling very sorry.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence, at just nineteen years old, gives one of the year's best performances, and I would be greatly disappointed if she weren't recognized with an Oscar nomination. The determination she brings to her character shows not the slightest trace of conventional Hollywood heroism; she doesn't make herself into a larger-than-life caricature of the strong willed young woman, someone who will sermonize endlessly and make a spectacle of herself. She's an ordinary person in an extraordinary situation. She does what she does not to prove a point, but merely because she has no other choice. Rarely do you see films with characters so convincing, so engaging, so in command of dialogue and emotion.<br /><br />The film's pacing is superb. The final thirty minutes alone build the kind of suspense that would rival even the best of Alfred Hitchcock's films, Ree's journey having taken a violent turn. It all builds up to a late night boat ride through a swamp, and while I won't reveal what happens, I will say that the scene is frightening in a way that most horror movies could only hope to be. That it's so terrifying is a testament to Anne Rosellini and Debra Granik (the director), who wrote the screenplay in such a way that we can actually feel something for the characters. Without that emotional connection, there would be little for the audience to react to; the film would be a sequence of events, and nothing more. "Winter's Bone" is a bleak, absorbing, resonant, tightly wound treasure of a film, one of the best I've seen this year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This year's winner for the coveted Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival was a little indie called WINTER'S BONE. It finally made it to Cherrydale Cinemas this week, and I have to say that all of the hype surrounding this film is justified. It is one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />It concerns a young girl, Ree Dolly, who lives deep within the Ozark Mountains. Day after day, she single-handedly takes care of her younger brother and sister, as well as her ill mother. On many occasions, she has to hunt for food in order to be able to feed her family. Ever so often, the neighbors help by giving the family leftovers from the night before. It is clear that this family is struggling, and that Ree is doing all that she can to provide.<br /><br />When the sheriff shows up at her doorstep and informs her that her father, a fugitive and a crystal meth dealer, has put her house up for bail bond, she has to race against all odds to find him. Everything is at stake, and so Ree sets out on a dangerous journey in order to save her family. From the time that Ree begins her journey into darkness until the shocking finale, we are driven to the edge of our seats. Not once will you take your eyes off of the screen. There are times when you want to look away, but you can't and you won't.<br /><br />The strength of this film lies in its authenticity. Most of the time, you feels as if you are watching a documentary feature, peering into the lives of these people. Everything from the performances, to the setting, to the minimalist score provides an eerie realism to the final product.<br /><br />Newcomer Jennifer Lawrence plays the part of Ree Dolly, and I should tell you that this performance is going to make her a star, possibly earn her a few nominations at awards ceremonies. She shows a confidence that many actresses lack these days. I'd put her in the same category as Ellen Page. It's a magical thing when the audience forgets that they are simply watching a performance. Ree becomes real to us because of Jennifer Lawrence's abilities as an actress.<br /><br />The same has to be said for the rest of the cast. I'm not sure how many of the actors had any experience prior to making this film, but they all shine in their respective roles. The direction from Debra Granik is simple and to the point. That's not to say that it lacks elegance, it only adds to the neo-realist vibe that the film sends out. The score is minimal, yet haunting. The cinematography is breathtaking. The cast and crew take us places that we have never been before to tell us a story that we will never forget.<br /><br />The film was adapted from the novel of the same name by Daniel Woodrell.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Young Jennifer Lawrence (Ree Dolly) is so effective in this movie as she was in a little seen movie from 2009 called "The Burning Plain" staring Kim Basinger. "Winter's Bone"  is set in poor rural Missouri which is even more bleak than the setting in "Burning Plain". Ree at 17 heads a family consisting of siblings of 12 and 7, a mother who is mentally ill and jail prone dad who's disappeared. He must show up for trial in a week or the family will forfeit the family home and property. Hell, it must only be worth $100 and that's if you set fire to everything. In any case, it's all they have. Ree sets out on foot (can't afford a vehicle) through the rural countryside to find clues about her dad's whereabouts. He's a meth cook and distributor but it's clear he got in trouble with the bad guys when he blabbered while in custody. Ree is determined to find him or his remains so the bond can be lifted and they can return to their life of eating dirt. It's unsettling to watch, but I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.<br /><br />I saw this film when it first opened and mentally nominated Jennifer Lawrence for an Oscar for her strong performance as Ree, the reluctant matriarch of a poor family in the Ozarks of southern Missouri.  John Hawkes was rightfully nominated for an Oscar for his role of Teardrop, Ree's uncle. The rest of the cast is equally brilliant especially Dale Dickey as Merab, the wife of the county drug lord. Old favorite Sheryl Lee shows up in a small but terrific performance as the ex-girlfriend of Ree's dad. The film is bleak, dour and depressing but gives an unflinching look at life among hardscrabble mountain folk. A superb second outing for director Debra Granik who also co-wrote the script.</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>This one is gritty realism at its grittiest.<br /><br />A 17 year old girl in rural (REALLY rural) Missouri is taking care of her younger brother and sister, and her mother, who is mysteriously incapacitated and never speaks a word.

Unfortunately for Ree, her two kid siblings and her catatonic Ma, Dad put up the family shack and land for his bond. If he doesn't show, they lose what little they have. Set in the Missouri Ozarks, the film depicts the harsh living and harsher culture of the hill people who inhabit that part of the world. Men are vicious, women are horny-tough, kids grow up with no options but cooking meth, and the law exists only to the degree that the locals allow it to. To find her Dada and save the family home, Ree has to run counter to every unwritten, yet iron-clad, rule and assumption. The sense of risk, menace and distrust is palpable in every scene. Even family and neighbors can be counted on just so much for support.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence, as Ree, is a standout. Whether facing down the local sheriff or tenderly showing her brother and sister how to skin a squirrel, she is real and affecting. And John Hawkes, as Ree's rough-hewn uncle, strikes the perfect balance between wanting to help his nice and needing to heed the rule of the hills to save his own neck.<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is just about perfect, as a film, but not a movie to see if you need an emotional lift.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>You've got to like the gritty, red-neck bumpkin dialogue in this movie, and the dirt poor landscapes of rusted-out cars and junk spewed across the yards.

And what do those diverse places share? Drugs! Pot-growing, methamphetamine cooking, crack and crank, drug selling, attended with desperation and violence. Drug addiction is not just a big city problem, and in fact it's not a problem limited to the outcasts, misfits, deadbeats, and indocumentados. There are plenty of big shot and fat cat users whose buying power fuels the gang wars of Mexico and funds the Taliban. And the 'moral turpitude' of the narcotics business isn't any more characteristic of liberals than of reactionaries, Blue States than Red, atheists than fundamentalists. In fact, statistics suggest that the fastest growing drug problem in the USA is meth addiction in socially conservative small towns in parts of the country that are supposed to be apple-pie wholesome and old-fashioned in values, towns where your image of the American Dream would include a white steepled church.<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is about an impoverished 'community' in the Missouri Ozarks, where all the men are up to their tailbones in drugs not only using them but 'cooking' them. Even those on the the "other team" -- the sheriff, the bail bondsmen, etc. -- in a sense depend on drugs indirectly, and exhibit the same angry out-for-themselves immorality. Jessup Dolly, a tough customer even by the standards of his hard-bitten hill-folk clan, has disappeared just a few days before his scheduled trial for drug production. The problem is that he posted bail using the title to his shabby house and the scrub forest lot around it. His seventeen-year-old daughter, Ree, is informed that if Jessup skips his court appointment, the family will be evicted from their home. Ree's mother is already suffering a psychotic withdrawal, and there are two younger children in Ree's care as well. Ree goes looking for her father, despite the warnings of her closest kin and neighbors that finding him will be mortally dangerous. Ree turns out to be determined, intrepid, tough -- a "Dolly bred and buttered" as she says. What she finds eventually is not pleasant.<br /><br />But "Winter's Bone" is not just about drug violence and a brave girl solving a mystery. Really it's more about concepts of loyalty, honor, and family cohesiveness. Nearly everyone in Ree's world is related to her by blood, and "blood" is supposed to be thicker than money or law. Ree learns that it isn't, and then again it is. "Honor" in her language means absolute solidarity against all outsiders. Ree's survival depends on the degree to which her neighbors are certain that she's "a girl who won't tell nothing to nobody."<br /><br />Actress Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree Dolly perfectly. John Hawkes is equally convincing as Jessup's fierce, scrawny older brother. Honestly, everyone in the cast of this film is "real" in his or her role. There's not a fleck of sentimentality or caricature in their performances. Good dialogue, good camera work, good editing produce a film that deserved the "Best Picture" award it won at the 2010 Sundance Festival.<br /><br />That's well and good, but my own 5-star enthusiasm for this film results from its realism as a fictional documentary of one portion of the America "we" live in. Some of the details of the film are gristly in the extreme, yet not implausible. Life does get ugly when lives are not so precious in themselves. This film doesn't exaggerate. The "Dollys" may not be average mainstream Americans but they are not disappearingly uncommon either. "Winter's Bone" is a gripping dramatic experience, but it's also a window into a painful sector of American society.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Winter's Bone" is a surprising dark thriller based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, self-described author of "country noir". The unlikely heroine is 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger brother and sister on their dilapidated property in the Ozarks, rural Missouri. She does her best to impart to her siblings the skills they will need to survive on this hardscrabble land with barely enough food to eat and no functional parents. If that weren't hardship enough, the Sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) informs Ree that her father Jessup, who makes crystal meth, used the family property to guarantee his bail bond...and then skipped bail. If Ree can't find Jessup before his court date, the family will lose its home. So she sets out to track him down and finds herself in a perilous position with no one willing to help.<br /><br />Debra Granik co-wrote this screenplay and directed the film, which was shot in just 24 1/2 days on location in Missouri. The environment is very much a character and a strong presence in every single shot, thanks to cinematographer Michael McDonough. At first I found the unrelenting destitution and hardness heavy-handed, but it seemed natural after a while. The fact that the film takes place primarily outdoors helps. The electrifying focal point is Ree as portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. She's a young woman with a quiet determination, tough, unsentimental, but somehow confident in her ability to succeed. This spark of optimism is a bit of youthful naivet&eacute; in an otherwise cynical character, but it brings the audience to her like lightning to a rod. Ree is something to hear. It's her voice -what she says, not what she does- that is absolutely captivating.<br /><br />The DVD (Lionsgate 2010): Bonus features include an Alternate Opening (1 ? min), 4 Deleted Scenes, music credits (text), a theatrical trailer (2 ? min), and a music video for "Hardscrabble Elegy: Composed and Performed by Dickon Hinchliffe" (3 min).

It's neither. It's more of a Missouri Ozarks odyssey, with almost a documentary feel to it, vaguely reminiscent of John Sayles' "Matewan." However, this film isn't about miners. It' about ordinary mountain people and their struggle to survive.<br /><br />It reveals the seldom-explored lives of these people. However, far from this rural town being a benign and gently humorous Mayberry, this film reveals life in such mountain settings as being often difficult, decimated, and brutalized by the role that drug-dealing has come to play among the inhabitants as a way of sustaining themselves.<br /><br />The central character in this story is a 17-year-old girl who circulates among the distanced people of this enclave, looking for her father whom she suspects has been driven into hiding as a result of his "cookin'" - meaning his cooking of crystal meth. Meth seems to have taken the place of the more amusing moonshine that used to characterize mountain entrepreneurship. There's an urgency to the girl's search. Unless her father shows up for his court hearing, his bond will be forfeit and the girl and her family will lose their house, the one thing that secures them in place.<br /><br />This film is beautifully photographed. I especially appreciated seeing the strong, unvarnished women's faces that it features. These faces, allowed to be present without the concealments and erasures of botox or blush, tell the story of the hardships these women have suffered. They are intrinsically beautiful faces.<br /><br />The main failing of this film is that its plot doesn't make much sense. Perhaps something got lost in translation from the acclaimed book to the screen. The violence in the movie seems to be dragged in out of left field. It's as if the producers feared that a mere representation of a girl's quest for her father would be too boring. So they threw in some sudden, unmotivated mob violence against her. Why would her neighbors turn on her that way? Is it that they feared she would tell the town sheriff about their own complicity in the drug trade? Is it that they feared she would somehow betray the fierce loyalties that bind the people in this area? Maybe, but these hardly seem like adequate explanations for their threatening descent on her, like the villagers' descent on Dr. Frankenstein's castle with torches.<br /><br />Then the girl's reaction to the vicissitudes of her odyssey is a constant blank impassivity. Jennifer Lawrence registers neither fear nor fondness. So her character's courage ends up looking more like simple indifference. I don't know if this is due to bad acting or bad directing.<br /><br />But these flaws end up being relatively minor detractions from what is overall a beautiful, absorbing drama about the persistence of a rural refuge that few outsiders would otherwise get to visit.<br /><br />One final reason to get this DVD is the thread of traditional bluegrass music that runs through it, making up its score. It's a rare treat to hear raw, honest voices intoning these time-honored tunes in our age of generally over-produced, over-amplified video extravaganzas. Here music literally is brought back to its roots as a homespun, intimate activity - back to where the singer and the song are one. The entire expanded score for the film is available as a separate CD/record.</p></br></body></html>

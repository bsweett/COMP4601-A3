Aeon lives in an apocalyptic setting, where the world has been decimated by a fatal virus and the 5 million survivors have been living for 400 years in an enclave called Bresna under the leadership of the Goodchild family that saved it.  But conflict emerges when members of the populace start strangely disappearing, and an underground resistance force known as Monicans emerges, in an attempt to assassinate the current leader of the Goodchild clan.  Aeon Flux gets the assignment to take out Goodchild, but in the process makes some startling discoveries that cause her to rethink which side she's on.<br /><br />The primary focus of the film is an action drama, with Aeon Flux and her fellow characters getting lots of camera time doing all kinds of cartwheels and handsprings in the modern setting that is their playground.  It's been said of the animated protagonist that she is "provocative, sexy, and acrobatic" - and that's exactly the way Aeon comes to life on the screen as well.  The film was pleasantly free of the crude humor or vulgar language that tends to be combined with this kind of character and action, but expect to see some sexual connotations (with a strong feminine character like Aeon, how can you not?), and lots of violence.  Although most of the victims are faceless, there were occasions where the blood and gore forced me to look away, and it's not surprising that the film got the PG-13 rating it did for this reason.  If the two main protagonists came across somewhat emotionless, they made up for it with the energy of their action and the destruction they cause, particularly Aeon's superhuman acrobatics.<br /><br />The action is backed by a relatively interesting, if not simple plot, which raises some interesting intellectual questions about contemporary ethical issues, cloning in particular.  In a world where the entire population has become infertile, Trevor Goodchild's quest is to find a way for normal pregnancies to happen, but his brother thinks that the status quo where the human race can only be perpetuated by cloning is a utopia that needs no change.  Perhaps nowhere is this better articulated than in the closing stages of the film, where the question is raised about whether a form of immortality achievable through cloning is superior than to a mortal life.  Aeon says: "We're meant to die. It's the only thing that makes things matter. ... To live once for real, and then give way to people who might do better. To live only once, but with hope."  The implication seems to be that even if human cloning were ever to be successful, it wouldn't make human life more valuable than it is at present, even with its mortality.<br /><br />This kind of dialogue seems to raise deep questions on an important contemporary issue, and even hints at a moral stand against cloning.  But in reality the film only scratches the surface of it, and never really addresses these serious questions except for raising them in a somewhat vague manner at the very end.  Not that it matters - in the end Aeon Flux is really about cool looking fight scenes and a futuristic spectacle with intense action sequences.  And in the process, like much other science fiction, it shows the illusion of a utopian dream, namely that even if cloning does hold the promise of utopia, it would still result in a world where humans are inherently flawed.  Cloning won't redeem humanity, and Aeon Flux won't redeem the genre of science fiction, but it's a fun ride.  While it lacks substance, but it's still reasonable entertainment.  - GODLY GADFLY</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Lots of people don't like this film, but I honestly liked it and thought it better than some other sci-fi movies (including Ultraviolet) Yes, this show is quite different from the TV show, but hey, I liked it, and also liked the story and the weird and cool sci-fi bits and special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>Charlize Theron stars in the live action adaption of the Aeon Flux animated series, which originally was on MTV. Here on Australia, the animated series was on really late on a station called SBS, so I've only caught a couple of episodes. It looked interesting, and I thought the adaption might be worth a look. Wasn't as good as I'd expected though.<br /><br />Set a few centuries forward into the future, most of mankind has been wiped out by viruses, and wild jungle has reclaimed the planet. The remainder of humanity resides in a city, heavily controlled and plagued, not by viruses, but by mysterious disappearances and memories that haunt the minds of its citizens in dreams. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is part of a resistance group, determined to have more freedom than they have. Aeon's own resistance becomes all the stronger when her sister is killed by the government. She sets out into the heart of the city, and stumbles on much more than she bargained for, including a lover she never knew she had.<br /><br />I must say I liked the look of the film, and the sets and such were probably what I liked best about the whole thing, a good combination of slick civilization and the lush green of the surrounding jungles and gardens. But looks aren't everything. Even though the film was a modest hour and a half, due to the straight faced dialogue and heavy seriousness over everything, it felt like much, much longer. Seemed to drag, despite the action there didn't seem to be a lot that actually happened. I can understand why the dialogue was the way it was, it adds to the unnatural atmosphere of the city, and it's similar to the way the dialogue is done in the animation, but a bit of humour and warm emotion would have been nice.<br /><br />Special features include two audio commentaries and five behind the scenes featurettes which include footage from the original MTV series. It was good to see the comparison between the film and the cartoon. In making the film, you can see that they have tried to recreate the feel of the film. On the other hand, it doesn't quite capture the more bizarre elements of the animation, which is what made the original series so unique, I reckon.<br /><br />As much as I like science-fiction, and as much as I liked the look of the film, I can't say I liked or recommend this film. Have a look at something else, the original Aeon Flux animated series, even.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>It's crazy because Aeon Flux is the first movie I've seen where the beginning feels like the end. When Aeon Flux was released I read reviews saying that if you've never seen the anime series that this is a hard movie not only to understand but also to sit through since you don't really know that much about it's past. This film feels like it's bringing closure to it's fans and all that says is that it's only for fans. Besides the fact that I attempted to watch this movie a little blind somehow it started to get a little boring and it wasn't because of the story. As much as I love Charlize she played this character too stiff. The rest of the cast was very weak especially Trevor (Marton Csokas) and I thought he would play the part pretty good.<br /><br />In the beginning they do their best to let newcomers know what's going on in the films past and present, they do a pretty good job informing and you're not all that in the dark. Aeon Flux's intelligence and cinematography actually start to exceed the actor's talents and it becomes a little hard for them to handle. The camera angles could have been a lot better, a lot of times your missing good fight scenes because the camera is somewhere else other than the action. Overall Aeon Flux could have been done better than this; it's missing a lot of key elements. The story is very appealing but this film missed the potential the live action movie should have. What really makes this movie a little good is the beautiful scenes of the future. The fight scenes were Ok but like I said earlier the camera angles killed them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The movie was a horrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters, squeezed all the depth and personality out of her, and pumped her full of Hollywood clich?s. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie.<br /><br />In the animated series:<br /><br />Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, untamable, and ambiguous all at once. The original Aeon had layers upon layers of depth. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking. You could never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist whereas Trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship.<br /><br />In the movie:<br /><br />Aeon Flux works for the Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tamable, emotional and very predictable. The Aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most. The plot was obvious and contrived. Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides.<br /><br /> The only reason why I'm giving this movie two star is because the visuals were incredible. It was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with CGI. Visually, stylistically, and with its energy and futuristic fantasy (and constantly under-dressed heroine). In that, it reminds me strongly of Fifth Element - another film where we feel as if we only get a glimpse of a futuristic, colorful world full of strangely dressed people, without the need to explain or expose every aspect of it. Again great actress, mediocore film.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>I have vague recollections about back in the day (the early to mid 1990s I believe) when Aeon Flux, created by Peter Chung, appeared on MTV as a segment within the series `Liquid Television'...while my memory's a bit fuzzy, two aspects about the Aeon Flux segments have stayed with me over the years, the first being how stylish they appeared and the second being how confusing they seemed...(perhaps had I seen all the episodes in their respective order it'd be different).  Fast forward some ten odd years later to the 2005 release of a live action adaptation written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, both of whom worked on The Tuxedo (2002), directed by Karyn Kusama (Girlfight), and starring Academy Award winner Charlize Theron (The Astronaut's Wife, Reindeer Games, Monster).  Also appearing is Marton Csokas (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, xXx), Jonny Lee Miller (Mindhunters), Sophie Okonedo (Hotel Rwanda), Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects), and Academy Award winner Frances McDormand (Darkman, Fargo)...I'm curious how much MTV, who produced the film, had to shell out for two Academy Award winning actresses to appear in this feature...<br /><br />As the film, set sometime in the 25th century, begins, we learn how a virus wiped out most of the world's population some four hundred years earlier before a scientist named Goodchild finally found a cure.  Now it seems the descendants of those who survived live in a walled city under the thumb of the Goodchild Dynasty, which has ruled since the catastrophic event.  As with any society there is a group of malcontents, known here as the Monicans, whose main goal appears to be in toppling the Goodchild regime...why?  As near as I can figure they're upset with the fact that it's not unusual for people to just up and disappear, never to be heard from again, something the Monicans think the gooberment is directly responsible for (and they'd be right)...anyway, in furthering their cause, the Monicans utilize secretive, highly deadly operatives, the most skilled being Aeon Flux (Theron).  After successfully completing her current assignment, she's given the one she's been waiting been waiting for, the elimination of Trevor Goodchild (Csokas), the current leader of the Goodchild regime.  While infiltrating the gooberment facility where Goodchild resides, things turn sour and Aeon begins to question those things she originally believed, which ends up leading to an unlikely alliance.  Turns out there is something seriously wrong with the population, the answers lying within a funky zeppelin known as the Relical, which continually circles above the city.  As a power struggle within the gooberment ensues, Aeon finds herself stuck in the middle as both the Establishment, who see her as a threat, and the Monicans, who see her as a traitor, want her dead, resulting in a struggle for survival that may ultimately decide the fate of mankind...<br /><br />Overall I thought this film entertaining, but it does have some flaws.  I thought the production values excellent especially in terms of the futuristic settings and such (the `stylish' element I spoke of earlier in terms of the original series seems to have made it into the film).  I also really liked all the nifty little high tech gadgets and implants utilized mainly by Theron's character, although I thought it interesting how, by the end, everyone fell back to using what appeared to be fairly standard projectile based weaponry (I guess some things never change).  As far as Theron herself, she displayed quite a bit of athleticism, some of which I'm sure was probably helped along by the special effects department, while looking fairly sweet in her numerous, skintight outfits (actually, with her Der Fuhrer-esque hairstyle and black clothing, she sort of came off as the ultimate Emo chick, but whatever).  I think the biggest issue I had with the film was the performances seemed somewhat flat, but I'm unsure if it was a result of the actors, the director, or the material (some of the cast is just plain wasted, like Frances McDormand...what was the deal with her character and that ridiculous red hair?).  Also, Theron didn't really come off as the ultimate assassin, at least when comparing her to the character presented in the original animated series, despite a good effort.  I learned quite a few things from this film including the following...<br /><br />1. Charlize Theron can catch flies with her eyelashes, which is kinda cool but also kinda gross.<br /><br />2. In the future the predominant hairstyle for men is the greasy bed head look.<br /><br />3. In the future secret messages are passed amongst people by French kissing.<br /><br />4. Charlize Theron can kill with her thighs (which wouldn't be too bad of a way to go, if you ask me).<br /><br />5. People in the future are stuck with really weird names like Oren, Una, Sithandra, and Aeon.<br /><br />6. In the future you can actually get your feet replaced with hands, which looks as creepy as it sounds.<br /><br />7. The Future is so Goth.<br /><br />8. In the future authorities are armed with highly advanced weaponry and have no problems using said weaponry to mow down innocent bystanders to get to two criminals.<br /><br />9. In the future when you get a phone call, your ears flash (no foolin').<br /><br />10. In the future when they say `keep off the grass' they ain't kidding.<br /><br />11. Despite a dumb hairdo Charlize Theron can still look hot, which isn't so much the case with Frances McDormand.<br /><br />12. Fluidic ball bearings can not only be trained to come on command but also to assemble in patterns and explode.<br /><br />13. Recycling is taken to a whole new level in the 25th century.<br /><br />14. Politicians in the future are just as skeevy and conniving as they are now.<br /><br />One aspect of the story that kind of bothered me was how the Monicans seemed to have a technological edge over the established gooberment.  They were able to infiltrate various facilities with relative ease (razor grass sounds like an effective security measure, that is until you get someone who comes along with platform shoes), keep things hidden on their person while in custody, and just generally outfox the authorities at nearly every turn.  The film does have lots of action, slick production values, a decent catfight, and I had little difficulty in following the story (what of it there was), but I couldn't say how closely this finished product resembled the original material.<br /><br />The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks very sharp and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital 5.1 surround and Dolby Surround 2.0 comes across well.  Extras include two feature length commentary tracks, one with star Charlize Theron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, the second with co-writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, five featurettes involving production of the movie, a theatrical trailer, a couple of previews, and English and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, it appears the animated series is available on DVD, so if you're interested in seeing from where the film originated, you might want to check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>I did'nt know anything about what this movie was about,<br /><br />except some bad reviews...i gave it a shot because its science<br /><br />fiction.

The few remaining survivors are all huddled into one city with walls protecting them from what ever is outside. It is an ideal city of Bregna ran by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) and a council. And as with any such city there will always be rebels that thinks something is wrong with lack of freedom and mysterious disappearances. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) belongs to such an organization. Her mission as the most ept agent is to dispatch the so called benevolent ruler. Can she do this or will circumstances and chance encounters change the situation?<br /><br />The film does not boast of any thing really extraordinary except maybe an exceptionally rich architectural back drop. Shot mostly in Berlin we see many popular places that for some reason they though would not be that familiar to the audience. Evidently they must not know how popular Berlin is, especially key locations. The original location on their wish list was Brasilia because of its 1050's futuristic look; however that proved to be economically unfeasible. See if you recognize Sans Souci, Potsdam built in 1745 by Frederick the Great, one of the world best know orangeries.<br /><br />Although this movie had nothing extraordinary it is a perfect example of the genre and will hold your attention as you anticipate where they are going with the story. Only someone that anticipates that it will stick to the animated series may be disappointed.<br /><br />The DVD rendering adds some background commentaries that make rewatching the film more enjoyable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013J55B6">Hancock (Two-Disc Unrated Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>It seems that every hot actress needs to star in at least one comic-book or sci-fi action flick to show of her athleticism, long legs, perfect tone and great figure.  Angelina Jolie had Tomb Raider, Halle Berry had Catwoman, Pamela Andersen had Barb Wire, and now Charlize Theron has Aeon Flux.  Fortunately, this one is actually very good.  Set in the distant future on an Earth decimated by a plague, Ms. Theron plays the title character, an assassin of incredible skill, beauty and ruthlessness.  The movie is about her latest mission, and how her discoveries on this mission change her and mankind.  This movie is based of a comic-book, which I have not read, so I have no comment on how faithful this film is to the original story.  However, I can say the movie is quite good, with great special effects, a plot that was original compared to other action flicks, and Ms. Theron was aptly displayed.  Overall, a very entertaining movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Aeon Flux is the 2005 film based on the early 90s animated shorts and late 90s half hour eps;and quite ride it is.I highly recommend the Aeon Flux animated collection also available,but do not try to compare the two.The movie(like any anime'to film property)is a palatable(dressed down)version of the animated series,with the action in the animated series much richer and heavier in content than its' movie counterpart.But that doesn't mean there's not alot to recommend here.<br />The story is set in the year 2011 and the  walled-in city Bregna,is host to earths' last surviving population.A plague 400 years ago left the survivors sterile and the Goodchild Research Foundation now runs the city with an iron hand.It is in turn run by its' name sake brothers Trevor(Marton Csokas,Borias from Xena) and Oren(John Miller).<br />But something strange is happening to many of the citys' citizens.Besides a myriad of daily disappearances,many of its' citizens who meet perfect strangers have inexplicable remnant memories of them;some good,some bad.<br />Our heroine Aeon Flux(Charlize Theron)is part of a rebel group called The Monacans who are fighting to end the Goodchild regime,by any means.Monacans are genetically and drug enhanced humans with superior strength and speed.They also can contact one another and/or their leader "The Handler"(Frances McDormand) psychically.Aeon is first given the job of sabotaging the security system which she accomplishes with little problem.On her way to meet her sister she sees her being carried out dead on a stretcher.Aeon wants and gets her revenge as her next assignment is to kill Trevor Goodchild.Making her way through many extremely difficult defences she manages to penetrate the Citadel where she finds Trevor rehearsing a speech.As she approaches him he turns,recognizes her and says the name of "Catherine".She also vaguely recognizes something in him but it is too late and her hesitation causes her to be caught.Not for long as she escapes and returns to meet with Trevor.They make love and after a brief sleep Aeon wakes up and chokes Trevor to near death.She leaves and realizes that her answer may lay in an object that circles the city in the sky called the"Relico".It is a flying ship supposedly built to remind the inhabitants of their sacrifices but she thinks there is more to it.She gets aboard and finds out the whereabouts of her sister and leaves.Trevor who has followed behind now knows what she was after and finds out even more information he didn't know of.He meets Aeon at the location of her sister to find that the sister is now a baby.Trevor reveals that she has been cloned;in fact everyone has been cloned over the past 400 years.He also says the real reason her sister was killed was that she was pregnant,naturally.Nature has found a cure on its own for the sterile plagued society and Trevors'brother Oren wants to keep the information from getting out,thus all the kidnappings,disappearances and deaths.Oren has also condemned Trevor to death as a traitor for sleeping with Aeon and both are now wanted fugitives.Aeon herself has also been handed a death sentence seperately by her own Monacan organization for not carrying out her mission.After a bloodied battle with Oren's forces who fight not only Trevor and Aeon but other Monacan snipers,the two barely escape with their lives.Aeon again climbs aboard the "Relico" and blows the ship up,sending it crashing into  a section of city wall and exposing the outside forested world to the startled inhabitants.The citizens now free of the Goodchild oppression can now start to live their lives anew.<br />The film is filled with spectacular stunts and CGI effects throughout and some sequences are amazing to watch.One especially delightful sequence is with a friend,the hand-footed Zathandra,as they attempt to cross the rolling grassy landscape towards the Citadel.With incredible jumps by the pair punctuated by deadly gourds with shooting syringes of poison and the grass,which becomes seemingly alive when a human presence is detected-going from blades of grass to razor sharp blades of steel.<br />It is certainly both an aural and visual feast to be sure.But the plot keeps you intrigued and interested,I found,throughout the picture with very few let ups.And more importantly this film is one you can watch over and over and still find something just a little different each time.<br />The picture here is top notch,crisp and clear all the way and with that wonderful sound available in D/Surround 5.1 or 2.0.<br />The special features abound:Commentary by Theron and producer Gale Hurd or by co-writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi,"Creating a World:Aeon Flux"(20 m),"Location of AF"(15m),"Stunts of AF"(9m),"Costume Design Workshop of AF"(13m),"Craft of the set Photographer"(3m) and trailers.<br />All in all this DVD is a worthy addition to anyone's movie library.It's a very engaging Sci-Fi concept brought to the big screen via its' animated roots and one you can watch again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>"Aeon Flux" is one of those rare films that gets universally negative reviews from critics who are normally used to 'epics' such as "Out of Africa" or "Terms of Endearment". It takes a different sort of mind to appreciate science fiction, because the genre is rare at giving us true classics. That said, if you liked David Lynchs' dark and disturbing film version of "Dune", then you will certainly find much to like in "Aeon Flux".<br /><br />The film runs like the fractured tale of a universe in peril, and one woman seems to hold the key and the balance between two insane realities. Charlize Theron really brings it as the lead character, and they really prop her well with the choicest special effects and the most liberal use of CGI, though in an appropriate manner. Theron has always been a good actress, but her stiff, warrior-like role here will win over the most jaded of science fiction fans, simply because there is no comparison (Milla Jovovich in "Ultraviolet" comes close, but that was more pop-art than dystopian art).<br /><br />The storyline is bleak, yet hopeful, and the multiple realities really make the film work even in areas where the script might sometimes let it down. There are issues with it, yes, but I think that it only works in making the film truly a work of art, because unlike other films in the genre, it doesn't cheapen science fiction, but rather glorifies it as a true vision of the future, much like the classic SF novels of the 1960s (remember Roger Zelazny?)<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" deserves five stars, and a really good projection system, because the visuals in this movie are just so clear, stunning and memorable, and this is one movie you can watch again and again - which in my book is the hallmark of a true classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>MTV's Aeon Flux (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8I9XQ">Aeon Flux - The Complete Animated Collection</a>) was interesting and appealing when it first aired.

But, none of the elements came together as they should have. Something was defiantely missing, such as a better and a little more ruthless Goodchild and a little colder Flux.

Charlize Theron slips into skin tight leather as the acrobatic heroine/assassin on a mission to overthrow an oppressive regime, I think.  The story of the film takes a back seat to the visuals and to Theron who sleepwalks her way throughout the film's running time, but you'd hardly notice because she looks so damned good.  The action and special effects are nicely done, but the film's incoherent storyline, wasted cast (Frances McDormand and Johnny Lee Miller are wasted beyond belief), and otherwise surprisingly tepid direction from Girlfight director Karyn Kusama make Aeon Flux a film that's strictly for fans of modern, empty sci-fi; and even fans of the anime series that it hardly resembles may find it hard to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VLX5Z090RQ0V.html">A3VLX5Z090RQ0V</a><br/><p>...and I'm saying that as a positive thing, not a literal meaning to the term.<br /><br />- REVIEW<br /><br />Hey, you!

My thoughts haven't changed, but within 700 words, my thoughts will render how this 1-star predicted disaster convert into a shocking 3-star entertaining romp.<br /><br />With 1-star on my mind, I have to grasp into the story, which is about as comprehensible as Dubya Bush making his speech.  In about 7 years from now, 99% of the Earth's pop is dead from a virus...possibly from the avian flu.  Those that survived are on scientific notice, and one Trevor Goodchild conducted a cure that will purity the remains...sort of.  All I know is that 400 years into the future, one 'psychedechnical' (Psychedelic meets Technical) city holds the survivors under control of the Goodchild regime, runned by the same guy who cured them 400 years ago (???).  But the rebels against the regime's reign continues to weaking his power, though the territorial rebels are destroying for the good, as the regime are really hostile that often kills certain civilians that might corrupt the nation's premise.  In other words: Government = bad; "bad guys" = good.  Only one Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), a high-ranked fighter of the rebels, has the strength to take down something as confusing as the regime.<br /><br />So, Ms. Theron here fights the government wearing clothes that ranges from "Awful" to "Not awful like the last one", although I doubt Theron would degrade herself to wear the old revealing get-up the original femme fatale wore on the animated show.<br /><br />Anyway, the "future" remains uncertain, and by uncertain, I mean I have no idea how anything I see in this film work.  How did Aeon's weapons work, how do the futuristic security system function, how is swallowing some pill got Aeon get in touch with the leader of the rebels from her mind, and what are the foods these people are eating?  It seems as though the movie just goes into the future setting without any hint of social explanation.  At least the producers kept the atmosphere in spirit of the original series, along with its intended characters and premise.  And as long as you can tolerate some of the actors goofy one-liners, the characters act well, and Theron is a good Aeon, which is why the star went up a pound.<br /><br />Another pick-er-upper is the fact that the movie has layers, albeit layers done very sloppy.  As Aeon confrots Trevor to assassinate in a vengeful manner, as she should, a revelation occurs when love and secluded past memories affected her way of thinking.  Neither had killed each other, which resulted in a backlash between the regime and rebels.  That's when the good part sets in, as many mysteries of the film (but not all) have been revealved that deals with the past, the search for a cure, and cloning.  Now, she and Trevor alone are on their own mission to find a solution to the nation's problem, while getting away from the regime who not only considered them as fugitives, but so has the rebels who now wants to kill Aeon.<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" is not so bad, I was really surprised.  The abrupt and incohesive premise should've been dealt with more "flux"-iblilty, but the fact remains: it's not boring, it had some cool action scenes, and it had a solid story as it progresses.  As long as you don't think of this as Theron's big hit like "Monster" or "North Country", this film will give you a decent time.<br /><br />This is Del Keyes, saying "At least it's better than that Tomb Raider film."</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>The Amazon.com review calls this a movie about  "a female James Bond for the cyberpunk era."<br /><br />I've seen more humanity expressed in the the robots/cyborgs from Lost in Space, The Hitchhiker's Guide, and Bladerunner.  In Aeon Flux, the emotive level reaches, say, the level of I, Robot, starring Will Smith.<br /><br />In other words, a turnip.<br /><br />Okay, I can appreciate the energy in the stunts, which really is the central part of this movie.  The story, in theory, is interesting ("400 years in the future, after a virus decimates the world population, only one city on Earth remains").  In "reality," with one walled city, where does all of the food come from?  The concrete?  The energy?  The steel?  Technology is a bit more more complex than just putting up a wall and having everything you need.<br /><br />The twists in the plot are such that I really had to watch it again a few days later.  Who knew who and how?  What has been happening for 400 years?  How come the secret is known to such a select few?  Why doesn't the populace question the killings and disappearances?<br /><br />This is a movie to watch for the action.  You won't find any Tomb Raider dialogue here, or James Bond dalliances.<br /><br />With that proviso, enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Being a science fiction fan, I was really hoping for more from this movie.  I was aware of the cartoon, but I had never seen it before watching this film.  The film is certainly manga influenced, which may turn a lot of people off.  Despite a really good cast, the acting is flat for the most part.  The technology is stylish, but impractical for the most part.  Good for a cartoon or comic, but it comes off poorly in a live action movie.  The story is a pretty straightforward tale with a minor twist that I saw coming.  I would say this is for only the die hard fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>In the future, a lethal disease kills off 99% of the population and what's left of humanity is gathered in the cloistered city of Bregna. Hundreds of years later, Bregna has become a "perfect" and sanitized Eden, run by an authoritarian regime. But, of course, every paradise has its infestation and the same is true here. There's something not quite right with the citizens of Bregna; they are plagued with troubling dreams and are gripped with a feeling of unsettledness. Enter Aeon Flux, the most capable and lethal agent of the resistance group aiming to overthrow the government. She is sent to assassinate Trevor Goodchild, the current leader of the ruling establishment. But the seemingly straightforward mission quickly goes awry and Aeon finds herself immersed in an insidious conspiracy centuries old, of which scope threatens to undermine the very bedrock of Bregna's ideal society.<br /><br />So we're back in that old "been here, done that" standby of the Utopian world with a fatal flaw. And yet, Aeon Flux is better than I thought it would be. Admittedly, I didn't know what to expect going into this one. I'd seen (and liked, in a bemused sort of way) some of the weird MTV Aeon Flux cartoons of the 1990s, and those shows struck me at the time as being non-linear, bizarre and angular in animation. For one thing, every single episode I saw had our sexy assassin dying. So I was curious to see how the live action film would be interpreted. I gotta admit, I was sold with the very cool opening scene of Aeon's eyelashes Venus-flytrapping a fly.<br /><br />The overall impression I have of the movie is one of aesthetic sleekness. It's visually arresting, with a semi arty-farty approach that recalls to mind The Fifth Element, in terms of its overall design and look. I like the way the filmmakers integrated nature with the futuristic sci-fi elements (Aeon and Sithandra evading literal "blades" of grass and tree pods shooting out deadly slivers; Big Brother implementing water in the use of surveillance technology). The special effects are astounding and original looking and alone make the film worth screening. I both liked and got creeped out by Sithandra's four handlike appendages.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot is nothing new. And being nothing new, it  commits the unforgivable sin of being dull. The action scenes are fairly trite but are beautifully executed, thanks in large part to the beauty, grace and athleticism of the lead star. She certainly is a credit to the recent slew of butt-kicking females coming out in our media (Buffy, Elektra, Lara Croft, Resident Evil's Alice). Charlize worked out for about 4 months and performs 95% of her own stunts, and that contributes to the film's integral credibility. It's also heartening to witness three females handling the brunt of the action here. The acting...is okay. No one sucks, no one stands out. Because the nature of her internalized character calls for it, Charlize has to come from a minimalist standpoint, acting-wise; her expressive, luminous eyes instead do a lot of emoting. I believe Charlize also is pretty close with her tonal mimicry of Denise Poirier, the voice of the animated Aeon Flux. However, the great Frances Mcdormand is totally wasted in her role as the rebel handler.<br /><br />Special features are comprised of:  2 commentaries (one by the screenwriters, the other by Charlize Theron and producer Gale Anne Hurd); "Creating A World: Aeon Flux", the obligatory "making of" documentary, which includes input from creator Peter Chung; a segment on the various locations wherein the film was shot; a stunts documentary breaking down the workout regimen of Charlize and the two other action-oriented actresses; "Craft of the Set Photographer", which details the still photographer's job and tools of the trade; and the movie trailer.<br /><br />It's too bad the box office result doesn't seem to warrant a sequel. Aeon Flux has flaws, but Charlize Theron proves to me that she has that certain heroine quality and certainly the physicality to have Aeon Flux become a franchise of Paramount Pictures. Great Godfrey, the sight of Charlize Theron in her futuristic scanties is almost worth the price of the dvd alone.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>If you're suspicious of a shoot-em-up SF action flick by a female director, don't be. This one is as fast and as furious as any other around. And it's better looking than most, and it makes better use of the female leads.<br /><br />There's some kind of a plot to this movie, if you pay attention to such things: some far future place, the last enclave of mankind. A terrible plague nearly wiped out humanity, and an equally terrible cure nearly finished the job by sterilizing the survivors. Society sustains itself by recycling DNA - cloning people, and maintaining the population by replacement as the old copies die. There may, however, be a cure for the cure, a way to reverse the sterility and restart the genetic Mixmaster. A power struggle ensues, with the tyrants who like being themselves again and again trying to quash the discovery.<br /><br />Enter Aeon, codename for the super-assassin-babe (Charlize Theron). She'll take out an armed and armored platoon bare handed and never muss a single spike of her sabertooth bangs. That's about it, really, lots of running around and go-boom, with pretty women. Pretty women with their clothes on, if it matters to you. One thing that sets it apart from others in its class, like The 'Matrix', is the pace of action. Where 'The Matrix' alternated set-piece action sequences and breathing space, this one sustains the energy level better. Maybe it doesn't peak as high, but it keeps a thundering pace. And, according to the extras, Theron and the other leads did nearly all their own stunts. If there's one thing cooler than a hot babe, it's a hot babe who can do stuff.<br /><br />The locations deserve special mention. They're convincingly futuristic, which makes a pretty disappointing statement about our sense of the future. All those high tech, way cool pieces of architecture actually exist and have mundane use: an animal shelter, an urban water supply, a crematorium, or a wind tunnel dating back half a hundred years. The coolest location, the one I was sure had to be sound-stage carpentry, was an 18th century church. What can I say? The future just isn't what it used to be.<br /><br />It has great action, a great look, and great female leads. If you have a fourteen year old boy anywhere in your spirit, let it see this movie. (And no, you don't have to be male to have a fourteen year old boy somewhere inside.)<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>400 years from now, 99% of the world's population has been wiped out by a virus.  Those remaining are living in a walled city and led by the Goodchild regime.  Five million people survived the plague in 2001, and five million still live in 2415.  The Goodchild regime is a totalitarian government, and the Monicans are focused on removing him from power by any means necessary.  The most dangerous Monican, Aeon Flux (Theron) accepts a specific mission from the Handler (McDormand) to kill Trevor Goodchild (Csokas).  With the help of her sidekick, Sithandra (Okonedo), she ventures into his fortress.  When the time comes to pull the trigger, something happens that will change their world forever.<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" is the film version of some short cartoons aired on MTV in the 1990's, and is a mixed bag, sometimes working and sometimes not -- mostly not.  There are a lot of nods to the cartoon, and they seem kind of silly when not in cartoon form.  Theron is wrong for the role, and never really feels right to this fan of the cartoon.  The story is moderately interested, but poorly executed for the most part.  "Aeon Flux" was a disappointment for me, and I can't help but think that with a different cast and crew, a better job could have been done.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>This is a really fun sci-fi movie to watch. This is a different story than movie in this genre and is a solid one at that. I did like the action of the "heroin" and does break all of the "sterotypes" of the "weak" woman figure. Bravo to the writer and director of this film for building a solid story with a strong woman as the heroin. The special effects were excellent in this movie as well as the acting of the actors. I do recommend this movie to anyone that loves sci-fi flicks with a little twist to the story.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>I'm not really a fan of MTV, but Aeon Flux was original and interesting.  Sadly, the movie is not.  The plot had potential--except that it didn't appear until the last 15 minutes.  The writers spent too much time with techno gadgets (YOU ARE IN THE FUTURE) crap, and showing Aeon's acrobatics (ISN'T SHE COOL?) to create any decent suspense.  Charlize Theron, Oscar Winner, is evidently too good to wear the more revealing costume Aeon wore in the series.  Ironic--Hollywood felt the need to put Halley Berry in a cut to ribbons costume when the original Catwoman was fully suited in leather, but they do the reverse here. Go figure.  Overall the movie was okay--a rental.<br /><br />It's these subpar, flighty movies with big name actresses that give Science Fiction/Fantasy a bad name.  And give Hollywood the mistaken impression that the public doesn't want action movies with heroines.  No, we want GOOD action movies with heroines.  And Jennifer Garner, Halle Berry and Charlize Theron aren't talented enough (or too talented?) to supply them.  I guess all my hopes are now pinned on Wonder Woman, please let her be a newcomer....</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>I went into this film with extremely low expectations.  I used to watch the animated Aeon Flux series which was very well done, if not somewhat confusing.  Bringing Aeon Flux to the big screen actually IMPROVES upon the original.  The film fleshes out the the story/history of Aeon Flux and actually makes the entire premise understandable.  This film was an enjoyable ride with some interesting special effects, some were good, some were lacking (I found all the blood in the film very fake).  Overall, this film is a good watch for anyone interested in sci-fi (even if not totally original).  The film stands on its own without any viewing of the animated series.  Four stars = above average.  Aeon Flux gets a well deserved four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>If you are looking for deep thinking Science Fiction this is not the film for you. Go read a Heinlein, Card or Cherryh book, you will be happier. If you want to turn your brain off for a few minutes, this movie is a lot better than I imagined it would be. Charlize is beautiful. The action isn't half bad, and the special effects are really quite good. The story is... well it's not exactly literature, but as I said if that's what you are in the mood for, there are lots of great books out there.<br /><br />If you are standing at the video store asking yourself, Aeon Flux or UltraViolet? Rest assured Aeon Flux is your better choice. This film is not "Aliens" by a long shot, but it isn't half bad. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Ever since I saw Peter Chung's creation mow down piles of enemies with her two Uzis, a leather S&M get up, and little else, I fell in love.  Aeon Flux was bizarre, action-packed, and short on words (actually, almost none at all when she first debuted on Liquid T.V.).  I watched it over and over, I drew Aeon multiple times until I got her right, and the breakneck pace that was established in the film still affects my writing to this day.<br /><br />So it was with no small trepidation that I approached the Aeon Flux movie.  How could they possibly do justice to a bizarre series that was as much a style as it was a cartoon, alternately ugly and sleekly beautiful all at the same time?<br /><br />Taking place in 2415, Aeon (Charlize Theron sporting a brunette `do) is an agent of the Monicans.  The Monicans wage a secret war against Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas), a well-meaning despot who struggles to keep the fragile city of Bregna together.  The Earth has long since been devastated by a plague, and there are only five million survivors left in the city. And yet there's something rotten in the city of Bregna, for Trevor's brother Oren (Jonny Lee Miller) is about to stage a coup.<br /><br />After her sister Una (Amelia Warner) is murdered, Aeon's out for revenge against the supposed despot. Assisting Aeon in her mission of revenge is Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) who happens to have hands for feet.  And yet when she finally faces her target, Aeon discovers there's something very familiar about Trevor that gives her pause.<br /><br />Aeon Flux was directed by a woman (Karyn Kusama) and her sensibilities bring a refreshing touch to a genre that is all too muscular, boxy, and grim. Like The Fifth Element, Aeon Flux is an entry in a science fiction genre that avoids the standard futuristic tropes and injects new and bizarre technology into it.  Body modification, as evidenced by Sithandra, is an accepted part of sciety.  Technology is organic, ranging from killer grass to dart guns shaped like beehives, computers made of water to holograms formed of harp-like strings.  All the Monican agents are linked by a telepathic connection that lets them visualize each other in a sort of World Wide Web of the mind. Fashion styles are reminiscent of French couture. A zeppelin computer that looms overhead has all the appearance of a monstrous jellyfish. Even the city looks like a giant carnation from above.<br /><br />Aeon herself is played with deadly seriousness by Theron, who draws on her ballerina training to adopt a dancer's pose. Her martial arts is as much an art form as it is combat style, and the graceful leaps and jumps that the cartoon version effortlessly executed are much in evidence here; an amazing achievement, given that the original character's proportions barely conformed to reality.<br /><br />So what's the problem?  Critics lambasted the film, characterizing it as too complicated.  It's difficult for me to agree with them, because fans of the show will know precisely what's going on...and yet the movie wasn't spoiled for me either.  In fact, the biggest flaw of the film is the motive for Oren to "recycle" people in the city of Bregna. His "my way or else" proposition isn't really justified in the movie's narrative, such that we just have to trust that there's simply no room for compromise between the two ideologies battling it out on screen.  But once you're past that hurdle, the film is as much eye-candy as it is an interesting post-apocalyptic entry into alternative sci-fi.<br /><br />The backlash on this film is suspicious.  Perhaps it was Theron's Oscar win. Perhaps it's simply that many critics don't like science fiction.  Or perhaps it's that a truly feminist take on a science fiction world makes male reviewers uncomfortable.  Whatever the case, sci-fi fans should definitely give Aeon Flux a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>AEon Flux (Karyn Kusama, 2005)<br /><br />I'm a very big fan of both Karyn Kusama (Girlfight) and Charlize Theron (Monster). So when I found out that the big-screen adaptation of Peter Chung's wonderful animated series AEon Flux would star Theron and be directed by Kusama, I was hopeful that the film would have some teeth to it. Alas, as everyone in the world but me seemingly knew, I was wrong.<br /><br />Theron plays the title character, who lives in a world whose five million inhabitants all live in a single city, the world outside having "gone back to nature." The city has been ruled by a benevolent dictator for most of those four hundred years, but things have started getting a little weird, and a rebel faction, the Monicans, has sprung up. AEon Flux is a member of the Monican resistance, and she gets an assignment from her handler (Fargo's Frances MacDormand) to assassinate said dictator, Trevor Goodchild (xXx's Martin Csokas). Except that, well, something makes her hesitate, and that something is the vast coincidence upon which the entire film turns. And once you accept that fact that you've been handed a vast coincidence, the whole thing simply falls apart, becoming nothing more than an excuse for a mindless shoot-em-up with all sorts of nifty special effects. (Sophie Okonedo's character, who has had her feet replaced with a second set of hands, is the recipient of, by far, the coolest of the film's effects.)<br /><br />So, the short answer: the only reason to watch this film has to do with Charlize Theron and a few yards of skintight leather. Which, I admit, could have even made Reds worth watching, really. But be prepared for the fact that Girlfight this ain't. **</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>"Aeon Flux" could have been so much that the movie was not, but I wonder if the movie really sucked as bad as some would say. Was it a classic sci-fi in the league of "Star Wars", "The Matrix" or others? No. On the other hand, it was not that bad either, to be honest.<br /><br />The premise is that about 99% of all humanity has been wiped out in a great plague and that there is only one city left: Bregna. In Bregna, people live in a healthy, utopian dream and they never venture outside the walls. The city is ruled by one family, the Goodchilds, who rule in benevolent guidance and look after everyone. Or so it seems. The Monicans are the resistance to the Goodchilds and work acts of violence and destruction.<br /><br />This movie has some definite things going for it, besides Charlize Theron in some very revealing clothing. The action sequences are excellent, and they are of the highest quality. On this basis alone, "Aeon Flux" could hold its own against most other films with fight sequences in them. The action is also fairly high paced, with few periods of dry or dull monotony.<br /><br />The special effects are also excellently executed, and worth a look. The creativity of different weapons and gadgets would satisfy most Trekkies, I think. The advanced technology portrayed was not so different from our own time, with some recognisable items there. However, it was different enough to give you something of the unreal and dreamlike.<br /><br />The striking thing for this viewer was the contrast between the frenetic intensity of the Monicans with their drive to rebel, and the mindless acceptance of everything by the majority of the population. Later in the movie, even this contrast is shattered when Aeon Flux starts to question the mission that she is sent on by the Monican Handler. Black and white/Them and us start to take on a more blurred aspect, complicating a simple dichotomy of friend and foe. The movie succeeds in raising some issues for thought.<br /><br />I thought the ending was a bit simplistic and corny. If I had a criticism of the movie, that would be it. I was left feeling a little less than satisfied with the way that the movie resolved itself. However, taken overall, I would have to say that this is more than counterbalanced by the earlier parts of the movie.<br /><br />In short, be cautious if you are buying it, I would not watch it a lot of times, but it is worth a couple of viewings, at least. I would not be shy on the hiring side of it, and see what you think. It may not be your thing, but I definitely enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Let me first say that I loved the Aeon Flux series on Mtv. It positively blew my mind. I use to watch this animated cartoon along with the greats. First came THE Maxx, then The State, Then Aeon. But, now that she's been poured into cinematic form, it seems that all the fan-nostalgia has been washed right out of me.<br /><br />Charlize theron, a brillant actress, Chameleon actress, did well in portraying Aeon as a kick-butt assasin who takes her work very seriously. I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to play Aeon but her, to be honest.<br /><br />But, alas, looking like a character doesn't necessarily mean that you will embody that character.<br /><br />The story takes place in the very far future as the last remaining humans build a city to house the last survivors of the population. Aeon, mingled in with the society, visits her sister often and has the feeling that the regime has been hiding something. Especially since people are dissapearing with no explanation for it.<br /><br />Now, as I was watching this movie, I couldn't help but notice that it had a similar outline to that of V FOR VENDETTA. But, sadly, this is no V FOR VENDETTA.<br /><br />The action was good and well cherographed, I admit.<br /><br />The costumes and plot were also very well done.<br /><br />If anything, I like the premise and story of this timeless character and movie.<br /><br />But, with this movie, I think they thrusted the audience too fast into the movie without really spending the time or effort in re-telling the backstory of Aeon and the Regime. Some parts I got confused as to whether everything was comprehendible or if it was just me. STAR WARS had a similar approach, introducing gadgets that need no explaination, but Aeon somehow falls flat in this department. It's not that the gagdets aren't well explained, it's just that they seem to almost pop out of nowhere or need MORE explaining.<br /><br />I'm Not saying that I hate the movie. I think that they did a spectacular job . . . but they could've done better. They could've spent more time with the backstory, becuase, in essence, that's what keeps us all interested in the characters. And I think that they could've at least spent more time on how the story would unfold. Each frame was not like a painting like it was in V FOR VENDETTA.<br /><br />It almost seems, when watching this movie, that they left something out or something was missing for the grand masterpiece. Thankfully, this doesn't hurt Charlize's career in any way but the film needs a lot of work still.<br /><br />I say, that if you are a hardcore Aeon Flux fan, that these things won't matter much. But, if you are a person who has never really been into the series, it may take you a long while to warm up to these characters. You may have to watch the original series and then come back to this movie in order to fully appreciate it more.<br /><br />I'd say that 40% of the movie was hype.<br /><br />Final verdict: Needs more history. Still good though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I was drawn to seeing Aeon Flux, because the trailer provided a few impressive action scenes and I am very interested in seeing the participations of three Oscar-nominated/winning actresses teaming up in this Sci-fi action "chick flick". I have been following Charlize Theron way back in the Cider House Rules days, and loved her work in Monster and her recent North Country. I had to see this film to see if she can play an action hero considered that she's got the supermodel body and she's a great actress. And how often does Frances McDormand submitts herself to a big budget commercial film? Lets not dismiss the appeal of last year's relatively unknown Oscar-nominated Sophie Okonedo, she also plays a strong supporting role that managed to steal some scenes next to Theron.<br /><br />Aeon Flux takes place 400 years in the future, when the virus afflicted Earth had eliminated 99% of the human population, and the remaining one million reside in the city of Bregna, which is controlled by the Trevor Goodchild(Marton Csokas). The citizens are duplicated clones of their original DNAs, but they are all unaware of that they are merely living like a ghost. The Resistant group called Monicants are lead by Handler(a God-like character played by McDormand) have a mission to kill Goodchild and take over the regime. A highly trained and skillful Monicant named Aeon Flux(Theron) and her sidekick Sithandra(Okonedo) are sent to assassin Goodchild . On their mission, there are many dangerous horizons they have to encounter before getting inside the highly secured buildings where Goodchild and his team were hiding. The seemingly fearless and emotionless Flux had no idea that she was a clone and that her true identity becomes clear when she reunites with her forgotten past-life husband Trevor Goodchild. And now she's torn between unsolving the mystery behind the clone humans and abandoning her mission. At the same time, Oren Goodchild(Johnny Lee Miller) is rebelling against Trevor, because he refuse to let Trevor use the new-found cure to the disease that would end the cloning of humans. Both Trevor and Aeon have became fugitives, and they must work together to defeat Oren and the assassins sent by Handler....<br /><br />This film features some great production designs, and the futuristic costumes are quite meticulous and impressive. The fight scenes are rather mediocre, while the special effects are quite worthwhile. Both Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite(who played the clone Keeper) had less than five minutes of screentime, and their roles are just too low-key and unchallenging for them. Theron wears that black spandex bodysuit most of the time, and she even had to wear a flesh revealing beaded underwear in one scene. She also had some steamy and romantic moments with the hunky Marton Csokas.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>I never saw the anime yet.

Man I was wrong, to heck with all the negative rubbish, I love it!<br /><br />The film itself is pure fantasy captured on the screen. I felt transported to another world for the time it took me to absorb the story and on a minor vain note I ended up loving Aeon's hairdo- do, it was awesome!<br /><br />Aeon is the equivalent of a bounty hunter in this movie, as she is a part of rebel group called the Monicans. She has a secret mission to kill Goodchild, the chairman who oversees the last surviving place called Bregna as he rules with other scientists. Since 99% of the population was killed by a virus, he is in charge and Aeon with her rebellion are about to change that.<br /><br />What I loved, other than the fantastic costumes and surreal landscapes was the twists and turns in the story! This reminded me of those books I read and loved, when you didn't really know who the bad guy was and that was really going on. You must pay attention as a lot goes! Aeon and Goodchild are caught in a game of cat and mouse and it was enticing to see how they were connected and what the truth would do.<br /><br />The twist start when Aeon if faced with fleeting memories of a previous life that keep her from fulfilling her mission and as the truth is revealed to her, she changes the future of Bregna with the equivalent of taking the bottom block of the foundation out. She lets all the skeletons loose as she jumps, shots, cartwheels, slinks through the night, paralyzes and disarms army men and fights for the truth of her and her people.<br /><br />As I said, I'm not a die hard fan, I've never even seen the series and I absolutely let the movie swallow my brain and possess my interest till the end credit. I loved it, cant wait to own the DVD so I can pop it in when I have a sweet tooth for some sweet , eccentric and off-the-wall action.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Once again I find myself in the minority. The Tomatometer's gauge at rottentomatoes.com levels off at an extremely cool 10% approval rating; meaning 90% of the critics DIDN'T like it.<br /><br />Most of the bashing comes via comparisons to CATWOMAN (another bomb) or the fact that the original Aeon Flux was an animated feature on MTV and the translation to live-action cinema didn't work. Not having seen these animated versions - or CATWOMAN for that matter - I can't make any comparisons. But what I can do is tell you how the movie flowed, how well it was acted, and its entertainment value.<br /><br />Charlize Theron (NORTH COUNTRY) stars as Aeon Flux, a rebel in the 25th century. A terrible disease has decimated humanity and its surviving members hide behind an enclosure, cut-off from the possible devastating effects of what lay beyond (think LOGAN'S RUN and you'll be close). Within the confines of their home live the remaining five million members of society thanks to the medical efforts of the Goodchild Regime, named after Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas). Aeon Flux belongs to an elite group of resistance fighters known as the Monicans who's goal is to topple the Goodchild Regime. People have been vanishing. Police actions are resulting in deaths. And Aeon Flux is going to find out why.<br /><br />As we move through the stronghold of humanity (the city is known as Bregna), we learn and see much about this futuristic yet completely alien-like society. Pills can heighten awareness and even send coded messages to ones brain. Computers look like musical instruments or a type of String Theory. Everyone feels that something is wrong with their world ...and there is. Cloning and its effects on the power-base of the Goodchild Regime are holding humanity back at a terrible price.<br /><br />CATWOMAN comparisons aside (yes, Charlize looks fantastic in her skin-tight leather outfit), this is a thinking person's film. There are lots of little tidbits thrown into the film that give it a futuristic look without trying too hard (the computers were a nice touch, as were filming many external shots in Berlin, Germany where new construction is the rage).<br /><br />The pacing of the film was excellent. Never once did it get bogged down in the minutia of the times or the science. If you can't keep up, oh well. Leaping from action sequence to fight scene to action sequence made the 93 minutes fly by. The acting was okay. Nothing special but nothing horrible either. Charlize was the shining star, of course, and gave a relatively fine performance.<br /><br />For my time, this was extremely entertaining and sexy, and full of great sci-fi scenery.<br /><br />Only one question remains: What's up with the critics?!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>OK, so this is not a masterpiece, but this is not nearly as bad as I would have expected given the horrid reviews by both critics and moviegoers when it first came out.  The real question, I believe, is not why people think this is so good, but why anyone imagines that the graphic novel and the MTV animated series based upon it were so great.  In all three cases the basic story had plot holes you could drive an armada of eighteen-wheelers through, all three were based vastly more on style than substance, and all three were more about how it parsed visually rather than logically.  No version of Aeon Flux could be honestly considered any kind of classic and I really can't privilege either of the previous versions over this one.<br /><br />Once one gets past the fact that this doesn't have the tightest plot in the history of cinema and just concentrates on the visuals that was really all the previous two versions had going for it, this is actually a fairly pleasant film.  Yeah, there were moments when I would flinch at the silliness of things, but, again, the same silliness afflicted the novel and animated series.<br /><br />If there is a chameleon in the movies today, it is Charlize Theron.  I find it nothing should of stunning the various physical types that she can play and I think she did a more than creditable job in this one.  Her presence here is remarkable of only because she truly is a first rate actress, capable of a wide variety of roles.  She can do action films, dramas, Sci-fi, and comedy, and could probably do other kinds of films as well if called upon to do so.  She looks good as Aeon, nothing like the previous two versions, but then Aeon in those incarnations looked, in my opinion, rather ridiculous.  Since no actresses who are 6'2 and have measurements of 32-16-30 were available, one has to settle for someone like the lovely Ms. Theron.  The greatest testament to her abilities comes from the fact that in the same period of time this film came out, NORTH COUNTRY was released for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and she appeared in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT in an extraordinary role for which she could very well be nominated and win an Emmy (you heard it here first) as the "special" British female Rita.  As many will know, Theron, who is a very good athlete, did as many of her stunts as possible.<br /><br />I thought the basic story, as long as one doesn't try to poke too many holes in the plot (an easy thing to do), was fun.  I put no spoiler warnings here so I won't go into the plot, but the basic premise has a kind of Philip K. Dick quality twist on things, where reality isn't as real as it seems.  Nonetheless it is impossible to completely ignore the essential silliness of so many things in the novel/series/movie.  The superfluous athleticism is only one of these.  Why the endless back flips, not only when they are nonfunctional but when they would be actual distractions?  For instance, when Aeon jumps to grab one of the things dangling from the ship that hovers the city she does a full somersault on her way down.  How in the world could that help things?  And why do fifty feet of somersaults instead of simply sprinting?  A one legged person could out hop someone doing back flips or somersaulting.  You can contrast this with the action sequences in another fairly recent film, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY.  What makes Matt Damon's action sequences so refreshing is that in every instance he does the absolute minimum number of moves to be effective.  It makes Bourne come across as the effective killing machine that he is supposed to be.  Here, as in the novel and series, Aeon comes across as an extravagant wind up toy.  And one of my pet peeves:  breaking necks.  I took quite a bit of martial arts and in grappling classes actually was trained in the ways that one can break a neck, mainly so that you can be on the defensive of it happening to you.  On a host of shows and in movies there has developed an intensely dumb way of doing this, which apparently consists of pushing the chin off to one side.  Trust me, you can't break a neck this way.  (My beloved series BUFFY and ANGEL were two of the worse at perpetuating this method of neck breaking.)  OK, this is nitpicking, but I state it as an example of the way the film starts falling apart if you pick at it.  But, again, the same was true of the novel and series.  It's not like the silliness suddenly started with the movie.<br /><br />So, I recommend this, especially to fans of Sci-fi, as long as you don't expect a tautly thought out story.  What you get is a host of gorgeous images, a compelling main character portrayed by the lovely Charlize Theron, and a pretty interesting visual representation of the future.  I've seen worse and I've definitely seen better but I think a tolerant fan will find more than a little to enjoy in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>The HD DVD version of this film (the only version I've seen) is easy to look at - the film is very well done by all parties involved.<br /><br />The story is definitely worthy of the big screen. The 5.1 audio tracks are very clean and captivating. The great HD picture comes through crisp and bright, clean and awesome.<br /><br />I have never seen the animated series so I have no comments about its similarities, but I consider this film a keeper for the collection that I can watch again in the future and still enjoy it.<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" offers a nice variety of well executed, pulse quickening action sequences, coupled with brilliant performances by a great cast. What you end up with is an hour and thirty-two minutes of excellent action-packed film!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought it.<br /><br />If you enjoy TV's "Alias" (please no comparison follow-ups, I'm not comparing) you may likely enjoy "Aeon Flux" - not that they're the same thing, but there is this mission...with a captivating female lead...this one's a bit more on the sci-fi side, though...I don't want to blow it for anyone, just go out and get it if that kind of premise piques your interest in any way. If you're curious so far, you can pretty much count on enjoying the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>First I am a fifty something white guy and I didn't say "what's going on" to my wife when I saw this movie. Nothing worse than people that want you to see their bold reviewing vision and then they slap someone in the face with a sexist/elderly discremination remark. Gee, like only the MTV generation understands Science Fiction and this movie. Funny but last time I checked Sci Fi was around and being read long before even I was born let alone someone such as yourself. I was probably reading Isaac Asimov before you were born, so what does that prove? One thing, I have learned age and sex have nothing to do with how people interpret SciFi. Now that we got that out of the way, this is a good movie. Some are being overly critical because of the predictable invulnerability of Aeon and how it is overly easy for her to take out everyone else. I too must admit it was a touch heavy handed, but then so was "The Matrix". The faults are minor when you consider the quality of the story, action, and the effects. Take time to watch it a second time and reflect on it before being so harsh.<br /><br />This movie may seem simple to some, but it has a good deal under the surface. One critical viewer went on about the blimp used to hide the DNA instead of a vault being stupid. I say, not at all. Hiding in plain sight is often quite smart. No one would expect something of great value in a blimp that could be easily shot down or boarded, and the keeper was there to make it seem like something ordinary. Another indicated this was new for a woman to strike out for her believes. Nothing new about a young woman striking out for her believes. Most recently I recall "Underworld" using that plotline, and then there was "Final Fantasy", et cetera, but I digress. The story is different in the respect of a different look at a future society. As mentioned previously by a couple truly open minded reviews, that is a tough nut to crack. "Logan's Run" 30 years later still looks okay even if the effects seem a bit hokey. It holds up because of what they tried to say, not because the F/X were not extreme. SciFi fans will probably like it best, but anyone with an open mind may find it entertaining. I suggest renting before buying. Personally I liked the acting and story so much I am buying it. The trailers did not do this movie justice. They make it look like a mindless action movie. There is much more to it than just some good action and special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>The cynic in me is beginning to wonder if there is a shortage of filmworthy material out there, as again another borrowed medium makes its transition to the screen. Now, this is no crime, when one looks at the success of the Spiderman, X-Men, and more recently Fantastic Four movies, and other pictures that have developed even video games into movies, with moderate success. But most of those had a wider recongition base, and global audience to work from leaving this feeling very "special interest". So I understand it, Aeon Flux is a relatively successful animated pulp magazine/storybook, and previous short TV series on Liquid TV that has been around for some time, and has a reasonable following amongst the adolescent community. The picture however, starts from the false assumption that you are familiar with the storyline, characters, and chronology of the aforementioned books. As faithful and appealing as that may be to hard core fans, it does tend to leave the uninitiated viewer out in the cold, so to speak. I spent the first 30 minutes or so wondering what the hell was going on, and although I picked up the idea (and a nice SciFi idea it is) the script and action had more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Often movies like this, bypass the theater and head straight to their intended target audience in the DVD section, and gambling on a major release with the injection of big name actors, is a very hit or miss affair (anyone remember Spawn?)<br /><br />Theron is certainly visually distracting in a seemingly endless wardrobe of leather and spandex, and the rest of the cast DO follow through their dialogue with conviction, but it simply isn't enough. The end result comes out like a ruined surprise souffl&eacute;, with plenty of promise, but flat as a pancake. Considering the short 93 min running time, some back story would have been more than feasible, and would have helped the movie immensely; also a little more concise editing would have been a welcome addition to the often choppy direction you see on screen. Overall, this isn't a bad movie, but it's really not very good either, and sadly the inventive story and initial ideas ended up being way too large for its own production leaving a watery popcorn flick for the MTV generation. Wait for the DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Setting aside the technical wizadry that makes "Aeon Flux" watchable, this is an ambitious science fiction story that is grounded by its reliance on oppression as its overarching theme. This is the same thing that happened with similar sci-fi flicks including "The Island" and "V For Vendetta" -- they all revolve around futuristic societies where the action takes place after war or other calamity.<br /><br />In "Aeon Flux" the society is set in 2415 after a plague has taken all but 5 million residents (who all seem beautiful and able to speak English.) They reside inside a walled society that separates them from a world nature has taken over -- similar to "The Island", where all the inhabitants tried their best to get to the island without knowing they were stuck inside a tiny little world.<br /><br />Star Charlize Theron is magnificent in the James Bond-ish lead role as a member of the underground fighting to overthrow the leadership -- not unlike the Zorro-like character in "V For Vendetta" whose goal was to topple the totalitarian government in place in England.<br /><br />Theron gets an assignment to assassinate a member of the ruling party and the action takes a decided turn in another direction. She recalls a previous life with this guy and doesn't kill him. She ends up in prison, escapes, kills some people, meets him again, and finds out more about their collective past -- all in the time it took my wife to go to the bathoroom!<br /><br />At this point the story changes changes and, without disclosing much, the notion of cloning begins to play a major role. This separates those that want to go backward to the old way (revolutionaries) from those that want to keep things the way they are now (ruling party). I don't recall what happened at the end of the flick so I can't spoil that for you.<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" has many fine and involving moments of action and imaginative scenes, has many wonderful sets, is marvelously lit, and benefits from a fine actress in the lead role whose outfits will keep male viewers attached to the screen if not to the storyline. That last thing, the story, becomes a bit bizarre and borders on incoherence once or twice during the telling of the story, so expect to be confused on occasion.<br /><br />The bottom line: "Aeon Flux" is a visual treat and somewhat entertaining as 21st century sci-fi with all its technical details in place. It is neither a film for the ages nor in any way individual compared to other movies of its type that have been made in recent years. But, considering the original was a cartoon, this is an improvement over that.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>The animated films originally ran on M-TV, and although the animation was interesting, the content was somewhat lacking. Well, the same could be said about the film as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>What a surprise this movie was! I never intended to watch this film, but when a friend lent me the DVD I decided to go ahead and try it out, expecting an action flick with a simple plot, and not much else. Instead I found a superb story with enough intrigue and suspense to keep our interest intact throughout its duration, and some nice action to boot.<br /><br />The action takes place in the twenty-fifth century, 400 years after civilization was almost wiped out by a virus and only some survived thanks to a discovery by Trevor Goodchild. The survivors live in a fortified city called Bregna and are monitored at all times from a central command. There is a group, called Monicans, that believes that something is not right in this society, and they have sent Aeon to murder chairman Goodchild.  Up to this point, it all looks like straightforward science fiction, but when Aeon and Goodchild meet, things will get complicated, and a rich and enthralling storyline surfaces.<br /><br />There are several things I liked about this movie apart from its outstanding plot. The futuristic city presented in the film was craftily created, and I could not help feeling as if I was looking at a modern version of Ancient Rome. I also enjoyed the action scenes, which involve a considerable degree of acrobatic skill. In this sense, I would say that there were some similarities with "The Matrix", and even the story line can be thought of as comparable to this masterpiece. Finally, I think that Charlize Theron delivered a very good performance, which should put her in the short-list of successful female action figures, such as Lara Croft.<br /><br />It is always great when I start watching a movie without any expectations of it being very good and I end up having one hell of a time. People that enjoy science fiction with a good amount of action and complex plots will definitely have a similar experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>'Aeon Flux' released in '05 is a surprisingly good sci-fi, action/adventure film. It has great special effects and it's one of the few films within the costumed female assassin/avenger genre that has a storyline worth your time to figure out.<br /><br />Plot: Set in the future, only one populated city remains on Earth. Outside the high walls surrounding Bregna is only wilderness. Everything appears idyllic on the surface except for one disturbing fact. People suddenly disappear now and then and the governing "Congress of Scientists" refuse to do anything to resolve the mystery. There is a growing faction of dissidents within the city known as the Monican's who want to know why, Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron)is one of them. When it becomes personal Aeon Flux decides to find out what's behind it all.<br /><br />Charlize Theron does a superior job as Aeon Flux, as does Marton Csoka as her adversary Trever Goodchild, head of the "Congress of Scientists." Also featured in a small but pivotal role is Pete Postlethwaite as Keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>With special effects and action superseding characterization, Aeon Flux makes for a fast-paced futuristic trip to the 25th century.  There's a definite "cool" factor to the whole thing, what with all sorts of ingenious futuristic gizmos and Charlize Theron's nifty little outfit, and the story, which is not exactly straightforward, does tie everything together in the end, but this just didn't feel like a complete movie experience to me.  This comes partly from the fact that the movie basically drops you into the middle of an unusual story without really providing you with a guide map at the start, but it has even more to do with the fact that the characters in this film are rather robotic.  The main character, Aeon Flux (Theron), is basically a terrorist, so it's a little hard to sympathize with her early on - especially since you have no way of judging the government or its leader, Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas).  When personal feelings do finally work their way into the story, they really aren't that dramatic at all.  Rather than explore anyone to any great depth, the director just keeps diverting our attention with special effects.<br /><br />Here's the backdrop for this story: in 2011, some disease wiped out 99% of the human population before a scientist was able to find a cure for it.  This scientist basically built a large walled city to house all of those he was able to save - and no one has been outside the walls in the last four centuries.  The Monicans, an underground group of terrorists and assassins, want their true freedom (and seem to be the only folks concerned by the fact that random people just keep disappearing out of the blue) and have decided that the Goodchild regime has to go.  Since Aeon Flux is their top assassin, she is given the task of assassinating Trevor Goodchild.  If you're thinking that 25th century security must surely be better than its modern-day equivalent, think again - Aeon basically just has to avoid some spiky grass and dart-shooting coconuts (and, if you're wondering, the "bad guys" of the future still can't hit the broad side of a barn).  Once Aeon comes face to face with Goodchild, everything changes for reasons she herself really doesn't understand.  As if things weren't complicated enough already, you also have a coup d'etat thrown in the mix.<br /><br />It takes a while for the viewer to find out what is really going on here, as the film is more concerned with showing off fancy special effects and superhuman abilities than it is in giving us a tightly-wound plot.  I for one would have liked to get at least a cursory look at this futuristic society and better insight into the main characters.  The film's entertaining, and I did enjoy it, but it was more of a snack than the full meal I would have preferred.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I don't know why so many people are talking crap about this movie. I thought it completely immersed you in this futuristic world. Charlize Theoren was the perfect choice for Aeon and it makes a sort of Actor/Director connection that makes this movie great. This film reminds me of the original (Matrix and Ghost in the Shell). This movie is about a huge conspiracy that the population of this world is unaware of. Also a resistance has been formed to stop this illusion. It may seem confusing at first, buy you just have to "think outside the box" in order to understand it. Also don't let a horney immature thirteen year boy watch this DVD, cause their's a scene when Aeon is half naked which was (SWEET)! I also recommed y'all get (Ultraviolent) the movie, when it comes to DVD.

That is not to say this DVD is not an interesting purchase, as it is one of the first I have seen where the extras add as much or more value to the purchase as the movie itself.<br /><br />From long years of reading `Heavy Metal' and similar `adult' comic strip fare, I have developed the opinion that both the art and the plots in these works tend to be very derivative of more original works, especially very popular movies. And, since `Aeonflux' is based on an MTV animated feature, I find that it too is very derivative of more original works, in spite of the principle's protestations of originality.<br /><br />I strongly suspect that the primary inspiration for the general situation is the film, `Logan's Run' and the heroine has strong similarities to the video game adventurer, Laura Croft. And, I am sorry to say, that Ms. Theron simply does not carry off the distaff daring do as well as the excellent Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />My primary problems with the movie are that first, it does not fully set the premise up well enough early in the movie, unlike the excellent `Blade Runner' or `Minority Report' for example. Second, I develop no interest whatsoever in the fates of any of the characters. They stay flat against the screen, as do most comic book characters. There is none of the angst we feel for the cinema incarnations of Spiderman or Daredevil or Superman. Third, the world in the background is almost totally sterile. There are none of the rich textures of `Blade Runner' or even `Alien' or `Predator'. The extras do a lot to explain this, but do not relieve the tedium of the movie.<br /><br />I was quite surprised to discover that the movie was shot entirely in Berlin, which turned out to be architecturally even better than their first choice, Brasilia, in spite of the fact that Brasilia is almost identical to the fictional city in the film, as it is set deep in the Amazon jungle. The advantages of Berlin were that there was a thriving movie industry in the city that could supply all sorts of support crew, not to mention a wealth of great costumers and set decorators. And, the scenes were not all-modern post-World War II concrete. Some scenes were done in the gardens of Frederick the Great's summer palace and some other scenes were done in a pre-World War II build aircraft testing tunnel.<br /><br />I was also delighted to see that many of the costumes were inspired by the 1970's Bernardo Bertolluci film, `The Conformist', which I was also pleased to see was to be released on DVD soon, as it has always been one of my favorite Italian films. There were several video documentaries on the sets, costumes, special effects, and stunts, plus my favorite extra, two voice-overs, one by the star and lead producer and one by the screenwriters.<br /><br />One of my least favorite aspects of the movie is the fact that the great Frances McDormand appears in a role that totally wastes her talent. That comes on top of the fact that the rationale for the role is totally inexplicable, and connected to virtually nothing else in the film.<br /><br />Like so many comic book movies, including the Lara Croft epics, poor plot and characterization may be forgiven if the visceral impact is good. I found nothing here that got me the least excited about what was happening on the screen. All I could think about were the errors in science where, for example, they give the impression that characters somehow become immortal because they are cloned from one generation to the next. I'm afraid it simply doesn't work that way. A clone shares no more in the personality, memories, or `spirit' of the original than a naturally born baby shares any intellectual material from natural parents.<br /><br />In the end, this DVD is literally more valuable as an essay on making this kind of movie than it does as a visceral experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>I had a life.<br />Now all I have is a mission<br /><br />The year is 2415; it has been seven generations since the industrial plague whipped out 99% of the people. The few remaining survivors are all huddled into one city with walls protecting them from what ever is outside. It is an ideal city of Bregna ran by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) and a council. And as with any such city there will always be rebels that thinks something is wrong with lack of freedom and mysterious disappearances. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) belongs to such an organization. Her mission as the most ept agent is to dispatch the so called benevolent ruler. Can she do this or will circumstances and chance encounters change the situation?<br /><br />The film does not boast of any thing really extraordinary except maybe an exceptionally rich architectural back drop. Shot mostly in Berlin we see many popular places that for some reason they though would not be that familiar to the audience. Evidently they must not know how popular Berlin is, especially key locations. The original location on their wish list was Brasilia because of its 1050's futuristic look; however that proved to be economically unfeasible. See if you recognize Sans Souci, Potsdam built in 1745 by Frederick the Great, one of the world best know orangeries.<br /><br />Although this movie had nothing extraordinary it is a perfect example of the genre and will hold your attention as you anticipate where they are going with the story. Only someone that anticipates that it will stick to the animated series may be disappointed.<br /><br />This is one of those films that lends its self well to Blu-Ray without distraction from the story.<br /><br />The DVD rendering adds some background commentaries that make rewatching the film more enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>This film is quite interesting.

However, I can't imagine why she took this role. Charlize's light is hidden under the bushel of a director who evidently thinks a story can be told without requiring any emotion from the characters. Aeon (Theron) and all the other main characters are flat and awfully boring. The simplistic story about the evils of cloning seems much longer than its 92 minutes. The fight sequences are heavily edited, just so much smoke and shadow -- no real martial arts expertise. Skip Aeon Flux and give Ultraviolet a try. That is a much more creative film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Okay, so I was hyped up about seeing it but I was somewhat let down in the long run.  It's by no means terrible, but it's not amazing either.  Theron does an okay job but having this follow so closly to her oscar winning performance in Monster was a shock.  North Country was a worthy follow up, but this was more suited to her Sweet November days, back when she was nothing but eye candy, you know, not taken seriously.  I want to say that a few reviewers said it was hard to follow if you hadn't seen the series...NOT TRUE!!!  I've never seen the cartoon nor had any idea what it was about and I followed the film fine.  There are things they don;t want you to know right off bat and thats the point of an unraveling plot.  That's a good thing.  Anyways...the action is decent but nothing to write home about and thats the reason for my complaint...with a film like this you don't look for a plot or brilliant oscar worthy performances...you look for amazing fight scenes and amazing special effects and this movie only delivered minimally...so, it's kindof a let down.  So does Flux Suck?  Watch it, I mean it's worth at least one watch, that way you can have your own opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>What is it about cloning that makes the Hollywood firmament indulge itself in futuristic narrative claptraps that aspire toward big statements about humanity and our apocalyptic fate? Last summer, big-budget schlockmeister Michael Bay went for the eternal youth angle in his bombastic though periodically thoughtful morass, "The Island", and now indie filmmaker Karyn Kusama makes cloning the lifeblood of Bregna, a cloistered city ruled by the dictatorial Goodchild family. Based on an MTV animated series from a decade ago, this 2005 film set in 2415 has the sheen of a stylish cartoon but the mindset of a confused pair of screenwriters, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, working off cartoonist Peter Chung's convoluted concepts about the self-destruction of mankind.<br /><br />Sporting an unfortunate Alan Cumming haircut, Charlize Theron plays the title role by showing off impressive athletic prowess and looking svelte in her black cat suit, but she is bereft of personality, at least one that would draw interest to her character's fate. Consequently, she speaks in a blank-faced monotone that seems to drain more energy than the Matrix-like kicks she uses to pummel her adversaries. As a Monican, an underground resistance movement out to eliminate the ruling Goodchilds, Aeon is instructed by the Handler to assassinate the leader, Trevor Goodchild. Yet, in the moment of key confrontation, she cannot do it for reasons that unfold in clunky plot turns that seem to weigh down an already clunky set-up. Any sensibility the story has - which is minimal anyway - is put completely on hold until the revelations come about later.<br /><br />Why actresses of the caliber of Theron, Frances McDormand (no more than a talking head as the Handler) and Sophie Okonedo (so impressive in "Hotel Rwanda" but simply posturing here as Aeon's colleague Sithandra) are involved in this debacle is the bigger mystery that should be solved. The men fare no better with Marton Csokas saddled with the film's most laborious lines as Trevor and Johnny Lee Miller who seems to be making a career of playing thoroughly obnoxious characters as his power-hungry younger brother Oren. The action set pieces should have saved this movie, but for the most part, they are quite dull and ridiculous and what's worse, edited badly, in particular, the first acrobatic display of Aeon and Sithandra as they attempt to gain entry into the Goodchild enclave.<br /><br />As the mind-numbing jumble of a story unwraps the mysteries behind the relationship between Aeon and Trevor, it doesn't provide enlightenment as much as it softens an already weak storyline with a romance novel angle. I think the filmmakers had good intentions in showing another variation of a post-apocalyptic world, but even with the slight twist toward the end and Aeon's consequent humanization, there isn't an element in the film that feels fresh. This is one expensive misfire.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>As you know, `Aeon Flux' has been either ignored or dismissed as nonsense by the critics, and its results on the US box-office are certainly not what the producers would have expected them to be. So here is a question: Is this so bad? If bad, how bad?<br /><br />I finally saw the film, and at first I thought these critics were wrong. The earlier chapters, in which heroine Aeon Flux appears as ninja-like deadly assassin, are full of rip-roaring sequences that are fun to see, and there are many good ideas in them such as the deadly turf. Though I have not seen the original MTV series, I thought Charlize Theron (and her black costumes, if not her hairstyle) brings life to the thin story that betrays its origin.<br /><br />But sadly `Aeon Flux' loses steam too soon, after she encounters the target Trevor (Marton Csokas) the leader of this futuristic, totalitarian society. Except for the secrets surrounding Trevor and Aeon, the film has little to tell, and that little is not very interesting. The film also has Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner), Aeon's partner Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo), but their characters have not much to do in the story. Even two veterans such as Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite are buries in the CGI-created halo and the heavy make-up.<br /><br />But if only there are healthy amount of good actions, every flaw would be forgiven. Sorry, but Karyn Kusama, who directed acclaimed `Girlfight' five years ago, may not be the right choice after all, for she fails to keep the film's good pace in the second half, slackening it with dull and uninspired actions. The concluding part is very disappointing, nothing that you have seen in sci-fi better actions like `Equilibrium.'<br /><br />Now I checked out the informative site of Rotten Tomatoes, and found that as many as four critics cited the name of `Catwoman' in order to mercilessly ridicule `Aeon Flux.' The unkind comparison is understandable. These two films both contain talented (and safe to say beautiful) Oscar-winners; both have one strong woman in its central role; and both define the meaning of `stylish action' in a quite unique way. Add to them `Tomb Raider' if you like and what can you have? Three Oscar winners and three very good-looking posters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>Wow! What a dim-whitted movie! It's sad to see Science Fiction sink so abysmally low this year! What formula-film-trash! Why does Hollywood repeatedly gear Science Fiction films to the mentality of teenage boys? Memo to Hollywood: THERE'S A MARKET FOR GROWN-UPS, even for Sci-Fi!!! Will someone please fill this nitch! PLEASE! I'm not asking for perfection, or genius. Just an ending without any ridiculous predictability, which, in turn, is devoid of any meaning, or real satisfaction. A film where more than half the time is NOT focused on killing and body counts. No more Wonder Women, (or men) who barely get scratched in mortal combat, or don't even bother to break into a sweat! In other words, out with the old LOWEST CAMP DENOMINATOR, and in with some new GROWN-UP STORY TELLING!<br /><br />The world of Aeon Flux is where men are either fools; conservative mass murderers; or fall like cardboard, and die like butter. Women, on the other hand, are tough as steal; have muscles; sleep with men and then knock them out, (ouch!); kill with such perfection, and ease, I thought they must be cyborgs; and single-handedly change the course of history!<br /><br />Here's a future where no one bothers to take a look on the other side of a big wall in 400-years! Human cloning and the quest for immortality are the root of all evil! Where killing pregnent women is done in order to keep the status quo, that is, mostly men in charge!<br /><br />Oh, yes the special-effect-eye-candy is magnificent! Too bad the storyline is two dimentional. I'll trade a low budget, low eye-candy film with a good story over this tedious trash, any day!<br /><br />Do us all a big favor! Don't encourage Hollywood to continuely make nonsense like Aeon Flux! Instead of trudging off to your local theater, treat yourself to a great film like the Matrix, or discover an old gem, like Zardoz! Maybe then, Hollywood will start diversifying again!</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Yet another stupid stupid movie.  Sure Charlize Theron is always nice to look at on the screen, but I think it would be better to just watch her walk around talking with her real life friends than have to put up with such a silly addlebrained plot.  The science it espouses makes no sense, the fighting makes no sense (why wear bright white clothes to an attack at night?), the love relationship makes little sense, and the destruction of the technology that Aeon alone has decided must end is stupid beyond belief.<br /><br />And, by the way, a world of only five million people could not live in the luxury and with the technology this city-state (I guess a kind of advanced Singapore) generates.  Frankly, they would be scrabbling about for food and such.  Where are the food producers?  Where are the carpenters, plumbers, programmers, die makers, assemblers, cooks, gardeners, and so forth?  Calling this a parable doesn't get stupidity off the hook.<br /><br />Can we also stop, puh-leeze, with the hundred and ten pound skinny women beating up entire armies of two hundred pound males?  And why is it that the hero can spray machine gun fire into the air and each bullet takes down a bad guy, but trained and armored soldiers who happen to be bad guys can lay down focused and directed fire and produce only survivable wounds in the heroes?  That alone would make bad guys not want to go into battle, right?<br /><br />We could go on and on and on about what is wrong with this movie, but unless you are willing to see it just to look at Charlize Theron in black hair, don't bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Never has so much work been put into a film that means so little.<br /><br />Aeon (Charlize Theron) is an elite member of a group called the Monicans. Due to a large-scale epidemic, there is only one city left on the planet ruled by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), who heads a council of elders (of sorts), including his brother, Oren (Jonny Lee Miller). Everyone in the cast seems to have been chosen because they spell their names in an odd way. Perhaps this is the director's subconscious method of evoking the future. The Monicans realize that although everything may look good, they are living in a police state and nefarious people lurk in the background, extracting citizens without cause. Aeon receives her latest instructions from Handler (Frances McDormand): The Monicans want her to assassinate Goodchild. Aeon has good reason to hate the Chairman as her sister was just murdered, for being a suspected member of the Monicans. The Monicans have received secret information that he will be vulnerable at a certain time. Just as she is about to kill him, Goodchild recognizes Aeon and asks "Catherine?" causing her to lose her concentration.<br /><br />"Aeon Flux", directed by Karyn Kusama, whose only other film was the independent film "Girlfight", is an interesting film to look at, to a point, but it is extremely simplistic and hollow.<br /><br />The film is based on a series of graphic novels and an animated series, which I am not familiar with. A friend told me that in these original incarnations, Aeon is repeatedly killed and then cloned, to keep coming back and back. If this is true, it seems rather pointless. How can we root for Aeon, the hero, if she is so completely unsuccessful that she repeatedly gets killed? Thankfully, the filmmakers have changed this when adapting for the big screen. Charlize Theron's interpretation of the character is an extremely well-trained assassin who seems to have every skill she needs at her fingertips. This makes her the sort of tough, no nonsense woman you are probably expecting from the commercials and trailers.<br /><br />But she is ultimately too tough. Aeon never shows any emotion. Even when her sister is killed, a tear barely falls before she is off running, kicking, or killing guards with a quick jerk on their necks. Note to filmmakers: They don't all have to be cold-hearted and stone-faced killers in the future. This would be an acceptable trait for the lead character if anyone else showed any emotion. Occasionally, a tear makes its way down a cheek, but the person remains cold and immobile. But no one does. I understand all of this stoicism is meant to evoke the sterile, antiseptic feel of the future, but we're beyond that. We can see a character show some emotion in the future.<br /><br />Watching Charlize Theron kick box her way through a series of attackers is fun, but it gets repetitive. Real fast. She gets a scratch here and a cut there, but nothing seems to slow her down. She just keeps running or kicking or hitting, etc. Yawn. When there is little or no evidence that she will ever be waylaid by any injury, any suspense generated by the situation quickly evaporates. Many of these futuristic fighting machines are just that, machines. They never appear vulnerable, never show emotion and simply move from one target to the next, trying to achieve some goal. What the filmmakers are missing is that the character, their futuristic fighting machine, needs to have something for us, the audience to identify with. Give the machine some trait or other that lets us in, shows us they are vulnerable. This is one of the reasons The Terminator is such a great character. In "The Terminator", he is originally the villain. Yet, he is also vulnerable, he can be slowed down. In the sequel, he becomes the protector and even though he isn't the most emotive guy in the world, we see that he cares about Sarah and John Connor. This made him a character we could identify with, yes, even though he is a robot who kills, leaving a path of destruction.<br /><br />The design of "Aeon Flux" is interesting and easily the best thing about the film. It occurred to me that director Kusama probably grew up watching films like "Logan's Run" and similar mid-70s attempts at depicting the future, and really enjoyed them. This is her homage to these films. The film looks and feels like "Run", but made with better special effects. Buildings have sleek shapes, built in concrete. Clothes are strange, made primarily of leather and latex and cover odd parts of the body. Food is interesting. It looks as though they took a mixture of the oddest looking things they could find in real life and interspersed them throughout, adding a touch of interest to a strange bleak landscape. At one point, Aeon's sister is cutting into a star fruit, which is supposed to be a futuristic thing, but exists in this day and age. I have heard that much of the film was shot in Germany, presumably to use some of their slightly surrealistic architecture as the basis for this futuristic world.<br /><br />Is this attempt at creating a new world enough to warrant your time and money? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. The film is well-produced, but it is not well-written or directed well. Until the filmmakers can begin to create futuristic characters that experience some believable emotion, which can make us feel for them, don't bother. Without this human touch, these films will always feel like hollow shells of moviemaking excess.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>It is a bad sign indeed when a studio does not allow the critical press to preview a film before its release. This happened with Karyn Kusama's (the extraordinary "Girlfight") "Aeon Flux," a turkey of such proportions as to overwhelm and upturn the largest and sturdiest of Christmas tables.<br />"Aeon Flux" has many things going for it on paper: Kusama, whose "Girlfight" was tough, gritty and aggressive, every thing this film is not; the glorious Charlize Theron, the noted cinematographer, Graeme Revell, Sophie Okenedo, Marton Csonkas and the estimable Frances McDormand. But what has come out of all this talent? Not much: "Aeon Flux" is still born, stilted, lacking anything even approaching style or forward movement. All of the actors, gifted one and all, are given mostly gibberish to spout...they seem lost and consequently so do we.<br />Despite all of this, the film is quite beautiful, looking very much like a 1960's futuristic film like "Fahrenheit 451" both in production and costume design. "F451" was released in 1966; surely the film makers could have come up with some new ideas particularly with all the technical improvements that have occurred in the last 40 years?<br />Many films are so bad that they are good: "Aeon Flux" is not one of these.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>makes ''normal'' people think more of actors/singers than they are worthy of.theron has a pretty face.

But for people like me, this is great entertainment.<br /><br />I give Aeon Flux an 8 out of 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Aeon Flux (2005) is a slick science fiction adventure, with Aeon being a sleek, attractive, and athletic heroine.  The character is taken from an animated MTV short, created by Peter Chung.  Substantial changes were made in order to develop a suitable full length story, and to allow for the adaptation of an animated adventure, to a real life format.  The story is complicated, but holds together pretty well, and features various futuristic sets, numerous action sequences, and impressive special effects.<br /><br />In order to survive a deadly plague, drastic measures were required, and the last remnants of humanity live in a city with walls along its perimeter, called Bregna.  Life seems ideal, but a small organization, known as the Monicans seeks to destroy the government structure.  Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), is an elite guerilla operative for the Monicans, who receives instructions telepathically, from the Handler (Frances McDormand).  Her next mission is huge, to assassinate the head of the government, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas).  Tragically, before she is about to embark, Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner) is shot, apparently for being suspected as a Monican.<br /><br />Oren Goodchild (Jonny Lee Miller), is also a member of the Government, believing his brother Trevor is not with the program, he hatches a scheme to eliminate his older sibling using the Monicans.  With the help of Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) another elite operative, Aeon enters the Cidadel, the seat of the government, and gets into position to complete her mission, but when face to face with Goodchild, Aeon hesitates, and is captured.  Things take a dramatic turn when Aeon learns the truth about Trevor, and the work he has been involved in.  The two team up to try and survive the Bregnan government, and the Monicans, who regard Aeon as a traitor.<br /><br />The film shifts into a high action mode in the final stretch.  There are some shaky, over the edge moments, but the result are exciting, stylized, and dramatic.  Whether the resolution is palatable, is another matter, as Aeon makes a decision that all humanity must live with.<br /><br />After Charlize Theron won an Oscar for Monster (2003), by her own admission, she did no major physical training, and needed to get in top shape for her physical demanding role as Aeon Flux.  Theron and Sophie Okonedo, both tall and athletic, underwent similar training regimes, eventually training together.  Remarkably, Theron did almost all of her own stunts, and amazed the production crew with her physical ability and timing.  Her acrobatic performance, in a skin tight suit, is quite impressive, as is that of Okonedo whose character has hands for feet.<br /><br />The  future world of Aeon Flux is intriguing, and semi-understandable, but with many mysterious elements.  There are theatrical show pieces like the cathedral where the Handler gives directions, a and blimp that flies over the city, and interdimensional transitions, that are really not explained.  The unique architecture of Berlin was featured, and helps give the film an certain ambiance and futuristic look.  Director Karyn Kusama (Jennifer's Body), whose only previous experience was Girlfight (2000), does a quite remarkable job in a challenging project.  The screenplay by Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, apparently covered much more ground, and may have filled in some of the gaps.  Some 30 minutes was reportedly deleted from the director's cut, for the theatrical release.  Some may feel that the liberties taken with the character, had already gone too far.  Creator Peter Chung, apparently had some problems with the film.<br /><br />The blu-ray disc does not contain the director's cut, but appears to contain the same 92 minute version of the film, as well as the extras from the Special Collector's Edition.  This includes two separate commentary tracks, and a number of informative featurettes.  Graeme Revell contributes a cool score for the film.  Although perhaps an incomplete vision, for some thoughtful science fiction, with some stylized action, Aeon Flux is worth a look.  Based on her performance here, Charlize Theron has great potential in the action genre, and hopefully she will pursue this avenue at some future time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF.html">A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF</a><br/><p>How I missed this production for five years means it's time for me to leave the cave. The three consistent criticisms, from what I read, were that the costuming was poorly conceived and I would disagree somewhat given how difficult it is and historically has been to portray dress codes that far into the future so why not at least promote Charlize's physical attributes. Second, that the movie isn't faithful to the written comic book series is a common argument for all similar transferences from the printed page to the screen and most viewers regard that as a moot point as the mediums are, in the first place, so different and, secondly, how a story is expressed should be independent in the two mediums. Third, that the forest outside the city was poorly conceived and I say, so what, as the forest was largely superfluous to the main direction of the story.<br /><br />Digression aside, I principally look for creative storytelling in movies including the plot, the props, the sets, the cinematography, the editing/directing, the acting and this movie succeeded on all those criteria.  The story had a moralistic and intellectual theme; the props were visually period appropriate and well conceived; the sets were uniquely futuristic in design and function; the props such as Aeon's rotating eye and modes of communication were all interesting and novel; the camera work contributed to making this alternative dynamic world come across as somewhat realistic and the acting was solid enough. Finally, I noticed that the director's cutting edge work went a little under appreciated. So, director kudos, but a few years late, for delivering an entertaining and thought provoking futuristic action flick. It would have been interesting to have seen you continue your work in this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>I had a life.<br /><br />Now all I have is a mission<br /><br />The year is 2415; it has been seven generations since the industrial plague whipped out 99% of the people.

Unfortunately, the show's creator had no input into the movie which only further alienates it from the fan base. However, I think fans will be pleasantly surprised at just how faithful the movie is to the show.<br /><br />Charlize Theron certainly has Aeon's emotionless attitude down cold and is more than up for her character's athleticism. It is an extremely physically demanding role that she is more than capable of, showing an impressive prowess. However, Marton Csokas is miscast as Trevor. He doesn't look like his animated counterpart nor does he act like him - a lecherous powermonger. Csokas goes in the opposite direction as a quietly confident leader.<br /><br />This film has top notch production design and special effects with well-choreographed action sequences often accompanied by the requisite techno music. The sterile, futuristic look, flashy martial arts and Orwellian society is reminiscent of Equilibrium, although its action sequences were much better as was its kinetic editing - something that this movie could have used more of. In an interesting twist, all of this society's top assassins are women and, like in the Kill Bill movies, there are ferocious fight scenes between highly trained and very dangerous women, each with their own unique skills.<br /><br />The animated series was a fantastic example of abstract sci-fi surrealism and to capture that in a live-action movie is a difficult task to say the least. The film tries to have it both ways. It's not quite abstract as it should be and is not as pedestrian as it could have been. Watching this movie, it's easy to see why it failed to capture a mainstream audience. It's too abstract for most and not abstract enough for the show's fans, leaving it in an odd state of limbo.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Charlize Theron and the film's producer Gale Anne Hurd. Theron talks about the challenges of the intense, physical training she underwent for this role and then Hurd, in turn, praises her physical prowess. This is fairly decent track and both commentators are engaging.<br /><br />Also included is a commentary by the film's screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. They point out connections between the film and the animated series. They also talk about how much exposition was needed to set up this world and how the challenge is to tell enough but not to overwhelm or bore the audience.<br /><br />"Creating a World: Aeon Flux" examines the challenge of adapting an experimental, non-narrative cartoon into a Hollywood movie. We see Peter Chung visiting the set and marveling at his drawings being brought to life.<br /><br />"The Locations of Aeon Flux." Kusama originally wanted to shoot in Brasilia because it had an ideal, futuristic look that was surrounded by jungle. It wasn't practical for them to shoot there so Berlin was their next choice because it also had futuristic looking architecture.<br /><br />"The Stunts of Aeon Flux." Charlize Theron trained hard for this role. She came from a dancing background so she was very flexible - an ideal attribute for her character. It's amazing to see the level of commitment she had for this movie and the fact that she did 95% of her own stunts!<br /><br />"The Costume Design Workshop of Aeon Flux" takes a look at how the film's many costumes were designed and then made. They took their inspiration from the film The Conformist (1970).<br /><br />"The Craft of the Set Photographer on Aeon Flux." He took pictures on the set for publicity stills and sometimes even for the film's poster. He shows us the various lenses he uses and gives a little insight into how he works.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This is another great Blu-Ray release,Aeon Flux looks and sounds great in the Blu-Ray format!!!

When Frances McDormand was talking to Charlize Theron (white robe scene), the color was so beautiful, it just stood out very much.  Now, I'm not saying this is the best movie with story wise, but as for picture, this is a great piece of DEMO to show what HD is like!  This is an awesome movie! Charlize is very cool!  If you are into this HD format era, this is a movie to get, in fact i would even go as far as saying is as close a King Kong in HD.  This movie is a must have, you won't be upset with the purchase with story and picture wise!  Mesmerizing!!</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>After about 10 minutes into Aeon Flux, I wasn't sure whether I was going to like the film. For the next 20 minutes, you could say "I strandled the fence" between liking it and turning it off. There were occasional hints that Aeon Flux would fall over to the cheesy side of the fence, but it didn't. By the end of the movie, I was in love with the story, characters, action, and its twists and turns. This is a must see for sci-fi/fantasy fans. Those outside this realm might not care for Aeon Flux. I will buy the DVD for this movie. My lower ratings for "must buy" reflect the fact that non-sci-fi fans might not care for Aeon Flux.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 64<br /><br />29 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

And two, I think politics should be left out of it...therefore I won't comment on Hollywood's left/right influence on this movie or anything like that. I'm reviewing it based on its merits alone and nothing else.<br /><br />That out of the way, I found "Aeon Flux" to be a dumbed-down, watered-down, yet entertaining version of the animated series. Although I have mentioned above that I didn't see that much of the original in the 90's, I saw enough of it to say that as usual, Hollywood has toned down the sex & violence so that it gets a safe, for-the-masses PG-13 rating. Fanboys of the original series are going to throw popcorn at the screen, and are advised to skip it. But for the rest of us, I suppose it's an adequate sci-fi/action brainless flick that doesn't challenge anyone and merely asks that one put their brain on neutral.<br /><br />Although Charlize Theron is WAY too attractive for the role of Aeon and basically phones in her performance, she does a commendable job with what she is given to work with. A large part of this movie relies on her sex appeal and it never apologizes for it. And in all fairness it does have some other good qualities, mainly the special effects and futuristic set designs that are at least original even if implausible. Some work could have been done on the fight sequences, which were amateur and even boring at times.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend "Aeon Flux," but only if you have some extra cash leftover and/or are a big fan of Charlize Theron (she is after all quite easy on the eyes in this movie). But if you're trying to save some money and want to limit your movie watching, give this one a pass and wait for "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe" or "King Kong," which will surely be light years better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>This modernistic movie was based on the animated MTV series and a video game about an emotionless female assassin.  In 2011, life on earth was eradicated by some explosive device and the surviving group formed the perfect society called Bregna, ruled over by the Goodchild regime.  The dessident organization out to defeat this was a group who dressed in funky black clothes and used gymnastics and acrobatics to get around the security systems.<br /><br />Charlize Theron who won an Oscar for playing a real-life 'Monster,' now with a figure like Cyd Charisse, leads the way to the doom of the Goodchilds.  She feels like she is in a gilded cage but has dreams of memories she does not understand.  She said that she had a life once, but now all she has is a mission.  We must show the way.  She agrees to go to the Citadel where they will have their revenge and we will all have victory.  There, in the forum, she confronts Trevor, played by Marton Csokas, and acts like a female John Wilkes Booth until he calls her Catherine which rings a bell.  Nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for!  Trevor showed her what it felt like to be a person instead of an unfeeling thing.  He told her, "We both are still alive for a reason.  Everything changed when I saw you."  Both were clones of the originals and the doctor over the lab told her, "I knew you were important, so I saved your DNA."  In a war, people on all sides die.  There would have to be consequences to their indiscreet actions.  He is betrayed by his brother, Orrin, who declared that what he did was treason.<br /><br />Suddenly, the situation has changed and has become more complicated.  He'd told her, "You had your chance, so you know where to find me."  Clones, they realize, are just like ghosts.  I needed to protect you; you are an idea I kept alive.  She agrees, "I remembered you."  After their escape, she patched him together again.  We watch a slaughter down among the cherry blossoms and Orrin is defeated.  It's the end results that count in this case, not how pretty the path is getting there.  Aeon climbs aboard the cloning lab in the flying saucer with the gold trailers floating underneath and sets the explosives to destroy it.  After all, we are meant to live only once, but with hope.  The use of the heligraph of the 400-year-old doctor was very effective.  It was a good diversion from the cold weather and Christmas crowds and music.  It was a nice interlude into fantasy and sci fi at its best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>As one esteemed critic so aptly put it, "Fux fux sux fux sux sux sux".<br /><br />The animated series that appeared on Liquid Television was cool, especially for it's time. Liquid Television was a good show bringing viewers highly original and entertaining animation. As for the movie, in my opinion they completely blew it. Charlize Theron is talented but wasn't at all right for the part. I thought Carrie-Anne Moss would have been better. The movie wasn't at all like the TV show. The creator of Aeon Flux said upon seeing the movie he "felt helpless, humiliated and sad". They should have stayed true to the TV series and Peter Chung should have had creative input.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>It's puzzling why this film was so derided on its original release.  Clearly, it is not a classic, but it is enjoyable enough - one can only think that the media were out to get Charlize Theron after her recent Oscar win.<br /><br />It is the future - a short time from now a disease wipes out 99% of the population, until Trevor Goodchild finds a cure.  Now as the movie starts it is 400 years later and mankind is reduced to living in one walled city.  However, there is unrest in this Eutopia and resistance has sprung up, of which Aeon is one.  However, events unfold which lead her to question not just her orders but the truth of her very existence.  It's a neat set up, and the story is not as trite as you might expect - it has some genuine unexpected directions and a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />If the movie has a flaw, it's that it fails to find much heart - the Eutopia is by its nature pristine and cool, but the acting seems to fall into the same trap so that we don't find much humanity to relate to. This future is not just cool but sexy too - almost like an updated version of the future seen in 'Logans Run'.  If you have seen the movie you might be tempted to see this as a special effects movie, but in fact the effects serve the story well.<br /><br />All in all a satisfying tale, which is crisply photographed and has a cast and art direction which are very easy on the eye.  I recommend it for an undemanding evenings entertainment where action is desired, but not at the expense of story.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>I'm not a heavy sci-fi fan, but I like a well-done futuristic film. Aeon Flux has the action, thought-provoking storyline and unique unfolding plot that kept drawing me into the film. Acting is top-notch, storyline is complex and fun to follow, and the action and special effects are superb. An excellent cast, twisting plot and even costumes will interest you until the very end. Well worth the watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The world of "Aeon Flux" is set in the year 2415, which is basically four centuries after 99% of the human race was wipe out by a deadly virus.  What is left of humanity is living in Bregna, a protected city that is ruled by the wealthy Goodchild family and we find out that are 5 million people living in that city: which is the same number of survivors left alive when the plague was done killing off people.  Clearly life in the future is carefully controlled, and of course there are those who do not like the arrangement and who are committed to doing something about it, namely bring the whole thing down.  So, once again, a sterile futuristic world is challenged by those who sensibilities are more in keeping with our own.  If only somebody in the future had an actual personality, this 2005 film would be a lot more palatable.<br /><br />The Monicans are the rebels in this society and their primary goal is to kill the Goodchild brothers, Trevor (Marton Csokas), who is the leader, and Oren (Jonny Lee Miller), the second in command.  The killing machine Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron, reduced to playing a walking manikin) is the best agent for the Monicans, receiving her missions from the Handler (Frances McDormand), and working with her partner, Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo).  After her sister, Una (Amerlia Warner) is killed by the government, Aeon goes right after Trevor Goodchild in his Citadel to assassinate him.  But the ultimate confrontation involves Aeon finding out some information that terms the world upside down and sideways.  This is not actually that surprising, because the vibe we pick up from the bad guy is that he is not the sort of evil megalomaniac we expect to see running a futuristic world.<br /><br />There are some interesting things about this world, from capsules you swallow so you can receive other people's thoughts to learning a pointed lesson about why you do not walk on the grass in this brave new world.  The problem is that while there are things of interesting in this film, I never found "Aeon Flux" to be engaging.  What works as an animated series falls flat as live action, especially when the cast is reduced to two-dimensional performances that tend to make them indistinguishable from each other as the story spins out.  Peter Chung's MTV series provides plenty of ideas for visual treats but it does not translate into anything that proves to be memorably exciting.  But what made me round down on this one is that when we get to the big revelation, which compels us to rethink much of what we have learned about this futuristic society, my reaction was rather apathetic.  To make things worse, the more I thought about it the more I was disappointed that given what is really going on what happens in the movie was not more interesting.  After all, this society has been spinning its wheels for four centuries just to get up to this decidedly underwhelming climax.  It hardly seems worth the bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>I'd rate this movie 3.5. I'm not familiar with the Aeon Flux cartoon series, but after watching some clips from the Special Features of the DVD, I actually prefer the movie.  The cartoon Aeon has spazzy hair, is scantily clad in some strange male-fantasy sort of way, and I was a little disturbed by the scene of a man sticking his wiggling tongue into a woman's ear.  Borderline pornographic if you ask me.<br /><br />The movie version took some license, softened the hues, made the Bregna world stylish and organic.  I admit the plot is a bit oversimplified and the characters dramatically flat, but the physical action is a pleasure to watch. Charlize made for a gracefully efficient and lethal Aeon Flux.  She maimed her victims with elegance.  Somewhat contradictory in terms, but the action was very fluid and feminine.  I do like that director Karyn Kurasama chose to make a sci-fi futureworld that was very beautiful versus the traditional industrial, hardcore, burnt out look. Think of this movie as the softer version of the Matrix in haute couture.</p></br></body></html>

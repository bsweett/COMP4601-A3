On the other hand, it's filmed and acted with such a lack of pretension and such simple elegance that it ultimately ends up being deeply moving and very affecting.<br /><br />Since this 2006 remake is the exact and polar opposite of the original, let's dispense with any comparison right now, and concentrate on what we have in front of us with the new version. Although, since the new version is so horrifyingly dreadful, you might just want to skip it altogether: for all its flaws the original movie is much, much better.<br /><br />So basically, the 2006 Wicker Man typecasts Nicolas "Scary Hair Plugs" Cage as a traumatized ex-cop who departs California for the mysterious commune of Summersisle, when he receives a letter from his ex-fiancee Willow asking for his help in locating her missing daughter Rowan. Cue cult members, witchcraft, murder and... ...fish costumes?<br /><br />Anyway, Cage plays himself and the rest of the cast sort of mumble their way through an embarrassing script. Poor Ellen Burstyn must have needed the money: as Sister Summersisle her role promised me a reprieve from the Search-Yell-Search antics of Nicolas Cageennegger, but sadly, she's as bad as the rest of the cast. Leelee Sobieski and Diane Delano are unwatchable and the rest of the cast is composed of stock C-List horror movie "actors".<br /><br />The script is wholly charmless, but Neil LaBute's direction does provide one comparatively small plus point: Summersisle and its environs and contents do look suitably idyllic.<br /><br />Still, if idyllic scenery is what you're after, you'd be better off with a subscription to National Geographic: "Wicker Man" is a complete failure as a horror movie. It runs along similar lines to "Silent Hill" - missing daughter, creepy locale, cult-member natives - and, for all its many flaws, "Silent Hill" is a far better movie.<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague!</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I have never seen the original, so I didn't watch this one with any expectations or anything else to compare it to.  This movie is terrible.  It is not a horror at all.  It dances back and forth between being a supernatural experience, and a simple drama, without ever explaining.  The movie is boring.  Not once did it compel me, excite me, scare me, or give me any reason to sit there and watch.  Cage is fair in the movie, but no one really stands out.  Bascially a quick summary of the movie is that a cop goes to a strange island run by pagan feminists looking for his girlfriend's missing child.  Lot of strange images, fast forward to a crappy ending and role credits.  The shocking ending isn't that shocking.  I saw the twist coming a half hour into the picture.  The dvd ending is very unsatisfying.  I am going to go rent the original.  It has to be better.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>In the original 1973 version of "The Wicker Man," actress Diane Cilento says to Edward Woodward, "Personally, I think it makes a very lovely transmutation." She was referring to the soul of missing twelve-year-old Rowan Morrison becoming one with a dead rabbit. But never mind the rabbit or the girl; it stood alone as a very effective line, almost coming off as funny in an odd sort of way. How fitting for a film of such depth, with numerous hidden layers very much focused on transmutation. Specifically, it focuses on new perceptions of different beliefs and customs. Apparently, such ideas haven't crossed over into corporate Hollywood; the writers of this 2006 remake should have taken Cilento's line into consideration when penning the screenplay. The transmutation from British Cult Classic to American Horror Film wasn't that lovely. To be perfectly honest, it was downright heartbreaking.<br /><br />If there's any way in which this new "Wicker Man" outdoes the original, it's in its cinematography; the color palette is muddy and overwhelming, as if a painter had been a little too careless with his or her color combinations. It suited such a dark story perfectly, especially since it takes place on a remote island off the coast of Washington state. But a film's look means absolutely nothing if connected to a substandard story. Not only does this movie lack any of the original's genuinely unsettling aspects, it also skews the commentary on culture clash by means of unnecessary shock value. Instead of an isolated group of nature worshippers living in harmony, we now have an isolated group of extremists who revere the feminine and punish the masculine. Is it any wonder that they worship bees, an insect species with male drones working for the queen on a regular basis?<br /><br />This is a real shame for California police officer Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage), whose arrival on the island of Summersisle is apparently met with intense malaise. Part of the problem is that he came to them right before a yearly harvest ceremony, one that they've held sacred for hundreds of years. But none of this matters; because Malus' former fiancee Willow (Kate Beahan) wrote to him out of desperation, he's willing to grin and bear it. That's because Willow's daughter, Rowan (Erika-Shaye Gair), has gone missing. It's a pretty personal situation for Malus, who hasn't gotten over a car accident that killed a woman and a girl during a routine traffic stop. He has haunting visions of them both during the course of the movie, all of which initially seem relevant but ultimately serve no purpose.<br /><br />His emotional turmoil ineffectively replaces that of Sergeant Howie from the 1973 film; he was a deeply devout Christian, strictly adhered to old fashioned, conservative values. That aspect meshed well with the main plot, which involved him being thrust into a world he was completely unfamiliar with. It was the perfect setup for his interactions with the Summerisle natives, which worked better than they did for Malus in this remake. In the original film, Howie saw the natives as nothing more than heathens that believe in pagan ideals and perform morally reprehensible rituals. True enough; their free spirited worship of nature would take a little getting used to, especially since they constantly celebrated with song and dance and had much less repressive views on sex. But from the audience's perspective, they seemed like decent, innocent people. At least, it seemed so until the end of the movie (which I can't give away for those of you who haven't seen it).<br /><br />The same can't be said for the remake. The moment Malus steps onto the island, the audience is immediately turned off by the natives. They're consistently creepy, detached, and aloof, qualities that detract from instead of enhance the seriousness of Malus' state of mind. I say this because the thoughts running through his head are much more disturbing than the islanders' cold reception. I would have liked it much more if today's audience had been tricked like the audiences of the 1970s were; for them, it wasn't immediately obvious that something was wrong with the people, and that made the final scenes that much more unsettling. But for us, the new version leaves no question that these people are odd. Because of that, the formerly shocking aspects of the final scenes are now reduced to an unsatisfying inevitability.<br /><br />But before any of that happens, the mystery of Rowan grows deeper. Malus is continuously evaded as he attempts to get to the bottom of things. Passing around the girl's picture isn't getting anywhere, and neither is questioning the important locals (such as a schoolteacher, an innkeeper, and a doctor/photographer). No one seems to recognize her, despite the fact that he's found numerous clues of her existence (most notably her name written in the school registry book). Unfortunately, Willow is proving to be of little help. She secretly meets with him on a regular basis, each time giving him vague explanations that don't point at the truth so much as they barely hint at it. She claims to be afraid of the residents of Summersisle, convinced that they're trying to punish her for being so headstrong. She did, after all, leave her home and get engaged with an outsider.<br /><br />But the more Malus listens to her, the less sense the situation makes. With few resources left, he meets with Sister Summersisle (Ellen Burstyn), the religious leader of the island (portrayed as Lord Summerisle in the original film by Christopher Lee). Her speech on the founding of the island and on the importance of their beliefs does little to encourage Malus. However, it does convince him that he needs to act quickly; he firmly believes that Rowan is in danger, and he has to rely on no one else for help. He eventually realizes that he can't even rely on the law, which he had thus far been using to his advantage. (Odd, considering a California police officer would have no jurisdiction in Washington state. But I digress.)<br /><br />By the time we get to the ending and meet the barely mentioned Wicker Man, the audience will come to the conclusion that the experience has been nothing but wasted effort. I say this mostly in reference to the new story, which ineffectively attempts to frighten the audience. The methods used in each version of the film couldn't have been anything less alike. I suppose this wouldn't have been so bad had the remake not relied so much on the original film's structure (exempting the inclusion of a completely unnecessary epilogue, featuring a cameo by James Franco). The dialogue alone nearly repeats Anthony Shaffer's 1973 screenplay verbatim.<br /><br />Too bad such a fascinating film was reinterpreted--or transmuted, if you prefer--into such a disappointing horror flick. It isn't even impressive enough to recommend to those who haven't seen the original version. In that film, Christopher Lee says to Edward Woodward, "Perhaps it's just as well that you won't be here tomorrow to be offended by the site of our May Day celebrations." I should think it's just as well that the movie going public not be at the theater to be offended by the site of this remake. Much like the Wicker Man, it should be burnt to the ground.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The star of the original "Wicker Man," Christopher Lee, said it best: "What do I think of it? Nothing. There's nothing to say."<br /><br />And indeed there is little to say about this flaccid, nonsensical remake of the classic cult horror movie. Little that's positive, anyway -- the movie stumbles around blindly, trying to give itself atmosphere with hokey tricks and silly-looking cinematography. Put simply, "The Wicker Man" is a big, weird mess.<br /><br />Cop Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is recuperating from a traumatic incident, which means he's not on top form when his ex-fiance Willow (Kate Beahan) gets in touch with him. Her child Rowan has vanished, and she wants Malus' help. And so he travels to a remote northern island, ruled by the matriarch Sister Summerisle (Ellen Burstyn).<br /><br />It seems that the people there are some kind of bizarre neopagan tribe, and the women all hate Malus. The few men there are basically second-class citizens. And as Malus comes closer to finding the little girl who may be his daughter, he discovers a horrifying secret -- which is waiting for him.<br /><br />Remaking anything is a tricky business, and "The Wicker Man" takes the worst possible approach -- it tries to bluster through. It has a lot to bluster about, because there's no suspense, no atmosphere, and no horror -- only a lame and unsuspenseful mystery, and a bad acid-trip finale, with lots of people in animal costumes.<br /><br />To make matters worse worse, it feels like it was scripted by several different people who never bothered to consult each other. Allusions -- like Malus' tape -- are dropped. The emotional appeal is trite. The metaphors and symbolism are appallingly blatant, until you feel that Cage's character must be the biggest idiot on the Pacific coast if he hasn't clued in yet.<br /><br />Director Neil LaBute obviously has no idea how to bring this celluloid Frankenstein's monster to life. So he dresses Cage in a furry costume and saddles the incoherent script with weird bee analogies and absurd dialogue ("Killing me won't bring back your g*dd*mn honey!"), apparently hoping that it will overcome the flimsy plot.<br /><br />Even worse, sometimes it gets unintentionally campy or funny, when it's actually being deadly serious. The most unintentionally funny moment of the movie comes when Burstyn dramatically says, "Prepare the drone!" near the climax. You'll be rolling off your seat.<br /><br />Cage himself comes across as confused and over-the-top ("How'd it get burnt?" repeated over and over), and it's hard to care whether his character lives or dies. Burstyn does as well as can be expected, given that her matriarch is a pale shadow of Christopher Lee, and a pretty silly one at that. The other actors just sleepwalk through.<br /><br />Remakes are bad enough, but remakes of cult classics are simply unforgivable. It's not hard to see why this disjointed dud was a box-office disaster.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>a movie I can hate with the rest of the Amazon viewerati. I want to go to Nicolas Cage's house and break his legs for real after paying to see this travesty.

And ELLEN BURSTYN???</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>*The Wicker Man* was a major disappointment.  I thought it was going to be something like *Stirs of Echoes* or *The Skeleton Key*.  Something supernatural-ish.  Nah, it was far from it.<br /><br />Officer Malus (Cage) is on leave after surviving from a fiery accident and failing to rescue the victims.  Malus receives a letter from his ex-fiance, Willow, requesting his help to locate her missing daughter, Rowan.<br /><br />So, Malus goes to Summers Isle, which is some isolated island in the Puget Sound.  The people there are different.  Different is an understatement.  You would rather hang out with the Amish than with these people.  It seems like an Amish version of the Amazon women and Themyscira (Wonder Woman).  The women run the island.  The men seem to have been "Stepforded".<br /><br />Anyways, Malus is investigating the disappearance of Rowan.  People claim to not know Rowan or that she has perished.  Willow isn't much help either.  She eventually tells him that Rowan is his daughter.  This news spurs Malus to find Rowan immediately.<br /><br />When he does find Rowan, things become confusing for Malus.  It is revealed that he is the wicker man.  The problem is that the movie doesn't explain the meaning or purpose of the wicker man.  The lack of explanation has deemed the entire movie pointless.<br /><br />You're better off watching *2001 Maniacs* for an entertaining yet chessy  version of the story plot.  *The Wicker Man* was slow and unappealing.  I was definitely surprised that Nicholas Cage chose to be a part of this film.<br /><br />Anyways, you're not missing anything if you don't ever watch this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Firstly, I wish you all the merriest Beltane! Some cinephiles may celebrate May Day with a viewing of the wonderful cult classic film The Wicker Man, although it certainly works as a critique toward all faith.  I mean of course the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005KHJM">original 1973 film</a> and not its 2006 remake which I finally sat through recently and hated with great passion.  Neil LaBute directs and writes the screenplay, which is a bit surprising because his films haven't been significantly unimpressive; at least until now that is.  The cast includes the likes of Ellen Burstyn, Frances Conroy, Leelee Sobieski, Molly Parker and of course Nicholas Cage as the film's protagonist. All should've promptly fired their management. The music for this film is by veteran Angelo Badalamenti.  With that kind of talent you may on the surface wonder what could've gone wrong, but I can assure you that the flaws are many and they are actually quite easy to pinpoint.<br /><br />The Wicker Man is, in short, about a man who investigates a mysterious island after hearing about his ex-girlfriend's missing daughter.  The plot is roughly the same as the plot of the original, at least on the surface.  All of the changes, and I mean every last one of them, were made with no concern whatsoever to the elements that made the original film so compelling and unique.  Cage's character is not a virgin, nor is he notably religious in any way, which immediately eliminates the significance of the message from the original film.  If anything, Cage's character comes off as a bit misogynistic and the film's villain played by Burstyn comes off as a feminist.  Are we to believe that Cage deserved his fate for his misogyny or that the feminists are evil? Or both?  The festival of the original was of course for May Day, here it is for a completely made up holiday while the film takes place on an island off of an American coast as opposed to an island off of the coast of Scotland like the original film.  This was even PG-13 when one of the key elements to the original were the unconventional sexual overtones in the face of a devout Christian.  But let's not forget, no bewbs can be seen in American theaters by anyone under the age of 17, at least without an adult present to explain exactly what those are!  Amazing, especially with so many other gratuitous elements presented within this garbage.<br /><br />All in all, The Wicker Man remake was nominated for five Golden Raspberry awards and cost $35 million to make.  It made $32 million worldwide and has been as widely panned by critics as infamous stinkers like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AM6NV">Boat Trip</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXI1">Death to Smoochy</a>.  Thank goodness for that as we may have had an even worse sequel to worry about.  Even an actor like Nicholas Cage, who has a history of poor judgement in taking roles, should've known better than this.  It was evidently a huge waste of money to make and it will be a waste of money for you to buy.  I highly recommend the original for only two dollars more, but avoid this one at all costs unless you're searching for unintended laughter.  Cage prancing around and yelling in a bear suit is really funny, but the plot-holes alone will keep you smiling.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Several Hollywood agents should have been handed their pink slips for advising their clients to take roles in this upchucker, and director Neil LaBute should have had his director's card revoked.  That being said, THE WICKER MAN still furnishes entertainment in spades because it is so glaringly BAD.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage, as a stressed out cop looking for a missing girl on a remote and mysterious Puget Sound island is bad; creepy Kate Beahan as Cage's ex love interest and the mother of the missing child is bad; Ellen Burstyn, who is aging wonderfully and gracefully, but as the island's nutty cult leader is bad; and Molly Parker as the local manhating school teacher is bad.  Cage screams, Beahan looks confused, Burstyn smirks, Parker puts on a bird mask.<br /><br />There. . .just saved you a couple of bucks from Netflix.<br /><br />Seriously, from the wacky dialogue to gaping plot inconsistencies to Cage's ranting to just plain silliness, this flick begs the question:  Don't these guys know they're making a clinker?  And if they do, they're giving us bad filmmaking worth one knee-slapping howl after another.  (I still haven't stopped laughing from the sight of Cage running around in a bear outfit.)  THE WICKER MAN deserves only one star, but because it's so bad it actually entertains I'll give it two.  Pass that bird mask.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Nicolas Cage just didn't stand a chance once he landed on that island (Summersisle) off Washington State, full of wackos. I just tried to think how he was going to overcome all those "forces" against him, but to no avail. This movie does not have a happy ending. Unlike a lot of other horror movies, the hero just doesn't survive this one. If you're the type who roots for the "good guy(s)" in horror movies, this one isn't for you. Cage, as police officer Edward Malus is out of his league (an in definite need of a SWAT team) against this island of matriarchal pagan zealots; in the search for his missing daughter.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>What the hell? Is all I could say at the end of this movie. What the hell? As in, what the hell was Nick Cage thinking when he read this script and decided this film was a good project. Come on, is he really that hard up for work that he's only taking what he can get now. I think he seriously needs to find his agent and fire him immediately. This movie was so far below Nick Cage's talent and acting ability it's laughable. Frankly, Nick needs to stick to the action/drama genre because movies this bad can really murder a career. I really hate to do this for anybody who hasn't seen this movie yet, but at what point were the viewers actually suppose to be surprised that the sacrifice turns out to be him in the end. Whether you've seen the old one or not, I can't imagine anybody not seeing that part coming a mile away. Quit frankly, this movie is awful, and this is time out of my life I won't get back. Please, take this review as a warning, and spare yourself an evening of torment and boredom like I wish someone had spared me. If you are in a video store, remember this review and place it back on a the shelf. If someone wants to let you borrow it, respectfully turn it down, and get something else as fast as you can. I wish someone had warned me that watching this movie would've made me so frustrated that I would sacrifice myself to be delivered from the pain and suffering I felt while watching this, or even worse I'd rather eat a bowl of crushed glass and down it with a glass of alcohol rather than watch this movie a 2nd time. I'm sorry, I guess that was an exaggeration. This movie is just enough to stretch anyone's patience level.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>Let's not have anymore of this kind of so called mystery movies! Wicker Man will give you a very hard time trying to stay focused as hardly any  exciting events take place. Could this movie by any chance secretly be another M. Night Shalyman movie? The way the story is being told reminded me of the Village, that other boring creepy story. Nicholas Cage stars once again as a police officer who needs to investigate the disappearance of a little girl and ends up in a place that is dominated by women. Without giving away the plot it is fair to inform you, that Cage boring performance is illustrating the lack of credibility of The Wicker Man.<br /><br />He looks just as if he already realizes, that this movie, will not interest anyone.(SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>Although I'm not necessarily a Nicolas Cage fan, this film which centers around Cage's character came across very well. I think the film is very well made and it stands on its own -- I wouldn't compare it to the original from a few decades ago. The story is about a missing child on an island up in the Pacific Northwest. The island is controlled by a weird cult which is lead/directed by women -- man other than Nic Cage don't speak in this film. Of course, if you know the ending, then some of the interesting surprises will be known and then this flick may not be as interesting. My wife liked the film very much and she would probably give it five stars.<br /><br />Well, the scenery and photography is really good, and also the mood was well captured. Acting is also pretty good and Cage comes across believable. Is this movie worth watching? Yeah, I think so and I didn't think that my few bucks or my time were waisted. True, my expectations were a little higher than the actual delivery, as especially toward the end the film lost a bit of its quality and it became almost cheesy. It's not a horror movie and I didn't have any goosebumps, but again the scenery and photography were very good. This is a different kind of film and because of the cult aspect it fits more into the late 60s/early 70s era than into the present.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>While I don't believe the original "Wicker Man" with Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee is one of the 10 best DVDs in my collection, I do know it to be one of the most frightening movies I've seen.  The ending chilled me for weeks -- even though I knew all of the big spoilers beforehand -- and I'll still occasionally have "Wicker Man" nightmares.<br /><br />If I'd never seen the first film, and if I went into the remake cold -- as did most of the sparse crowd of theatergoers I saw this with -- would I have had those same feelings about this movie?  Would I still have nightmares years later?  The answer is "no".<br /><br />I'm not certain that Neil LaBute's gender politics are the reason this movie did not light any fires within me (pardon the pun, that was the best I could do).  If anything else, I knew this movie wasn't going to have a happy ending, and let's face it, the original movie's ending is what made it stand out.<br /><br />Maybe it was Nicolas Cage doing his usual shtick that soured me.  Sergeant Howie, the protagonist of the original, is a very dated figure to today's American audience, but he does command his own movie.  His quest became our quest, his horror became our horror.  Cage's "Officer Ed" (a nice homage to the original star) remains distant from the audience throughout: when the ending comes, his pleas for relief are unconvincing, his distress shown from too far off to be affecting.  The situation he finds himself in is horrible, but LaBute doesn't get the horror across.<br /><br />The goings-on on Summer's Isle are murky.  This is a Celtic witches' community, after 400 years of evolution away from the Old Country (Salem is mentioned, as if we didn't get the joke).  A local doctor (of the witch variety) refers to the "old ways", but LaBute leaves it to the audience to figure out what those ways were.  Bees are worshipped, their colony setup emulated.  The few men on Summer's Isle seem mute and emasculated, although again it's left to the audience to decipher their exact role.  A few moments of shock-horror -- a corpse's mouth sewn shut, a naked woman surrounded by thousands of bees -- don't linger after the credits roll.  The epilogue unites three sexy Young Hollywood actors, although this adds nothing to the movie that the final Cage vs. Ellen Burstyn sequence didn't tell on its own.  Even then, all the layers and complexities of Woodward's and Lee's final debate in the original movie don't survive into the virtual word-for-word rewrite here.<br /><br />In the end, it's impossible to rate this movie without comparison to the original.  On that basis alone, rent the original, and don't pay full theater price to see this version.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>There are several points during THE WICKER MAN that Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) has a pained look of exasperation on his face as he vainly searches to find a missing child, Rowan Woodward (Erika-Shayne Gair), on a mysterious and isolated island off the coast of Washington State that is ruled by a cult of pagan women.  The look on Malus face could very well be that of Cage as he slowly realized the horror of a movie that he had gotten himself into.  Not that Cage is at fault.  Nicolas is a great actor and despite having a resume that includes some of the most dismal pictures ever made (LEAVING LAS VEGAS), his very presence in a movie makes it a better picture than it would have been otherwise.  He's got the everyman appeal of Tom Hank, the charm of Cary Grant, and the acting skills of Al Pacino.  No, Nicolas Cage isn't the problem with this remake of THE WICKER MAN.  In fact, he's one of the reasons someone should see this movie.<br /><br />Perhaps, the plot and script are the culprit.  The film has changed greatly from the original cult classic that starred Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee.  The location is set in the U.S. on a small, isolated island off the coast of Puget Sound (the locations are amazing) instead of an isolated isle off near Scotland (is there such thing as an isolated island near Puget Sound anymore?).  Instead of a pagan cultic community taking desperate measures to bring favor to their gods, there is an enclosed community of women misandrists performing a ritual they perform every generation (by the way for those who believe in THE DA VINCI CODE, this is the type of world you would live in if that was true).  There are some major plot holes, e.g. the girl and mother who supposedly die in a fiery car crash and why exactly do the women worship bees again?  Nevertheless, much of the original THE WICKER MAN's key moments are a part of the film and the feminist cult setting updates and contemporizes the original film's tone in a way that would make most remade films proud; different but true to the original spirit (Edward Woodward who starred in the original THE WICKER MAN was offered a role in the film but declined to take it, but stated that he was "surprisingly impressed by the quality of the script" of the remake).<br /><br />No, the problem with this THE WICKER MAN isn't the acting or plot. It is the characterization.  Nicolas Cage does a great job, but Officer Edward Malus does not seem like a very likeable person.  He enjoys helping people and has a great deal of those two distinctive American qualities of individuality and self-reliance.  He's also very rugged and seems to be the type of person who would make a great golf partner or drinking buddy.  However, he's not at all like what Sister Rose (Molly Parker) calls him: quixotic.  No, Officer Malus is anything but quixotic (the school teachers at Summerisles are apparently even less intelligent than the students they teach).  Don Quixote was a nobleman who believed in an ideal.  Quixote's ideal might have seemed unrealistic and crazy, but it was an ideal that inspired those around him to live better lives than they would have otherwise.  Edward Malus isn't like that.  He seems more like someone suffering with bipolar disorder:  one moment he's very outgoing and jovial, the next he's yelling at the top of his voice and on the verge of throwing something or hitting something.  He willfully disrespects the law once he enters Summerisles, even though he is a man who is supposed to uphold the law.  He chases away the people who care from him most away either because won't let them get too close or because they are afraid of his angry wrath.  In short, he's a jerk. When Malus meets his fate, the audience doesn't really care.  Sure, it's all very violent and horrifying.  Yet, the audience is given the impression that it might have been a good thing.<br /><br />That's not what THE WICKER MAN is supposed to be about.  The original film was about a noble man (who was indeed quixotic) who met a very undeserved, horrifying, and grisly demise.  That original film is wicked because the bad guys seem to win.  The noble ideal is extinguished in flames of pagan lust.  That doesn't happen in this film.  Sure what Malus has to endure is horrifying, but because he doesn't represent an ideal, it's not all that shocking.<br /><br />THE WICKER MAN could have been an excellent film in the suspense/horror genre that added to the original movie it was remade from.  Instead, THE WICKER MAN isn't all that different from any other teen horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I had and have heard so much thru the years about The Wicker Man (the origional). I had heard that it was a cult classic and a forgotten gem. Well, I never saw all of the origional Wicker Man but some bozo put the entire end on Youtube so I got the basic premise of it. BUT I did just see the entire version that stars Nicolas Cage. I must say that I only saw about 15 minutes of the origional and it was better and had more depth than this dreck. The movie starts our ok but then just turns to blah. They leave out one of the things that made the origional good (or at least good to some people) that is the fact that the cop is a devout Christian that sets him off against this bunch of pagan fanatics. In this remake Cage is just a cop who experiences a tragic and traumatic event and then starts taking medication because he is so disturbed by what happened. They also change up the pagan weirdo's. They are still weird but they are kind of a man hating cult of freako bizarro strango people. They use men for labor and for 'breeding'. But anyway, this movie just isn't very good and Nicolas Cage proves again that he is not a very good actor and has little range beyond his usual quicky stuff.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor watch the Youtube clip if you are intriqued by hearing about this movie because the remake is not very good and from what I have heard and seen of the origional it's not very good either, weird and different but not good.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>The original wicker man is a classic b horror movie.

This is like a pale shadow of that movie and they didn't even get the stuggle of the lead characters relgious faith against the older and sometimes more dangerous celtic faith , at least on the island he's on. Nick Cage is a excellent actor but he can't even begin to save this movie as it's  lost the point of what the original wickerman film focus was.  Buy that one.  This is a hoot though for people who like bad horror films as it's a really bad horror movie with a higher budget, still the original is a great horror classic so that's not a good thing in this case.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"The Wicker Man",for some reason,was deemed ripe for a remake. The 1973 original has Christopher Lee as a sinister,sensual Lord Summerisle... but in this version, respected ex-Mormon playwright Neil LaBute decides to turn "Wicker Man" into an allegory about male insecurities in the face of feminine power. The original was Christianity vs. paganism, resurrection vs. reincarnation, timeless in tackling issues such as sex education. But LaBute, usually known for his sardonic social commentary such as "In the Company of Men", goes back to oh-so-contemporary cliches.<br /><br />In the new "Wicker Man",Nicolas Cage learns from his ex-fiancee Willow that her daughter (he's supposed to be a virgin,so he's not the father) has gone missing. Cage ventures to the Pacific Northwest, finding Ellen Burstyn leading a matriarchal cult with Leelee Sobieski at her side. Since the cult is centered on honeybees, colony collapse disorder is a big deal,and demands the final sacrifice.<br /><br />The "Wicker Man" has unintentionally hilarious moments,MANY of them. Nicolas Cage freaks out,bellowing,"How did it get burned?" when he confronts the ex-fiancee. Or the scene where has a vision of a drowning girl. There's "STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!" Or Nicolas Cage running around the beehives. Or Cage running around in a bear outfit. The final sacrifice scenes are even funnier. He gets his legs broken a la Misery,and for some reason,bees poured onto his face. While the original Summerisle was all about the union of men and women (how very heteronormative,then again,Lord Summerisle does dance in drag),in the remake, Summerisle seems to be a matriarchal lesbian colony.<br /><br />From Cage's overwrought "acting" to the ludicrous premise, "Wicker Man" crashes and burns.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>We had seen the original Wicker Man so we knew what the storyline was about, however this version left so much to be desired.  First, let me say, that I truly enjoy Nicolas Cage and think he is a wonderful actor, but he should have passed this movie up.  He did the best job he could do with what he was given, but the movie...well!  As you know he is searching for his ex-girlfriends daughter who turns out to be his own.<br /><br />Determined he insults everyone on this weird island and is totally clueless to what is about to happen to him. Which might I add waS totally gross. I was bored and I had some questions that I wanted him to find out the answers for....why did the men stay there (the few that they showed,) and why didn't they fight these woman?  Did they for sure kill any male children born?? The answers to these questions would have made the movie at least a little bit more interesting.  Anyway, I'll still enjoy Nicolas in other movies I'm sure, but this one needs to be put to sleep.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>There comes a time where every actor has at least one movie that bombed in the box office, and here is Nic Cage's turn.<br /><br />The begining of this movie starts with a scene that has been pulled off many times before in different time periods: Man pulls over car, car gets plowed by truck, man tries to save them, man lives in regret for not be able to.<br /><br />Afterwards, we slowly start to slouch into the life of Edward (Nic Cage) who recieves a letter from a woman he was involved with who says that her daughter is missing. First sign that it's a bad movie right here: He gets up and travels to this private island as if to say,"Well, I have nothing better to do."<br /><br />Then, to add insult to injury, the whole cast of characters are cult-like, amish-atire, creepy-slow-speaking people who pretty much scream, "Something is not right here! These people are part of a cult!" Yet it takes Edward, even with the badge of a cop, a long time to get really ticked in order to find some answers. What follows is an endless monatage of unrememerable scenes that leave you asking the questin, "Sheesh! When is this going to get better already?"<br /><br />And it doesn't stop there, even the twists in this movie have no prior setup and make no logical sense.<br /><br />Finally, the whole annoying idiotic cult, in their delusional glory, wrap this whole agonizing two hour bore-fest into the worst anit-climatic scene I've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />Pass this one up. It is no surprise how badly it did. It's like a bad cross between Blair Wicth and village of the damned.<br /><br />Trust me, you don't want to know what the wicker man is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>In cynical fashion, the major studios churn out needless remakes aimed at young moviegoers who lack imagination to track down the originals. The latest casualty is "The Wicker Man" - writer-director Neil LaBute's desecration of the 1973 British horror favorite. Like most contemporary remakes, it has been justly ignored. Hollywood's creative bankruptcy never ceases to astonish me.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Nicholas Cage stars as Edward Malus, a California police officer who goes on a leave of absence after witnessing a tragedy on the job.  Taking pills to soothe the effects of his post-traumatic stress disorder, Edward is in a weak place when he receives a letter from his ex-fiance, Willow, requesting his assistance in finding her missing child.  She bids him come to Summerisle, a small island off the coast of Puget Sound, and help her find her daughter, Rowan.<br /><br />When Edward first arrives it's clear that Summerisle isn't like other places. Quite frankly, it's the land that time forgot.  The women dress like pioneers and the men--well... there don't appear to be many men around.  When Edward starts investigating Rowan's disappearance, he hears a different story depending on who he speaks to.  Rowan is either: not even Willow's daughter, nonexistent, dead, or soon to die.  Refusing to give up, Edward delves deeper into this strange community shrouded in mystery, secrecy, and deception.<br /><br />The Wicker Man is not for those who can't tolerate trash, as is pretty obvious from the other reviews.  I, however, revel in how far a movie can go in its efforts to be different. And different is putting it mildly where The Wicker Man is concerned.  Also, for those who can't stand needless violence, at least three women were punched in the face over the course of this movie. Furthermore, there is a scene toward the end when everyone in the village is dressed in animal costumes that made me think I might have stumbled upon an acid trip gone wrong. You've been warned.<br /><br />It's difficult to put into words how spectacularly bad this film is.  I honestly think you should see for yourself.  Not for full price, mind you, but at a matinee or second-run theater.  It's worth it for the experience of wondering if you could actually be watching something so completely out of touch with reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The star of the original "Wicker Man," Christopher Lee, said it best: "What do I think of it? Nothing. There's nothing to say."<br /><br />And indeed there is little to say about this flaccid, nonsensical remake of the classic cult horror movie. Little that's positive, anyway -- the movie stumbles around blindly, trying to give itself atmosphere with hokey tricks and silly-looking cinematography. Put simply, "The Wicker Man" is a big, weird mess.<br /><br />Cop Edward Malus (Nicholas Cage) is recuperating from a traumatic incident, which means he's not on top form when his ex-fiance Willow (Kate Beahan) gets in touch with him. Her child Rowan has vanished, and she wants Malus' help. And so he travels to a remote northern island, ruled by the matriarch Sister Summerisle (Ellen Burstyn).<br /><br />It seems that the people there are some kind of bizarre neopagan tribe, and the women all hate Malus. The few men there are basically second-class citizens. And as Malus comes closer to finding the little girl who may be his daughter, he discovers a horrifying secret -- which is waiting for him.<br /><br />Remaking anything is a tricky business, and "The Wicker Man" takes the worst possible approach -- it tries to bluster through. It has a lot to bluster about, because there's no suspense, no atmosphere, and no horror -- only a lame and unsuspenseful mystery, and a bad acid-trip finale, with lots of people in animal costumes.<br /><br />To make matters worse worse, it feels like it was scripted by several different people who never bothered to consult each other. Allusions -- like Malus' tape -- are dropped. The emotional appeal is trite. The metaphors and symbolism are appallingly blatant, until you feel that Cage's character must be the biggest idiot on the Pacific coast if he hasn't clued in yet.<br /><br />Director Neil LaBute obviously has no idea how to bring this celluloid Frankenstein's monster to life. So he dresses Cage in a furry costume and saddles the incoherent script with weird bee analogies and absurd dialogue ("Killing me won't bring back your g*dd*mn honey!"), apparently hoping that it will overcome the flimsy plot.<br /><br />Even worse, sometimes it gets unintentionally campy or funny, when it's actually being deadly serious. The most unintentionally funny moment of the movie comes when Burstyn dramatically says, "Prepare the drone!" near the climax. You'll be rolling off your seat.<br /><br />Cage himself comes across as confused and over-the-top ("How'd it get burnt?" repeated over and over), and it's hard to care whether his character lives or dies. Burstyn does as well as can be expected, given that her matriarch is a pale shadow of Christopher Lee, and a pretty silly one at that. The other actors just sleepwalk through.<br /><br />Remakes are bad enough, but remakes of cult classics are simply unforgivable. It's not hard to see why this disjointed dud was a box-office disaster.<br /><br />(Merry Christmas to all!)</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>It's that bad.<br /><br />I've always been enamored of the original version.

What I did notice throughout was a direct rip-off of Nicholas Roeg's '73 "Don't Look Now", with an equally disappointing end for our hero. The sad thing is that where Roeg used style and focus, this film seems wrought with silly masks and over-acted hysteria. I didn't hate it as much as the others did, but I'm definitely going to seek out the original. Yes, the acting was pretty bad and unbelievable, though I liked Diane Delano (a Kathy Bates look-alike), and Leelee Sobieski's fine talents were badly wasted. This remake also reminded me a lot of Shyamalan's "The Village", though, again, it lacked style. Director Neil Labute is a talented man, but this one is best forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>Sometimes I write long reviews and other times a short review works just as well.  To compare this in any way to the classic movie of 1973 is an insult and to call this film a remake is an insult to all halfway decent remakes.  This is the only movie Cage stars in that I have to go with the majority and say that he is not a good actor.  Most of the time with Cage movies even if the story isn't very good he is at least passionate about the role.<br /><br />That just never arrives here.

She lives on a small island in the Pacific Northwest and her daughter is missing.  She has asked Cage to help.  Seeing a chance to save a child Cage sets off on the wild adventure.<br /><br />On the island he meets a strange group of women who don't like him being there.  They also don't believe there is a girl missing.  Cage knows there must be something going on and bullheadedly continues his investigation.  Nothing seems to make sense but something about an upcoming festival seems to be at the heart of things.  Eventually we get the shocking surprise ending we all expect.<br /><br />Although there are Pagan beliefs in this film, it lacks the true Christian/Pagan conflict of the original.  We are also missing the Christopher Lee character and the wrinkle about what if it doesn't work (Lee's life was on the line in the original).  But still, the film manages to elicit many of the same feelings as the original while also being fresher and newer.

I will say that I really adore B horror movies that border on camp, and that's how I took this movie.

If you like your plots loose, disjointed, and full of unanswered questions, this is your film.  (Personally, I have a hard time figuring out why one of my favorite actresses, Leelee Sobieski, is stuck playing a fairly insignificant role in any film, but that's just me.)  Still, despite quite an over-the-top performance by Cage and a less than stellar plot, this movie isn't all that bad, especially for those who have never seen the original film.  One thing you cannot take away from The Wicker Man is its distinctly un-Hollywoodlike ending.  The conclusion alone makes the film worth watching, if you ask me, because it throws a monkey wrench into the years of programming droned into our heads by Hollywood lackies lacking the guts to rock any cinematic boats.  This modern incarnation of The Wicker Man may be a fairly disappointing movie overall, but the ending will greatly defy most viewers' expectations - and I count that as a good thing.<br /><br />The beginning of the film can boast of its own fair amount of shock value, as well - a traumatic accident that sends officer Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) for quite a loop.  Then, from out of nowhere, he gets a letter from his former fianc&eacute;e asking for his help in finding her missing daughter.  This girl, Willow (Kate Beahan, who's quite a looker in my book) basically walked out on him for no reason a number of years earlier, so it's strange for her to be contacting him now.  It's also strange that the letter arrived with no stamps or postage.  The strangest thing of all, though, is the fact that this letter is a model of calligraphy, not exactly the kind of writing you would expect to see from the hand of a mother desperately worried about her missing daughter.  Edward bites, though, and takes it upon himself to head out to Summersisle, a mysterious, very private island off the Washington coast, to try and help Willow find her daughter.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious from the start that Summersisle is the abode of a crazy back-to-nature, feminist witch-like cult, so Edward would not have been welcomed with open arms even if he hadn't thrown his weight around like he's Columbo come to solve the big mystery of the week (even a bunch of reclusive pagan cultists probably know that a California badge counts for jack squat on a private island hundreds of miles away).  Being a traffic cop and not an investigator, Edward has a heck of a time just figuring out whether the girl, Rowan ever existed, if she actually died, or if she still lives, but his instincts tell him that Rowan is to be sacrificed to appease the angry gods of a ludicrous cult of bee-happy women.  Don't expect a Mr. Mustard with a candlestick in the library ending here.  Edward Malus is no Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original 1973 The Wicker Man, I think this movie is well worth watching.  Just watch out for all the plot holes, don't get too distracted by the wealth of unanswered questions the story leaves in its wake, and prepare for a conclusion that may actually surprise you.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`The Wicker Man' done originally in 1974 is a great English cult film, similar in many ways to the earlier English film version of William Golding's high school favorite novel, `Lord of the Flies'. And, just like `Lord of the Flies', we are now treated to a Hollywood remake of this classic with co-producer Nicholas Cage in the lead role created by Australian actor, Edward Woodward in the original flick.<br /><br />I am happy to say that the remake of `The Wicker Man' is better than the remake of `Lord of the Flies', where the filmmakers seemed to totally miss the point of Golding's story. The new `The Wicker Man' did change a fair amount of the story, but largely what was really essential to moving the scene from an island off Scotland to an American island in Washington State, in Puget Sound.<br /><br />The primary problem faced by the filmmakers is that in the original story, much was made of the traditional English class system with a traditional Manor House landlord, emphasis on the `lord' business in charge of the `private island' with an otherwise very peculiar social system. The modern storytellers got a lot of mileage out of their paradigm shift from English noble to cult matriarch at the head of a little society patterned after the society of bees, which happens to also be the island's main industry, replacing the orchard agriculture in the English original. These changes are to the good. The only problem with the switch from apples to bees is that while apples are not normally grown on the Scottish islands, bees are not at all out of place in Puget Sound. This looses a useful clue to the unusual nature of this island community.<br /><br /> Another fairly effective change is to make the lead character policeman (Cage) allergic to bee stings. Somewhat less effective is providing the California policeman with a back story which connects him to a resident of the Summersisle community (The modern movie adds an extra `s' to aid in pronouncing the name), making him the father of the missing little girl, the bait which the mother uses to draw cop Cage to the island.<br /><br />I think the problem with this backstory is that while Cage and Woodward are both playing policemen, Cage is out of his jurisdiction and his police authority is really a shadow with no real weight. Woodward, on the other hand, has official standing on his island and is fully authorized to make arrests and conduct investigations.<br /><br />Otherwise, the story plays out in almost exactly parallel scenes starting at the point at which Cage arrives at on the island.<br /><br />The original movie had a purely realistic story, where the only supernatural element was in the island inhabitants' beliefs. There were no supernatural threats and not even too many menacing flashbacks or dreams. The remake remained true to this point of view, and improved on it just a bit by drawing parallels between the Summersisle community and the Amish, where both exhibited anti-technological biases. I think I also saw a hint of parallel being drawn to the puritan witches of Salem, Massachusetts.<br /><br />Of course, nature was called in to help out by blanking out cell phone reception on the island. One problem both movies shared is that they were marketed as `horror' movies. While the sense of threat is constant throughout most of the movie, it is not really the kind of supernatural threat we get in most Stephen King stories. Like `Psycho' and `Ten Little Indians', the source of threat is entirely based on purely human, albeit quite pathological, behavior. The isolated venue does create similarities with stories such as `Alien' and `House on Haunted Hill' where the victim(s) are physically cut off from any outside help, but here, the primary thing keeping Cage / Woodward on the island is the obsession with the lost girl. I also note a strong similarity with the movie `Don't Look Now' where the plot is driven by fleeting glimpses of a little lost girl.<br /><br />In the end, the modern `The Wicker Man' makes the Summersisle inhabitants just a bit more loony and therefore just a bit less believable in their realistic setting. While one can easily imagine descendants of Druids celebrating May Day with animalistic costumes, neither the Amish nor a hippie holdover connection works quite as well. Too bad cinema finances prevented the filmmakers from keeping the venue back in the old country. While Cage is a superb actor, I think Woodward's matter of fact, `just the facts, Madam' tone of the English constable fits against the background of the tree worshipping islanders. The islanders don't have to be quite so bizarre to stand out behind Woodward's low-key tone. This also means that the original movie gives much less away early on. The unraveling of the threat and the climax comes more slowly and subtly. But when it does, it's a far bigger surprise.<br /><br />Last but not least, I think the current director, Neil LaBute, should have studied the camera work on the last scene of the original more carefully. The original director did a much better job of revealing the climax venue, even in black and white.<br /><br />So, while Cage is ultimately a more interesting actor than Woodward, I would still recommend the original over the remake if what you want is a really good rendition of the story. I will say that the modern `The Wicker Man' has my favorite DVD extra, a commentary soundtrack including the director, editor, and a few of the lesser actors (I think casting Ellen Burstyn was a waste of her talent. They did such a good job of casting the minor women on the island, but Burstyn just didn't seem to work as the queen bee.). This commentary easily doubles the value of the DVD. The `shocking Alternate Ending' is just a bit more graphic violence added to the telling of the final scene, which adds nothing to the meat of the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>This movie does miss the mark. Not only did they move the scenes to america, they changed the main evil characters sex and a few other liberties were taken.<br /><br />But the underlying plot is still a good one.<br /><br />Asked to investigate a missing child, a detective goes on his own to try and solve the case only to ultimately find out he is to become a human sacrifice.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is Nicholas Cage's acting is over the edge. There is a great gap in the other's acting and his. The sense of brooding and paranoia doesn't come through. And there's no growing feeling of doom either. It's as though the characters are just interpreting lines to their own liking instead of playing the movie out together... as a team.<br /><br />The Wicker Man is a wonderful mystery. However, I heartfully recommend the original way above this one. It plays on your fears, developes the senses of urgency, deadly secrets and dread.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Edward Malus (Cage), a California cop, is looking into the disappearance of an old girlfriend's daughter.

Once there, Malus encounters a bizarre pagan cult that puts fertility and death on pedestals via annual festivals.  The cult is made up primarily of women with a few men on the island to do handiwork.  Malus believes that the cult has taken Willow's daughter for some sort of ritual and sets out to prove it.  For those unfamiliar with the conclusion of the original, the ending may be a bit of a shocker.<br /><br />Like others have stated, the acting is a little iffy.  Cage puts in a decent performance, but his antics sometime border on slapstick.  Leelee Sobieski has a minor role as one of the sisters in the cult.  Her performance is pretty good.  Kate Beahan portrays Willow.  She turns in one of the weaker performances in the movie.  Molly Parker is fun as Sister Rose and her twin sister.  The biggest letdown in the flick is the performance of Ellen Burstyn.  Her loopy, feminist Sister Summersisle adds a new dimension of cheesiness when she makes her appearance.<br /><br />With all of that said I still believe that "The Wicker Man" at least deserves a rental.  It isn't as terrible, in my opinion, as much of the rest of today's remakes or even originals for that matter.  It's not going to win any big awards, but it is a decent way to kill one-and-a-half hours of a rainy day.<br /><br />It's a rental, nothing more, nothing less.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>The reviews here are unbelievable. They make Neil LaBute's 2006 remake of "The Wicker Man" out to be an incredulous turkey of astronomical proportions on the level of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "American Beauty." Well, I just saw it twice -- both the widescreen theatrical cut and the full screen cut with the Director's alternative ending -- and I can safely tell you that it's all a bunch of malarkey.<br /><br />First of all, let's be honest about the original 1973 version: Yes, it's a unique and original film in multiple ways and has numerous strengths, including fine Scottish locations and the presence of Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt (the former's siren-like "How Do" song & dance is a definite highlight), but it's certainly not the masterpiece that many claim. What's wrong with it? For one thing, the protagonist Edward Woodward (Sgt. Howie) is incredibly annoying and unlikable; he comes off as a self-rigteous, Pharasaical tighty-righty (this is how he struck me and I'm a Christian!). This is a serious flaw when you consider that the entire film focuses on Woodward's progressive search for the missing girl. In addition, Christopher Lee is just 'there' as Lord Summerisle (which, I know, is blasphemy to Lee fans since Lee considered his part in "Wicker Man" his personal best). The biggest problem with the original is that the film plays out in a dull way; the plot itself is interesting, but the delivery is less than compelling.<br /><br />Woodward is so unlikable and annoying that, on some subconscious level, I was almost glad with his outcome at the end. Which brings up another criticism of the original film: I simply didn't find the ending horrifying. It was supposed to be, but somehow it wasn't.<br /><br />One last criticism of the 1973 original is that it's understandably dated. It's obvious a product of the free-love hippie era and it shows. If any film screamed out for a remake this was it. I was therefore looking foward to Neil LaBute's 2006 version.<br /><br />THE PLOT: The story in this new version switches to America. Nicholas Cage plays a California cop searching for his ex-fiance's daughter on a mysterious privately owned island in Washington's Puget Sound. The society is backwards, pagan and matriarchal in nature; the men are mute and second class. As the film progresses Cage comes to see that the inhabitants are lying to him about the girl's disappearance.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: First of all, unlike Woodward, Cage is likable as the protagonist (or, at least, we can relate to him). His mounting frustration and anger over the situation are understandable. When he ultimately turns to outright violence against the women, we understand what has driven him to such actions.<br /><br />The British Columbian locations are good, pretty much on a par with the Scottish locations of the original in their own unique way.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is better than Christopher Lee as the villain. We don't even meet her until a full hour into the film and she fittingly comes off as a creepy religious psycho (just because she's pagan doesn't mean she's not religious). Lee was bland in the original.<br /><br />Molly Parker as the school teacher and Leelee Sobieski are quite fetching (with Kate Beahan a distant third). Molly and Leelee are fully clothed at all times and yet somehow ooze beauty. Molly, in particular, has a very unique loveliness to her. One reviewer complained that there weren't any scenes of naked women as was frequently the case in the original, but the director didn't feel the need to go the softcore porn route. Lebute expertly shows that true beauty is far more than numerous displays of softcore eroticism and overt nudity. If you want that rent a porn video.<br /><br />The story is entertaining, fun and, at times, even unintentionally hilarious. For instance, the scene where Cage talks with the "barmaid" and the patrons has some laugh-out-loud aspects. There are numerous other humorous moments (Cage apprehending the bicycle: "STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!", running around in a bear costume, the dead girl suddenly appearing in his arms on the dock, numerous hilarious lines like "OH NO, NOT THE BEES, NOT THE BEES!!", etc.) but the picture somehow maintains a serious aura. The original, by contrast, was dead-pan serious and never entertained in this manner.<br /><br />The ending is horrifying (WAY more so than the original), even though I knew it was coming. If you're in the right mood it can also be funny. The alternate ending is even better with the inclusion of overt torture scenes (although I know why they cut one of the torture scenes, the bees would have killed Cage since he was allergic to them). The Wicker Man prop is intimidating and over twice the size of the original.<br /><br />In the theatrical version there's a "6 months later" coda tacked on, which is an important scene. It shows how pre-meditated the actions of the women are in the film. It also explains one of Leelee's mysterious lines earlier in the story, "When you leave, take me with you." This sequence shouldn't have been cut from the alternate ending.<br /><br />The DVD, incidentally, features the theatrical cut on one side and the alternative-ending cut on the other. Unfortunately the vocal track is slightly off on the alternative cut. There's also a trailer and a decent commentary track with the director, Leelee, Kate and one other person (I didn't listen to the entire commentary, but what I did hear was informative).<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The search-in-the-barn sequence is pretty useless, but adds to the mounting mystery. Also, the story really bogs down in the graveyard scene where Cage and Kate have a heart-to-heart talk.<br /><br />Some people may look down on the film because of the numerous unintentionally funny scenes noted above. I think it makes it more entertaining. If you don't agree with me STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!!<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: Both the 1973 and 2006 versions of "The Wicker Man" are 4/5 Star films and are equally valuable for their positive aspects noted above. The insane criticisms of the remake are unwarranted (remakes are, of course, a lose-lose situation: if the film in question is remade frame for frame like "Psycho" people complain, and if the filmmakers deviate from the original they'll complain even more; you can't win). The fact is that the 1973 version is severely dated and NEEDED to be remade, and this is a good updating. I wasn't disappointed. It's definitely worth catching if you like mounting mystery stories with creepy, horrifying elements. On top of this there are numerous humorous aspects. And, thankfully, the protagonist isn't some irritating religionist with a corncob stuck up his arse.<br /><br />Lastly, you won't understand unless you see it but this remake is destined to become a cult classic -- loved or reviled, it's entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>I did like the settings and the colors - the acting was excellent - the plot confusing for a while -- in the end just plain gross.<br /><br />Poor, demented Edward -- why didn't he just shoot someone when he had the chance?<br /><br />maybe worth one watching but -------- not worth the aggrevation of finding the Wicker Man.

Admittedly, the original "The Wicker Man" really is not a good horror movie to begin with.  In short, the original is an interesting portrayal of a paganistic society, but it is not scary, nor is it very interesting or entertaining.<br /><br />As undynamic as original "The Wicker Man" is, the remake relishes in its own futility beyond belief.  Nicholas Cage was just awful in his role as the police officer, and the rest of the cast turned in forgettable performances at best.  The liberties with the original script that the makers of the remake took are of negligible effect except to perhaps bring an already boring movie down to an even lower level of insipidity.  Aside from the poor acting, my first thought after seeing the remake was, "what is the point?"  It simply did not make any sense to remake this movie at all.  It seems Hollywood's reasoning to remake old horror films (other than to just make money of course) is to give the film a present-day feel to it.  I don't really see the point though because what inevitably happens is that the atmosphere and mood of the original is forever lost in the remake's new age flavor.  Hence, an exercise in futility is the end result.  Such is the case with the remake of "The Wicker Man".<br /><br />In all fairness, everyone should see the original "The Wicker Man" at least once.  Christopher Lee's hairdo in the movie is simply fabulous--in a humorous kind of way of course. :)</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>Whenever someone tells you a movie was a cult hit in the 70's, you should be very wary of its entertainment potential.  You have to remember lots of people did lots of drugs in the 70's, which made James Taylor, disco and the original The Wicker Man seem much cooler than they are.<br /><br />Based on the 70's cult hit (I warned you), Nicolas Cage stars as California sheriff Edward Malus.  After witnessing a horrific accident and failing to save the victims, he has fallen into a great depression.  One day, he receives a letter from his old fianc&eacute;e, Willow (Kate Beahan), begging for help in finding her lost daughter.  Compelled by current circumstances and his desire to help a woman who meant so much to him in the past, he travels to her remote island community in the Puget Sound, and starts an investigation that leads to great peril.<br /><br />Was Willow's daughter kidnapped?  Why?  What has become of her?<br /><br />When he was reading the script, and saw the part of the movie where he is supposed to run through the forest in a bear suit, I hope Cage asked for a huge pay raise.  If he didn't, I have lost all respect for him because this movie is a silly piece of junk you should only participate in for a huge sum of money that makes up for the assault on your integrity (I can handle movie fans all across the world laughing at me if it helps buy a Bulgarian castle like the one Cage just purchased).<br /><br />Writer/director Neil Labute does include some frightful moments, but they are cheap frights that have nothing to do with advancing the story or helping understand the characters better.  Then, he takes us through an unacceptably meaningless plot that can be predicted within the first 15 - 20 minutes even if you never knew the movie was a remake.  The dialogue is supposed to be mysterious and get us more intrigued, but just ends up mocking the horridness of the movie on the big screen before you.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Edward is sent running all around the island in a series of uneventful scenes that fail to build any tension partly because they are ill-conceived (based on the original script by Anthony Shaffer) and partly because Labute makes the action move at the speed of a glacier.  However, if you fall asleep, Cage will wake you up with his ranting and raving.<br /><br />While the rest of the characters are all moving through the movie in a haze (you'll understand why when you learn about the story or, God forbid, see this movie), Cage gets ample opportunities to ham it up as Edward gets pushed further and further over the edge.  Most of the performance feels forced, which is a shame from someone as talented as Cage, but I think he was trying to compensate for the disaster going on all around him.<br /><br />The Wicker Man commits the worst sin a serious thriller, action film or horror movie can - it is outright silly and laughable.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Every couple months or so, there seems to be a slew of horror film re-makes that flood the market.  We had Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Hills Have Eyes, and even the upcoming Black Christmas, and now, another classic horror film has a needless, pointless re-make, and it's the Wicker Man.  Nicolas Cage stars as a cop investigating the disappearance of a young girl in a mysterious island community.  What he soon discovers is a religious cult that has their own secret, and thus, let the schlock fest begin.  What many fans of the original film, this one included, complained about the most, was the gender transforming of Lord Summersisle (originally played by Christopher Lee) into a woman (Ellen Burstyn).  While Burstyn does her best, Cage is wooden, and the rest of the cast, including Deadwood's Molly Parker and Leelee Sobieski, are just plain bad.  Not to mention that where the original film was a creepy, sexy, haunting satire of differing religions and communities, this version is just a watered down, wanna-be horror film with lame, typical conventions that you see coming before the film even starts.  All in all, the Wicker Man re-make is nothing that is worth seeing, but fans of the original classic already know this.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>I am always hesitant to totally trash a movie since I know how much work goes into trying to create something entertaining...........BUT... having said that I also feel an obligation to warn others about something HORRIBLE as much as telling them about something GREAT.<br /><br />Okay... there is no other way to say it...<br /><br />The Wicker Man is horrible, ridiculous, bland, silly, stupid, idiotic, lame, boring , insulting.... etc..<br /><br />This will rate as one of the 5 WORST films I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />Yes.. it is THAT BAD !<br /><br />No surprise this came and went without ever being noticed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Wicker Man (Neil LaBute, 2006)<br /><br /> I have come to the conclusion that Nicolas Cage is a man with impeccable taste. First, obsessed with Begotten, he tabs Elias Merhige to direct Shadow of the Vampire. Then, when he wants to jump on the horror-film-remakes bandwagon, he chooses a brilliant, literate movie that easily ranks among the finest ever made.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, taste does not necessarily translate into talent. "Desecration" is far too tame a word to use for what Messrs. Cage and LaBute have done with this Wicker Man remake. I have seen a good number of the recent horror-film remakes, and I have seen a lot of them that were awful. The Wicker Man is by far the worst of the lot.<br /><br />The story remains the same: a mainland detective, Edward Malus (Cage) gets a frantic letter from one of the residents of the secluded private island Summerisle-- excuse me, SummersIsle-- stating that one of the island's young girls is missing. When he gets there, he finds an island out of time, as it were, one where the inhabitants live by their own laws. Malus fights to impose the outside world's system on theirs with increasing desperation as he tries to find the child, whom no one on the island admits even exists (save Malus' old girlfriend Willow (Chopper's Kate Beahan), the child's mother).<br /><br />What makes the original movie great is the detail Robin Hardy and Anthony Shaffer paid to the religion and customs of Summerisle, and how well Edward Woodward's Sgt. Howie fits into its life there-- as a strict Catholic, he understands the idea of fervent worship, and the religion presented there is a powerful temptation for him. (To go any farther with this analogy would constitute a spoiler for the original movie-- which, if you haven't seen, you must.) Everything is consistent down to the last detail, and it all fits together-- when you get to the end of the film, you realize that all that "gratuitous" shocking material was actually an integral part of the plot. None of this can be said for the remake. LaBute (who also wrote this new adaptation) replaces Howie's faith with an allergy to bees. Really. He also monkeys with the mechanics of the kid in order to, presumably, give Malus a more personal reason for trying to find the kid, and in doing so unravels a vast portion of the tapestry that holds the entire movie together-- replacing it with something so slapdash it seems they didn't even notice everything was falling apart until they were shooting, and simply had Ellen Burstyn improvise a line or two.<br /><br />Then there's the matter of Nicolas Cage's acting. Perhaps the less said about it the better, but if we was trying to convey the same intensity and duty of Sgt. Howie, he badly missed the mark. Howie's expressions of horror during the climax of the original film ring so true that it's hard to imagine a viewer questioning that, at the very least, Edward Woodward was so into the role that he really felt the disgust and despair in the exhortations he made to his God to save him. Cage's Malus, on the other hand, is laughably bad. It doesn't help that the script breaks so very, very many rules of writing decent dialogue (for the love of god, man, "ow, my legs!" was about the worst line of dialogue, given its placement, I've heard since Night of the Lepus), and that Cage overacts every one. In contrast, Ellen Burstyn's Lady SummersIsle (and the addition of that "s" may actually be the most annoying detail in the entire movie) has none of the vitality and charm Christopher Lee brought to the role of Lord Summerisle; she seemed as if she were trying to reprise some odd combination of Judi Dench's character in As Time Goes By and any given screen incarnation of Jeeves. It's absolutely pathetic, and just when Burstyn's career was undergoing a well-deserved revival.<br /><br />As for all that not-so-gratuitous explicitness, kiss it goodbye. The schoolroom scene, one of the more shocking in the entire canon of seventies film, does exist here, but as a shadow of its former self. I think LaBute stuck it in for the sole purpose of appeasing the people who were going to compare this one to the original. If so, well, frying pan, meet fire-- it would have been better without the scene altogether, and I say that as a blind, drooling devotee of Molly Parker, who plays the schoolmistress here (and would otherwise get so little screen time in the movie as to not really deserve an acting credit.) (Oh, and what was with the twin thing? Was the importance of that scene, assuming it had any, left on the cutting-room floor?).<br /><br />I could go on listing the vast catalog of reasons this is, to date, the worst movie I've seen so far this year, but what's the point? It all boils down to one thing-- avoid this mess and find a copy of the 104-minute print (the most complete available) of Robin Hardy's 1973 original, one of the finest films ever made.

It's "so bad that's it good."  I'm not one of them.<br /><br />Because I enjoyed the original film from the 1970s.  That film had a mood, a point, an intelligence behind it.<br /><br />What does this film have?  Nic Cage mugging.  Some weird feminist cult.  And countless reasons that American cinema will totally screw up an original foreign film.<br /><br />In the original film, Edward Woodward is a devout Christian police officer searching for a missing girl on a creepy island of pagans.  He eventually falls into their hands and dies a martyr's death, holding onto his faith to the end.<br /><br />In this version...well...Americans are squeamish when it comes to the whole religion thing.  So Nic Cage can't have any beliefs of his own.  And Americans would also have a tough time reconciling themselves to a tragic ending for such a pious man.  So Nic Cage is...a jerk.  A moron.  A woman-beater.<br /><br />Of course, I don't believe any of this.  But this is the type of thinking that went into remaking this film: Hollywood's contempt for its audience.<br /><br />Looking at it that way, you can see this project twist and break and completely come apart to become the absolute mess that is THE WICKER MAN.<br /><br />Check out the original film and deal with it.<br />Watch this clumsy mess of a remake and shake your head.<br />Hollywood thought they were pleasing you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VLX5Z090RQ0V.html">A3VLX5Z090RQ0V</a><br/><p>"The Wicker Man" is a serious problem, and yet I was entertained because it's problematic.  Like certain people on the net, I too saw the 'greatest moments' that this film had to offer, and after watching the movie, it rings true to its audacious nature.  The harbinger of the audacity is Nicholas Cage, who REALLY overacted to the point of hilarity.  Cage has always been eccentric for his entire career, but he went completely batty for this film; It's like the actor has channeled Jack Bauer and tried to follow that method for the entire movie.  His character spend most of the time yelling and being unnecessarily aggressive towards the fellow women of Summersile.  I know he's a cop and he's serious in helping his ex-wife find her daughter, but there's a thing called composure; he clearly didn't know how to stay calm even when nothing's going on.  His over-the-top acting, not to mentions his actions like when he's running on a field of beehives, was nevertheless my source of joy for this film.<br /><br />Take my 3-star review with grain of salt.  If you're not amused by a theatrical car crash, then you might as well look away.  Technically, "The Wicker Man" is a two-star movie at best, and not just because Nicholas Cage isn't the right actor for the role.  The scare tactics are tacky and it's strongly misogynistic in how women are viewed as vindictive and deceptive (though in my opinion, this movie doesn't insult all women; just the amish ones).  I don't think the movie is nonsensical plot-wise, although the whole prologue with the car crash didn't served anything in the long run; the twist in the end was very elaborate (if I hadn't seen the video, I probably wouldn't see it coming), and I had to wonder why such a scenario wasn't simplified to just have it done on the first day.  On the unironic side, it does have good cinematography and the costumes were nicely woven.<br /><br />It's recommended to only see the unrated version, since the theatrical cut has a rushed third act and a cop-out epilogue that had no purpose; plus, only the unrated cut had the bee scene.  It's only a slight improvement to an otherwise flawed movie, but really, the movie is in lieu to "Dreamcatcher": both are lousy horror movies, but both are hilarious popcorn-fodder.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>He could have appeared in his trademark vest, with machine gun at the end to save Edward (Nicholas Cage). He didn't and I was grateful for that. So is it as awful as most of the reviewers here are making out? Well frankly no. Its actually a decent film, especially if you haven't seen the original version (which I strongly recommend you watch first). Nicholas Cage does his usual good acting job and is as always is very watchable. Ellen Burstyn is very good but woefully under-used. Its not badly directed and the core of the story is mainly similar to the original play.<br /><br />The problem with this film IS the original version. The original is better in nearly every respect and whilst this isn't a shot for shot remake like the stupid remake of Psycho a few years ago, its pretty close and because of that rather pointless. Key elements from the original film are missing from this version. Most importantly Nicholas Cage's character isn't devout, he isn't really even tempted by the women, so the reason for him being 'chosen' is pretty unclear.<br /><br />So its not a bad film, but for anybody reading this please see the original version first, then watch this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I never cared for the original "The Wicker Man," I found it slow, dull and rather uninteresting; LaBute has taken the idea and made it into a Neil LaBute rant about feminism. However, the movie tells more about the creator than it does about feminism. This was by far the worst movie Nicholas Cage has ever starred in, and has topped my list for being one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although the trailer makes this movie look amazing and full of suspense and horror, it unfortunately contains neither.<br /><br />Nic Cage goes in search of his lost daughter in "The Wicker Man" and runs afoul of an isolated community of pagans. This remake of an old Chris Lee flick has little suspense and nothing to hold the attention, as Cage literally scrambles about the countryside, thinking he has glimpsed his kid first here and then there. Some of his search becomes downright comical, especially in a scene where he is trapped overnight in a cistern. Cage's character is allergic to bees, and there's a scene involving torture-by-bees where Cage utters what is destined to become an immortal line: "Oh God, not the bees!" Ellen Bursteyn of "The Exorcists" fame is wasted here as the head of the mysterious coven, much the way veteran horror actress Alice Krige was underutilized for a similar role in "Silent Hill".<br /><br />The beginning of the movie starts out fair enough, but as the movie pushes its way down you have to make more and more leaps of faith. And then, the bad dialog comes pouring out in the final 20-30 minutes. From "I'm going to find Rowan and what I need from you is to stay out of my f---ing way!" to "Ahhhh, my legs!!" the movie gets some really silly dialog...and considering its a LaBute film, its a shame to see his talent for dialog go to pot.<br /><br />The big questions, however, are "Is it better than the original?" and "Is it worth it?" It is arguably worse than the original. It is vastly different and in some aspects better and other aspects much much worse. But, it isn't worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Have you ever had those moments in life in which you see a film years ago and you thought it was okay back then, but then when you watch it again it sucks? That's what happened when I watched this film. I thought it was okay three years ago, but then I watched it again and realized that it was a truly bad horror/suspense film. Now I have raved about a number of films that I think people unfairly victimize for being different, but sadly, this film isn't one of those films. This is a laughably bad horror film that has to be witnessed to be believed at how shoddy this film is.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The film starts off with the main character Edward Malus (Played by washed up actor Nicholas Cage) and a car crash which leaves him depressed. But then out of the blue, he receives a letter his ex-fiancee named Willow who wants him to come to an island known as Summersisle, in which she claims that her daughter; Rowan; who is allegedly Edward's daughter as well has been kidnapped by the cult that runs the island. So Edward travels to the island to find out what has happened to Rowan and uncovers a sinister plot full of lies, and there is no escaping from it.<br />MUSIC: It's a shame that such a good musical score was wasted for such an awful film. The music excels and is well-composed (Unlike the film) which is why I think it should have been used for a much better film.<br />ACTION: This film is boring and is certainly not scary. The only shocking part about this film is the ending (Which is on side A of the disc because of the alternate ending), but other than that this film is a complete mess. The script is a ham-fisted, worthless effort that goes nowhere and doesn't come together. It's a grungy, disjointed mess. Most of the film is Nicholas Cage wandering aimlessly throughout the island continuously asking about Rowan and no one bothers to answer him. This film has no suspense involved because you don't care what happens, and you'll never root for Nicholas Cage. This film fails spectacularly as a horror film and as a suspense film.<br />ACTING: This was just appalling. Nicholas Cage puts on a horrendous performance as a cop. He seems bored and makes his performance even worse with laughable dialogue that is never believable. Everyone else puts on terrible performances as well and you're not scared of them as a cult, they just look and sound ridiculous (Wait till you see Sister Summersisle's face paint for the festival, it looks like face paint they use at football games). But then again, I don't know whether to blame the actors themselves, or this horrendous script. Most likely it's both.<br />OVERALL: The only way anyone will ever enjoy this film is in a B-movie way. Everything about this film is laughably bad (A cult obsessed with bees?) from its ludicrous and disjointed plot, to the terrible acting, and to the laughable dialogue, this film is sure-fire miss. If for some reason you want to see this film, only rent it. This might appeal to some, but for everyone else, you should just avoid it. If you want a good horror film about a crazy cult that's actually scary, I suggest you try the superb Silent Hill instead of this tripe. No wonder this was voted as being one of the worst horror remakes of all time.<br />THE GOOD: Good music, some nice set designs, and the alternate ending was weird.<br />THE BAD: Ham-fisted script that goes nowhere, horrendous acting and dialogue, it's completely boring, it's not scary, and it's not suspenseful.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>If you have ever read my other reviews and have grown to trust my judgment even a little bit, then please trust me here and avoid this dreadful film which is a remake of a small classic.<br /><br />There are no words to describe this monsterous disaster.

It's that bad.  This is NOT one of those "it's so bad, it's good" kind of film.  This is a film that is just bad.  Period.<br /><br />The script is incoherent, silly, and eventually predictable.  The acting is cartoonish at best and totally inept at worst.  The direction is all over the place as he couldn't decide if he wanted to make a thriller, a comedy, a mystery, or satire; therefore, he tried to do it all and succeeded at none.  The film is a disaster at every level.  Go rent and enjoy the original and forget this farse was ever made.<br /><br />Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it!  :>(</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Neil LaBute's remake of "The Wicker Man" is possibly the worst film of the decade, probably worse than "Battlefield Earth" and "Epic Movie," considering that the former film actually stars two Oscar winners, Nicholas Cage and Ellen Burstyn (the latter with strangest make-up on the face). And their acting is very disappointing.<br /><br />What you see here is beautiful landscapes and an utterly incoherent story about a missing girl and a police officer. The truths are obvious from the moment when Nicolas Cage's policeman landed on a remote, privately owned island off the coast, but our dim-witted hero never knows the right thing to do. Instead he does many silly things and perhaps his "bear" costume part would be the worst. But there are more to come before and after that, as many other reviewers rightly pointed out.<br /><br />But what made me really sad is the presence of Leelee Sobieski as Sister Honey. I just couldn't believe what I am seeing during her "brawl" scene and its terrible results. If director wanted to make a point about war between men and women, he surely made it with dreadful portrayal of Sister here, or any other terribly-acted Sisters and heavy-handed metaphor of bees.<br /><br />Please. We don't need any more "re-imagined" version of classic films. Also, British films should be left untouched if you don't have a more suitable idea to update them. The concept of female-dominated society may be intriguing, but that idea is hardly compatible with the eerie world of "The Wicker Man."</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>Wow, this is just about the worst movie I have seen all year.  The only nicolas cage movie that is worse in 8mm.  Wow this is bad.  If somebody remade the original thinking that they could make it better, then I'd hate to see the original 1975 movie, it must be horrific, or else this director botched this up bad. Cage plays a cop who comes to investigate the missing daughter of his old fiancee.  The minute he reads the letter, you know it's also his daughter. But, the ignorant man doesn't pick up on that until his ex lets him know 40 minutes into the movie. Also, any man that would stay 5 minutes on that Estrogen laden Island without thinking it was wierd....Come on, how stupid can you be.  Finally, he hung around even after the plane radio was smashed up and transport of the island was limited....how many clues does this guy need to say hey, forget it, something is fishy here.  Nope.  The dope deserved to burn for being the most ignorant gullable person alive.  Thank goodness a guy like this isn't a superhero like spiderman...his spidey sense is broken.  If you just want to see a bad movie, con a friend into renting this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>THE WICKER MAN is a bad movie in ways that are inexcusable.  It had a decent budget and an attractive, experienced cast.  It had a creepy setting and a good set up.  What it didn't have was a credible script or tight execution.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage plays a patrolman who, after a horrific traffic accident, takes some time off from work, but is soon summoned by his ex-fiance to come to "Summerisle," a mysterious island off of the Washington State coast because she needs help in finding her daughter who has disappeared.  Cage, while still hurting from their long ago breakup, comes to her aid.  The island is privately owned, and on the surface appears to be a commune of some sort...dedicated to living off the land in a way which reminds me a lot of the village in M. Night Shymalan's THE VILLAGE...a pseudo-puritan society.  Turns out, on Summersisle, the women run things and the men are mute servants.  And the little girl who has disappeared has almost certainly been appropriated for a mysterious ritual of some sort that might involve human sacrifice.<br /><br />The plot elements are ridiculous but could have been fun.  When we go to see a horror/suspense movie, we're ready to suspend some disbelief and have fun.  See where the filmmakers want to take us.<br /><br />Sadly, THE WICKER MAN doesn't even earn a modest suspension of that disbelief.  Primarily because Nicholas Cage's "experienced cop" doesn't even ask the most basic questions.  He'll go up to some mysterious old woman, ask a question, get a vague response and then just go on his way.  No follow up questions.  Not even the questions any halfwit would ask.  He's an investigator who would NEVER solve a single darn crime in the real-world.  He's almost laughably inept.  And Cage gives one of his weaker performances.  When he's on, his quirks make for great entertainment (ADAPTATION, MATCHSTICK MEN).  When he turns off the ticks and plays more normal (WORLD TRADE CENTER) he can be restrained.  In this film, we get the worst of both worlds.  His character will burst into a rage for no reason...then become soft-spoken and "sensitive."  But most importantly, he doesn't do believable things for someone in his situation.  And best of all, at one point, he puts on a bear suit!  It almost makes sense that he does so...but after 80 minutes of bad-movie...it's just so funny.<br /><br />I have never seen the original WICKER MAN...although I guess I will now to see what all the fuss was about.  But this movie is pretty bad.  It has gorgeous scenery.  It has Eileen Brennan nicely chewing the scenery (and looking quite lovely) and it's always great to see Frances Conroy from SIX FEET UNDER.  It has a modest twist ending.  But it has no emotional impact, seems to take much longer than its 97 minute running time, and is terribly frustrating.  If you must see it, at least wait for the DVD...which you must only rent, not buy.  It's PG-13 and that seems about right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>I was really surprised to like this movie so much.  It didn't seem like a good choice for a remake, and the trailers made it look like it was going to be a possibly-too-slick, mainstream-ized, and frankly dumb, version of the original.  Instead I found the actual movie to be a smart, well-crafted horror thriller.  While it wouldn't make my Top Ten for 2006 by any means, I thought (although I'm clearly in the minority here, judging by its overall low rating) it was a very succsessful remake.<br /><br />  I thought it was a succsessful remake largly because of this: it does something different with the original material.  If you're going to remake something, I think you should take some different paths so the two versions are distinct from one another.  The 1973 original focused on a Christianity vs. evil paganism theme; today paganism isn't viewed with nearly the same distrust and misconceptions as it was decades ago, and in this remake has been replaced with a strange new religion apparantly created just for the movie.  The Christianity element has been eliminated altogether for whatever reason; I wouldn't have minded if it had stayed but that wasn't the way they decided to go.<br /><br />  The rest of the premise is the same as the original - Nicolas Cage is a policeman drawn to the island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a little girl on the island.  Edward Woodward made that role in the original his own, and here Cage plays the role in a totally different manner; even the name of the character has been changed.  Once on the island, Cage finds the locals uncooperative to the point of denying the little girl ever even existed.  The island is ruled over by the outwardly benign Sister Summerisle, played by Ellen Burstyn - another change: in the original it was Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee.  In any remake of a movie that featured Lee, the recasting of his character is going to be tricky (I'm not counting Dracula movies; there have been so many different incarnations of the Count over the last hundred years that they don't really count as remakes of any previous film, and haven't for a long time) and in this case they went so far in differentiating the roles as to change gender.  Which ends up a good thing, with having a 'queen bee' type of figure tying right into the mythology of the island and its religion.  The islanders are fixated on bees, the creature they keep for harvesting honey, although I suppose the question of who's really keeping who could be argued, if you want to read between the lines.  The bee motif plays out in the movie in ways alternately subtle and overt, and made for a fascinating mythology and backdrop.  The officer's investigations lead him to quickly conclude that the girl did indeed exist, and that a large part of the island is covering up not only her death but her life as well.  Cut off from the outside world in a society with no link to the mainland, he attempts to find out what happened, and whether she may even still be among the living.  With performances that are far better than they've been given credit for, and a nice tight tension throughout, I give this one a strong recommendation.  8/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>Nicholas Cage plays a police officer who witnesses a disaster, and during his time of leave gets a letter from an old fiance who states her daughter is missing, some 8 or so years after they last spoke.  So he decides to take it upon himself to investigate.  Sounds interesting, but really really stupid.  He must have been the last one in his class from the academy to figure out that A.  It's his Kid B.  He should just leave (swim boat, whatever the heck you can do, just leave) C. He's the Pawn in a game.  The movie was predicatble, and a downright snorefest.  Save the cash, save the time, pass this one by on the shelf.</p></br></body></html>

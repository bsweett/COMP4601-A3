All happiness is far to be innocent said Jean Anouilh. And the story of Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot will be engaging to millions and millions future readers over and over again. The mythic roots are too powerful and survive far beyond any other circumstance or religious belief.<br /><br />Monthy Phyton makes a fantastic turn of page about this legend and precisely due its black humor doses, put us in context with some revelations that can not be told by reasons politically correct. The sense of irreverence, and sharp deformation of the personages helps still more to get a closer approach to the meaning of this legend.<br /><br />Go for this ever lasting cult movie and if I may express with absolute sincerity this is the real masterpiece of that legendary ensemble.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>This is a great and funny movie and one of the best that the Python team came up with! And the 2 disc edition here is great, but i recomend you get a good price! The bonus features are packed into 2 discs but there not somthing you would watch over and over again! The movie is worth it mostly just for the classic film, and the people who have seen and loved the film will enjoy the bonus materials, espechelly the return to locations where it was filmed, and seeing what it looked like when they did the documentry in 2000 or whenever?</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>You know, I would've loved to have been in the audience when Monty Python and the Holy Grail was first shown. I'm picturing a fair amount of laughter, but also quite a bit of confusion and critics saying, "What the hell did I just see?" That was certainly the case when Roger Ebert reviewed the first Monty Python movie, And Now For Something Completely Different. He seemed very interested in the audience reaction during his review, and I imagine the audience reaction during the first screenings for this film would've been similar.<br /><br />Of course, by the time Monty Python and the Holy Grail came out in 1976, the original series had been airing on PBS for a couple years, so people were more familiar with the show. But still. Just imagine what reactions must've been like for those poor souls who went into this movie never having seen the TV program.<br /><br />I don't need to tell most of you about the plot to this film. King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table go off to find the Holy Grail. Most of the major knights from the stories are here, though Guinevere and Merlin are strangely absent (though there is an enchanter named Tim). The film also adds the rather cowardly Sir Robin and the aptly-named Sir Not Appearing in this Film.<br /><br />The movie itself is a fascinating hodge-podge of hilarity. You get to see several film genres, including swashbucklers, fantasy, epics and musicals, all get joyfully skewered. One cost-saving move, using coconuts banged together to simulate the sound of horses, since they couldn't actually afford horses, is an inspired notion. Despite that, much of the film shows the time period in a more realistic fashion than most other movies. There's lots of dirt and lots of mud and people know the king is the king because "He hasn't got [...] all over him."<br /><br />Everyone who has seen the movie has their favorite moments. For me it's probably a toss up between the "Spamalot" song, the Holy Hand Grenade, and the "Help, help! I'm being repressed!" scene. The events at Castle Anthrax is a close follow-up, but really the whole movie works and works well. There's not a bad moment in the film, not a joke that falls flat.<br /><br />This movie, like all great films, has left behind a huge legacy, though not in the way some might think. Often times it's a legacy that filmmakers try to avoid. For example, in the the commentary on The Lord of the Rings films you will frequently hear Peter Jackson somewhat humoursly lament how hard they tried to avoid giving their movies a Holy Grail feeling. Of course the movie also lead to the hit Broadway musical, Spamalot, which I've never seen, but heard great things about.<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone, of course. There's always a few humourless louts out there who won't enjoy it. Us normal folk know better, however, and we can enjoy it for the wonderful, creative, hilarious film it is!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>This movie starts with some clips that make you feel you are lost, or took the wrong DVD to watch... soon enough you realize that even the opening lines, and the credits have been written to keep you laughing... not sure if at the plot... or at the fact that you are watching one of the silliest films ever made.<br /><br />But... we watch from beginning to end... The movie starts with King Arthur of the Britons searching throughout the land for brave men to join him to form Camelot... the Knights of the Round Table.<br /><br />He finds the pure Sir Galahad... the daring and brave Sir Lancelot...  As the movie opens, you hear the distant clapping of horses hooves, only to realize that what you are indeed hearing is only  a servant, banging coconuts together to pretend... and you know you are in for an ever ending sequence of rather funny and definitely silly recreations of history... where famous characters spend their days and nights overcoming obstacles in search of the Holy Grail.<br /><br />King Arthur is played by Graham Chapman, while John Cleese is seen as the Second Swallow-Savvy Guard, The Black Knight, Peasant #3, Sir Lancelot, the Brave, the French Guard who taunts King Arthur's group, and finally as Tim, the Enchanter.<br /><br />In the end... King Arthur finds the Castle of Arrrghhh... where the Holy Grail actually is... and we had no choice but to say to ourselves.... Arrrghhh!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>This is one of the funniest movies of all time. My faviorte scene in the movie has to be where they meet the french guard. You do have to have an odd sense humour to get most of the jokes. Its random, but still funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>This is what dvds were invented for -- there are so many great features here!  So in addition to seeing one of the funniest movies ever made, you can be entertained for hours with the extras, and the extras are terrific: subtitles in English, French or Spanish; audio track choices -- English (the original mono or a brand new full stereo version), French, a directors' (Gilliam and Jones) track or a commentary track with Cleese, Idle and Palin; a copy of the script overlaid on the film; a painstaking, hilarious Henry the IV-ish subtitle for those who don't like the film; a hard-of-hearing feature; killer rabbit easter eggs; animated menus using Gilliam's original animation; karaoke renditions of 'Knights of the Round Table', 'Sir Robin' and the 'Monks Chant'; a delightful 45 minute visit to the locations with Jones and Palin; an educational film about the 'other' uses of coconuts; Japanese versions of the French Castle and Knights Who Say Ni scenes, including references to the 'holy sake cup'; a 1974 BBC Film Night visit to a location site during filming; photos of tickets, press releases, reviews, posters, production stills and original artwork; trailers; cast credits (Palin played over a dozen parts!) with pictures of each character; a Lego knights version of the Camelot scene; pictures of sketches that were never used (a killer snail?!); a web link.<p>A lot of effort went into this special edition dvd, and it shows.  I particularly enjoyed seeing Jones and Palin visit locations.  They were in a jolly mood, their comments are interspersed with film footage, and they meet affectionate and funny fans along the way.<p>If you like this film you will love this dvd version; if you love the film, you wil adore this two-dvd set.  An essential item for your collection.<p>Highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>To those who do not like this film I say STUFF IT...<br />This movie is a masterpieace of British Comedy.  There are wonderful and unforgettable lines like "Bring out your dead" and "The knights who say nee".  It is loaded to the gills with humor and wit from the genius minds that brought you classics like "The Life of Brian" and "A Fish called Wanda".  That is just the movie itself now with the DVD you have a whole new level added to the experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>This film was my introduction to Monty Python.  When I was a boy, the local PBS station aired it frequently.  I was hooked instantly and began watching the television series as well.  The Pythons pioneered a delightfully absurd brand of comedy that has been imitated but never equaled.  I actually enjoy some of their later films more (particularly &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;), but this skewering of the Arthurian legend remains one of my all-time favorite comedies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>For those who don't "get" the humor in this movie, it may seem like a 90 minute detour into one of the outer circles of hell.  Actors playing multiple roles, idiots smacking coconut shells together to make horse-sounds, men playing most of the female roles, modern-day police tracking medieval knights, the use of the word "nee" to a huge extent and lots of blood gouting from gory wounds.  For those people, I can only have pity.<p>Because to love HOLY GRAIL is to establish a life-long friendship.  I've never known anyone who was lukewarm about the film.  Hate it (see above) and you just scratch your head in wonder at its popularity.  Love it,and you find yourself quoting it often and watching it over and over.  My family and I watch this movie at least once a year.  When my son (now 15) first watched this movie with me, I knew it was an important moment in our relationship.  Would he think his dad was weird for recommending this old British piece of junk?  Or would he join the club of fanatics?  Let's just say that we now own almost everything by Monty Python that is available on DVD and we're saving up for FAWLTY TOWERS.  For him, it was the Dark Knight's duel with King Arthur that first made him a believer.<p>I won't rehash the plot...that probably isn't possible.  But suffice it to say that I don't think anyone should skip this movie.  Yes, you might hate it.  If so, I'm sorry.  But there's a good chance you'll be sucked in and then you too can quote "It's only a flesh wound" or "Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry" or "There are those who call me...Tim."  And you can enjoy, again and again, the vicious attacks of the white rabbit.  (If you have the DVD, I challenge you to watch the rabbit attack on super-slow motion...it's a historian's study on great film editing and it's also gut-bustingly funny!)  You can learn to count to five...uh, three.  You can learn to insult like the French.  And on and on.  <p>The deluxe DVD set comes with a 2nd disc full of extras.  Not much of it is indispensible, but it's certainly worth the extra few bucks.  There is a complete redo of the CAMELOT song, except done entirely with legos which makes the 2nd disc worthwhile right there.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>It is well-known that the Pythons themselves believe &quot;Life of Brian&quot; is their best movie.  In terms of production value, it probably is, but it's not nearly as funny as &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&quot;  Made on a shoestring budget and played absolutely straight by the troupe, it is hilarious and intellegent at the same time, as well as being charmingly rustic (due to the low budget).<p>The late Graham Chapman plays Arthur, and is perfect in the role.  He is always dignified and noble, even while taking insults from ludicrously-accented Frenchmen.  All the other Pythons have multiple speaking parts - a special highlight for me is Terry Jones as the whining prince.  The Pythons are at their pseudo-intellectual best in this, their first feature film.  My favourite part is Arthur's argument with the peasants making up the anarcho-syndicalist commune (&quot;You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!&quot;), followed closely by the opening scene of the film, where it's revealed that Arthur is not riding a horse but has a servant following him making horse-noises with a coconut (&quot;Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?&quot;).<p>The DVD is packed with nifty extras.  There are two making-of features, one made while the film was in production (by the BBC) the other made just recently.  The latter features Terry Jones and Michael Palin travelling through the country reminiscing and visiting the old locations (don't worry - it's better than it sounds!).  Most importantly, the DVD looks fantastic, and the sound is good as well, and if you're still trying to figure out what the characters are saying, you have several subtitle-caption options.  There are numerous other extras, including a version of the song &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; with animated Lego figures - hilarious!<p>For Monty Python fans, this DVD is an absolute must, and I recommend it most highly to everyone else!</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>This is still to this day one of the finest, funniest movies ever made.  Im so happy they have it on pretty much any format.  Monty Python has a youtube channel now too.  Great stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The grand opus of Monty Python, a goofy gang of guys who invented the most skewed comedy routines in the world. Rather than a series of individual spoofs, this movie is a long spoof based on Arthurian legend; specifically, the legend of the Holy Grail. Somehow, these six guys not only produced a low-budget movie, but cast themselves in multiple (many multiple) roles throughout it and still maintained a hilarious result!<p>Rather than a real story, this is a series of vignettes concerning the long-suffering King Arthur and his loyal knights of the Round Table (&quot;We eat ham and jam and Spam-a-lot!&quot;) Among them are:<p>*The encounter with the Communist peasants in their autonamous collective (&quot;HELP! HELP! I'M BEING REPRESSED!&quot;)<p>*The Tale of Sir Robin, the cowardly knight with a chicken on his shield.<p>*The king's encounter with the loony black knight, in which a ridiculous series of blood-spurtings will have you guffawing. (&quot;You've got no arms left!&quot; &quot;Yes I have!&quot; &quot;LOOK!&quot; &quot;It's just a flesh wound.&quot;)<p>*Sir Lancelot receives a desperate note from a castle, but is the person sending it what he expects? <p>*The French attack.... verbally. (&quot;Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries!&quot;)<p>*Sir Galahad is waylaid in the temptation-laden Castle of the Maidens (interestingly enough, in traditional legends Sir Galahad did go to the Castle of the Maidens, though in very different circumstances *leer*)<p>*The Keepers of the Sacred Word, the Knights Who Say &quot;NI!&quot;<p>*The rabbit of death, Tim the Enchanter, and so much more.<p>The sheer off-the-wallness is what sells this movie, and Monty Python was in rare form. Graham Chapman's primary role is King Arthur, who seems to be the most competant of the bunch but is still pretty goofy. John Cleese of &quot;Fish&quot; and &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; fame stars as Sir Lancelot/Tim the Wizard/The Rude Frenchman, and is amazing in each role. Eric Idle plays lily-livered Sir Robin/Roger the Shrubber (don't ask)/Brother Maynard. Terry Gilliam is lower-key as Sir Gawain/Patsy; Terry Jones is also pretty low key as Sir Bedivere/Prince Herbert. Michael Palin has a hilarious series of roles including the King os Swamp Castle/Sir Galahad/Leader of the Knights Who Say Ni.<p>Shoring up the cast is Cleese's now-ex-wife Connie Booth as The Witch, John Young as the Historian/Dead Body, Neil Innes as the annoying Minstrel/Page Killed by Rabbit.<p>Perhaps the funniest move in this movie was mocking the budget limitations, with the coconut shells and so forth. The special effects are deliberately cheapened to make them sillier, such as the sprays of rather gloppy gore when someone is wounded. The script is typically hilarious, full of stupid comments and straight-faced jokes. <p>Frankly, it's hard to think of Camelot now without rhyming it with &quot;I have to push the PRAM-A-LOT&quot; and the line of tap-dancing knights. This movie is lodged in the American brain, and it ain't budging soon...<p>A small note: You may want to check out the Veggie Tales ep &quot;Josh and the Big Wall,&quot; in which a respectful (yet kooky!) homage is paid to this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>With the opening of Mike Nichols' and Eric Idle's "Spamalot" on Broadway last month, it's a good time to revisit the 1975 comedy classic that inspired the musical. Thirty years have elapsed since its original release, but it is still a movie that veers wildly back and forth between hilariously inventive and downright silly.  If you can hold on tight, it's a worthwhile ride. Almost arbitrarily about a band of adventurers looking for the famed Holy Grail, the movie is just an excuse to create a nonsensical world steeped in medieval history and comically ironic violence. Directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, it is typical Monty Python fare, which means a lot of clever wordplay and elaborate sight gags with big payoffs. The story begins with King Arthur and his page Patsy galloping on their invisible horses with their clapping coconut half-shells, as they search for worthy knights to take back to Camelot. From there, we meet a cast of characters that only makes sense in Python-land: an increasingly armless and legless Black Knight with a chip on his shoulder, a big Trojan Horse-like wooden rabbit, some disrespectful Frenchmen, castle-bound nymphomaniac maidens, the knights who dare to say "Ni!", a pedantic historian in the present day and even God, who seems rather impatient with the befuddled knights as He explains their quest for the Holy Grail. Amid these disparate elements, the film holds together as a clever satire on blind pious ignorance and the unquestioning acceptance of organized religion. The pacing gets sluggish toward the end, but the conclusion is riotous and just in time.<br /><br />Well packaged, the two-disc set has several extras. The main menu on the first disc is funny in itself with an option for the hard of hearing. There are two alternative commentary tracks. The first is newer and features Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin; the second was recorded much earlier with Gilliam and Jones. Both are informative but only fitfully funny since they defer to the movie. The second disc has "Mindless Sing-Alongs!", where three scenes are taken from the film and subtitled so that once can sing along to the amusing "Knights of the Round Table" (which inspired the Broadway show title, "We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and spam a lot."), "Sir Robin" or chant along in "Monk's Chant". There is a hysterical little "educational" short entitled "How to Use Your Coconut" and two scenes dubbed in Japanese. But the highlight is a 45-minute documentary called "The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations," in which Jones and Palin explore the various film locations with humor and a sense of deserved nostalgia. Other features include a mock interview with the cast done during the filming, a Lego version of "The "Knights of the Round Table" song and various sundry features suitable primarily for a Pythonite. For non-Pythonites, the film is still worth a look at a comedy that only looks better with all the witless dreck produced now.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ.html">A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ</a><br/><p>Essentially a series of sketches with a medieval theme, this is less structured than 'Life of Brian', and operations on a sillier level  entirely. You've probably seen it half-a-dozen times already, and on DVD  it's just as funny as it is on VHS, but with a slightly nicer picture and a  smaller box. That's pretty much all you get, too - the wonderful Criterion  version of 'Life of Brian' is a taster of what can be done with DVD, and  the lack of extras makes this less interesting. What sets the film itself  apart from the competition (not that there is any) is the attention to  detail, the desire to create a stylish portrayal of medieval England on a  minute budget (less than a quarter of a million dollars, in fact). It works  well - location footage in Scotland and lots and lots of smoke give the  production an 'Exclaibur'-esque look of grim and gritty reality, and this  is what sticks in the mind after the film is over. It's extremely funny,  but you know that already - as with all Python, you can watch it again and  again, spotting lines and performances you hadn't noticed beforehand. Given  that no special effort has been put into the presentation, and given that  'Holy Grail' is hardly THX material anyway, you'd probably be better off  with the standard VHS version. Or tape it from the telly.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>I recently watched this classic again for the first time in years, having previously viewed it about a half dozen times.  It was great to see one of my all-time faves brought to DVD.  The Pythons epitomize the greatest imaginations and creativity in British humor, and this movie is, in my humble opinion, the hands-down best work of the Python troop.<br /><br />There are probably precious few souls who haven't seen this at least once, so there's little I can add about the movie itself that hasn't already been praised in earlier reviews.  I was especially pleased with some of the special features on this DVD, including the "tutorial" on how to maximize the use of coconuts for a full equine "riding" experience.  Needless to say this was done in the classic Python style by Mr. Palin himself.  Also great was the "Camelot" song-and-dance routine done with Lego figures -- brilliant!<br /><br />What can I say?  You need to see this for yourself, so rush right out and get it.  Might as well pick up a coconut while you're at it -- you'll need that too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the funniest movies ever designed by a group of men you will ever find from the 20th Century.  The killer bunny, the virgins, the weird prince who wants to sing, the lack of horses for the knights, the Knights who once said Ni.  The movie is full of extras and so is are the DVDs.  Legos, sing-alongs, on-screen screenplay, commentaries full of back-stabbing, complaints and whining by the crew of Month Python.  Looking for a message?  Well, there may be a few, but mostly it was meant to be funny, the kind of funny that burns into your brain and slowly burns its way out, till you laugh aloud on the bus, or at the wedding, or when they are trying to pull a tooth.  The kind of funny that hits you right when you're trying to chew that very hard piece of beef that you think MAY be bone, but you don't wish to spit it out, because that would be bad manners.<br />Well, enough of that.  Just buy it already.  I would also suggest you buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OKQK">Jabberwocky</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305388458">Life of Brian</a> DVDs.  If you don't I'll send a bunny after you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>Beloved among geeks, revered by their putrid faithful, the Pythons' parody of Arthurian legend has been afforded nearly as much praise and idolatry as other venerable institutions of virginity, such as Doctor Who and Star Trek. Indeed, this bloated, ponderous, nauseating two-disc set couldn't possibly have been produced in its present form without the rock-solid, decades-old attention that Monty Python and their fans have lavished upon it, like some twisted infant deformity that's been coddled to a state of ever-needing, ever-shrieking and all-consuming, an obese and slovenly cripple that cares only to ingest more of what's fed it, either until it's shipped off to an institution to care for it into old age or some kind soul decides to attend to nature's mistake by messily dispatching it and putting it out of everyone else's misery.<br /><br />Anyhow, it'll be no surprise to Python fans that the menus of both discs are presented via Terry Gilliam's inane and very colorful animations. Quite a lot of time, cash and energy was squandered on the development of this package; the only consolation of this fact is that these resources weren't diverted to build more nuclear warheads.<br /><br />DISC 1<br /><br />If you must watch this dreck, you'll be pleased to know that the audiovisual quality is quite a step up from that of the nigh-unwatchable VHS editions. The picture is as clean as it could be, and the restoration of the 1.66:1 aspect ratio now prevents the titles of many goofy, ornate Gilliam animations from being truncated; whether this makes these titles more or less comprehensible is anyone's guess. Though the original mono soundtrack still ably recreates the effect of having mud jammed into your ears, it's far more audible than it was on VHS, and by contrast, the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is perfectly lucid and brilliant - it's too bad that all this fine technology is being used to polish what amounts to aural feces.<br /><br />For whatever reason, much of Neil Innes' incidental music was removed from the soundtrack of the U.S. VHS edition. Enthusiasts of good music will surely moan in fits of agony and despair to find that this music has been restored. Another restored element is comprised of twenty-four tedious seconds of footage that were rightly left on the editing room floor and have been scooped up like so much pet droppings and returned to their rightful place. If you paid just for this lost footage, you deserve to be ripped off.<br /><br />The scene selection menus are video thumbnails within airborne animated scrolls, the audio of which are played in sequential rotation. Oh, what a waste of time.<br /><br />Inexplicably, Monty Python have established a rabid fan following throughout the Anglosphere and in parts beyond, which is the excuse used to justify adequate English, French and Spanish subtitles for all of the film's moronic dialogue. Those with a hint of refined taste won't find themselves watching this, but if they're ever captured and tortured by being forced to view this horrid disc, they might be able to better comprehend the movie's absurd proceedings if the subtitles for those who don't like the film are enabled, which provide text from Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part II that's roughly analogous to what's spoken onscreen, or not. The final textual insult is an option which displays the overlaid entirety of the screenplay in portions that mirror the onscreen activity. This is merely evidence that the troupe were succumbing to mental illness well before the film's production ever started shooting.<br /><br />The dubbed French dialogue track is either more hammy or obnoxious; it's difficult to determine which. Python have already mangled the English language enough. Do they really need to drag an uncivilized tongue that sounds like oral diarrhea into this mess?<br /><br />Oh god, and then there's the commentary tracks, surely enough to inspire a suicide or two. In the first of these, Terries Gilliam and Jones wax poetic about their monumental cinematic failure with trite anecdotes. In the second, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and a rather grumpy John Cleese wax poetic about their monumental cinematic failure with trite anecdotes. Fans might find these commentaries informative and amusing. Those of us with triple-digit IQs can't help but notice that the film's idiocy is more lively than that of the commentaries, which is all that kept me from eating a bullet.<br /><br />One Hard of Hearing option induces your TV to scream out the main menu options for those too old to know what a DVD player is, much less how to use one.<br /><br />Apparently, the Killer Rabbit Game presents the icon of the murderous bunny during the course of the movie; pressing the Enter button on your DVD remote when it's displayed is supposed to exhibit the inner workings of either Terry Gilliam's diseased mind or those of the film's accountants. I've watched the film on this DVD thrice, and have suffered enough brain damage by doing so, so I'll leave this option for some dullard who's willing to sit through it.<br /><br />DISC 2<br /><br />It's even worse than you could have expected: three musical videos culled from some especially vacuous scenes - The Knights of the Round Table, The Tale of Sir Robin and the Chanting Monks - featuring sing-along subtitles so you can make a complete fool of yourself in front of your friends and loved ones, or that the lot can drag down their local property values. This is hardly necessary, as it can be achieved with the English subtitles of the first disc, and if you're the sort of devoted dork who's watched this as many times as I have, you know all the lyrics by heart, anyway. You've wasted your life.<br /><br />It wouldn't be a two-disc special edition without a tiresome featurette, and The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations finds Terry Jones and Michael Palin doing what so many other criminals have - returning to the scene of one of their most egregious crimes...specifically, the locations in Scotland where Holy Grail was shot. It's heartbreaking to watch these two sprightly geezers harass the kindly local Scots who tolerated their presence a quarter-century before and are forced to do so again. It's a wonder that these two buffoons weren't arrested, and a marvel that Eric Idle didn't tag along; I can only assume that there was no extra cash to be had in it for the little sellout.<br /><br />A mock PSA starring Palin on the widely-recognized alternate use of the coconut shell is provided. That's just what we need: more half-wit fans pretending to ride horsey to the noise of banging coconuts.<br /><br />A pair of English-subtitled scenes from the Japanese-language version of the film are also supplied, in which the Holy Grail is referred to as a "Holy sake cup" and the shrubbery so coveted by the Knights of Ni as bonsai. To have lost the war, been subjected to American savagery via nuclear warfare and an oppressive occupation, and then forced to endure the ravings of these British lunatics...I pity the Japanese as I could no others.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, check out the BBC Film Night documentary episode, in which a bunch of mindless journalists aggravate the Pythons while they're filming pivotal scenes. Graham Chapman clearly enjoys being interviewed slightly less than having dead sheep dumped and offal drained upon him. Most ghastly here, an interview with a young, gnomish, clearly demented Terry Gilliam, who's a sight for blind eyes. Chickens are wrangled, animal corpses heaved, the French language further mangled. It's all a testament to man's inhumanity to man.<br /><br />The Old Rubbish is just that: completely worthless promotional materials and both scanned images and an aural reading of a negative review of Holy Grail. One might think that I'd find comfort in this last. Hardly! The review is a fatuous bit of pompous crap that totally misses the mark in assuming that Holy Grail is a comedy. Without doubt, that writer died alone, in misery.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the "Artifacts" are merely a variety of film posters that suggest what an international embarrassment this movie was.<br /><br />Ah, the obligatory photo gallery - another exhibition of on-set horror, which only emphasizes how many gory, outrageous, wholly tasteless scenes were shot before this putrid disaster was halted by financial exhaustion.<br /><br />The U.K. theatrical trailer is a good example of what happens when these things are produced by giggling, infantile man-children. Suffice to say, it's an abomination. The 2001 U.S. re-release trailer is more of the same, proving that yanks are only lazier and more derivative than Brits.<br /><br />Pictures of the entire cast in all their many roles are presented for those who want to debate who did more to ruin the picture by overacting. Most may suggest that Michael Palin (in his seven hundred thousand parts) is the most egregious culprit, but my vote goes for the elderly, ill-named John Young. The old ham.<br /><br />The Unshot Footage is atrocious. A CGI Lego version of the Knights of the Round Table song was produced to help you finally pull the trigger. Location Recce is a travelogue of sorts narrated by the Terries, and exhibits their many travels in the early seventies. It's plain to see that they carelessly wasted most of the film's budget on bawdy and lavish comforts while "location scouting" well before the movie was shot. Finally, the "Unused Ideas" are a collection of incomprehensible, totally psychotic sketches and scribblings by Gilliam that, thankfully, were never animated. Why the public tolerates Gilliam is beyond me. He's already slandered the righteous Hunter S. Thompson by portraying him as some sort of drug-crazed madman, and 12 Monkeys is a direct rip-off of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, never mind that he also plagiarized Vertigo there, out of the blue. Also, The Fisher King was merely a 12-step therapy movie filmed for consumption by Stern, Imus, Hughes and Cumia, Mancow and the Greaseman after they've all been fired. What an intolerable hack!<br /><br />In summary: it's an appalling disaster, one of the most awful, insidious things that I've been subjected to. This really is something that might enjoy massive mainstream success in any sick, depraved society, which is why it's so popular today. Now go out, buy one, and don't even think to contact me with any message that includes the word "ni." There are some things that even I won't tolerate.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>Somewhat of a guilty pleasure, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is one of my top 5 movies.

Each member of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GEIRSM">Monty Python</a> is perfect in their (dis)respective roles, but standing out from the others is the late Graham Chapman, who plays King Arthur as the "straight character". Chapman portrays Arthur as a serious, heroic figure who is completely unaware of his self-satirizing surroundings.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRQX34">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a> begins with a series of gags involving mock-Swedish subtitles and of all things, moose and llamas. After some of the strangest credits ever, the first scene opens on an epic shot of the mist-shrouded moors of medieval Britain. Two men come galloping heroically into view. What's odd is that neither of them are on horses. In fact, one of them is simply banging two halves of a coconut shell together to simulate the sound of hoof beats. Thus hilarity ensues. The story also includes such memorable characters as an obnoxious French "taunter", a three-headed knight, an effeminate prince who just wants to sing, a ghastly cartoon monster, and perhaps the most lethal rabbit ever put on film.<br /><br />What makes the film so bloody funny is the complete lack of respect that it shows to Arthurian legend and medieval folklore. Both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (the dementedly brilliant directors and co-stars) are quite familiar with medieval history and delight in lampooning it at every turn. The dialogue is perfectly ridiculous and that's precisely what makes it so entertaining.<br />I won't go into great detail about the plot (ha-ha-ha!) or the innumerous zany characters other than to say it's absolutely irreverent and mad (something that seems common with the Pythons). Even the ending of the film is intentionally anti-climactic.<br />But if you want British comedy without restraint, then check out this classic or, "I'll wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of secondhand, electric-donkey bottom biters!"<br />Oh, and don't forget your coconuts.<br /><br />The 2-disc Special Edition includes the following special features: an audio commentary by directors and stars Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, an audio commentary by John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin, Follow the Killer Rabbit feature, Subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film (taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part II), On-Screen Screenplay, three Sing-Alongs, The Quest for the Holy Grail documentary, BBC Film Night: On Location with Monty Python and the Holy Grail vintage featurette, two scenes from the Japanese language version of the film, How to Use Your Coconuts instructional featurette, Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego short film, extensive image galleries, An Interactive Cast Directory, and theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312311451">The Pythons: Autobiography</a> by The Pythons<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XRZ92">The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus: 16 Ton Megaset</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767827724">And Now for Something Completely Different</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OKQK">Jabberwocky</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VE439Y">Monty Python's Life of Brian</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A0MFJ">Monty Python's The Meaning of Life</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011E5M66">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a></p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This movie is terrific in every way.  It is truly a timeless comedy that can make me laugh 25 years after having first seen it.  I do with though they they would remaster the movie and give a better looking film to show.  This looks like a vhs version copied to dvd.  I purchased this movie after going to see Spamalot on Broadway.  Spamalot is worth a trip into New York City, the funniest Broadway shows I have ever seen.  I didn't even realize that I didn't have a copy until I came home to look for it.  They have put out several editions at various prices depending on how many extras you really want.  I stuck with this version since it has plenty of bonus materials.

Cleese, Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Gilliam, and Jones all play multiple roles, combining non-sequitur humor with bloody duels and other pratfalls that parody medieval chivalry and archaic religious sentiment. Somehow, senselessly silly gags like the encounter with a killer rabbit and the Knights Who Say "Ni!" tickle the funny bone no matter how many times you watch. For brilliant, irreverent lunacy, seek the "Holy Grail."</p></br><a href="../users/A2NOZB6VZCTOI4.html">A2NOZB6VZCTOI4</a><br/><p>This new packaging of the Monty Python classic is to be cherished by Python fans as much (if not more) for the extras as for the film itself. I have always been a Python fan, and must confess that I actually prefer the series to the films, but the classic scenes in this film make it a must see. <p>The film was shot on a shoestring budget (funded largely by rock music celebrities) in horrible, wet weather by a small cast and crew, with direction from first time directors Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. The net result is a quasi-historical, utterly warped film about King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his knights in their search for the Holy Grail. Many entertaining diversions follow, including encounters with the 'Knights Who Say Ni' (my very favorite part of the entire film), a killer rabbit, plus a visit to the surprisingly appealing Castle Anthrax. <p>The extras are what make this version so desirable. Included on the two disc set are numerous diversions, including a couple of documentaries (one made in 1974 on location, and one made for this release.) One of the highlights of this package is the documentary &quot;The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations!&quot; in which Terry Jones and Michael Palin take us on visits to the locations where the film was shot. It is a very interesting and entertaining documentary with footage from the movie compared with how the areas look now; of particular interest are the interior views of the castles.<p>Also included is a collectible film cel made for this edition and a printed copy of the screenplay, so you can follow along, or clear up hard to decipher lines. This and many other little gems on the CD's (such as two scenes from the Japanese version, and a skit in which an older Michael Palin demonstrates uses for coconuts) make this a worthwhile addition to any video library.</p></br><a href="../users/AHCVWPLA1O4X8.html">AHCVWPLA1O4X8</a><br/><p>This movie is just hilarious.  I don't know how else to put it.  It's basically a series of short sketches that have to do with the legend of King Arthur.  He blunders his way about the land gathering 'knights' on his way and leading them on a search for the Holy Grail.  Along the way, he has some hilarious encounters.<p>One of the funniest aspects of this movie is the dialogue.  Some of the scenes are incredibly funny.  The burning of the witch (she turned me into a newt!) and Dennis the peasant (you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just cause some watery taut threw a sword at you!) are among the most memorable.  Equally funny is Arthur's battle with the black knight and Sir Robyn's encounter with the giant (when danger reared it's ugly head, he boldly turned his tail and fled).<p>The special features in this set are fabulous.  What could be more funny than Monty Python in legos!  Just the bonus disc is enough to entertain someone for hours.<p>Monty Python is undoubtedly one of the most talented comedy troupes ever to perform, and this is the creme of the python's crop.

No, I didn't!), initial photography on what would later become (from all my extensive years of movie watching) the single most unforgivably sidesplitting, enormously irreverent, shrewdly perceptive, unremittingly uproariously aggressive, gruesomely hysterical, and endlessly quotable comedies EVER.

There is a director's commentary out there--I heard it years ago on Comedy Central!<p>This sad fact aside, the color has been brilliantly restored to the print, which is usually washed out.  The sound is nicely preserved as well.<p>When they get around to releasing a DVD worthy of this fine film, I will be glad to give it as many stars as possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>Monty Python took a hell of a chance making a full lenght motion picture, as the simple production and mostly strictly six man skits which characterized their TV show and their live performances since 1968 gave their brilliant scripts and acting their full power. With the Flying Circus behind them, however, and John Cleese already starting to work on his own project with his wife (Fawlty Towers), Monty Python decided to take that chance, and it proved to be worth it, mainly due to the fact that Monty Python and the Holy Grail looks more like a collection of skits than a single story; any attempt to follow the storyline will be quite disappointing. However, almost every scene is brilliant by itself, and the movie provides some of the most memorable moments and one-liners in comedy history.<p>The perfect timing and team work of the Monty Python crew, which made 'Flying Circus' one of the most popular shows in history, was transferred well to the big screen. Additional actors were kept to a minimum, so each of the Pythonists played several parts. As usual, the casting is wonderful, and each of the six actors brings life to all his characters, as each one gets one or two great scenes to show what he has to offer. Graham Chapman was given the role of the straight man (sort of like Zeppo Marx only funnier) and does a great job in the part of King Arthur, as well as an unforgettable short appearence as God (&quot;Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy...&quot;) Terry Gilliam is, as usual, not given a very big part in the movie, but does a great work on his very few lines as both Patsy, Arthur's trusty steed (&quot;It's only a model.&quot;) and the keeper of the Bridge of Death, as well a short appearence as himself (The Animator). His animation sequences on this movie are his absolute best. Director Terry Jones does a wonderful Sir Bedevere, supplying the brilliant witch scene, as well as the unforgettable Prince Herbert. Michael Palin is a great Sir Galahad, but is more memorable as Dennis (&quot;Help! Help! I'm being repressed!&quot;) and of course the leader of the Knights Who Say Ni. Eric Idle is dreadfuly funny as usual as Sir Robin, and also as Roger the Srubber, Brother Maynard, the Dead Collector (&quot;Bring out your dead!&quot;) and Concorde. And most of all, John Cleese, making not only a wonderful Sir Launcelot, but also supply some of the film's most memorable moments as the newt guy, Tim the Wizard, the rude French soldier and of course the Black Knight (&quot;It's just a flesh wound!&quot;)<p>The comedic work of the Monty Python team, their scripts and their timing are flawless. Python's humor is one that works on familiarity and not on surprise, and so I still enjoy it after watching it about twenty times - it's the perfect kind of thing to own on video. Get the Holy Grail, as well as Life Of Brian, And Now For Something Completely Different, and Meaning Of Life. They  will become your most precious earthly posessions.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The whacky bunch behind Monty Python's Flying Circus got together in 1974 and crafted one of the most absurdly hilarious films ever made with Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

Whether you are a fan of the series or not, you will find this film one of the funniest movies you'll ever see, and it is an essential comedy to anyone and everyone.  The DVD features are more than worth noting as well; the double disc DVD features a laugh out loud commentary by Gilliam and Jones along with Cleese, Idle, and Palin, three karaoke-esque sing alongs, Gilliam's original artwork, fantasticly designed interactive menus based on Gilliam's art, and tons more.

Co-authored and then co-directed Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (two rather silly people indeed), this film makes at least some effort to recreate a distant period in history and from a somewhat 20th century perspective. Apparently available funds were limited because Gilliam and Junes could not afford to rent horses and thus were forced to simulate them with body language and coconut half shells. Also, various members of the Ye Olde Merrie Companie were required to play several different roles...on occasion at the same time. For example, Graham Chapman as King Arthur as well as (or as unwell as) the Three-Headed Knight and the Hiccoughing Guard. Eric Idle ia also actively involved as Sir Robin, Maynard, Roger, a Guard, and the Historian Who Isn't A.J.P. Taylor...plus some other stuff my limited space precludes noting. One of Gilliam and Jones's cleverest strategies is to juxtapose 6th century Breton with 20th century England. Actually, not only juxtapose them but to have the former and latter interact without prior warning. Yes, this creates some confusion but the plot lags on fewer occasions and younger persons in the audience will feel more at home.<p>According to various historical sources, there was not one Arthur but hundreds...perhaps thousands in 6th century England. Indeed, here in Dallas in the year 2003, there are thousands of Arthurs now living in the North Texas region. How many kings? Ooodles of Kings but no kings; however, back then (i.e. 6th century), there were quite a few. <p>According to generally reliable research sources, for example, Geoffrey of Monmouth (about 1100-1155 A.D.) recorded Arthur as a High-King of Britain. He was the son of his predecessor, Uther Pendragon and nephew of King Ambrosius. As a descendant of High-King Eudaf Hen's nephew, Conan Meriadoc, Arthur's grandfather, had crossed the Channel from Brittany and established the dynasty at the beginning of the 5th century. The Breton King Aldrien had been asked to rescue Britain from the turmoil in which it found itself after the Roman administration had departed. He sent his brother, Constantine, to help. Constantine appears to have been the historical self-proclaimed British Emperor who took the last Roman troops from Britain in a vain attempt to assert his claims on the Continent in 407. Chronologically speaking, it is just possible he was King Arthur's grandfather. Arthur's Breton Ancestry was recorded by Gallet.<p>Of course, historical material such as this brought tears of joy to the eyes of both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (also their parents). They were inspired by it to bring the story of King Arthur and the Holy Grail to the sometimes silver screen. This they have done. Truly, the Pendragons are the stuff of legend. Predictably, Gilliam and Jones took certain liberties to achieve enhanced dramatic effect, adding some important new information revealed by their own historical research. For example, details about martial arts for quadriplegics, the Sepulcher of the Holy Grenade and its Killer Rabbit, aerodynamics of various species of migrating swallows, and interior decorating (e.g. curtains) in 6th century royal quarters. Exciting new stuff indeed.<p>Who said in 1974 that "They just don't make great movies anymore"? Well, whoever said that could not be more wrong.<p>For proof, they are herewith directed to the abundance of materials which are available only with the DVD version of this film. If they are still not convinced, I fart in their general direction.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>What can you say about a film whose script has been virtually memorized by legions of fans since its release in 1975?<br /><br />"Fetchez la vache!" "Bring out your dead!" "English knnnnn-iggets!" "How do you noo she is a witch?" "Castle Anthrax" "Of course it's a good idea!" "Some call me.....Tim?" "It's only a flesh wound!" "Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?" "The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch" "Answer me these questions three!"<br /><br />Each of these quotes will immediately be recognized by Grail fans. The list of memorable lines and sight gags goes on and on.<br /><br />The film itself is the greatest of all comedies by the greatest of all comedy troupes. No small intellect is behind the script, and no insignificant amount of historical knowledge either. The actors avoid playing their parts with self-knowing irony, which gives viewers the a chance to get (or miss) the humor on their own. As much fun as the film are the director's commentaries and various shorts depicting the search for castles (not as easy as it might be supposed) and the shooting of the film itself. Two sad truths: Graham Chapman is no longer with us and John Cleese has developed into (perhaps always was?) an insufferable bore. Ah well, I'm over it.<br /><br />"Holy Grail" is a daffy, delicious send-up of socialist politics, encounters with the divine, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Grail romances, medieval science and the perils of living in a verminous and crud-bestrewn land.

My first viewing of the movie left me at once choking for oxygen and impressed by some of the subtle angles they took. Admittedly, not that much was all that subtle in the end.<br /><br />Containing great scenes that still endure as massively quotable, (even non-Python fans have heard of them), this is definitely a must-have for anyone remotely interested in the work of Monty Python. The black knight at the bridge is still one of the funniest things I have seen, (I still kill myself laughing at it). The "anarcho-syndicalist" serfs, ("You can't expect to weild supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!" -- Dennis to King Arthur), were just a treat. Overall, it is a good whipping at anything concerning King Arthur and a host of other tales from the medieval period.<br /><br />Simply put, this is among the best that Monty Python have done, and after over 30 years, it is still up there with the best comedy on the planet. I loved it back then, and I still love it now. An enduring classic that never bores. Great stuff that definitely needs oxygen and defibrillation units.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>There are so many things about this (and indeed any) Monty Python movie that one hardly knows where to begin. Nothing is left out of the mix--history, religion, politics, personal relationships, prejudices, intellectual prowess or the lack thereof. My title, of course, comes from an early scene in with Arthur approaches a castle, inexplicably occupied by French k-nigits, who claim to already have a grail.<br /><br />The Monty Python troupe, led by the creative talents of Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, incorporated John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman as King Arthur, the dominant role in the film. No animals were harmed in the filming, not even an African Swallow, non-migratory as they are. A few coconuts bit the dust, however, as did more than a few comic images. Logic bits the dust, too, on more than one occasion. I did a paper once for symbolic logic which I was told ten years later was still being passed about because I had dared to use something so unconventional as this Monty Python movie in the references (I couldn't see why that wouldn't be much more common, and indeed, hope it is today--I use 'Life of Brian' in homilies, so why not this film in logic?).<br /><br />The particular logical incident (or rather, illogical incident) involves the trial of a woman accused of being a witch. Through 'logic' it is demonstrated that she would be a witch if she weighed the same as a duck (which, surprisingly enough, it turns out that she does -- 'It's a fair cop' she concedes as the general rejoicing commences at the prospect of a bonfire). Those who have benefit of the 'Executive Version of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail' are also treated to an exposition of the logical problems which itself concludes that 'sex is better than logic'. And who could argue with that reasoning?<br /><br />However, my favourite scene would have to be the liturgical procession and reading of instructions for the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, with the leader's instruction 'skip a bit, brother' -- an instruction which I've searched in vain in the liturgical handbooks, but would vastly improve many readings on some mornings in church. This is a perfect parody of the sonorous but deadening readings that seem to drag on interminably.<br /><br />A close second would be the scene in which Arthur tries to explain his kingship to members of an autonomous collective (read, peasants without a lord) who view him as just another oppressor, and inform him that watery tarts throwing swords at you is not an adequate basis for the exercise of supreme executive power.<br /><br />Those who have visions of Great Britain as royal and cultural icons are often amazed-the likes of Monty Python and Benny Hill (among others) show the inhabitants of the UK as just as human (if not moreso) than the rest of the world. And we are all the richer for it. Alas, the Holy Grail is never actually attained by the seekers, who run into trouble with more French k-nigits and the local constabulary.

They encounter many things on their quests, and many humorous things happen.<br /><br /> This movie is hilarious. From beginning to end, it's filled with random, British-style, humor that will make you howl. The killer bunny rabbit, the Black Knight, the Camelot song, and an ending that will make you go, "WTF?!" is the best parts about this hilarious film.<br /><br /> If you want a good laugh, check this out!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p>By far one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, Monty Python and the Holy Grail holds up to repeated viewings. The knights of the round table are all delightfully dimwitted on their quest and it is a perfect mix of song, hilarious one-liners, and physical gags: "Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!"; the Black Knight ('tis but a scratch); the Killer Rabbit; the Holy Hand Grenade; "cut down a tree with...a herring!". It is hard to believe it was made for just peanuts and only in 5 weeks, this comedy has stood the test of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>After watching the musical production Monty Python's SPAMALOT this summer I could not resist in purchasing the DVD of this 1975 movie featuring the greatest comedy troupe ever! Here we are, 30 years later and it is still the most outrageous film with Monty Python. I think the real attribute is the work of Terry Gilliam's animation that was featured. This is a must for all Python fans and for those who have seen or plan to see SPAMALOT! Buy this DVD..You won't be disappointed!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>by far the best comedy period on my list. I laughed my love handles off watching this movie. my friends were right and I thank them for letting me see it. it's really, really great with awesome charcters like The Knights who say "nee!", Tim the Enchanter, The Killer Bunny, The old man at the bridge of death.<p>favorite part in that whole movie is when they meet the killer bunny. There are some other hilarious and memoriable parts like the Castle Anthrax with all the horned up maidens who want spankings and oral sex and the holy hand grnade of antioch. If anyone doesnt like this movie they ought to be shot.<p>French man- " I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of eldeberries!"<p>a damn addictive movie.

HEEEHEEE HEEEHEEE!<p>(If you've never experiened an unbridled reaction of this kind to absurd comedy, brilliant slapstick, or general silliness, then you will never like this movie. Your life will be devoid of humor ever after and will no longer have any meaning. Move along.)<p>If you have, and delight in the antics of the Pythons, you will not be disappointed. It's a wonderfully restored, remastered, re-whatevered DVD. I loved to hear the actors and directors still genuinely laughing -- after all these years -- on the commentary tracks. This movie stands the test of time as a comedic masterpiece.<p>And the extras are outstanding -- down to the nostalgic documentary with Terry Jones and Michael Palin as they retrace their steps to the Scottish locations where they made film history 30 years ago.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>There are so many things about this (and indeed any) Monty Python movie that one hardly knows where to begin. Nothing is left out of the mix--history, religion, politics, personal relationships, prejudices, intellectual prowess or the lack thereof. My title, of course, comes from an early scene in with Arthur approaches a castle, inexplicably occupied by French k-nigits, who claim to already have a grail.<br /><br />The Monty Python troupe, led by the creative talents of Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, incorporated John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman as King Arthur, the dominant role in the film.  No animals were harmed in the filming, not even an African Swallow, non-migratory as they are.  A few coconuts bit the dust, however, as did more than a few comic images.  Logic bits the dust, too, on more than one occasion.  I did a paper once for symbolic logic which I was told ten years later was still being passed about because I had dared to use something so unconventional as this Monty Python movie in the references (I couldn't see why that wouldn't be much more common, and indeed, hope it is today--I use 'Life of Brian' in homilies, so why not this film in logic?).<br /><br />The particular logical incident (or rather, illogical incident) involves the trial of a woman accused of being a witch. Through 'logic' it is demonstrated that she would be a witch if she weighed the same as a duck (which, surprisingly enough, it turns out that she does -- 'It's a fair cop' she concedes as the general rejoicing commences at the prospect of a bonfire).  Those who have benefit of the 'Executive Version of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail' are also treated to an exposition of the logical problems which itself concludes that 'sex is better than logic'. And who could argue with that reasoning?<br /><br />However, my favourite scene would have to be the liturgical procession and reading of instructions for the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, with the leader's instruction 'skip a bit, brother' -- an instruction which I've searched in vain in the liturgical handbooks, but would vastly improve many readings on some mornings in church. This is a perfect parody of the sonorous but deadening readings that seem to drag on interminably.<br /><br />A close second would be the scene in which Arthur tries to explain his kingship to members of an autonomous collective (read, peasants without a lord) who view him as just another oppressor, and inform him that watery tarts throwing swords at you is not an adequate basis for the exercise of supreme executive power.<br /><br />Those who have visions of Great Britain as royal and cultural icons are often amazed-the likes of Monty Python and Benny Hill (among others) show the inhabitants of the UK as just as human (if not moreso) than the rest of the world. And we are all the richer for it.  Alas, the Holy Grail is never actually attained by the seekers, who run into trouble with more French k-nigits and the local constabulary. But, the journey's the thing, so they teach me in seminary, and thus, this journey is well worth following to the end.<br /><br />The DVD comes with many extras, including the Camelot song being sung by Lego-land figures, and extensive commentary by actors and others involved in the production.<br /><br />Prepare to be amazed!

Not to mention some very nice shrubbery. Well, back in 1975, the lunatics that were Monty Python decided to destory any credibility these legends might have.<p>This brilliant farce is the stuff of legend itself. What with Wizards called Tim, killer bunny rabbits, and one knight that just doesn't know when to quit.<p>If you've never seen this film, shame on you. It should be required viewing for every member of the human race.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>There are been a lot of clever flims out there.  Films to make you laugh, films well written, well acted, well edited, with great special effects and all star casts...<p>...but lets forget about them and talk about Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  There are simply not enough adjatives to adaquately describe this film.  It is thinking humor, it is slapstick humor, it is political humor, it is irrevant humor, it parodies Arthurian Legends (with a jab at ancient greece as well) documentaries, spectacles, and itself all in one package.  <p>  It does all of this on a shoestring budget and a cast basically consisting of the six pythons, and a few extras thrown on here and there for speciality scenes.<p>  This movie isn't so much watched as experienced.  For maximum viewing pleasure don't let anyone tell you about the film.  Let them sit you down, turn on the VCR and be amazed.<p>  Like A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM you will miss funny things if you don't watch it multiple times; Unlike FORUM it is not due to editing but do to little backround things that are easy to miss.  I think three viewings minimum are necessary to catch all of the backround stuff.  Of course if you are not Leonard Malton then you will watch this movie three times out of sheer pleasure.  If you haven't bought it yet, shame on you! Don't you know that people are starving in the BBC residuals department!</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>A few months ago, I wrote a negative review for "Monty Python and The Holy Grail" that no one seemed to like. Well, today in school, we watched it in music class (didn't really understand the connection, unless it had something to do with "Spamalot"), and my opinion has now changed.<br /><br />I still have yet to watch the whole thing, but watching the film for the second time, I have now realized I was blind. I know understand a lot of the humor in it. This film is indeed screamingly funny. The opening credits? Hilarious! The coconuts? Inspired! The witch burning? Amazing! The Black Night? Classic! The Nights Who Say Ni? Great! This film may not be the funniest movie ever, but it's pretty close. It's in the Top 10.<br /><br />The extras add to a very funny movie. The commentary is funny, and the other extras are very enlightening. This is a film that I would recommend to only fans of certain humour, no "Saturday Night Live" or "South Park" humor. Still, this is a very funny movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>An awesomefilm with so many great line and great scenes.

And that's after seeing it enough times that I've become one of the annoying legion who can quote entire scenes from the film. Python are a rare combination of physical, low brow, silly, and philosophical humor. Some scenes you laugh at because they are so stupid (killer rabbit), others because they are so absurd (Black Knight) and others because of the amazing language used (anarchosyndicalist commune).<br /><br />Even though in my opinion this is the funniest movie ever made, I didn't give it 5 stars because as with most movies, it is not perfect. It falters in the last half hour and the ending leaves something to be desired. If you already know Python and don't like them, this movie won't change your mind. If you don't know them, this is the perfect place to start and if you're already a fan you didn't need to read this review because you've already seen the movie a hundred times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is a landmark of screen comedy.  It is easy to equate this brilliant Medieval tomfoolery with something that preceded it but this film is a true original.  The film is an intricately plotted series of comic setpieces that mocks the Arthurian legend with equal amounts of silliness and informed intelligence.  Thirty years on this film has lost none of it's comic luster.  I have numerous favorite moments but that would ruin it for the uninitiated.  I was fortunate to have seen this film when I was a teenager theatrically back in the day when the Pythons brand of madness was just breaking on these shores.  This package includes alot of good extras including commentaries by the surviving Pythons(R.I.P. Graham Chapman) and the "Lego" version of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>King Arthur and his knights embark on a low-budget search for the Grail, encountering many very silly obstacles.<br /><br />That is the tagline from the Internet Movie Database, and at the end of the day (and this reviewing session) I could not come up with a better way of describing the film. What do you get when you give about ?230,000 to a couple of debutante directors and the rest of the members of the greatest comic collective the world has ever seen? Monty Python And The Holy Grail!<br /><br />Monty Python And The Holy Grail is a truly great film and in particular a truly great comedy - to still generate laughs even after repeated viewings.<br /><br />What is the film about? King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is seeking knights to join him in the court of Camelot, and after some run-ins with the French, eventually gathers together Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Galahad the Chaste (Michael Palin) and Sir Robin the Not So Brave (Eric Idle). After not returning to Camelot for reasons well detailed in the film, the knights are confronted by God who gives them an awesome task - to find the Holy Grail. Now the fun really begins! They have to confront the dangers of The White Rabbit and The Bridge Of Death in order to seek what they hope to find. Many months pass before the possibility of success finally arrives. But then again, perhaps not. In case you are wondering, Terry Gilliam plays the part of Patsy - Arthur's "horse" - but like everyone else also plays a bunch of other parts, so typically Monty Python. Not so typically Monty Python is the fact that apart from Dennis's mother, all female parts are actually played by females!<br /><br />With classic comedy scenes aplenty - you must have seen the Black Knight scene surely? - that still are as funny today as they were twenty five odd years ago, this is truly a gem of a film. What this bunch of comic geniuses managed to achieve on a shoestring budget remains one of the pre-eminent comedy classics, ranking up there with the likes of Buster Keaton's The General. Okay, it looks cheap and nasty at times, but you really would be hard-pressed to make any complaint - there are plenty of way over-budget Hollywood pieces of tripe that could not even approach the delights of this film with one hundred times the budget. And this was but one of their classic films! When you add into the mix a collection of some of the funniest gag subtitles during the opening credits, the inspired surprise opening and everything else, this is a true classic DVD release.<br /><br />Monty Python fans have been awaiting this sort of local release for far too long and to finally have it is to emphasise why. Whilst the film urges you to run away frequently, the only direction you should be running is towards your nearest DVD retailer to order this DVD. Brilliant stuff all through, and an essential purchase for any DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>From the trumpet flourish at the beginning of the film, followed by the approach of Arthur galloping on foot with the sounds of coconuts being smacking against one another by his minstrel, to the climactic finish of the film, when the Knights of Camelot are seized while attacking a French Castle for actions against a news commentator earlier in the film, has history been so humorously re-&quot;created&quot; as it has been in this brilliantly funny film by the British Troupe of comedic actors known affectionately by fans world wide as &quot;Monty Python&quot;.<p>&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; is a tongue-in-cheek look at the lore surrounding the Arthurian Legend and his quest for the Holy Grail.  The film pulls no punches, taking jabs at everything from the political strife between the French and the British, the Catholic Church, the Inquisition, the British Aristocracy and just about every legend and myth surrounding King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable.<p>When Arthur (Graham Chapman) is approached by God to discover the secret resting place of the Holy Grail, he at once sets out on a quest to find it, picking up his entourage of knights along the way: Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Launcelot (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), and Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin).<p>While on their quests, each face a variety of hilarious challenges, including the construction of a Trojan Rabbit, the approach of Castle Anthrax with the multidle of Vestial Virgins,<br />the rabbit with &quot;big, pointy, teeth&quot;, and of course, the Knights who say &quot;Ni&quot;.<p>Originally filmed in 1975, the movie has become a cult-classic, and a favorite for many generations of Monty Python enthusiasts.  Considered by many to be their most successful feature film, the Holy Grail relies on a careful combination of slapstick humor combined with clever writing and high-brow British wit.  Though some of the humor relates to the period the film was shot, most of it transcends any generation, poking fun at history with an originality and absurdity that is funny and entertaining.<p>Make sure to pay close attention to the many characters throughout the film, for many of the &quot;Python&quot; principals play more than one character.  In many instances, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones can be seen carrying on conversations with themselves.  Its one of the many hilarious twists that the Monty Pyhton troupe use in their films.<p>This is a great film for anyone who has yawned their way through a world history class in high-school or college.  It brings a slanted and hilarious version of history to life in a way that only the men of Monty Python can.<p>-Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>This film is still hilarious and the extras are fun.  <p>I never knew that the colors were as bright as they are on this DVD.

Despite one or two slow periods in the film, this is definitely a comedy you need to have a pulse to get.  The DVD specal edition has it's own little moments of humor as well.  Not only do you have commentaries from the members of Monty Python (above ground, anyway), but even subtitles in Shakespearean form (for the more high-brow types).  The second disc is where you'll find a shrubbery full of features, including sing-alongs and my prsonal favorite in this set, part of the film done with Legos (you know, the blocks you put together to make stuff that you may have played with during your kiddie years)!  For Monty Python fans and fans of insane and confusing comedy, this one's definitely for you.</p></br></body></html>

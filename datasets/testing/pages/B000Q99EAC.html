Sylvester Stallone has given us a movie that nearly comes close to the original "Rocky" (1976) and is the best sequel of the series. His directing and story and screenplay are excellent. The cast led by Stallone is excellent. The music by Bill Conti (who also did the original "Rocky" & the sequels) is excellent. The cinematography by J. Clark Mathis is great. The film editing by Sean Albertson is great. The casting by Diane Heery & Sheila Jaffe (both of them also did the casting to "Invincible" (2006) is great. The production design by Franco-Giacomo Carbone (who also did the production design to the upcoming "Bug" (2007) is great. The art direction by Michael Atwell & Jesse Rosenthal is great. The set decoration by Robert Greenfield (who also did the upcoming "Lucky You" (2007) is great. The costume design by Gretchen Patch is great. This is an interesting sports film that will keep you entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A81P47EIXM8HA.html">A81P47EIXM8HA</a><br/><p>I just came from the opening showing of the film and a suprisingly packed house for a noon viewing!  I really enjoyed the film and the story...as well as Stallone's brilliant dialog.  This was the Rocky character we all fell in love with 30 years ago....and I really appreciated all the references to the history of the character and particularly the first installment. A very good bookend to the first ROCKY...I don't want to spoil it for others by discussing plotlines...just encourage fans of the first,  in particular, to get off their butts and to the theatre....it would be good for this to succeed and shut up all the big mouths and naysayers who want this character to go away.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>Rocky Balboa captures some of the drama and spirit of the first Rocky film.  With R.B., the Rocky story comes full circle.  Unlike Rocky III and IV, which were almost cartoonish, there is real emotion and drama in R.B.  The movie is entertaining and inspiring.<br /><br />Some of the acting is good (Stallone, Hughes, Young) and some is lousy (Ventimiglia.)  [Note:  Why didn't Sage Stallone play Rocky's kid?]  The script is sufficient but a some of the dialog is embarrassing.  The emotional connections and Rocky's giant heart carry the film.<br /><br />The biggest problem with all the Rocky movies (from II forward,) is that the boxing sequences are, on some level, ridiculous.  It's nice to suspend one's belief once in awhile for the sake of entertainment, but it's almost insulting to pretend that fighters could take the types of beatings Rocky and his opponents take in these movies.  The best boxers to ever step foot in the ring couldn't wildly throw punches and take shots to the head for 10-12 rounds.  Fights just don't work that way.  Watching a 50-some year old "retired" fighter go toe-to-toe for 10 rounds with the heavyweight champion of the world, a fighter in is prime, is complete and utter farce.  For me, I would have been pleased to watch a match that was more paced and deliberate, in a word: realistic.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, it is worth watching.  If nothing else, Rocky's life lessons (never give up, believe in yourself, keep moving forward, go for your dreams) give R.B. considerable value.<br /><br />[3.5 stars]</p></br><a href="../users/ADJBUPS8SJHTC.html">ADJBUPS8SJHTC</a><br/><p>I have watched Rocky since it first came out and I just love the guy! I almost got to see it when it first came out around Christmas, but opted to Dreamgirls and prayed to be one of the first to buy it when they released it on DVD, and sure enough, I was one of the first, I watched it tonight and wasn't disappointed; Watching Rocky at Adrian's grave was real touching; Bringing back Little Marie(now grown and in need of a little help)was a nice touch; Seeing Rocky moving on with his restaurant(lvoingly named after Adrian) and seeing Paulie again(who never disappoints us no matter what with his wisecracks and asides); and you got a good ending to a great set of movies; I'm like the promoter who wanted Rocky in Rocky 5, Rocky truly fought some wars in the ring, and in this film, he shows us that he still got some of it left in him; Only this time, he goes toe to toe with the Boxing Commission, for refusing to let him box even though he passed the tests and physicals; To bringing his family in line for this event, and most of all, bringing himself to the ring and fighting this young fella; he doesn't disappoint us. Personally, I thought after Rocky 5, it was OVER. even bought the Boxed 5 set; but I was a bit happy to see Rock come back like a phoenix in Rocky Balboa. He'll always be a favorite and hero of mine.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This is the only Rocky movie I've seen in theaters. We have all of the other Rocky movies, but I didn't watch them till yesterday. My husband is the Rocky fan. We've had the movies for many years. I don't know why I never watched them before. They are really good movies.<br /><br />I really enjoy this movie. It was crazy seeing how much time's have changed going from the first five Rocky movies to this updated, bright, clear movie. What a nice change. Rocky won at the end of this movie. But in the Deleted Scenes he lost the fight. I think him losing is a better ending. But I guess Rocky wants to live on in peoples mind. I guess he didn't want them to think he is too old to fight. No matter what age he is he can win. I guess that's what Sylvester Stallone is saying.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>For the sixth and final film of his legendary boxing series, writer/director Sly Stallone brings back characters only seen some 30 years earlier.<br /><br />Spider Rico (Lovell), the opponent defeated by Rocky Balboa at the start of the first story, is now punch drunk and a recipient of the ex-champ's affectionate protection.

It was good to see Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, Burt Young as Paulie and Tony Burton as Duke (Rocky and Apollo Creed's trainer). Rocky had to give it one last shot and get it out of his system. It was well worth the elegiac journey. Rocky's fight scene in this Blu-ray edition should look fantastic since that sequence was shot with digital cameras.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Rocky Balboa" can be viewed in two distinct ways: it's either an unoriginal film that reuses all the best elements from the original "Rocky"; or it's a well-crafted film that respectfully pays tribute to its origins while telling a new and compelling story. For whatever it's worth, I tend to favor the latter interpretation. While it isn't perfect, I still greatly enjoyed this movie. It's a heartfelt story written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, one that manages to steer clear of becoming sappy, preachy, or melodramatic. Yes, the climactic fight scene is also entertaining, but it's nowhere near as important as what takes place early on. Just like the original 1976 film, this is not a story about boxing; it's about amounting to something amidst the realities of everyday living. Stallone created an underdog character, representing the everyman who wanted a chance at greatness.<br /><br />In some ways, these underlying themes take on even greater significance than when they were presented thirty years ago. Still living in Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is now an aging restaurant owner. Consumed with remorse over the death of his beloved Adrian, he begins to wonder whether or not he still has what it takes to get through life. It's apparent on the anniversary of her death that he needs to go in a different direction; not only does he visit her grave, he and Paulie (Burt Young)--Adrian's brother--also visit all the spots where Adrian and Balboa were together. They stop by the pet store where she and Balboa looked at birds. They stand on the stoop of Balboa's home, where he envisions her as she once appeared. They even visit the vacant lot of the now demolished ice skating rink. When at this location, Paulie loses himself, feeling as if he has no right to remind himself of his sister (who he treated badly).<br /><br />His last stop is a sleazy little bar, where he meets the local bartender, Marie (Geraldine Hughes). As it turns out, she's the same Marie that Balboa walked home thirty years ago, back when she was just a young girl ("Screw you, creepo!" were her final words to him). They immediately strike up a friendship, made stronger with the introduction of her son, nicknamed Steps (James Francis Kelly III). For whatever reason, they motivate Balboa into random acts of kindness, such as employing them both for his restaurant. While Marie is certainly grateful, she has a hard time understanding why he's being so generous. "You don't owe us nothing," she says one night as Balboa replaces the bulb of her porch light. "Why do you have to owe something to get something?" is his simple yet significant reply. This scene worked especially well because so much was being said with so few words; a lot of this film works on that level (it made me think twice about criticizing Stallone's overly-colloquial writing style).<br /><br />Other relationships highlight the story, such as that between Balboa and his son, Rocky, Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia), who has gone on to become a suit-wearing paper pusher in a wealthy Philadelphia high rise. When making a surprise visit, Balboa sees his son's boss acting belligerently, suggesting that his son is willing to let people step all over him. He clearly has some issues, always feeling as if he's lived in the shadow of his famous father. Now it seems as if Rocky, Jr. is unwilling to visit the family restaurant, opting instead to go out for drinks with his friends. During one such outing, the bar's television is tuned in to the sports channel, where a computer-simulated match between Balboa and current heavyweight champion Mason "The Line" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is fought. Of course, the animated Balboa wins.<br /><br />But when the real Balboa hears of this "victory," thoughts of actually entering the ring one last time begin floating through his head. Consider the fact that at his restaurant, he goes from table to table, telling his guests stories about his past fights; is this not indicative of someone who still has something to prove? His son seems to think so, and the feelings only get stronger when Balboa decides to go through with it. Rocky, Jr. is initially unwilling to support his father, who he thinks will only succeed in embarrassing them both. The sports world doesn't hold out much hope, either; Balboa will be up against Dixon, who's younger, faster, and more athletic. But Balboa is determined to do what he feels is the right thing.<br /><br />Thus begins the obligatory montage training sequence, set against Bill Conte's famous score. Just like in the first film, Balboa runs through the city in a gray sweat suit. He punches sides of beef in Paulie's slaughterhouse. There are even some brief shots of him chugging a glassful of raw eggs. (I can't say whether or not this scene was written to appease fans of the original film. I suppose it doesn't really matter; if a film's plot centers on an impending boxing match, training footage is a necessary component.)<br /><br />I won't bother describing anything about the final fight scene in Las Vegas; because the entire film builds up to it, you should experience it for yourselves. I will say that, to a degree, I questioned the plausibility of it, especially in terms of Dixon's involvement. He's an undefeated champion boxer, yet he's not respected in the sports community, labeled as someone who only picks easy opponents. I also got the impression that he genuinely respects Balboa, despite offering a way for him to be defeated without embarrassment. He comes to believe that his managers are only interested in the financial success of the fight, and that made me wonder why he would actually want to be in the ring at all; such a hollowly conceived boxing match cannot be easily dismissed.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the ending of "Rocky Balboa" is appropriate. It helps that the fight scene in and of itself does not represent the soul of the film; as I said before, this is not a story about boxing. At one point, Balboa says something to effect of, "It's not about whether or not you get hit, but about how hard you can be hit and get back up." It may be a cliche statement, but there's no denying that it rings true. Is this film better than the original "Rocky"? Of course not. Nothing ever will be better than that. But is it a worthy final chapter to the film series? Absolutely.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>In 1976, an unknown and struggling actor named Sylvester Stallone wrote an underdog boxing fable and somehow convinced the powers that be to allow him to be cast in the starring role. The success of the film (modest box office hit, Oscar wins for Best Movie and Directing) garnered four sequels of varying quality before the franchise was put in hiatus for 17 years. But, now, at last, the 60-year-old Stallone, feeling his oats again and desiring one last hurrah, brings to a close the Rocky Balboa saga.<br /><br />SPOILERS and a few boxing trivia follow here: If you're any sort of boxing fan, then you know that the heavyweight class has been in steady decline for a number of years now; it's just been fairly recently that Wladimir Klitschko has been imposing his dominance over the sundry contenders/pretenders. ROCKY BALBOA borrows from the real-life lack of an undisputed, linear heavyweight champ and transposes it somewhat onto its movie premise. In the plot, undefeated and current heavyweight champion Mason "the Line" Dixon (real life light heavyweight pugilist Antonio Tarver) has been knocking out his opponents for a while now but, because of the lack of depth in his weight class and the absence of a fighter who could truly test him, he's considered to be a dubious champion by fans and boxing pundits. Even an ESPN computer simulation refuses to show him respect as it pits him versus a past champion in Rocky Balboa; to add insult to injury, the computer even has Balboa knocking out Dixon. Dixon's manager, who is well aware of his client's prevailing unpopularity, hits on the idea of putting on an exhibition match between Dixon (33 wins, 0 losses, 30 knockouts) and Rocky Balboa (57 wins, 22 losses, 28 knockouts). And, speaking of Rocky...<br /><br />With the loss of his wife and anchor, Adrian, to cancer, ex-prizefighter Rocky Balboa, now 58 years in age, has basically been just drifting. He spends much of his time missing Adrian and, every year, on the anniversary of her passing, he frequents their old hangouts, much to the distress and disgust of his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), who is as unpolitically correct and irascible as ever. Rocky owns and runs Adrian's, a nice, little Italian restaurant, and amuses the customers by regaling them with his fight experiences and accomodating them with photo ops. When Rocky catches a glimpse of the same virtual match on ESPN, his aged motor gets going; he begins to mull over the idea of re-entering the ring and fighting in small, local bouts. Somehow, against everyone's wishes (including and especially his overshadowed son, Robert), he's even granted a boxing license. Dixon's manager and promoter approach him with the offer to fight a 10-round exhibition bout (but with no protective gear) with the current champ; this  challenge proves to be too much for Rocky to resist as he still harbors a "beast" inside of him.<br /><br />The rest of the movie goes on to depict the by now expected montage of training sessions - including the traditional sprint up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art - and culminates in the highly anticipated match, where Rocky is considered a massive underdog. Even with the fans solidly behind him and chanting out his name, Rocky is hard pressed to beat a champion who's reigning and defending his crown in the prime of his life. In the end, as usual, it goes down to heart, as Mason Dixon finally finds the defining test he's been looking for and Rocky seeks to tame the savage beast within him one final time. I won't say who wins, but let me put it this way: Rocky exits on his own terms.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is, without a doubt, the quintessential underdog, and, obviously, is one of the most universally beloved cinematic creations of our time. The city of Philadelphia has taken the Rocky character on as one of its very own citizens. Rocky, for 30 years now, has simply resonated within the souls of the populace and it's easy to see why. The man isn't too bright, though he does have a certain street savvy and has become wiser over the years. He's innately lovable - a big palooka who works hard and is intrinsically true to himself. He's very rootable. In ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone returns his iconic character to his roots, the seamy neighborhoods of Philly peopled with blue-collared Joes. This film is predominantly a series of low key character-driven scenes, one after the other, punched up, every now and then, by Balboa's occasional impassioned speeches (you could see Sly straining for the Oscar), until the big, showy brawl at the end. We get to hear and ponder Rocky's gravelly, ineloquently vocalized homespun philosophies and realize that, while Rocky's no brain surgeon, he's smart enough to know what matters most in life, a nugget of wisdom he imparts to his unfulfilled and whiny son, as played annoyingly by the plastically smouldering Milo Ventimiglia (who also isn't exactly my most favorite character in HEROES), whose turnaround to his father's side happens too rapidly for my taste. Yes, the pace is deliberate and, at times, threatens to plod. A lot of the flashbacks shown in the first half hour will certainly test the patience of folks unaware of the Rocky history. I even found some of the old clips too much to take as I wanted the movie to advance already. But, in the end, Sly knew what he was doing as these quiet moments do serve to make Rocky's last time in the ring heartachingly more resonant.<br /><br />The other actors aren't shabby. Burt Young inhabits Paulie from such a deep, personal place that I really can't picture him in any other kind of role. Antonio Tarver (who, by the by, after this movie, went on to decisively lose his very next bout to the elderly, blown-up heavyweight Bernard Hopkins) is decent enough as Rocky's boxing foil, although the script doesn't really call for him to stretch as an actor. Geraldine Hughes takes over Jodi Letizia's role as Little Marie, who reappears after 30 years. Little Marie was the girl who told Rocky, "Screw you, creepo!" after he walked her safely home; this time, she has more of an integral role to play. Marie, apparently, didn't listen to Rocky's advise from way back and has become a single mom with very low self-esteem. We'll never know if a romance will develop between her and Rocky but we are assured of a blooming friendship between the two. Hughes' deft portrayal of the wounded Marie makes you wish good things to happen for her. Unfortunately, not much can be said of the actor who plays her son, Steps, as the audience never really gets a chance to know him.<br /><br />It was nice to see actual folks in the flick who are major players in the world of boxing. Credibility is lent with the appearances of ESPN's Brian Kenny (who's had his own verbal battles with Floyd Mayweather, Jr.), the HBO boxing commentary crew (Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, Max Kellerman), announcer Michael Buffer ("Let's get ready to rumble!"), ref Joe Cortez (who really does say "Remember, guys, I'm fair but I'm firm"), promoter Lou Dibella, and the cigar toting boxing historian Bert Sugar.<br /><br />Of course, this movie ain't perfect. The plot tends to drag at times, not enough time is spent working on Mason Dixon's character (although his relationship with his former trainer proves to be surprisingly touching), and I find it vexing that not one mention is made about the brain damage Rocky incurred in ROCKY V.<br /><br />So is ROCKY BALBOA as good as the first ROCKY? No, not by a mile. But, while it doesn't live up to my high expectations, it certainly contains enough graceful moments which affected me at a deep enough gut level that I can honestly recommend it. Needless to say, this movie is best experienced in a rambunctiously crowded theater with folks who are all in the know about the Rocky films. I guarantee you ROCKY BALBOA'll serve up a nice, warm slug of nostalgia. Like I said, the movie's pace is leisurely so take the time to savor the scenes as there won't be any more after this. ROCKY BALBOA is a fitting capper to what has been an iconic film series. By the way, in an interview on a radio sports show, Stallone made mention that he would like another crack at John Rambo with the intention of making the next movie more character driven as well, as opposed to the last two action oriented sequels. If he can revive Rambo as well as he did ROCKY BALBOA, then count me in.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>One of the pleasant surprises of 2006 is the "come back" of Sylvester Stallone, or Rocky Balboa, in his sixth and probably the final chapter that began back in 1976. The sixth "Rocky" film, or simply "Rocky Balboa," turned out much better than people had expected, if not as great as the first Oscar-winning one which is now part of American movie history.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa, now retired, and running a restraint, steps into the ring for the last time. It's an exhibition match against Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), current heavy weight champion whose unpopularity is part of the reasons behind the match in Las Vegas. I am afraid the story is not as plausible as it should be, not because of the age of the star or Rocky himself, (who still looks in good shape), but because even the former champion like Rocky, I think, would have to fight his way more than the film describes, before the bout against the champion. The film's script is rushed at certain places like the relations between Rocky and his son, or the training scenes before the match.<br /><br />Still I liked "Rocky Balboa" for one reason. It is that Stallone, truly in character, delivers one of his best acting as Rocky, clearly aged, but still with dignity. The strength of the film is the character of Rocky himself, whose honesty and good-natured personality is exactly what makes this film special. There is no Adrian any more, but Stallone wisely brought back little girl Marie from the original, who is now living with her son. Geraldine Hughes is impressive as grown-up Marie, whose quiet interaction with Rocky reminds us of what he was like in the first Rocky film, where budding romance between him and Adrian played the major part of the story.<br /><br />The film is not flawless. The use of archive footages from the previous Rocky films is too much for me, and sometimes the film gets too sentimental. Still I think "Rocky Balboa" with moving moments and inspirational messages, is winner, if it is not a knockout.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>There's a scene in the beginning of `Rocky Balboa' where I thought of Bruce Springsteen's famous song, "Glory Days".  Rocky has long since retired from boxing and has bought an Italian restaurant in Philly.  One night he's schmoozing with his guests from table to table.  He's enthusiastically telling his favorite stories in the ring when one guest cuts him off to finish the ending.  They've heard it all before.  And so have we.  In the Springsteen song, there's the punch line, "...The time of glory...leaves you with nothing, Mister, but boring stories of...glory days."  They weren't boring; it's just there's nothing new to tell.  The rest of the movie finds Rocky wanting to make new stories.  Seldom does `Rocky Balboa' seem like a sentimental reunion that only clings to the past.  Rather, the flashbacks melt well into the present day.  What we know goes well with what's new.<br /><br />Adrianne has died and their son, Rocky, Jr. (Burt Young) has grown into a semi-successful white collar worker.  He's the apple of dad's eye, but Rocky's own "glory days" cast a shadow on his son.  He offers his son some philosophical words we can all take to heart:  "It's not how hard you fight in life.  It's how hard you can take the punches..."  Rocky still has ties with Paulie (Burt Young) the one who lent him the meat locker.  His advice to Rocky is also sage:  "You're living life backwards, Rocco...Change channels."  So the aging Rocky clings to his memories of Adriane, pains after years of physical strain, and his reluctant retirement.  As one might guess, he gets a second chance.  I was so impressed with the development, I had to smile at how Sylvester Stallone pulled it off .<br /><br />Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is that second chance.  A notorious champion, Dixon's a prima dona who doesn't give his opponents much of a chance.  (He reminds us of the contrast between growing up watching Ali and Frasier fight splendidly for free and today's debacles on Pay-per-view.)  Once opponents and a huge audience seem elusive, Dixon's promoters brainstorm an exhibition fight with Rocky, one that is meant to create interest, partly as a fund-raiser.  It also is meant to resolve ESPN's speculative computer simulation of two boxers from different eras match up.<br /><br />With some effective scenes that warm up the heart between Paulie, an old acquaintance Marie (Geraldine Hughes), her grown son, Rocky's son--and the loving bond they share despite their differences--there's plenty of tender moments.  (And none of them stem from the meat locker.)  Then, they put on a fine show.  Plausible developments come to the fore in the ring where Stallone's stylish freeze-frame approach manages well with the poignant flashbacks, artfully done like none before in the 'Rocky' franchise.  'Rocky Balboa' offers many rounds of heartfelt entertainment and wisely ducks from any false sentimentality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>When it was revealed that there was going to be a Rocky VI, many naysayers groaned and complained that enough was enough and that Sly was too over the hill and couldn't pull it off.  But the TRUE FANS out there knew differently.  Even the critics, who initially made skeptical/negative comments about the sixth installment, started turning their stories around after viewing the film in its entirety.  Rocky Balboa is a real winner of a movie, that fully realizes the essence of the original classic and brings the saga full circle to a thrilling, emotional, and very memorable conclusion.<br /><br />Many years have gone by since last we saw Rocky, who is now a widower, estranged from his son and still mourning the loss of his beloved wife, Adrian.  There are some truly touching moments of Rocky at the cemetery, sitting by her grave (when I saw the film in theaters, no one in the audience made a sound - even the rowdy ones - during these scenes, out of pure respect for the characters) as well as Rocky's journey, with Paulie, to all the places he took Adrian on their classic first date.  So touching.<br /><br />Now Rocky has his own restaurant, where he greets his customers and regales them with past stories of glory.  But deep inside of him is a rage that he must get out of himself and conquer in order to move on with his life.  The only way to do that is to go back in the ring.  But when a computer simulated match between Rocky and the current reigning heavyweight champion of the world, Mason Dixon, is shown on TV, showing Rocky as the victor, word spreads like wildfire for the real thing.<br /><br />No Rocky film is complete without a training montage, and this film's got it in spades.  Stallone has the character of Rocky so integrated within himself, and gives nothing short of one of his finest performances on screen.  Many memorable scenes, including Rocky's long and emotional talk with his son, as well as his new relationship with Marie (the young woman Rocky walked home back in the first installment) make for truly compelling drama.  And the climactic fight at the finale is the icing on the cake.  It's inspirational and never disappoints for a second.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa belongs in the collection of every fan (and non-fan alike for that matter) and the DVD is loaded with wonderful bonus features, including Audio Commentary with Stallone, Deleted Scenes, Featurettes, Alternate Ending, and more.  Pick this film up and watch it again and again.  You'll be happy you did.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa - a fitting end to the Rocky Saga!<br /><br />"But it ain't about how hard you hit.  It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." - Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>After 16 years, Sylvester Stallone has accomplished what many figured would never happen. He came back with a new Rocky movie, and he came back with a really GOOD Rocky movie. Not only does Rocky still have punches in him, but so does Stallone. As a fan of the series, I can safely say that this is the best entry since the original. Quickly, the plot sees Rock running his own restaraunt, Adrian's, named after his deceased wife(Talia Shire is missed, but it works, and Shire herself says she trusts and believes in Sly with this twist in the story), and he doesn't have a strong relationship with his son(Milo Ventamiglia). A virtual reality boxing match on TV pitting him against Mason "The Line" Dixon(Antonio Carver)has Rocky defeating him, and setting up a real life match with Rocky coming out of retirement for one last match. It's an interesting premise, really, and it works. Some may think it takes too long to get going or to get to the action, but that's why it works. It's not just about action and boxing, but about the people and the character of Rocky. That's why I like it. I am just as interested, if not more, in the non-boxing aspects of the movie. The best thing about the Rocky films is that each one finds the Italian Stallion in a new part of his life and takes it from there. He's older now, and the film doesn't overlook it just for Rocky and Sly to have another shot at glory. It's about age. It's a big part of the film. That's one of the great things about the film. They are not overlooking reality and age just to make another film. I hear the same thing is being done for Indy 4. The flashback scenes are scarce(although others say otherwise), and the "tour" of the old haunts is nostalgic, affective, and well placed. This film feels like a Rocky film, and has a sense of the original film. Little Marie(Geraldine Hughes) is back, as well as Spider, and this leads to the film's closer touch to the classic original. Burt Young's Paulie is still Paulie, and it would seem out of place to have a Rocky movie without him. The movie is surprisingly real, emotional, and heartfelt. You can't help but get caught up in the situation and cheer Rock on one last time. The end match is great, and feels like the real deal. It's exceptionally planned out and set up, and makes the tension feel real as you watch it. Bill Conti's theme is back, and it still raises goosebumps when it starts up. Sly isn't the greatest actor, but he is Rocky, and he knows Rocky, and he is really good in the film, as well as behind the camera as a director. Rocky V had it's moments, but it was not the film to end on. This one is. It fits wonderfully, and it wraps it up perfectly. To see the love and respect Rocky gets from people, especially in the end, is heartwarming. It doesn't fail to bring a lump to your throat. To matter how old you get, or where your life takes you, Rocky Balboa tells you to never give up. Thanks for coming back with Rocky one more time Sly. You made a truly wonderful film for this iconic character and series to go out on.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>One of the biggest surprises in recent cinema, "Rocky Balboa" recaptures the heart and spirit of the 1976 Oscar winner. The 16-year hiatus adds graceful poignancy to the aging Philly underdog - a quality lacking in the previous sequels. Sylvester Stallone delivers an affecting performance as the iconic boxer who defies skepticism by taking on the current heavyweight champion (Antonio Tarver) in a Vegas exhibition match. As writer-director, Stallone bounces back from the pitfalls of sequelitis by making a detailed character study that gives his famous creation a stirring finale. Against all odds, "Rocky Balboa" emerges as a minor triumph.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Rocky Balboa' is a pretty credible addition to the Rocky series which has a decent story, decent direction and decent acting from Stallone. Considering he wrote, directed and starred in this film that's not bad going at all. Following Rocky as he fights a comeback `exhibition' fight with the reigning world champion, this film has plenty of fight scenes and Rocky training with the usual rousing soundtrack to add to the atmosphere. Stallone shows Rocky's motivation for wanting to fight again and his relationship with his son to good effect and the whole film builds on the Rocky franchise, whilst also redeeming itself against some of the more dubious sequels. Overall, if you're a fan of the Rocky films this shouldn't disappoint and if you're new to Rocky you can still watch this and get some enjoyment out of it without being aware of the full back story. Worth a look.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Sylvester Stallone directs and stars in this 2006 drama.<br />Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa returns to the ring to fight<br />a young heavyweight champion. Sly did a great job and<br />he proved that even at 60, Rocky could still get back<br />in the ring one last time. This dvd has nice picture<br />and sound plus cool extras. I recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I loved it. I waited six or seven years for this Rocky masterpiece to come out, and it was all worth it. I love when they play the original theme during his training and running up the stairs with Punchie. (His dog.) I loved all the Adrian and Mickey flashbacks. I also loved the fight toward the end with Rocky and Mason, showing that Rocky could still go toe-to-toe, so people who want him to win, you might be disappointed, but hard-core fans who love Rocky and see that he still has it, you'll love it. Also, I thought the fight was too short, but it was still great. I highly recommend ROCKY BALBOA!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Suprisingly just about everyone, Stallone decided to make a real movie with Rocky Balboa instead of the cartoons that had preceeded it; the only sequel that is true in spirit to the original, it can be a bit slow in the first half but it's a worthy film and a fine capper to the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Gotta Be Willing To Take The Hits<br /><br />"Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, but it ain't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. It's about how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now if you know what you're worth, go out and get what your worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!"<br />-Rocky.<br /><br />So this movie... is not too bad, actually. Rocky is an old dog now, still got some good mileage left, but clearly he has taken his hits, and then some. In fact he seems to be pretty much done, his glory days long since past. But of coarse we know he's got some fight left in him and watching him pull himself up by his boots straps like the all American hero is, get back into shape and get into that ring one last time(?) you may actually feel respect for this character and enjoy the film. The greatest moment comes when his son shows up and Rocky delievers a truly inspired speech that serves as the message of the film. Stallone made a decent film and heartfelt send-off for Rocky.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Sylvester Stallone is feeling nostalgic lately. Between "Rocky Balboa" and the latest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHP2C">Rambo</a> installment, he's trying to resurrect past glories and reconfirm that his skills as a writer/director/actor are worth recalling as solid. "Rocky Balboa" goes a long way towards re-establishing Stallone's credibility for the better.<br /><br />"Rocky Balboa" is a well done, feel good sixth chapter, redeeming the sometimes absurdity of the later <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOGS">Rocky</a> films. Rocky is an older man, he's lost his Adriane but named his restaurant after her, has a son who hates living in a shadow. (Weird irony - years ago when Weird Al did a Rocky parody song to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5IK">Eye of The Tiger,</a> he sang about Rocky opening a deli.) But 'Rock' wants one more chance to show what he's made of after a simulated "Then Vs Now" simulation shows a fight between Rocky and current champ Mason Dixon.<br /><br />Cue Bill Conti and Stallone in sweats. Virtually a tribute to previous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5VM">Rocky flicks</a> (complete with multiple flashbacks and Burt Young/Paulie), the movie offers feel-good comments and philosophical asides like a zen-boxing Master. Rocky befriends Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and her son as an antidote to his loneliness, but is far too honorable to move beyond just helping her out. Showing the arrogant champ that the must important muscle being a real champ has is his heart. Proving to glib cynical sportscasters that age is just a number. The movie is very predictable, refuses to play into a maudlin ending, and - most importantly - absolves Stallone from the last few years of sleepwalking through his 90's movies.<br /><br />Interesting note - the filming in Philadelphia had already wrapped when a snowstorm hit that day, and the opportunity for more dramatic settings had arrived. The crew quickly grabbed a camera and filmed an impromptu re-shoot of the street-running scenes, ending with Rocky charging up the steps of the Art Museum in the driven snow.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>When I first heard this movie was going to be made, I groaned in agony.  But then a good friend of mine stated, `I think he still has something to say'.  And you know what?  He actually did.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I knew Stallone had talent.  After all, he scribed all the Rocky movies (the first won an Oscar), and directed 2, 3 and 4.  Leaving the fifth to the director of the original.  I can't blame him for wanting to make one more movie (lets hope it's only one more) after the travesty of the fifth movie.  Something was definitely lost in the translation.  This is a beloved character for him and he obviously wanted to set things right.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is most certainly a return to the roots of the original movie and character.  Where a man overcomes all negative odds with heart and belief in himself.  Stallone takes the reigns and makes sure this movie came out the way it should.  An aged Rocky is now suffering the loss of  Adrian, a distant relationship with his son and just getting older.  Everything in his town is changing and even though he seems to be taking it all in stride, there are moments where he is obviously having trouble dealing with it all.<br /><br />When a computer generated `Fantasy Fight' is broadcast on ESPN pitting Rocky (in his prime) against the current champ Mason Dixon, the buzz turns into full blown demand for an actual fight.  The plot is pretty predictable from that point on, the inevitable is going to happen and Rocky ends up in the ring.  But you still find yourself rooting for him with everything you can, even though the guy he's fighting isn't someone you want to hate like the last three movies.<br /><br />After a decade of flopping mediocre movies that he got paid WAAAYYY too much money for (Assassins, The Specialist, Driven) Stallone has been humbled, and seems to be trying to get some dignity back.  He has done that with Rocky Balboa, bringing some class back to an American underdog character that has become an icon of our culture.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>When I first heard about this my reaction was to groan. Having seen ROCKY BALBOA I have to admit my fears weren't justified.  This is a very entertaining film that bring the Rocky saga to a satisfactory conclusion -- far better than ROCKY V 16 years earlier. His son is an adult, Adrian has died and become a therapist to Geico cavemen, and Rocky finds himself drawn into another improbable contest.  Still, the formula still works.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>Stallone returns as a retired boxer given one more change for greatness & glory.<br />This movie is closer to the original cause he's not some star anymore he's in the real world again.<br />His wife has died & he runs a Italian restaurant, bet you couldn't have guessed that one...lol<br />So he given another chance to fight as a warm up fight, but he gives the new champ a run for his money.<br />With his son in his corner Rocky comes out on top again.<br />I rate this Movie a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Rocky has taken some abuse over the years in the ring and out! After the first film the critics seem to think the sequels were formula, but I have always liked the sequels as mindless, but inspiring entertainment! This new and hopefully last installment is very good and is probably the best "Rocky" since the first film, although Rocky 3 is a blast! This film lets the lovable lug go out with style.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>And I mean that in a good way because this was such a fantastic film! I watched it yesterday and it is a worthy sequel to the original Rocky!<br /><br />Sly Stallone gets knocked a lot by people (myself included) but no one is laughing at him now. Like his fictional son said in the film during his fight with Mason Dixon "Everyone thought this was a joke, including myself! But no one is laughing now!"<br /><br />The story, the acting....everything was well done. I only hope this is the end because I would hate to see it ruined by a bad follow-up. This is a fitting end to the Rocky saga and I would highly recommend this film to anyone's collection whether you're a fan or not!</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>"It ain't over `til it's over," the tagline for ROCKY BALBOA proudly proclaims.  The truth of the matter is, as moviegoers realize and even Sylvester Stallone himself freely acknowledges, that it was over four films ago.  Why is it, then, that ROCKY BALBOA packs the most fierce and delightful punch since the original masterpiece?  Why is it that thirty years and five sequels later, we still leap up in our seats, toss our popcorn aside, and cheer for Rocky Balboa?  The answer is one word: heart.  The film has heart, and it has it because ROCKY BALBOA stays true to the heart of the original film, long before the increasingly silly sequels began flying like Balboa's much-acclaimed punches.<br /><br />In ROCKY BALBOA, the titular hero has given up his boxing career (which he actually did at the start of ROCKY V - remember ROCKY V?) and now runs a successful restaurant in the slums of Philadelphia.  His beloved wife Adrian has passed on, and his son has grown up to be an office worker haunted by his father's huge shadow.  His best friend Paulie (the wonderful Burt Young) continues to work in the meat shop.  Meanwhile, back in the ring, ferocious young fighter Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) has taken over as the Heavyweight Champion of the World, and has absolutely no competition, having never been defeated in his career.  When a controversial "fight simulation" between Dixon and Rocky Balboa airs on ESPN, Dixon's publicity-starved managers attempt to set up an exhibition between the current and former Heavyweight Champions of the World.  To the dismay of most of Rocky's friends, he decides to fight Dixon, realizing that it may be the ultimate way to finally accept Adrian's passing.<br /><br />Although this film began building up immense hype immediately after it became known that it was being made, I was positive it would be the weakest of the series after viewing its outrageous trailer.  I don't think I was alone in that prediction, and I'm sure that there are still many people who avoided seeing this film because, well, five ROCKYs was enough.  However, I found that ROCKY BALBOA was my second cinematic surprise in a row (the first being CASINO ROYALE).  The surprise: ROCKY BALBOA is not the simply best ROCKY sequel - it's an excellent film as well.<br /><br />There's a number of reasons for that.  The biggest, as I said before, is heart.  The film's got heart, and the man responsible for it all is Sylvester Stallone.  Stallone is truly a wonder.  At sixty years old, he's in the best shape of his life (the guy is huge), he just cranked out an excellent ROCKY sequel (THE excellent ROCKY sequel), and he's about ready to begin production on the fourth RAMBO movie (a movie I'm highly anticipating).  Stallone's script for the movie is heartfelt and true to the spirit of the original film, and at times it's even quite clever; the ending is beautiful.  Stallone's directing is surprisingly classy, as is the gritty photography.  Longtime ROCKY fans may be pleased to learn that composer Bill Conti returns to the series for the first time since ROCKY III, and though most of the music is reused music from the original film, that's really all this movie needs.  One song in particular stands out.<br /><br />That song is, of course, "Gonna Fly Now", the soaring anthem that has been the ultimate workout tune for thirty years.  It's used in the inevitable "training montage", a sequence that the series has never had a problem with making interesting and enjoyable.  This montage is especially inspirational: we haven't seen one of cinema's most beloved heroes in sixteen years, and suddenly he bursts on to the scene and benches about three-hundred pounds more than I'll ever be able to.  I really felt like I was gonna fly now during that scene, and I know I'm not alone.<br /><br />Does ROCKY BALBOA have its flaws?  Sure.  It has the occasional laughable moment (particularly when Stallone mumbles something about dancing with bears), but for the most part Stallone knows when the film could wind up being hokey or silly or cliched and he avoids that.  The film is actually very funny intentionally, be it from Rocky's constant greeting of "Yo, how you doin'?" or a well-timed parody of the series' earlier entries.<br /><br />In the final round, and this is undoubtedly the final round, ROCKY BALBOA is the sweetest kind of surprise.  It's like seeing an old friend for the first time in years and seeing that he not only is still alive and kicking - or, in this case, punching - but also that he's doing better than ever.  The directing, the acting, the screenwriting, it's all top-notch, and that's all because of heart.  Heart goes a long way, and thanks to the heart of Sylvester Stallone, as well as his woefully-neglected mind, ROCKY BALBOA is a knockout.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>this is the best movie i've viewed so far between 2006 and 2007! Sylvester Stallone has again proved himself to be one of the most talented actors and screenwriters. lot of people treated him as a joke as the old rocky balboa, even called him names, steroid junkie and other things. but even they're partly true, with his continued contribution to the movie culture, rockys and first blood/rambo series, he indeed has brought lot of good memories to our lives. sylvester stallone would always be a spiritual figure to me with respect, no matter what.<br /><br />as to this wonderful movie, every and all the ingredients are so good, screenplay, script, dialog, acting, supporting cast, editing and, furthermore, the subtle feather-like sound track as the background music is also one of the best sound tracks i've experienced so far.<br /><br />a wonderful movie to be treasured time and again.<br /><br />thank you, mr. stallone and to rocky balboa also, a larger-than-life but always down-to-earth true hero, a role model ever better created on the screen by stallone for those young men who really want to do some good for their lives.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Sylvester Stallone makes his way back to the Rocky series to redeem himself after the travesty that was Rocky 5.<br /><br />It's a swan song movie, more touching and slow-moving drama than the rest, but it still packs a punch.<br /><br />The movie starts with Rocky several years after his boxing career has ended. He's living alone as a result of his wife's passing, and he uses his daily hours taking care of the needs of his restaurant, named in honor of his late wife. For Rocky, however, just getting by is not enough, just going through life is not enough. The fire still burns within.<br /><br />He slowly lets the news leak out to his son and Paulie that he'd like to fight again. Neither seems to receptive. Hell, even the Boxing Commission is against it. But then a computer generated fight in which Rocky KOs the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (played by real boxer Antonio Tarver), gets the wheels in motion for Rocky 5 (take two).<br /><br />It's a joke of a fight, nobody expects Rocky to have a chance. Everyone is counting him out, even his family. Rocky still believes, and he proves his point, and his life's motto, by telling his son that life is not about how hard one can hit; but, instead, it's about how hard one can be hit, and keep moving forward.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is a bit slow, building up the drama and tension. Eventually, however, the training montage takes place, and the actual fight ensues.<br /><br />It ends exactly as the Rocky series should end: in the ring, with power, with dignity, and with a ton of body shots.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Cue the music! Rocky Balboa, the most beloved onscreen character and highly anticipated sequel of the the year, is back!<br /><br />Written and directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone in the role that made him a movie star, Rocky Balboa, like the title character, triumphs. This film could end up being the surprise hit of the year.<br /><br />16 years have passed since the last Rocky movie, part 5 that is, Rocky is now a widow; Adrian has been dead for nearly 3 years (Talia Shire appears only in flashbacks). It's a walk down memory lane in the first third of the film as Rocky visits the places he and Adrian met and went to in their early days accompanied by Paulie who dreads the annual ritual because it reminds him of how bad he was to his sister. When he's not touring the sites, Rocky is sitting at Adrian's grave pondering what's left of his own life.<br /><br />Rocky has closed the doors of Mickey's gym, and is now the owner of a local restaurant named after his late wife. Rocky goes around the restarant every now and then, telling customers stories of his glory days. One of his regular patrons is Spider Rico, the guy he fought and defeated in the opening minutes of the original Rocky. Another old face in the neighborhood Rocky bumps into is 'little' Marie, the girl who once told him "Screw you, Creepo" after walking her home and giving her advice on how to live her life. She ends up being a pivotal character in Rocky's post-Adrian life. She even reminds him of Adrian with her encouragement, and support. However, their relationship does not evolve into romance, which is quite understandable.<br /><br />Rocky is in pain. He's old and lonely. He regains the passion to fight again to unleash the 'beast' that is still inside of him. His son, played by Milo Ventimiglia, is striving to find his place in the corporate world but can't escape dad's shadow; and as a result despises his father's decision to return to the ring. Things get heated up when ESPN airs a computer generated fight between the new champ Mason The Line Dixon, played by real life boxr Antonio Tarver, who is disregarded by the boxing community as a phony, and Rocky. Computer says that Rocky would win by knockout. This causes a stir with the press and fans, and gives both Dixon and Rocky the chance to prove their worthiness.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa succeeds in exploring Rocky's inner feelings at his old age. The scene where Rocky expresses that he still has 'stuff in the basement' to Paulie is extremely convincing, especially when the grieving Rocky breaks down in tears. There's also the scene where Rocky angrily refutes the Boxing Commission's refusal to renew his boxing license, a scene so intense, many members in the audience cheered. It's a powerful performance by Sly that will leave audiences wondering why this man has never had the chance to evolve properly as a character actor. Oscar, anyone?<br /><br />The climactic fight scene at the end is incredible. Even the commentator in the movie says he can't believe he is only moments away from watching Rocky fight again. That's exactly the same feeling I had. When the fight did begin, I was literally on the edge of my seat. Stallone's directing is so precise that Rocky's final round, both in the ring and on the movie screens, goes down in style.<br /><br />Would I pay to watch it again?<br /><br />Yo, absolutely!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>Rocky Balboa is pretty much what you'd expect. Rocky's retired from boxing and running a little Italian restaurant where he gives fellow former boxers free meals and entertains the customers with stories from his days as the champ. But Adrian's dead, and Rocky's living in the past, and their son is tired of living in his famous father's shadow.<br /><br />The current champ, Mason Dixon, is suffering from a bad reputation. He's had nothing but knockouts, so boxing fans are complaining that he's only taking easy fights and that he's not a "real" champ.<br /><br />A computer simulation fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon that shows Rocky winning brings everything to a head. Rocky wants one last fight, and Mason Dixon's promoters want an exhibition match between the two to shore up Mason Dixon's reputation.<br /><br />There are a lot of flashbacks, of course, and the training scenes are similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOGI">Rocky IV</a>, contrasting Rocky's working-man methods with Mason Dixon's high-tech. And we get the raw eggs and beef carcasses, too, just because.<br /><br />And there's a new girlfriend for Rocky, to add a little hope for the future for him, since this really has got to be his last fight.<br /><br />It's not nearly as good as the first movie, of course, but it's a much better end to the series than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOGS">Rocky V</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure what to expect with the news that a new Rocky movie was in the works.  I thought to myself "Well, maybe this is just TOO much and the series should have stayed in the past where it belongs".  BUT, I was wrong.<br /><br />This movie really surprised me with the amount of emotional scenes.  More emotion than the older Rocky films, which is amazing.  This is what REALLY made the movie shine in a light that made the entire thing worth watching over and over.<br /><br />The emotions obviously lead up to one heck of a fantastic boxing match at the end.  Who wins the fight?  Doesn't matter, and you'll see why at the end.  What a great way to end an interesting series, that's all I'll say about the ending.<br /><br />Another thing that surprised me was the way the entire movie had a creepy, quiet tone that pretty much stayed like that until the training for the main boxing match at the end.  That tone really helped keep my interest in the storyline, so a job WELL done.<br /><br />Another cool thing is how the storyline leads you believe Rocky is too old to ever fight again, and then you see a completely different person when the time comes for Rocky to fight.  Awesome.<br /><br />You must see Rocky Balboa to watch how to properly tell an interesting and emotional story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>When I first heard about a new Rocky movie, like everyone else, I thought it was a bad idea. Make that a terrible idea. Forget his age, didn't anyone remember "Rocky V"? It wasn't popular. The "Rocky" franchise was dead after that film. Even though it wasn't an awful film, it wasn't good either. So, when Stallone made his big announcement of the new one, I greeted it with the same enthusiasm as any Stallone film. I just wasn't interested. After a lot of positive reviews for the new one, "Rocky Balboa," I decided see it.<br /><br />"Rocky Balboa" works and its a terrific film. Stallone wrote and directed it, and he does a great job. And not just with the fighting scenes. Believe it or not, the whole training and boxing scenes take up a small part of the film. The whole first half is just Rocky being Rocky. He visits Adrian's grave and the places where they used to spend time together. The film makes excellent use of the Philadelphia locations. From the little run down corner bars, the burned out houses, the city is as much a character in the film as Rocky is. There is a scene where Rocky stands on a street corner talking to someone, and the way he uses the locations is just perfect.<br /><br />I was kind of worried about Milo playing his son. Since he played Jess on "Gilmore Girls," I was worried he would be very Jess like, whining, and all surly and angry. And while his character starts out that way, he grows quite a bit. The relationship between he and his father is handled extremely well. And I especially liked the other relationship between Rocky and little Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a bartender he meets who he had met years before when she was a kid. While not a romance from the start, since he still is not over Adrian, this is one of the strongest parts of the film. Rocky befriends her and her son. Hughes gave a really nice performance in the film. In looking over her filmography, it looks like this is the first major role she has had.<br /><br />But, then there is Stallone. His last few movies have gone direct to video. I hope this changes that. I never expected to think he had this film in him. At 105 minutes, this is one of the shortest films this year. Yet, for the first time all year, I wish it was half an hour longer! I would have liked to have seen even more training. I think that is one of the strengths of Stallone as a filmmaker. He leaves you wanting more, rather than wearing out his welcome. If you have any desire to see a Rocky movie, this truly is a must see. I'm actually surprised I liked it as much as I did and one of the better films of that year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I was very reluctant to see this movie having suffered through the last two sequels.  I must say that I was surprised by this film which was actually quite good.  The film managed to recapture the feel of the original film with a now "old" Rocky, mourning his wife constantly while trying to mend fences with his son.  He is the owner of a restaurant and lets his old sparring partner Spider Rico eat there for free until Spider decides he needs to earn his keep and voluntarily begins working in the restaurant.<br /><br />Rocky meets up with the troubled young lady who he had walked home in the first movie.  She is now a middle-aged single mom tending bar.  Rocky takes a liking to her teenaged son right away and seems to like her too but Adrian's memories keep getting in the way.<br /><br />Of course what is a Rocky film without a bout?  In this one Antonio Tarver puts in an excellent performance as Mason Dixon, a champion with nobody worthy to fight.  Since there are no valid opponents for him, he cannot get a pay-per-view big money fight going.  His promoter and manager get intrigued by a computerized fight between Dixon and Rocky and feel that if they could talk both fighters into getting into the ring for real, they can have the big money fight they were looking for.<br /><br />The movie does not make any pretensions like some of the other Rocky films.  Rocky's trainer tells Rocky that the only thing that he can do is train himself so that any punch he lands will put a hurting on Dixon and may teach him some humility.<br /><br />The fight in itself is not bad and in the end, Dixon may become a more "polished" fighter with a better reputation because of it.</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>This nostalgic rendering of Rocky in his advancing years is a good ending to the series.  It is neither too fanciful nor too depressing.  Rocky is older and has grown in wisdom through the years.  This film does not try to recapture Rocky's youth.  It is a good film for aging baby boomers.  It is a must see for Rocky fans.  It is a little slow and sentimental for those who are not already Rocky fans.  If you like Rocky, watch the film.  If you are not a Rocky fan let it pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>I didn't expect much out of this move. Rocky V was hard to stomach, well, actually anything after rocky II was not easy.  But Stallone put together a decent movie here. I admit, it moved slowly at first, and I did get kinda sick of all the reminicing and wanted more boxing, but hey, it did deliver in the end, and it true rocky style.  Talia Shire, Adrian, was not in this movie, but much of the movie revolved around her spirit.  I wonder if after rocky V she said she'd rather be dead than be in another rocky movie.  Well, now she probably wants her publisist dead for not getting her into it.  Oh well, the movie is decent, good action, and good message. And his son Robert, all grown up, but how do he escape the shadow of a champ...learn to become one yourself. Good movie entertainment, Rocky fans enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Sylvester Stallone is back for the 6th time as Rocky Balboa. Yes he's old which had many people including myself making fun of the fact that he was doing another. Yet Stallone manages to pull it off anyway. It's about him trying to prove that he's a somebody yet again. Since spectators try to say he was over-rated and that a famous boxer of today would destroy him. A computer fight shows that Rocky would win but not many people actually agree with it. The movie isn't all about the fight though. It's about Rocky trying to move on after the death of his beloved wife Adrian and trying to get back into the life of his son. It's also about as smart as the first one.<br /><br />  I always have found myself thinking about the girl he gave advice about not smoking in part 1. She's even back in this one and Rocky is looking out for her once again. The movie could've easily have given us a romance between the two but Stallone's script is smart enough to know that Rocky could probably never get with another woman after Adrian. So they just have a little innocent flirtation thing going on.<br /><br />  The movie is good but I don't think there's even any mention of the fact that he had a serious concussion after his fight in part 4. Which is why he was even retired in the first place since another fight would've risked brain damage. But who cares really since it's nice to see Stallone and Burt Young on screen together one last time anyway. The film wasn't needed that much but still it's a respectful reunion with Stallone giving his best performance in awhile. Rocky doesn't only make a great comeback but so does Stallone since before this he has been making made for dvd movies for a few years now. I think he's going a little too far by making a Rambo 4 though...lol. But who knows, if he could pull off a good Rocky film at his age then maybe he can even pull off a Rambo 4.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 5/08, 8/11<br />Rate: 6<br /><br />5/08: Much better than I anticipated and even exceeded my expectations, I thought Rocky Balboa was going to be the worst Rocky movie in the series, even worse than Rocky V (it's still a painful to think about it). Lo and below, Rocky Balboa is back and charms his way throughout the picture. I've not had so much fun, and I love the whole package. What Sylvester Stallone brought to Rocky Balboa is the old memories and characters. At the same time, he merges his past with the present, showing no hard feelings or bitterness about how things are different and/or changed. He just has a different perspective on them, and interestingly, Rocky Balboa is old school meets new school, just a real nice fresh change for a turn. The editing work is unlike the crap I see nowadays with an interesting back-and-forth of the natural, part of the film and the fight show. I like that. Sylvester Stallone (whose best acting bit is when he gives the speech to his son before he goes back in the restaurant) is phenomenal playing Rocky again, and it's the role that he was born to play. Everybody else is great also. It's too bad not seeing Talia Shire again, but actually her death contributes a great deal to the story and makes Rocky Balboa to work. A real good asset indeed. Another thing I like about the story of Rocky Balboa is how Stallone combines the juvenile mentality of ESPN (you know, the crap about who is the best and the fictional versus thing that dominates the show instead of showing some real sports) and the need for Rocky to come back and actually fight. It makes total sense, and the fight is awesome. The best part...well, there is so many of them in the movie, but the best part is how Rocky Balboa ended. It shows how much we know that Rocky didn't care about the fight result but the actual result of winning the true fight. That display shows what is more important, and Sylvester Stallone does that admirably well. That's why I loved the movie. The feeling that I get out of Rocky Balboa is more jubilant, emotional, and refreshing than I've felt for a long time. I always think of a movie that could be made in sort of "back to the old times again" in a "where are they now?" And Sylvester Stallone does just exactly that. Mike Tyson trashing-talking with the current champion is hilarious, reminding me of the press news conference post-melee where Iron Mike yells at Lennox Lewis, "You scared coward. You ain't a man enough to **** with me." All in all, Rocky Balboa is a great, inspiring feel-good movie that is almost (I'm wincing over that rap song for Mason Dixon's entrance) completely free of anything that's improper and brings back the memories again to the point that I feel like I want to watch the whole series all over again and relive that "Gonna Fly Now" scene atop of the steps in front of the Philadelphia Art Museum (now moved back to below next to the steps). This film deserves a `10'.<br /><br />8/11: I am going to lower my rating of Rocky Balboa from `10' to `6'. To be honest with you, it's just not a very good film. Of course, it is filled with memories, but we can always watch first five pictures to relive them. So, what is the point? It is hard to for me to stomach Robert Balboa, a whelping that needs to be beaten up by Rocky to set his priorities straight. Also, it gets pretty tiresome to see Paulie making the same, usual complaints. If he is going to be like that, why should I bother to care? Then, Rocky goes into several different directions at once, letting the film to have no real clarity what the message intends to be. In short, not much really happens in the film. The most atrocious aspect of it is the camera work. Does the cameraman suffer from a bad case of arthritis? At least the fight at the end is the best part of Rocky Balboa. All in all, time for the Rocky series to die for once and all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYRTQ04LYI55.html">A1CYRTQ04LYI55</a><br/><p>This was the best of the Rocky Sequels, with meaning an emotional strength that compared to the original movie.  The story follows Rocky Balboa as he copes with the loss of his wife, and emerging estrangement with his son.  And of course he is goaded into one more fight...  Somehow they make the premise and the actual fight realistic.  And in the end you're left thinking, "I'm glad they ended it this way, I hope they don't do another"<br /><br />If you want the most fights, see Rocky 3.  The best training sequence?  Rocky 4.  The most disappointing?  Rocky 5.  An appropriate ending to the series?  See this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of the "Rocky" series, and I was very excited to see "Rocky Balboa." I didn't enjoy the film quite as much as I thought I would, but I still recommend it.<br /><br />Here's the basic plot of the film: Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) has been running a small Italian restaurant in south Philadelphia for about ten years. His beloved wife Adrian (Talia Shire, who appears only in flashbacks of the other five "Rocky" movies) died of cancer three years ago. Rocky has been unable to let go of her, and the first 45 minutes of the movie basically outline the tremendous amount of grief he is feeling. In a way, Rocky is also grieving for his son (Milo Ventimiglia). Now a grown man, Rocky Jr. is unhappy with his job and has tried to distance himself from his father.<br /><br />Rocky ultimately decides that he wants to try his hand at boxing again. He manages to acquire a license and plans to concentrate on small local fights. However, the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), becomes rattled after a televised computer matchup between him and Rocky deems Rocky as the winner. Mason invites Rocky to participate in an exhibition match, and Rocky accepts the offer.<br /><br />Rocky's training doesn't go as smoothly as it did before: he's pushing 60 now and has to deal with arthritis, calcium deposits, and a variety of other ailments. As always, though, Rocky perseveres, and he gets a lot of help from his son and from good old Paulie (Burt Young). The film culminates in a Pay-Per-View matchup between Rocky and Mason in Las Vegas, which is as intense and emotional as every other fight we've seen in the series.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for everyone, but I think the result of the fight was entirely appropriate. Once again, Rocky shows us the importance of fighting hard to keep our dreams alive, despite any obstacles that come our way. The film is very reminiscent of the first "Rocky" movie, and I really enjoyed that. There are also many flashbacks from the previous five films, and those old clips were a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />Even though I liked the movie, there were a few things I didn't care for. As I mentioned before, the first 45 minutes of the movie were incredibly depressing. Stallone obviously wanted us to focus on Rocky's character more than just the fighting itself, and I get that, but still...it was too darn depressing! Also, Rocky's friendship with Marie (Geraldine Hughes) was interesting at first because of the way she actually knows Rocky from years back, but I think the movie focused too much on their relationship. Marie did not have to be such a prominent fixture in the film. Finally, I didn't like the way most of the fight was filmed. It looked like we were watching an actual Pay-Per- View fight, which seemed very out of place with the rest of the movie's style. Stallone switched to using "regular" camera angles again at the very end of the fight, but I don't understand why he went with the whole HBO sports film sequence for so long.<br /><br />Overall, I think Rocky fans will really enjoy this movie. It's very bittersweet, but it was nice to have a solid conclusion to the series. (And ANYTHING would have been better than "Rocky V!")</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>It is easy enough to say that "Rocky Balboa" is a much better ending to the cinematic saga of Sylvester Stallone's most famous creation than "Rocky V," because that 1990 was clearly the bottom of the barrel for the franchise.  But "Rocky Balboa," the new "last" Rocky movie is not only a lot better than the last "last" Rocky movie, it does a good job of bringing things full circle and reminding us of why the original 1976 film scored a big upset by winning the Academy Award for Best Picture.<br /><br />Adrian has died and Rocky's son (Milo Ventimiglia) is tired of living in his the shadow of his famous father, who spends his days at his wife's grave and his nights at his bar.  With his old friend Paulie (Burt Young) in tow, Rocky visits all of his haunts from the old days (that is to say, from the first film), and pretty much everything is in ruins.  The exception is "Little" Marie (Geraldine Hughes), the kids who rejected his advice in the original film with the comeback "Screw you, creepo."  She is grown up now and a single mom, and when she denies she ever said anything that rude he assures her that she did, adding a comment about the longevity of great insults.  Rocky takes an interest in Marie and her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III), hoping to fill the voids in his life but never thinking that they are replacing his wife and son.  Then the Fates once again intervene in his life and give Rocky an unlikely match against the unpopular current heavyweight champ, Mason "The Line" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), which means it will be time to cue Bill Conti's famous music, go through another training montage, and have Rocky climb the steps at the Philadelphia Art Museum.<br /><br />However, all of that happens relatively late in the film.  Of course, Stallone wrote and directed the grand finale, and having thought long and hard about his character that is primarily what this film is about.  The fight is a necessary part of the Rocky formula and therefore of this story, but most of the memorable scenes and lines from this film come before Rocky ever steps into the ring.  One of the casualties of the Rocky franchise was the fantastic lesson of the original film that you can be a winner without winning.  That is the sort of thing that Yogi Berra might say (or that Joe Garagiola might say that Yogi said), which is quite apt since Berra's "It ain't over 'till it's over" is the film's tagline.  But such ideas are at the heart of the Rocky mythos and Stallone has not simply returned to them, but found a way to rearticulate them in terms of the life of his character at this age and at the center of his shrinking circle of family and friends.  One of his best moves is that the big fight is meaningful for his opponent as well.<br /><br />Stallone is not only working off of the Rocky mythos but also drawing inspiration from the real world of boxing, explicitly updating the original computer match that had Rocky Marciano beating Muhammad Ali.  There is also the idea of the ex-champ's restaurant, which harkens back at least to Jack Dempsey's place, where he tells stories and poses for photos (Ali makes people pose for shots where you put your fist against his chin like you are landing a hard one on him).  Stallone knows that even those who do not own a George Foreman grill probably know that he was the oldest man to win the heavyweight crown even if they do not remember how old (Foreman was 45 when he won the title, 20 years after losing it to Ali, and would hold it another three years).  So in Stallone's screenplay Mason "The Line" Dixon gets the chance to prove the computer wrong and as soon as that robe comes off in the right before the fight it is clear that even at "50," Rocky is totally chiseled and in a lot better shape than Foreman.  We are also reminded that Stallone knows he is doing when he choreographs a fight.  Included in the deleted scenes is an alternative ending that only reinforces what we already knew: namely that what you see in this movie is the way the saga of Rocky should end (Stallone's commentary track is well worth listening to as he juggles his varying perspectives as writer, director and actor).<br /><br />For me things get a bit too artsy in the fight, where suddenly shots are looking like a cross between "Raging Bull" and "Pulp Fiction," and every since that slow-motion fall and rise ending to "Rocky II" I start to worry when Stallone starts getting too cute.  But whereas previous bouts have been about Rocky finally landing the big blow, this one is definitely all about Rocky being hit.  In case anybody does get the point, the key line in the film echoes in Rocky's mind at the pivotal moment: "But it ain't about how hard you hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward."  We have had ample reason to be cynical and Stallone and his creation for a couple of decades now, but both the creator and his creation evince a lot of the heart that made us care about them in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>Sylvester Stallone returns to star and direct the finale to his Rocky boxing saga.Essentially all of the Rocky films summarized as the evoloution of the life of a boxer,from his prime,ups and downs and to his retired years. Rocky is drawn back into the life of boxing and to come out of retirement in an exibition match between himself and the current champ Mason Dixon.Through the years Rocky has run the gammet.His hard climb from his humble beginings to get into the professional boxing world,his rise to the top and bitter falls.Rocky has always been the underdog,pitted against opponents who seem to shrink him in skill and stature,but with a steel will and drive of a champion he always emerged victorious.Current day, Rocky is back in his old neigborhood living his life.The owner of a resturaunt in tribute to his wife Adrian who died of cancer a few years before,trying to deal with his estranged relationship with his son and not to mention his rough relationship with Paulie.Needless to say,Rocky has allot of untied ends,or as he puts it,"stuff in the basement".Due to a computer simulated match seen on ESPN,Mason Dixon is talked into proposing a match between himself and Balboa to beef up his reputation which has deminished.Rocky gets to thinking on his own he'd like to box again,and with an opportunity such as this,he can't resist.Hard training begins and as Rocky builds himself up for his triumphant return,you can't help be reminess of the good 'ol days.The fight begins and all the way to its final round(and to everyone's surprise)Rocky (who was the pun of everyones jokes) goes the distance and shows all that "heart" will take you all the way.I was pleasently surprised with Stallone's final film and the depicted life of Rocky Balboa.It was a very honest,genuine,down to earth portrayal of the life of a boxer dealing with his struggles.This isn't a fast paced action film,and does move a little slow and perhaps for a few instances,a bit sappy here and there.If you look beyond the obvious,Rocky Balboa delivers an honest performance of one of the greatest fictional comebacks of a professional athlete one will ever see.You have to hand it to Stallone,for a man who is 60 years of age,he was in phenominal shape for this performance.Something I expect that most everyone wishes they could be also.So,with a few friends,do a movie night with all the Rocky films and,"Get ready to rumble" with Rocky one last time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>Although the news of Rocky's return was good for some laughs at first, I have to admit Sylvester Stallone managed to create a dignified finale for his boxing alter ego. Eventhough we have seen the same movie 6 times by now, Rocky Balboa's strength of being the underdog in every fight still works. Too bad part 5 of the Rocky series cannot be erased from everybody's minds forever. Rocky Balboa should have been part 5.(SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Stallone deserves praise for taking the time and effort to see that the ROCKY series ends on a proper note and comes "full circle" instead of having an American Icon fade away in disgrace as would have been the case if we had been left with Rocky 5.<br /><br />In many ways this film is a "mirror" or an "opposite book-end" to Rocky I as we basically see a man who has come full circle in life with the similiar challenges only made different by the passage of time.<br /><br />Unrelated to the movie itself, Stallone also deserves credit for showing that "60 is the new 40" in today's society for people who are dedicated enough to diet and exercise.<br /><br />Not only does he look great for 60 in this film, he looks better than 50% of the population in their 30s.<br /><br />I also see a "need" for this film in todays' American society.<br /><br />In 1976-1977, when the first Rocky came out, America was at a lowpoint in terms of image, self-esteem, respect, etc....<br /><br />Much of this of course is due to one of our worst Presidents ever.... Jimmy Carter.<br /><br />Rocky became a mobilizing icon to remind Americans about dedication, hard work, sacrifice, and "never giving up".<br /><br />Thru the 80s, America refound itself, Reagan ended the Cold War, the Berlin Wall was torn down, etc...<br /><br />In other words, instead of being negative, America made things happen in the world !<br /><br />Now in late 2006, we have a similiar situation.<br /><br />Much of America has grown soft, fat, lazy, happy and stupid as a result<br /><br />of having it too good for too long.<br /><br />People criticize those trying to take action to protect this Country from an impending crisis.<br /><br />(apparently 50% of our society has no knowledge of history or they would clearly see the importance of action TODAY in the Middle East before we get to the point England, France and Germany are facing already today).<br /><br />Getting to the point.... too many Americans today are apathetic, soft and are trying to rationalize "no action" as a way to live their lives in "cushy" ignorance of reality.<br /><br />Perhaps if we are fortunate, the film ROCKY BALBOA can do for us today  what it did for America in 1977................. namely, get people to remember what hard work, sacrfice, duty, standing for principles and "never giving up" really means.<br /><br />Hopefully this current generation can recapture at lease a glimmer of what made the WW2 generation so strong.<br /><br />Only then can we get back on track and remake America great again as opposed to the disentrgrating cesspool of decadence it is becoming now (like a repeat of the Roman Empire 400AD).<br /><br />"Yo, Aint so bad... hit me again"</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>When Rocky Balboa, the sixth installment in the series, was announced, there was almost a unanimous cry of "ugh" from people. Like the Terminator getting a horrible third outing or Alien which had a really lackluster fourth one, the idea that another Rocky was coming out was almost like saying another franchise was getting another unceremonious finale. Imagine people's surprise when it actually didn't suck and it was - gasp - pretty good. It's not an awesome movie though but when you think about what it is and what it could've been, it's quite an achievement.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is having a hard time dealing with the highs of his youth and constant reminders of his current lows. Make matters worse, he has a rather shaky relationship with his son Robert and his wife Adrian has passed away. He's incredibly nostalgic for the old days and he has to realize the old days are over and he's seen as part of it. In the boxing world, current heavyweight champion Mason Dixon is underappreciated and booed since he keeps beating anyone he comes across and there's no heart in his fights. When a "what if" computer simulated fight appears on TV, it gets people curious and Rocky and Dixon seem up for it.<br /><br />But Rocky's old age and a "has-been" aura brought on by critics tries to deter him and while billed as an exhibition match for charity, it becomes an even bigger match for Rocky and for Dixon who wants to be appreciated by actually proving he's a good fighter since so many of his fights were rather easy. With the help of his son, Adrian's brother Paulie and Marie, now all grown up, Rocky steps into the ring and proves he can still pull off the impossible.<br /><br />If there's anything that's bad about the film is that there's a little bit too self-conscious tone to the film where it knows it's an underdog story and meant to be inspirational but it kinds of pushes it. Nearly every line of dialogue Rocky says is some beat-all-obstacles tagline that they'd put on movie posters (the one they probably didn't use for the movie ends up being the cover tagline I bet). And the whole thing just feels like a big downer after all since there's so much hardship Rocky has to deal with, you're almost surprised there wasn't a scene of him jumping off a bridge. Obviously this is meant to reinforce the more inspirational aspect of the film but it feels like the film's a walking Chinese cookie dispenser.<br /><br />Sylvestor Stallone I always saw as being lumped into that "action hero" stigma of guys who look tough and can say one liners but they can't act. In this, he's actually pretty good (though not Oscar-worthy) and if it wasn't for the aforementioned lines he says, it'd be a quite poignant performance. Milo Ventimiglia does an admirable job as his son Robert and Geraldine Hughes is also quite good as Marie who isn't really portrayed as a kind of "Adrian Part 2" but instead just a female friend Rocky can count on for support.<br /><br />The film as a whole is kind of erratic for the most part. The pacing during its initial two-thirds is sketchy with many scenes of Rocky reminiscing and trying not to let things get to him (such as a humorous scene where a young punk girl goes after him cause he didn't buy them beer). It takes a good hour before the fight is actually officially announced and then we go into the training montage, complete with the infamous music and the museum step run although amusingly, it has a dog in it. But the big star is the fight which is a big knockdown drag-out fight between Rocky and Dixon and, shot in HBO-like format rather than the "in the ring" approach Raging Bull had, it's still quite a rousing scene.<br /><br />I got a huge truth to spill: I never saw the original. I've seen snippets of scenes and I have seen IV but let's face it: I was 10 and I forgot most of it. So I can't really comment if this is the best Rocky since the original or a pale comparison. What it is though is a pretty good film and not the embarassment people thought it'd be, including me. Now, let's see if the Rambo sequel is the same thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>The final chapter of the "Rocky" saga, "Rocky Balboa", will be available to own March 20th.

But I saw this in the theatres and it blew me away. I saw it twice, as a matter of fact. Simply, Stallone's best movie in years, probably his best movie since Cliffhanger that just had this universal appeal. Why is Stallone able to do anything he wants, from Demolition Man, Rambo and even Stop or My Mom Will Shoot? His success with Rocky. This last installment in the up and down Rocky series sees Stallone returning Rocky to his origins as gothic, yes, gothic and a bum. It was the best entry in the Rocky series since the first one, probably better than Rocky 2. Adrian dies and Stallone fights real life champ Mason Dixon. A has been, Rocky against someone at the top of his game whose own popularity and credible legacy are in doubt. Stallone forray as the "man/actor of the 90s" is going here to the millenium man. Every Stallone movie will be big and make millions, routine box office triumphs for Stallone who can still wow the ladies at like age 55 or whatever he is. I'll give away a spoiler so don't read further unless you want it really bad (ROCKY GOES THE DISTANCE YET AGAIN AND GETS A SPLIT DECISION!!! IT WOULD'VE BEEN TOO PREDICTABLE IF HE WON!!!)</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>In this day and age of "equal rights" for all orientations, it is highly refreshing to see such an old-fashioned macho man like Rocky Balboa.  I am quite a fan of Mr. Stallone and his Rocky series, and found Adrian (his wife) to be a strong feminist-type presence.  It is no secret that she is no longer with us, and I worried my well-fed rear off that her absence would hurt the movie.  Not so, as Mr. Stallone handles her passing with great sensitivity - never letting the audience forget how much that tigress meant to him.<br /><br />As a confirmed neo-feminist, I find it perfectly acceptable to desire a strong ol' guy while also maintaining my own identity. The reason, I think, that so many people ended up wanting to see this movie is because in these overly sensitive "politically correct" times, there is a strong appeal in seeing such a straight-ahead tough guy who knows what he wants and how he plans to get it without ever compromising who he is nor conceding to the societal pressures that force so many to sell out their own personal integrity.<br /><br />I was a little iffy regarding the character of Marie.  While I applaud Stallone for resisting temptations to fire up a romance between he and Marie, I also felt he was a little too fatherly in his attempts to control her life.  Bravo to her for telling him that he was offering too much, but boo to her for ending up accepting such help.  Not really a part of the neo-femme credo.  Her son Steps was also a little ineffective and wasn't seen learning many lessons in masculinity from Rocky.<br /><br />Back to the subject of grieving a lost spouse, while I have never experienced that harsh reality - I have relatively recently split with a male companion (shouldn't the term 'boyfriend' end with the onset of middle age?). I was heartbroken and remain very depressed as I feel lonely (not to mention that my biological clock is about to stop ticking, and no amount of winding is likely to restart it).  Watching this movie, I was reminded of the type of love I have been close to many times yet somehow have managed to miss. Why are some of us so unlucky? Don't I deserve my own Rocky Balboa??<br /><br />Thank you for indulging me in such a personal take on this movie. I dare not spoil anything about the big fight, but for me it was not all that important.  Stallone crafted an excellent character study and by the time the training sequence begins it is almost beside the point. Not a criticism mind you, it is in fact a huge compliment to the first 70 or so minutes of the movie.  Did I cry?  Yes.  Did I wet myself?  Only a little because of the gargantuan soda I drank throughout the movie.  Kudos to Mr. Stallone, God bless him.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Sylvester Stallone seems to have made "Rocky Balboa" as a feature-length apology for every "Rocky" movie after the Oscar-winning original. It strains to be about a character and not the size of Stallone's oiled muscles.<br /><br />"Rocky V" treaded this ground, too, but crumbled under its overwhelming sentimentality. "Rocky Balboa" is a simpler creation, more of a meditation on aging than a boxing flick. I liked it. It's humble and sincere; Stallone seeks to give purpose to life after 50 but has stopped trying to butter up his own image. Rocky's not ending racism or slurring for an end to the Cold War. He's just a "yo" with an itch to box.<br /><br />Because actress Talia Shire refused to return to the franchise, the storyline reveals that Rocky's wife, Adrian, has died from cancer. Rocky mourns weekly at her gravestone. And he's named a restaurant after her. It's a cozy place where Rocky can tell stories and nurse wounds. Somewhat estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia), Rocky spends hours haunting South Philadelphia with Paulie (Burt Young).<br /><br />His routine changes when he runs into neighborhood girl Marie (Geraldine Hughes). Marie's a bit of a love interest, but more an opportunity for Rocky to reconnect with the outer world. Once he does, he senses a "beast" inside. It says, "Box."<br /><br />And he'll get his shot in an exhibition against the heavyweight champion. Stallone makes this ridiculous scenario borderline plausible - just look at the state of boxing, and you have to admit it might happen - by integrating ESPN and HBO TV personalities into the screenplay.<br /><br />The fight itself - against Mason "The Line" Dixon - is a schizophrenic mix of a HBO broadcast and "Raging Bull" choreography. But the rest of "Rocky Balboa" is crafted with restraint. Gone are the endless matching shots and music video editing from Stallone's earlier efforts. This is a decent and measured close to a series that deserved a little better</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Here's an incontrovertible:  There is no state boxing commission in existence that would grant a boxing license to a sixty-year-old.  And there is no heavyweight champ--no matter how lousy his reputation is--that would agree to get into the ring with a fighter of six decades, exhibition or no exhibition.  Sorry, but I just couldn't get past the obvious before suspending my disbelief while watching ROCKY BALBOA, the final (we think) installment of the dearly beloved Rocky franchise.<br /><br />(Had this fight been sanctioned in some foreign country that wouldn't object to the massive risk involved--say the Philippines, or one of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula--the plot would have been more believable, but I digress.)<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone returns in the role he was born to play, only now he's sixty, a lonely widower, and has a son (Milo Ventimiglia) who resents living under his father's famous shadow.  Rocky, while pining away at his wife's grave, realizes he still has a burning rage inside him that must be exorcised--and only a boxing match will do the trick.  Because the video games (or whatever they're called these days) have him actually beating the current reigning champ, Mason Dixon (great fighting name, played by a stoic Antonio Tarner), why not have life imitate. . .recreation?  And the rest is standard Rocky fare, from the training music to the raw eggs.  The fight. . .um, yeah, okay.<br /><br />Sly is Sly, hair color or no hair color, yet this time he is curiously articulate and able to wax philosophical at the drop of a hat.  I kind of liked that.  Burt Young must be tired of playing a drunken idiot.  And the fight. . .um, yeah, okay.  But what raised the reviewing stakes of ROCKY BALBOA in the eyes of this reviewer from two to three stars was the film's ending, which was an impressive tribute to Rocky the movie icon.  After all, this is the last installment of the Rocky franchise. . .isn't it?<br />--D.

But I suppose "all over again" are the key words here.<br /><br />When watching ROCKY BALBOA, you can't help but enjoy it as a guilty pleasure because it reminds you so much of the original ROCKY of 1976, with all of its heart, soul and drama.  But the fact is, is that when it's over, you've only been reminded and taken back to the spirit of the original film "all over again".  If that's all the sixth installment of this franchise has to offer, then you're better off watching the original best picture of 1976 all over again; it was the best film in the series and it always will be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IKOYZVFHO1XP.html">A1IKOYZVFHO1XP</a><br/><p>Over three decades after the theatrical release of the original ROCKY in December 1976,the retired Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone) steps into the ring one last time for old times' sake. He's probably fighting a new,much younger opponent. Instead of Rocky VI,this film was instead entitled ROCKY BALBOA. I'm sure there will be at least one more sequel. Rocky could train and manage a younger boxer. As all of Stallone's fans know,he no longer carries as much energy as he did three decades ago(Stallone is currently 60 years old). Since the original ROCKY,Stallone's fans loved him in other memorable favorites like OSCAR,TANGO & CASH,RHINESTONE,NIGHTHAWKS,OVER THE TOP,the RAMBO series,his several-second cameo in STAYING ALIVE which he directed(during the opening credits),and of course the five ROCKY sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>This movie was not all I thought it would be. Honestly I am torn on my opinion. There were things about it I liked and things about it I disliked. Here is the lowdown on what I thought and why...<br /><br />What I liked: Stallone is in AWESOME shape and is an inspiration to people young and old. A healthy lifestyle pays off and here is your proof. He still has a great body. He still looks great shirtless even at 60 years old and I respect that a lot. It's not easy to stay in that kind of shape at any age. The acting, Stallone has matured as an actor and is a lot more natural and believable than in other movies. The cinematography was nice and really captured the essence of the first Rocky movie. The HBO PPV fight LOOKED like a real boxing match! The camera angles during the fight looked very authentic. Paulie was great, I loved his line about "People who skate on ice are stupid" (I am not a fan of the cold either) and I think he was a valuable and funny character in this movie. Paulie added some laughs in the somber beginning. The Champ, they picked a real boxer for the part of the rival and I think the authenticity really came through, he's not a bad actor and I hope to see him in other roles in the future. It's nice to see someone who is not just an athlete but has other talents too! He did a very good job of acting like the young, self-absorbed, arrogant champion. To see him interviewed in real life, he seems like a respectful, humble guy. I think this role was a good challange for him. He actually seemed to enjoy playing an ego-inflated star who everyone hates and I think it takes a lot of character for an otherwise nice guy to play such a role.<br /><br />What I disliked: The slow, sappy version of the famous "Rocky" music. I thought the music was a downer and really did not like hearing the formerly upbeat and inspirational theme song slowed down to the pace of a funeral dirge through most of the film! Yeah we get it, we are supposed to feel sad, depressed and it's meant to be nostalgic. It was overkill! The first half hour of the film is dedicated to showing how down in the dumps Rocky is, his wife is dead and he goes to all his old hangouts and there are too many flashbacks. The beginning dragged a lot and I almost fell asleep during the first 30 minutes. The son, a good actor who looked a lot like Stallone but the whole 'living in dad's big shadow' concept was cliche. I didn't like his character at all. I found it hard to believe that a 25-30 year old man would still have such an immature resentment of his dad. I was thinking "Dude, get over it, grow up and give your old man a break!" This attitude would have been more suited to the behavior of a teenager and not a grown man, though I did like Rocky's speech to his son about blaming people and making excuses. Way to go dad, I would have felt the same way if I had such a grumpy, ungrateful kid! I also thought it was unrealistic how the son suddenly was so supportive after being so distant for so long. It was painful to watch such a loving kind hearted dad being brushed off by his whiny, wimpy and disrespectful son! The girl Marie, they could have heated this part up just a little, it was too 'innocent' a relationship. Rocky's wife is dead, he's had a tough time, the guy deserves to hook up with a new lady and prove that he is indeed still the Italian Stallion! I would not have gone so far as a love scene but I found the one kissing scene was too 'vanilla' for my taste. I wasn't feeling any passion there. So, Rocky is not young anymore but he's not dead, geeze! The ending, ok so it was realistic but it was dissapointing, I much preffered the alternate ending on the DVD! I also could have done without the shot of Adrienne's grave, like we already SAW that 3 times during the film, why show it again and end a good movie on a sad note? We know she is gone, I want to see him move on with his life and stop wallowing in the past like he did for half the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the movie but I didn't love it. Halfway through the film I was thinking "PLEASE lets get past the sappy parts and show him training, climbing stairs, drinking raw eggs and punching sides of beef!" I really liked how the other Rocky movies pumped me up and made me want to go work out. This movie did not have the degree of adrenaline that I would have wanted in an action-based Stallone movie.<br /><br />This movie showed a more human Rocky but it was so overdone it came off too sappy and slowed the pace of the film. There was a lot of emotion in the beginning but the end lacked emotion and fell flat. There was a big build up and it lacked a big ending to carry it. I wanted to see the tear-jerking ending where he triumphs over all odds after being beaten to a bloody pulp. The satisfaction simply wasn't there. It was a good ending to a great series but unfortunately I think this movie could have been better.<br /><br />The alternate ending on the DVD was stellar and would have been a much better choice than the original. If they had gone with the alternate ending I'd have given it 4 stars. If they had done that and cut down on the sap and sad music I'd have given it 5 stars. It was WAY better than Rocky 5 but that's not saying much because Rocky 5 was a one star movie as far as I was concerned. I am looking forward to the next Rambo movie and I hope it has a better ending than Rocky Balboa. I might watch this again one day but I think I will skip the ending and watch the alternate one instead!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Rocky Balboa is the final installment of the Rocky films and boy was I disappointed! I just hated this film, Adrian is dead, Rocky is working in an Italian resturant, he is estranged from his son, and he tries to make an ill-fated comeback in the boxing world. This film was praised so much by critcs and fans so I thought, well I've seen all the Rocky films - why not give the last one a try? I remember watching this in the theatre and just dreading every moment. Stallone looks miserable (nice plastic surgery, not!), the writing is absolutely corny and stale and the premise is depressing. I really tried to like this film but I felt something was missing. Stick to the first 5 Rocky films, those are worth every penny.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>This is so depressing. This has to be the last of the Rocky movies...Stallone is just too old to be playing this character after all these years.  The most excitement is him back in the ring for a fight.<br /><br />Stallone needs to move on to other things...Rocky is done!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Rocky Balboa is like your 10 year high school reunion. It may be fun to see some familiar faces for awhile, but then you realize after about a half an hour that your glad you've moved on to new friends and possibilities. I absolutely loved the first four Rocky films, so don't take me for a Rocky hater, I'm far from one. But Rocky Balboa is not a good film. The pacing is slow and boring, the story is way past played out and the final fight scene contains the least amount of actual "fighting" that I have ever seen in a Rocky film. Antonio Tarver is the worst "villain" as he is basically devoid of any emotion in this film. There is no real beef between him and Rocky. On the whole the story line is utterly ridiculous and even though I tried to tell myself that this is just a movie, I still couldn't get past some of the nonsense. For instance, in this "exhibition" match for charity, if one of these men were knocked down twice in one round the fight would have been stopped. No exhibition fight would ever go the distance with it's participants cut and bleeding. So be prepared to suspend your belief in reality for the 1:42 minute running time of this film. It's clear that Stallone was unhappy with the way the series was ended (Rocky V was an utter train wreck), so he has basically come back to finish the series with some class and dignity. The question is...who cares? Some people will I'm sure, but I guess I'm way past the point of caring. Recommended only to hardcore Rocky fanatics.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure what I was watching: an adoring public saying good-bye to ex-champ Rocky Balboa, or Sylvester Stallone in an embarrassing plea for relevance or redemption. In the end, I think it was the latter. The telling clue was in Paulie's speech to Rocky before Rocky entered the ring. Paulie said (and I paraphrase), "tonight get it out of your system once and for all". He was referring to the stuff that Rocky said was in his "basement", the anger that he had in his gut. As Stallone wrote the screenplay, I think he was talking to himself. I wonder what speech he'll give as John Rambo in the upcoming "John Rambo" movie that's filming. (I'll never know, and I won't miss it.)<br /><br />All art must pass the test of credibility and this failed. Rocky, a punch-drunk pugilist morphed into a dime store philosopher. It felt as if Stallone was reaching back for the easy dialogue of the first Rocky film - still a classic IMO. That easy dialogue was written thirty years ago, though, and this time around it didn't come easy. Stallone is a different person, and therefore a different writer. People grow; they change. Yet here he presents us with yet another Rocky film, with a main character desperate *not* to change. (We may as well be speaking of Stallone himself.) A Rocky that wants to get back into the ring, relive his glory days, get whatever he didn't get out of his gut the first time around when he lost a staggering and entirely unbelievable twenty-three fights. A Stallone desperate to...yeah, I've said that already.<br /><br />The vehicle Stallone chooses as Rocky's spark is absurd. ESPN does a "cartoon" simulation of a fight between the current heavyweight champion (Mason "the Line" Dixon, played by Antonion Tarver who is a former light-heavyweight champion and has a few grand delusions of his own), and the simulation predicts that Rocky would win. In the real world, this wouldn't have raised more than an eyebrow. In Stallone's world, in whatever illogical, deranged universe he has placed Rocky in, this grew to an exhibition pay-per-view fight worth millions held in Las Vegas, where nobody goes to lose.<br /><br />An exhibition PPV? Who are they kidding? I understand that this is fiction and that suspension of disbelief is expected, but this is absurd. I'm a boxing, er, fan, I suppose. A reluctant fan in that I don't enjoy the violence but do enjoy the competition. My point? I know the game, and I can state with absolute certainty that an exhibition PPV between a young, strong champion and an aging (50s!) fighter who has shown signs of brain damage in previous films would never be sanctioned. For that matter, no fight between said combatants would be sanctioned anywhere in the U.S.A.<br /><br />I will give the film this: it used a real boxing promoter (Lou diBella, and also showed the production flag for De La Hoya's company, Golden Boy Promotions), real boxing commentators (all from HBO: Max Kellerman, Larry Merchant, and Jim Lampley), a real ring announcer (Michael Buffer - "Let's get ready to rumble!"), a real referee (Joe Cortez), and the weigh-in official was the Nevada State boxing commissioner (Marc Ratner). Mike Tyson even made a punk appearance, showing up at the fight and calling out Dixon. There were others, too, such as the commentators from ESPN (Brian Kenney).<br /><br />I heard that the fight choreography was going to be superb. It wasn't. The punches looked no more real than they ever have, and the beatings that each fighter took were impossibly brutal. In this film, Rocky is over fifty years old. Any referee, *especially* Joe Cortez, would have stopped the fight in the second round when the fifty-year-old contender is knocked down twice and severely wobbled several other times. Rocky still hasn't learned to keep his gloves up so he's quite literally a human punching bag. I wonder if there's a metaphor in that last sentence for Stallone.<br /><br />Let's hope that Stallone is finished with Rocky. I am.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>This movie was best never made in my opinion. There was really no point to it and it really just came off as cheesy and unbelievable.<br /><br />I mean Rocky is older, and although his character comes still quite strong as in any of the other films, everyone around him are just weak and lacking characters. Steps, his son, Paulie even are just standing around with frowns and a frozen stare for most of the film while Rocky still goes on and on about the world being lousy and you have to take your hits and get back up- you know all the same stuff he went on about in the other films before. And now it is just old to hear about.<br /><br />Along with the lack of any real characters to care about besides Rocky, the story itself is just a little too unbelievable in my opinion. He being able to last in the ring with that young and uninteresting boxer I found a little silly and it wasn't played out in any way exciting.<br /><br />The story is boring, the characters are worse- the only thing that helps this movie go to just 'okay' status is Rocky himself. After loving the character for so long through Rocky 1-4 (5 was pretty iffy too for me) you want to see how he turns out regardless. But besides the loveable Rocky character, nothing else is worthwhile to watch. So I say stick with Rocky 1-4, even 5 for it did have its moments, but it's not worth the time to watch this one. I just felt this last movie wasn't worth the time or money making it.<br /><br />3/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>For the love of all things sacred, please do not go and see this one!  It will make you cry with all the passion in your body.  Do not forget how bad Sly's television program and magazine were!  They failed horrendously!  This movie will sink to the bottom of the sea!  I promise you!<br /><br />This is the only movie I know that won an Oscar, yet has nearly as many sequels as the Friday the 13th franchise.  Please just go away, Rocky!<br /><br />That is all!<br /><br />EDIT: 12/6/2006<br />I was just listening to Opie and Anthony, and as expected, the first reviews are starting to come in for this bomb.  As expected, Rocky is showing his age, and expected reactions to this fuddy dudy has been "embarrassment" at best.  I suggest Rocky take his "middle age" magazine, and his "dinosaur" antics in a DeLorean time machine with Marty McFly and Doc, back to 1979, when he was a success. Maybe he'll score with Marty's mom?<br /><br />EDIT 6/4/2007<br />MCW aka MC White responds:<br /><br />Well, well, well, a'int that sweet?!  You finally see the movie that you were "positively reviewing" before you even seen it!  Ain't that sweet?!  Well, I'm glad!  But you forgot one thing.  To "eat" our words, we have to agree with your words.  And agreeable, a'int how I'm feeling just about now.<br /><br />And I'm a big Sports movie enthusiast...by the way!<br /><br />I did also see this movie, finally, on DVD.  And you know what?  I thought it was very "clickish" and hackneyed and stereotypical.  I really did laugh a lot,... at Rocky, throughout the entire movie.  I can't believe he's still trying to paint himself as this "castaway" Philadelphian.  What a joke.  He owns a restaurant, and he wears a sports coat (the same one every night?) and talks to his customers every night, about being this great fighter?<br /><br />If I were a regular in that fictional restaurant, I'd find myself ducking, and getting very interested in my Pasta Primavera, every time I saw that lout walking towards my table, praying that we didn't make eye contact, for fear of 45 minutes of his "dwelling on the past."  Hell, even his brother-in-law let him have it 25 minutes into the film.  And Rocky is probably sustaining his "alcoholic" lifestyle with his money.<br /><br />I did feel his pain, regarding his dead wife.  I can only imagine how his character must have felt.  But what the hell.  Even Basketball players have awesome `cribs' and tight rides.  Why the hell is he driving around in a beat up white van?  Where's his glass house?  Did I miss something.  Did some Nigerian Banker dupe him out of his millions?  Completely unbelievable.  Sorry.  Just stupid and ridiculous!<br /><br />I don't know why, but I don't find myself "feeling" for that type of character that is Rocky, I find myself despising that type of character in films.  And you know what. I specifically remember the reviews for this movie in the San Francisco Chronicle being very similar to what I'm saying here.  Clich&eacute;d and silly.  And stupid.  I also remember Opie and Anthony lambasting the movie, and calling it weak on the radio.  I remember very few positive reviews.  At least this part of the country.<br /><br />I did enjoy the black and white with red blood scenes near the end.  I thought that was pretty clever, and visually appealing.  I did enjoy the fight scenes, though I though it ridiculous to see Rocky in the ring with a young fighter.  Very silly!<br /><br />2 stars out of 5.

Yes, I hereby confess that I actually enjoyed all those Rocky movies with Roman numerals in their titles. I even sort-of liked Rocky V (1990), the one that all the film critics mock.<br /><br />But that's because I'm not a "film critic," you see; I'm a movie enthusiast. Although I'm nominally Roman Catholic, my true religion is that uniquely American art form known as motion pictures. Every Friday night that devotion draws me to the services conducted at the local mission--the Mission Drive-In Theater in San Antonio, that is--where I take communion, comprised of hot-buttered popcorn and a Coca-Cola slushy. In the lobby, posing proudly amid my pantheon of movie gods--right there with blown-up images of heroes portrayed by John Wayne, Charlton Heston, Robert Mitchum, Burt Lancaster, and Gregory Peck--stands Sylvester Stallone's enduring creation: the quintessential American underdog, Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />For more than thirty years, Stallone has never been given his proper due as a screenwriter. Recently, for the first time in over a decade, I watched a DVD of his original, low-budget sleeper, Rocky (1976). I was struck all over again by the masterpiece of understated, eloquent drama that Stallone and director John G. Avildsen had put up on the screen. The tale of the small-time pugilist and loan shark's enforcer with the soft spot in his heart, who gets his miracle shot at the heavyweight boxing championship on America's Bicentennial, Rocky became the unlikely winner of the 1976 Academy Award for Best Picture--and an instant classic.<br /><br />To a great extent, Rocky worked so well because of its indelibly memorable supporting cast. There was Talia Shire as Adrian, the painfully shy pet shop cashier and the object of Rocky's affections. There was legendary character actor Burgess Meredith in the role of his lifetime as Mickey, Rocky's elderly, cantankerous trainer, whose fatherly devotion inspired the lowly club fighter to believe in himself. There was Burt Young as drunken leech Paulie, Adrian's bullying brother. Here were people taken from Stallone's own tough childhood in South Philly, made even more real through brutally honest dialogue and poignant situations. But no matter how lowly or bad, they and all the other characters in the film--even the loan shark (played by Joe Spinell)--got caught up in Rocky's quest and ultimately redeemed themselves. Their lines and gestures were so simply, beautifully, economically imparted that, at times, they seemed to rise to poetry.<br /><br />In one scene, Rocky visits the boxing gymnasium to ask Mickey why he's been running him down for so many years. Mickey snorts back at his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, "Ya don't wanna know!" When Rocky presses him, the old man unleashes all the fury he can still muster:<br /><br />"Okay, I'm gonna tell ya! You had the talent to become a good fighter, but instead of that, you become a leg-breaker to some cheap, second-rate loan shark!"<br /><br />"It's a living," Rocky mumbles.<br /><br />"It's a waste of life!" Mickey roars back.<br /><br />Along with other memorable scenes, that one--with the pain and anguish on Burgess Meredith's face revealing his heartbreak over the younger boxer's unfulfilled promise--could easily have been scripted by such dramatic luminaries as Budd Shulberg, Paddy Chayefsky, or Rod Serling.<br /><br />The film has left its enduring stamp on the culture. The steep flight of steps that rises up to the Philadelphia Museum of Art has become one of the most-visited attractions in the city. There, tourists re-create Rocky's ascent during his famous training scene, pumping their own fists in imitation upon reaching the summit. These rituals are a testament to an iconic character that millions worldwide regard as the embodiment of their highest aspirations and deepest dreams. Rocky Balboa reminds them that within them lives the power to make their own dreams real--if they only put as much heart into pursuing their goals as he did when he stepped into the ring against Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), giving everything he had and more.<br /><br />Sadly, the Rocky series is generally held in low critical esteem, largely because of subsequent inferior installments. Although Rocky II (1979) was an excellent sequel (after losing a split decision in the first movie, Rocky finally won the title from Creed in the second), the following two films (1982 and 1985) pitted Rocky against flamboyant, cartoonishly indomitable opponents (played by the scowling Mr. T and the stone-silent Dolph Lundgren, respectively). Fun stuff, but nothing to rival the first two. The fifth film (1990) was a complete letdown, a tired, anticlimactic outing about Rocky Balboa in retirement, down on his luck and dealing with the challenges of fatherhood.<br /><br />Sixteen years after that fizzle, were you expecting yet another Rocky? I certainly wasn't. But happily, Stallone has returned to first principles. Avoiding the predictable Roman numeral "VI" and simply using the lead character's name as its title, Rocky Balboa focuses once again on the essence of its protagonist, regarding him as a man first, and a boxer second.<br /><br />The movie takes its place with several other film series that recently have gone back to basics and started to take their heroes seriously: Batman Begins (2005), last year's Superman Returns, and the new film of Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, Casino Royale. Unlike those blockbusters, though, this picture doesn't try to recapture its early magic by casting a younger man in the hero's role: instead, it audaciously asks the viewer to take seriously the prospect of a man pushing sixty, yet becoming a contender for the heavyweight championship of the world.<br /><br />It opens with Rocky visiting the grave of his dead wife Adrian (Talia Shire once again, in flashbacks). She died of "woman cancer," as the Rock describes it. Every year on their anniversary, he takes a sentimental journey through the old neighborhood, visiting landmarks from their first meeting and dates, dragging the insufferable Paulie in tow. As he reminisces, you see that her absence has broken his heart. Yet Adrian remains omnipresent throughout the movie, as the spirit that moves him on.<br /><br />Visiting an old watering hole, he runs across a girl from the neighborhood, Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a single mom trying to raise a teenaged son and make ends meet by tending bar. A comely lass with the map of Ireland twinkling in her eyes, she and Rocky clumsily, tentatively, spark a relationship. Rocky meanwhile becomes a mentor to her son (James Francis Kelly III), keeping him on the straight-and-narrow.<br /><br />Otherwise, the former champ leads a predictable, comfortable life running an Italian restaurant, greeting and regaling patrons with old stories of past bouts and glories. His whiny twentysomething son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia), complains about living in Rocky's shadow while he tries to make it in the business world. Rocky gives him the kind of speech fathers stopped giving their boys a couple generations ago, but should resume giving:<br /><br />The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows! It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!"<br /><br />He schools his son to have some pride in himself. "I stopped thinking about what other people thought a long time ago. . . . The only respect that matters in this world is self-respect."<br /><br />One night on ESPN, a panel of sportscasters debate who was the greater boxer--current heavyweight champion Mason "The Line" Dixon (played by real-life light-heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver, stepping up in class), or the former two-time champion, Rocky. In an on-air computerized video simulation, Rocky KOs Dixon. This wounds the champ's pride: he's gotten to the top by defeating a bunch of has-beens and fall guys, never facing a real challenger for his championship belt.<br /><br />"All of boxing is hoping for a warrior who can thrill us with his passion," a ringside announcer carps as Dixon defeats another chump. Desperate for respect, his handlers pitch the idea of a pay-per-view exhibition fight in Las Vegas between their man and the legend who hasn't been in the fight game for twenty-one years.<br /><br />After a few awkward moments mid-movie, there's The Rest . . . and, well, you can pretty much guess the rest. Our Rocky begins training hard, old-school style. Once again he pounds his fists against bloody slabs of meat in the cooler; he lifts barbells; he does one-arm pushups; he plows through the Philly's snowbound streets and sprints to his rightful place atop those famous Steps. "Gonna fly now!"<br /><br />The film culminates with the inevitable fight between Rocky and Dixon. Since Rocky is too old and stiff to bob and weave, his corner man, Duke (Tony Burton), counsels: "So, every time you hit him, you got to make a dent. . . . So what we'll be calling on is good old-fashioned blunt force trauma. Horsepower. Heavy duty, cast-iron, pile-driving punches that will have to hurt so much it'll rattle his ancestors. Every time you hit him with a shot, it's got to feel like he tried kissing the express train."<br /><br />Cinematographer J. Clark Mathis's camera frames the fight scenes tight, and they come fast and furious, like watching Goya's Segundo de Mayo spring to life. Rocky may be old and weathered, but he's still solid as the hull of a battleship. Composer Bill Conti's martial score, built around his famous trumpet fanfare from the original, got my pulse pounding once more, and before I knew it, it was 1976 all over again, and I was rooting for the Italian Stallion. There was Rocky Balboa standing toe-to-toe with the heavyweight champion of the world and giving him a run for his money.<br /><br />Sixteen years after the debacle of Rocky V, we've got a Rocky movie that believes in itself once again. Though it may not match the first in originality and drama, in heart and soul Rocky Balboa lives up to its tagline: "It ain't over 'til it's over."<br /><br />Sadly, the Rocky franchise is over, at last, but the old warrior is going out on his own terms.<br /><br />Thank you, Sly Stallone, for not throwing in the towel.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I was all set to dislike this film.  I skipped the last Rocky installment, the last one I saw being when he fought the big Russian in Rocky does Glasnost.<br /><br />However, Stallone imbues his aging South Philly boxer with such a sweet nature, weathered by his boxing years and now grieving for his departed Adrian, living a humble life in the old neighborhood, proprietor of a modest but decent family restaurant, obviously still beloved despite the fact that his championship glory days nonetheless inevitably are fading, that I was reminded why a huge audience was captivated by this character o-so-many years ago.<br /><br />And so Stallone hooked me in for one final inspirational saga of an aging champ trying to find meaning for his life, at the same time trying to convey a message of passion and courage to his own son and a young single mother and her son.  Of course it's incredible, but realism was never the attraction of Rocky movies.  It's always been about the inspiration and the yearning.<br /><br />So if you're beyond being touched by a sentimental flick about an iconic American character, give this a pass.  Stallone was wise not to make his opponent a villainous "bad" guy.  And that is indicative of the movie as a whole: Stallone displays maturity in both his story, himself, and his character.  He's aged gracefully, and so has Rocky, and both have their hearts in the right place in this one.  Nicely done.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5VM">Rocky</a> franchise is a part of our American culture now.  The original Rocky film went on to win Best Picture and many believe Stallone who was nominated for Best Actor that year only lost because another great actor, Peter Finch, had died that year after filming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNESU8">Network</a> and the award was given to him posthumously.  Stallone over the years turned out some great performances such as in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BMY2N8">F.I.S.T.</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XALT6">Cop Land</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JZHJ">Nighthawks</a> and we see him return to his roots of great acting in this film.  I would not have been surprised to seem him squeek out a Best Actor nod for this film, but that didn't happen and I think it should have happened.  Regardless, Stallone has proven once again that he can command the screen as actor, writer, and director like few can.  He's no Mel Gibson or Clint Eastwood, but he is, nevertheless, very competent at each task.  He managed a $24 million dollar budget (not bad for a sixth trip to the sequel well), and it earned over $100 million.<br /><br />This latest and perhaps last entry into the Rocky franchise is much better than expected and actually picks up the story in a very believable fashion.  Most sport has-beens typically end up opening a bar or restaurant when their careers are over and tend to tell the same stories over and over again to anyone who will listen.  Rocky is no different here, and like others before him in the boxing industry he feels he has one more good fight in him.  Thus begins a very believable story.<br /><br />In addition, Stallone doesn't forget that Rocky had friends and family who were affected by his boxing life.  Rocky sort of forgets that a bit when he wants Paulie to run around with him and mourn over his losses, forgetting that Paulie had lost a lot himself and he stands in stark contrast to Rocky as he always did and to Paulie's credit, he sees that.  Adding to this, Rocky's son feels he must forever walk in his father's shadow and "you cast a big one" he tells him, but Rocky does appropriately tell him in return," don't blame 'shadows' for not making your own way in the world."<br /><br />This is a thoughtful Rocky that we saw coming in the last Rocky film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000897BC">Rocky V</a>, where he knew he couldn't really fight anymore, but wanted to somehow stay close to the action.  That effort failed when his prot&eacute;g&eacute; in that film abandoned him and the story ended with a street brawl, a place where Rocky has always ruled.  I personally think that that Rocky film failed as his legion of fans hated to see him grow older, but I think it was a clever new direction for Rocky and a logical one and this film follows in that sequel's footsteps; however, we are now more accepting of an aging Rocky as this film opens 30 years after the original did.  Rocky is like your family photoalbum or your old favorite sweatshirt.  He brings up a well of memories that make us feel good, but also saddens us as we realize time has marched on for all of us.  In this film we get to relive similar themes from previous Rocky films that are still important.<br /><br />This film covers similar ground from some previous Rocky films such as the aging fighter who believes he has one more good fight in him and goes the route of an exhibition fight to get it like Apollo Creed did in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOGI">Rocky IV</a> against Drago from Russia.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAO6I">Rocky III</a> dealt with having the "Eye of the Tiger" and overcoming one's fears, both issues the current champion tackles himself.  As already mentioned, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000897BC">Rocky V</a> dealt with what every sports person dreads, retirement.  The interesting thing in this film is how we see so much of the original Rocky film in this last one.  You know it's a swan song here and a beautiful one at that.<br /><br />In the very first Rocky film he isn't concerned with winning as much as still not being looked at as "another bum from the neighborhood" (a quote from the first film).  He doesn't even stay in the ring at the end to hear who won the exhibition fight.  It simply doesn't matter to him.  He already proved long ago that he wasn't a just another bum from the neighborhood; however, in this one he just wants to get out the rage in his heart (over losing Adrian) and that annoying feeling that there is still something left floating in his "basement" (soul) over a life not quite complete yet.  Paulie jokingly responds with, "What?  You don't think you've peaked yet?"  We all laugh with him on that, but understand that even when we've peaked in life, there may still be something burning in us.  Rocky reminds us to not ignore that regardless of our age.<br /><br />In that vein, Stallone smartly wears little makeup to cover his age in this film, even though he still looks very good for 58.  Heck, I wish I looked that good at my current 43.  He does, however, add on some eye makeup to Rocky to clearly show the power behind the beatings he had taken in his career and he does little to shed the extra weight he's put on as we all typically do over time.  Don't get me wrong; I wouldn't want to mess with Stallone one on one no matter what the weight.  He is still in remarkably good condition, but he's obviously aged too.  Age isn't a regret in of itself, but an incomplete or unfulfilled life is.<br /><br />Many are not aware of this, but the original script, to which I have a copy, had Rocky not only losing the fight in the first film, like he did, but also going home with Adrian in a cab.  He rests his head on her shoulder and says "I fought my whole life to be something more than just another bum from the neighborhood and tonight I was.  Boy, I'm tired", and with that Rocky dies in Adrian's arms having fought his heart out, literally.  The producers convinced him that the audience wouldn't accept such a downer ending, so he rewrote it.  Ironically and without giving anything away here, this Rocky ends at a cemetery.  One can't help but feel that as much as we love Rocky and how he so often embodies the common man's struggle to overcome obstacles, we can't stop time.<br /><br />Rocky will live on for generations.  For us older folks, he reminds us of who we once were, wanted to be and might still be and for younger audiences he is an encourager to be all they can be while they can.  In Rocky's words in this final film of the franchise, "Life isn't about how many times you are hit, but how many times you are hit and still keep on moving forward."  In that, Rocky continues to encourage us all.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Rocky Balboa is the final installment in the great Rocky franchise that began thirty years ago with the original film winning the best picture Oscar. The final film goes back to the roots of the series and focuses on Rocky as a person, and as a man, and ignores the flash of Rocky IV and the silliness of Rocky V.<br /><br /> Rocky is older now, and all he has left are memories of his boxing career and memories of Adrian, who died a few years ago. Rocky spends his nights entertaining customers at his Italian restaurant (called "Adrian's") with stories of his boxing glory. On the anniversary of Adrian's death, he tours the location where they first lived, their first date and then visits the grave. A reluctant Pauley goes with Rocky but his son Robert is absent.<br /><br /> Rocky sees a computer simulated fight of himself and current champ Mason Dixon. Rocky wins the computer fight and this gives Rocky the bug to do a little fighting again, to maybe try and get in shape. Meanwhile, Mason Dixon's managers are urging him to fight an exhibition with Rocky in hopes of improving his reputation and to make tons of money.<br /><br /> Rocky Balboa has several strengths and weaknesses. First, Sylvester Stallone is excellent in the movie. He plays Rocky as a man just trying to be good, trying to be a good father, trying to please the people in his world. Out in public, he graciously signs autographs and poses for pictures even though you can tell he's been doing it for years. Paulie is good in the movie and through flashbacks we see Creed, Adrian and Mickey. The final fight is done as an HBO broadcast and the fight is really awesome. It is much more realistic than any of the fights from the previous movies. Also, the Bill Conti score is exceptional. If you are a fan of the series, this will be a great conclusion for you.<br /><br /> Now for the complaints. Some people can nitpick about how he deals with his son and another kid that he befriends, but those subplots didn't bother me. Rocky spends the first hour of the movie moping around his restaurant. Knowing how the movie ends, I would have liked to see a little more of him staying in shape, because he'd have to be in shape to fight they way he does at the end. That being said, the training they do show via a montage is set to "Gonna Fly Now" and is predicable, boring and short. The fight is realistic, but the story told via the fight is pretty bland. Again, minor complaints, but I want you to know this isn't a "perfect" movie.<br /><br /> Rocky Balboa is a good movie, not great, but to a diehard Rocky fan, it could be considered great. It wipes the sour taste of Rocky V out of our mouth and will leave you presently surprised to see that Sylvester Stallone still has it. ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>With the first Rocky film, we are introduced to a decidedly American character.  A true blue collar hero who inspires the quiet majority is certainly a great accomplishment.  Sylvester Stallone merely looks outside at the real world and reflects in his film the squalor and the near-squalor surrounding and pressuring his main character.  We watch as he struggles to be the right man for a woman.  He struggles with his dreams and feelings of inadequacy, and through it all, we connect with him emotionally and we subsequently celebrate his victories.<br /><br />The second film is essentially a director's extension to the first film, and it continues and concludes much more storyline than Stallone probably intended.  Stallone is so complete with the first Rocky movies that the third, fourth, and fifth movies have nowhere believable to begin, and it's painful to watch Stallone brutalize a character that he worked so hard to build.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is interesting to me because it shows how poor and unnecessary the third, fourth, and fifth Rocky films really are.  There's no need for Rocky to overcome the overly racial-ized Clubber Lang in Rocky III, or the Cold War Russian in Rocky IV.  By far the worst of the series, Rocky V nearly obliterates everything human about Rocky Balboa, turning him into a selfish jerk; he's always self-centered, but only in Rocky V does he make that unsympathetic turn into selfishness.<br /><br />But with this final chapter, Stallone has attempted to own the mistakes of his Rocky series as well as finally write a conclusion worthy of the character he created 30 years ago.  Yes, the older Rocky lectures to us in clich&eacute;s and he tells us "something [we] already know," but he does it in a manner that is believable and insightful within the context of the character.  Stallone has rendered a good sense of desperation and pain for his older Rocky.  It's likely Stallone himself is going through these very same feelings as he ages and looks back at some mistakes and missteps in his career as well as the moments of greatness.<br /><br />My uncle is 50 years old and in fantastic shape.  After seeing the film with his kids, he thought the film didn't have enough action and that it was more about thinking and feeling than the Rocky he knows.  His description of the film is accurate, but I'm not sure what else one can expect from Stallone.  Stallone is 60 years old and in great, great shape for his age.  He gives as good a physical display as possible in this final film, and he does not appear broken or apologetic because of his age.  There are few movies out there that actually respect the aging and the elderly.  Stallone has found a way.<br /><br />It's also great to see Rocky continue to learn and not settle on old prejudices.  This struggle may be even more difficult than the physical challenges of the film.  Stallone displays a matured tenderness in a Platonic relationship with a younger woman that I wasn't expecting, and I appreciated the gesture.  Stallone seems to have touched on nearly everything in the Rocky world, tying up loose ends, finishing things.  Rocky Balboa could easily have been the conclusion to a trilogy instead of a disclaimer about what Stallone meant to say.<br /><br />In the end, the film works for me.  Despite being sentimental, I actually believed Stallone's older Rocky, mostly because it's clear that Stallone believes what he's saying and doing in this film.  Better late than never.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>When this film was announced over a year ago, the chuckles and jokes(If I had a nickel for every friggin' time someone said "what, is he gonna fight in a wheelchair?", I'd buy a yacht) began.  After all, the Rocky series was being poked fun at back at #4.  Stallone was obviously well aware of how people would react to the concept of another Rocky film on the surface, and wrote his script accordingly.  The people in the film feel the same way about Rocky as the folks in the real world who laughed the movie off.  It is great screenwriting on Stallone's part and made people and critics think twice about the movie.  This turned out to be a damn good movie, and most folks agree.  The movie is done as if Parts 3, 4, and 5 didn't exist.  You could almost look at it as the true Rocky 3.  There are really no references to the other films, at least none that would make a difference.  It seems as though Stallone wanted to really get back to the roots of the story and get back in touch with the character.  Over the course of the sequels(parts 3 and 4 specifically), he seemed to have lost touch with the character a bit.  As Rocky became more famous and wealthy, he also suddenly spoke more intelligently(he pretty much spoke the way Stallone did in all of his 80s action films), and became a bit more high brow.  Rocky's always been a lovable, generous guy with a big heart, but a little punchy and loopy, and in this film Rocky seems to have his personality back.  On the other hand, you can still assume the events of the sequels happened as well, coz there really is nothing to contradict that they happened.  Here we see Rocky living alone, wandering the neighborhood, wondering what happened to everything he loved.  His wife, Adrian has passed on and he simply can't get over it.  His son sees him more as a bother than anything and only seems to talk to him out of necessity.  Even the folks who all once glorified him as a hero just seem to regard him with little enthusiasm.  He's just a relic in the sports world.  It's all kinda depressing actually, especially a sequence where he drags his brother in-law, Paulie, along with him to revisit locations where he and Adrian used to frequent, while he reminisces about their times together.  He also owns a restaurant and that seems to be the only joy he has.  He does befriend a woman(the girl on the street corner he gives a pep talk to in the original Rocky film) and her son, and they become good friends.  Not romantic, but the potential is there.  When a computer generated fight putting Rocky(in the prime of his career) against the current world champion shows Rocky kicking the champ's butt, opportunity knocks.  The champ(Antonio Tarver, who had to beef up to play a heavyweight fighter) doesn't like the embarrassment.  He also has personal demons of his own.  His managers and the boxing promoters see this as a goldmine opportunity and soon they're knocking on Rocky's door.  Rocky's been bored for so long and has nothing to lose, so he decides to do it.  What the hell, right?  Plus, Rocky sees it as a way to feel like somebody again whether he wins or loses, as long as he goes the distance, does his best, and can prove to everybody that he's not some old fogey that is just gonna get knocked on his butt in the second round.  In a way, it's alot like the first film in that regard, that he really has nothing to lose and is doing it more to prove something to himself rather than everyone else.  The fight is visually probably the best and most realistic of the series with the first few minutes looking as though you're actually watching a Pay Per View bout.  Pretty cool.  How does it turn out?  Watch it!  Stallone definitely scored a knockout with this one.  Very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Wow, this was not what I was expecting!<br /><br />The story was a lot slower than any Rocky film since the first one in the mid '70s, but I'm not complaining. When it was all over, I thought this was probably the best-made Rocky film of them all. I never thought I would describe a Rocky movie as "classy," but this one deserves that adjective. It may be the least entertaining, as far as a lot of action goes, but it is the most classy.<br /><br />I say this mainly for the wonderful, sweet tone to this story: a story of aging boxer who is long past his glory and is still mourning the loss of his wife. (Apparently "Adrian" died some time after the last Rocky film.) His wife's death is haunting him, which makes this a very sad film in the first 45 minutes. However, interspersed in Rocky's reflective period is the still the same upbeat, look-at-the-positive side-of-people attitude. It's obvious Rock still loves people. With that attitude, it's impossible to dislike the man.<br /><br />For those who might be leery about watching yet another Rocky movie filled with over-the- top villains and way overdone ring action, rest easy: you won't see that here. Balboa's training scenes last only a few minutes and the fight doesn't begin until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. Preceding that are melodramatic moments with Rocky's friends, family, and new female friend and her son.....all handled with dignity and class.<br /><br />The cinematography is just beautiful in parts and if you're a student of photography, you'll enjoy viewing this.<br /><br />Sad, nostalgic, yet inspiring and optimistic, I can't recall ever being so impressed with a "Rocky" film. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>The first Rocky film had a heart and a soul that mattered to people a lot more than the fight.  Rocky was a kind man who wanted to get through life, was unhappy about being a collector for a local loan shark, and fell in love with Adrian.  The whole Apollo Creed thing fell into his lap and changed his life forever.<br /><br />The spirit that made the first film a joy faded with each new film while the fighting sequences became the point of the film.  Sort of like they way the gadgets overshadowed Bond in many of the subsequent films after "Goldfinger".  This film is so enjoyable because it has the heart and soul of the first film and the inevitable fight (this time ostensibly an exhibition) is the right send off for the hero.<br /><br />The film opens later in Rocky's life.  He has experienced the one loss he could not bear well.  Yet, he has found the grace to bear up under its tremendous weight.  Paulie is still as miserable as ever, actually even angrier and in not very healthy way.  He lives in a row house just as he did in the first film and has a small restaurant that serves decent food but whose main attraction is for folks to come by and get a picture taken with Rocky and hear the champ tell his old stories for the ten thousandth time and Stallone does just the right touch on making the stories sound that way.<br /><br />We also see him fill some of the emotional gaps in his life in a very touching way.  Since Adrian is ever present in his heart, it is very touching to see him develop a friendship with a woman that is really a friendship and not a prelude to something that could encroach on where Rocky really is emotionally.<br /><br />The most wrenching relationship in the movie is between Rocky and his son.  Yes, sons do have to become their own man and it is incredibly tough to find an independent place to stand when your father was the heavyweight champion of the world and people want to know you to meet your father.  This is a very active force in Rocky's life and leads him in several directions that all make real sense.<br /><br />I also appreciated the way the film actually set up the fight between Rocky and Mason "the Line" Dixon (by the very capable Antonio Tarver) by actually creating sympathy for him by making him unsympathetic.  Yes, a neat trick.  The film doesn't set him as a big villain as previous Rocky films did with Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago.<br /><br />This was a very fine way to end the series and does so on a rather moving high note.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Twenty seven years after his first championship fight, Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa is just living his life as a normal guy.  His wife, Adrian, is dead and he visits her grave regularly.  He hangs out with his brother-in-law, Paulie, and goes to places that remind him of his and Adrian's courtship.  He runs a restaurant, Adrian's, and walks around during dinner reliving the glory days of his fighting years with customers who like the sentimentality of it. And he's struggling to maintain a relationship with his son, whose friends call him "Little Rocky" and who desperately wants to shake off his image as Rocky Balboa's son and make a name for himself.<br /><br />The current undisputed heavyweight champion of the world is a man named Mason Dixon.  Dixon is fast, quick, and youg, but people doubt his talent because he's never really fought anyone who would prove much of a threat.  Since his victories don't seem to be much of a challenge, everyone wonders if Dixon really is worth his salt as a boxer. Then ESPN has the bright idea of staging a computer-simulated a fight between Rocky Balboa at his prime and Mason Dixon right now. This is supposed to mirror a similar fight that was once similated between Rocky Marciano and Muhammed Ali.  In this version, Balboa wins. Angered, Dixon challenges Rocky to an exhibition fight to go 10 rounds and to prove once and for all who really is the greatest.<br /><br />I have to say that in order to like this movie you have to be a fan of the original Rocky franchise. I went with one friend who, like me, was a die hard Rocky fan and another who couldn't care less. Whether or not we liked the original films was reflected in the split decision between who liked and who didn't like Rocky Balboa.  This movie was a tad bit melodramatic, but all the Rocky movies are and if you're a fan you'd know that going into it.  Regardless of whether you like the old films or not, I'd suggest rewatching the original Rocky from 1979 before going to see this movie. It's  not really necessary to see any of the sequels, but there are a lot of flashbacks and clips from the first film and I think seeing it beforehand will help put them into perspective.  Even as a longtime fan of the Rocky series, if I hadn't watched the original within the last week I'm pretty sure there were parts of this one that would have been lost on me.<br /><br />Still, as a whole, I really enjoyed this movie. It focuses a lot on Rocky's efforts to rebuild his life in the aftermath of Adrian's death.  You can tell that since she's been gone he hasn't really known what to do with himself. Going back into the ring with Dixon is his way of exorcising the demon's that have been haunting him since her death. It also allows him to get back his relationship with his son and to finally bury the past so that he can go on with his future. Melodramatic it may be, but I love Rocky and this is a fitting end to the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>"Rocky Balboa" AKA, "Rocky VI" will not be the greatest inspirational sports movie you see. Its grandfather, the original "Rocky" could argue for that spot. In fact, it might own it. However, no one should compare this to the first Rocky. It is a fun, inspiring movie for 2006, and will be a worthy addition to the sports movie pantheon.<br /><br />4.5 stars for this one.<br /><br />"Rocky Balboa" is, itself, the great underdog. Critics see it as another installment in the descending and embarrassing series, or, are calling it the best 'Rocky' sequel. Because of the two extremes Stallone has presented us, from one of the best movies ever to some of the dogs of cinema, expectations are low. With expectations across the board, I saw this and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa, circa 2006, is a retired boxer approaching 60. People in town generally give him respect, and space. He is no longer hounded by the media, and no longer chased by his fans. Philadelphia has moved on. They even took down his statue.<br /><br />Now, he runs a midlevel Italian restaurant, and wanders from table to table telling about the good old days. Customers get a meal and a story, and Rocky gets his mortgage paid.<br /><br />His son begrudges his dad for the big shadow. Imagine being Michael Jordan's kid? Such is what Rocky, Jr. must endure, and he wants to be his man. He pushes his dad away in the process. Rocky's conversation with his son outside the restaurant will be ranked among the great movie speeches, and will be quoted everywhere from church sermons to business books to locker rooms.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Rocky is looking for meaning. Like Willy Loman, he wants the older years of his life to matter, and like Loman, he keeps looking to the past to find that meaning. Regular visits to Adrian's grave, autographs in his restaurant, and walks through his old neighborhood remind him of who he used to be. Who is he now?<br /><br />He feeds a needy old opponent of his, helps a single woman and her son with friendship and jobs. He recognizes that life should be lived on his terms, just as he always has. But what are his terms?<br /><br />When reigning champ Mason Dixon, a mix of rap star arrogance and Mike Tyson dominance, wants to fight, Rocky sees it as similar to the opportunity Apollo Creed gave him decades earlier. He's a fool, naturally. The match "will against skill" is respectful that Rocky's will power is bar none, but he isn't 25.<br /><br />Like the other Rocky movies, good and bad, this is a family film. No profanity, sex, or the usual Hollywood movie gimmicks to kick it into PG-13 or up rating. It's clean, hard-charging, and packed with the message the other movies carried: "All about: pride, reputation, and not being another bum in the neighborhood."<br /><br />The movie needs another 10-15 minutes to wrap up some storylines, and some of the lines are cheesy. Dixon's desire to be tested, Spider's reasons for being out of work, and Rocky's friendship to Steps need clearing up. The movie hangs on, but viewers might be left unsatisfied. Rocky makes one monologue too many about continuing to fight and never be beaten, but not so much that it becomes polemic.<br /><br />I fully recommend "Rocky Balboa."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>I found Rocky Balboa starring Sylvester Stallone to be surprisingly good. It could be possible that I didn't expect much from this movie that sounded so much like a cheap retread of old glory. In fact, like many, I had no intention of seeing it until I was coax into the theater. When I saw it, I was very surprised how good the movie turned out to be and how well Stallone presented this movie. The movie proves to be surprisingly deep, entertaining and well told story. As one previous reviewers stated, it proves to be a worthy "bookend". This is the best Rocky film since the first one came out 30 years ago. Stallone tell this story with certain amount of flair and good taste. It shouldn't surprised anyone by the time that familiar tune come blaring out that movie's format create a situation we all been waiting for. The fight scenes, exciting as it was, provided an end result of well put together movie. Since the story of this movie have been rehashed many times, I won't bother rehashing it again.<br /><br />The DVD of this movie turned out to be pretty good. The images proves to be pristine, the sound was aggressive and clear and extras proves to be entertaining and educational.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone gambled greatly in making this movie. If it fail, he would have probably been heelhaul out of Hollywood. But fully understanding his own limitation as well as his character, Stallone put together a movie that will definitely surprise many who may see this movie for the first time on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>being a big fan of Rocky and subsequently turned off by all the sequels I was a bit skeptical of this one when I first heard it was being made. I even kept putting off watching it even after everyone I know who saw it, said it was good. All right so I finally got to see it and what a great movie. The Bill Conti score is there, the turtles Cuff and Link, Maria from the old neighborhood, Paulie and his irrascible ways. Rocky now runs a restaurant in Philly named Adrian's, whose death he is still mourning, he's lost connection with his son who is trying to escape the shadow of his famous dad. Rocky's future is stuck with his past as his life consists of regaling customers with old fight stories. When he decides that he needs to fight again because "he still has stuff in the basement". The action builds slow as we are brought into the characters lives and we feel so much for these characters the story builds and builds and pulls you in. Well written and acted without all the histronics of the sequels and just the pure heart and soul of the original Rocky. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>In Sylvester Stallone's latest and, potentially greatest, take on his seminal hero Rocky Balboa, the writer/director/actor scores big in the emotional clenches. These are the final moments of a great character so many people have come to know and love.<br /><br />When I heard about the film getting green-lit with Sylvester Stallone in the starring role, I have to own up to some skepticism. I really didn't think Stallone could pull it off. I thought maybe he wouldn't have the chops physically or possibly be too emotionally close to the character and the lucrative franchise it became to take enough risks with the character.<br /><br />Twenty minutes into the film, though, I was convinced that I was in for a comfortable, exciting, and emotional reunion and final meeting with a hero that's been in my life for thirty years. I saw Rocky when it came out. He and Burt Reynolds were the reasons I drove Trans Ams for ten years. Burt had Sally Field back then and jeans looked great on her, so maybe Burt had a little more influence.<br /><br />Rocky's personal life has always been a series of tragedies. He was a bum from nowhere who got a shot in Rocky. He almost lost the woman of his dreams in Rocky II. He lost his trainer, Mickey, who was like a father to him in Rocky III. He lost one of his greatest friends, Apollo Creed, in Rocky IV. And in Rocky V, he lost everything and got kicked to the curb back in his old neighborhood while getting betrayed by a young boxer he was trying to help.<br /><br />And in Rocky Balboa, he's lost Adrian. Knowing the character for as long as I did, I had to wonder what was left. His life appears comfortable, but it's empty. The tour he takes us on during those opening minutes of the film bear this out. His relationship with his son has gone south. More than anything, though, Rocky just doesn't know what to do with himself. When Adrian was alive, he could give up the fighting. He had her. Now he no longer has her and all he has is that restless drive to be inside a ring matched up against an opponent.<br /><br />Stallone pays loving tribute to his character and graciously gives the fans a great story. It's not art. It's not always polished. What you've got here, folks, is myth, the stuff of good dreams. That's been enough for people since they first gathered around campfires to swap stories.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>The entire Rocky series has been a great ride.  All of the Rocky films have been inspirational, entertaining, and of course a little predictable.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is no exception, but this film has the same "rough" edges that made the first Rocky such a hit.<br /><br />Rocky is still back in Philadelphia, but now he owns an Italian restaurant (Adrian's) with Mexican cooks preparing the food.  The restaurant kind of becomes the focal point for a lot of what goes on in the film.  Well, that and Adrian's gravesite.  The scenes at both of these locations work well, and add a lot of realism to Stallone's sixth installment of the series.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone and his films have always inspired me to believe in the impossible; I'm sure many people around the globe think the same.  He has been criticized for riding the success of the Rocky films, but I think the films are great.  I also consider Stallone a man who has lived a full life, giving his all to his work, his family, and himself.  He's made mistakes, but he has always accepted responsibility for his actions and moved on.<br /><br />Stallone had to have doubts about making Rocky Balboa.  But I noticed the people in the theater, especially the generation who grew up watching the Rocky films, seemed to be visiting a cast of old friends as they watched the film progress.<br /><br />The only part of the movie I thought could have been a lot better was the fight sequences between Rocky and Mason "The Line" Dixon (Antonio Tarver).  After all of the amazing boxing matches Rocky has been in, only a match between Rocky and Godzilla would have sufficed a true Rocky fan.<br /><br />The best parts of the film are every single scene with Geraldine Hughes (Marie).  She absolutely steals the show with every move she makes and every word she speaks.  Whether she is telling Rocky about her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III) or giving Rocky a speech about why he should box the current champion (a crazy idea if you ask me), she is so believable that she deserves an academy award for almost single-handedly carrying this film into the Land of Possibility.  Geraldine Hughes is now my favorite actress!<br /><br />Rocky fans will also be happy with Paulie's (Burt Young) return to the big screen.  Age has not made Paulie anymore of an adult, and his dialogue throughout the film reminds us why we all first fell in love with this guy - as creepy as that sounds.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is not as predictable as I thought it was going to be.  It has just enough things going on in the film to keep it interesting, just enough action scenes to get your blood pumping, and just enough romance to make you wonder if Rocky and Marie get married in the never-to-be-made Rocky 7 (Rocky and Marie Balboa).<br /><br />At the end of the movie, the people in the theater broke out in applause.  I think men and women appreciate the hard work Stallone has put into his Rocky films.  I think they were saying goodbye to their old friend - Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />And I think we are all going to miss him!<br /><br />Bye Rocky!  It has been a blast!<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>To put things in perspective, when the original "Rocky" came out, my wife was still three years away from being born.  That's 30 years Stallone has been playing this Rocky Balboa.  I grew up with the first two films on endless TV reruns and saw the later ones in the theater.  My nostalgia-fueled anticipation for tonight's premiere was akin to the thrill I felt for the final "Lord of the Rings" movie, or for "Superman Returns", or even for the misbegotten Chronicles of Narnia movie last year.  Literally I've been waiting decades to see this movie.  "Rocky V" bombed when I was still in high school and I was hoping Rocky would get one last chance to knock out evil boxers with ridiculous ring nicknames.<br /><br />My advice is that you'll need to see this movie in a packed theater, as I did.  I can't imagine it would have the same effect on the small screen when you're alone with a much smaller crowd.  In many ways, the best part of this film was the spontaneous call-and-response from the audience I was with, two storeys beneath 3rd Avenue.  People shouted famous "Rocky" catchphrases at the screen seconds before the famous fanfare started playing.  "I pity the fool!", "I will break you!", "If he dies, he dies!", and, of course, "Mickey!!"<br /><br />Once all the pre-movie nostalgia was out of the way... it was time for more nostalgia.  Wisely or not, Stallone (who wrote and directed) soaked the first half of the script in nostalgia so deep for the first, small-scale "Rocky", that significant screen time was devoted to characters who hadn't appeared since the original's second reel.  I had to explain to my wife who Spider Rico was, and why Rocky needed him in his inner circle by the end of the movie.  Also great to see the return Duke, Apollo Creed's old trainer, although most of Tony Burton's lines appear to have been looped in post-production.<br /><br />The main problem with "Rocky Balboa" early on is Stallone's concept of dialogue.  Just about every character in this movie delivers a loud speech about motivation and glory and drive and passion.  Rocky's defense of his application for a boxing permit to the State athletic commission (after 20 years of retirement) is particularly ludicrous, although Stallone must think it's going to cap off the montage for his Lifetime Achievement Oscar.<br /><br />Once the nostalgia and flashbacks clears out and the plot settles in, the film picks up steam.  Antonio Tarver does a decent job as Mason "The Line" Dixon, the brazen young champ at odds with the boxing establishment.  Dixon never really becomes a villain in this movie -- he even has a Rocky/Mickey relationship with his own trainer.<br /><br />Also welcome are the numerous cable TV personality cameos.  Everyone from ESPN's Brian Kenny to ESPN Classic's Bert Randolph Sugar to the entire HBO fight team (Merchant and Lampley and I, Max) chips in; too bad Jim Rome got left on the cutting room floor.  The only thing missing from the celebrity bandwagon was Randy and Jason Sklar doing "Cheap Seats" commentary over the Rocky vs. Thunderlips celebrity boxing/wrestling match.  Maybe in a deleted scene on DVD?<br /><br />In the end, "Rocky Balboa"'s a fun nostalgia trip that echoes the original in tone and sentiment, and even has a similar bittersweet finale.  This is never going to become a TNT rerun classic like "Rocky III" and probably has no catchphrases of its own, but if Rocky's been one of your movie heroes since the 1970s, check him out one last time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I haven't seen any of the previous Rocky movies, so I watched this through completely innocent eyes. I wasn't sure about it at first, what with not having seen any of the previous five, and I was wondering if it would be one of those films, where you HAVE to have seen the previous films.<br /><br />I was surprised when I found myself not only enjoying the film, but also getting emotionally involved. Sly did the right thing when he got this up and running by NOT making the viewers feel the need to see the previous films. There were only a couple of brief flashbacks, which were necessary, and relevant.<br /><br />The film begins with Rocky, now a hero in Philadelphia and running his own restaurant, letting his old sparring partners eat for free, and telling the locals his old stories. It cuts a pretty sad story, he's a washed up ex boxer, who actually looks like he's been a few too many rounds in the ring. I did get the impression; maybe it was just me, that he's desperate for company. Rocky constantly greeted people with "Hey, how u doin'?" Practically adopted a woman he remembered walking home as a little girl, and her son, and gave them both a job. It comes across as a bit desperate in the character of Rocky. His wife is dead, he's estranged from his only son, who seems to be embarrassed of his old pa, and it's a very lonely life. His son doesn't want anyone to meet his old boxer dad at his work, even though he only got the job because of his surname.<br /><br />Of course, there's a new kid on the block, and they start comparing him to the old Rocky, and who would win in a fight. A computer whiz-kid simulates the fight. Rocky sees this, thinks about it for a nano-second, and starts training again, despite protests from the licensing committee, his son, his friends, and people in the restaurant. Many think he cannot do it, many people say he can't, right to his face, but that just makes Rocky all the more defiant.<br /><br />The training montage is definitely one of the highlights of the movie, along with the terrific song backing it. It shows Rocky trying desperately to get back into shape (and Sly himself too, since he's admitted in interviews, that he let himself slide, and can't do as many things as he could do in the earlier films), from not being able to bench press very much, to a whole lot! Honestly it made my eyes water how much he ended up bench pressing & lifting in weights. Ouch.<br /><br />The final fight scene is of course, what we've all been waiting for throughout the film. It's the climax, and wow, what a climax. I wouldn't have said I would normally go to watch a boxing match - it's more an American thing really, I think? In fact, I hate boxing, but the film captures the electric atmosphere in the stadium, and I found myself getting caught up in the excitement. If there hadn't been people around me, I probably would have started jumping up and down in my seat. Of course, you're just waiting for him to get up, when he gets knocked down, urging him to get up, and obviously, will he win, or won't he? And it's also intercut with very brief flashbacks to previous Rocky matches. Flashbacks were used from every Rocky movie apart from Rocky V, which Sly admits himself is the weakest in the series.<br /><br />I thought it was quite good how they finished it. I was expecting the ending to be clear-cut, but it's not, and it's good that it's not.<br /><br />The one thing that got me watching Rocky Balboa was the fact that no matter how much plastic surgery Jackie Stallone has, Sly is basically turning into her!!! It was scary watching him on screen and seeing Jackie, which I never really noticed in Demolition Man, or his older films. He is turning into his mother.<br /><br />Overall I think this was a good idea (some people do disagree with me) for Sly to revisit Rocky one last time, and just wrap it all up. If I'd seen the previous movies, then it would have been a good way to end it all - if I had, I'd probably have been totally fed up with it all by now! The ending does seem very final, but then that means nothing these days. I have to applaud Sly for returning to the role after 15 years, showing he still has what it takes, showing he still has the body (his shoulders are the width of me lying down no exaggeration!), and showing he can still hack it in the ring. He is 61 this summer after all. It is a good film to go see if you have seen the previous five or even if you haven't. Excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>this film is not without flaw . it gets so much so right though , it's not even about the fight . we all know the ROCKY films have not been RAGING BULL from the get go . the first film was a tremendously uplifting story about the spirit of an individual brawler who never would have prevailed giving and getting such superhuman punishment . if MR. TARVER'S character were to actually box MR. STALLONE'S character , it would last moments . it wouldn't even happen in exhibition . it's a mistake to observe this film as if it were an approximation of CINDERELLA MAN . you forgive the deep dark dye job if you understand that this film is about maturity . between the first film and this picture there were a lot of fun movies that were guilty pleasures more often than not . fun to watch over and over because of their implausibe and rote formula of good verses bad or proud or unfair . this rousing picture serves as a proper bookend to the first great chapter in a character saga . one in which we don't have to see the central character aged by make up but rather actual time itself . STALLONE'S maturity informs an individual so right and real that the only significant flaw is that he manages to go several rounds with the young boxer . by surrounding himself with an outstanding group of actors young and old . by putting so much truth into the lions share of what occurs on screen (in word and deed) . i feel he made the finest ROCKY picture yet . after its' fashion , nearly as satisfying and thrilling as MILLION DOLLAR BABY . great motion picture making . great entertainment . the coda that was needed .</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>I knewI would like the last installment in the Rocky franchise, but Rocky Balboa was even better than expected.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Rocky Balboa is about sixty.  He owns a popular Italian restaurant.  Despite his Philly icon status, he lives a quiet, humble life, driving an old van and keeping a folding chair in a tree by Adrian's grave.  Honoring Adrian, he has never married and has no girlfriend.  Their son, in a corporate job, avoids his awkward attempts at fathering. To top it all off Rocky is facing his last fight, with a much younger opponent.  Why is he doing it?  "There's a beast in me," he sadly tells Paulie.<br /><br />The movie has a great message, is tender, and you root for and relate to the Italian Stallion all the way.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>I have to confess, I could not be more surprised by the quality of this movie. After a very disappointing Rocky V, I decided that I was just going to watch this final film for the sake of completeness, but I expected it to be a bad, or at best a neutral, experience. To my surprise, the end of the saga is really good, with a nicely built story, and a movie which provides the whole journey with an elegant symmetry.<br /><br />Adrian has died, victim to cancer, and Rocky owns a restaurant that is successful only by virtue of the fame of its owner. Patrons visit the establishment looking for a first-hand story, or a picture, or an autograph. Meanwhile, Rocky's son is trying to make it in the corporate world, but is having a tough time dealing with being a celebrity's son. This in turn puts a strain in the relationship with his father that takes a big toll on Rocky. When a computer simulated fight between the current heavyweight champion and the old hero takes place on Sportscenter, with a controversial result, the door opens for the return of the people's champion.<br /><br />I am extremely glad I was wrong about this film, since this provides a classy ending to one of the best collection of sports movies of all time. Stallone delivers a much better performance than I expected after watching him being a guest in Monday Night Football. He has some restrictions in terms of facial expressions, but this does works well with the character, and he provides the needed level of passion and energy. Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Robert Jr., also adds to the quality of this movie, since he is right on target with his performance, portraying the inner conflicts of his character masterfully. The final fight might not be the best we have seen in this series of movies, but it is definitely adequate.<br /><br />Anyone that has been following the Rocky movies needs to watch this final installment. And please, if you were discouraged by the dreadful Rocky V, do not be afraid, this new movie will definitely make it up to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>A fitting finale to the Rocky (aka Rocko) saga.

I, on the other hand, was afraid to believe the hype.  Even after talking myself into renting this, it sat around the house for days because I still couldn't bring myself to believe that this film would actually be good.  But boy am I glad I finally hit the play button.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed Rocky Balboa and it's strange how he feels like an old friend I haven't seen in a while.  I'm impressed with Rocky's wisdom and understand his heartbreak over Adrian.  Afterall, I've known her for thirty years too.  In no time, I'm quite charmed by Rocky's humbleness and inspired by his unconquerable soul.  The script is a bit laid back and not over the top like Rocky 2 thru 4. (I like to pretend that 5 never happened.)  In short, this is a wonderful film about a remarkable character.  You won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>With "Rocky Balboa," Sylvester Stallone brings the "Rocky" film series to its final conclusion. And, like  the title character, the series finishes on top! Stallone, even at the age of 60, still proves he has what it takes. His performance is great, and his writing and directing is nearly perfect! The rest of the cast and crew do a great job with the film. This is a fitting conclusion to a great series of films! If you're a fan of the "Rocky" films, or just love great dramatic films, then "Rocky Balboa" is the movie for you. By the time it ends, it will have you cheering. Count on it!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A3EZHMGGWY74HY.html">A3EZHMGGWY74HY</a><br/><p>I have to admit, I was worried that this could not be done...I thought it couldn't be believable...that Rocky was just too old...but I have to say, I was wrong.

Try this one, even if you have your doubts.  You won't be disappointed.  The only sad thing about the movie was that Adrian was gone, but even that added something special to the nostalgic look back at where Rocky began.</p></br></body></html>

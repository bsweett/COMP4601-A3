It is like a postcard from the edge, full of carnal knowledge, unafraid of Virginia Woolf, avoiding any Catch 22's, and the graduate cum laude of the school of hard knocks. Screenplay and the Play it was based on were both written by Patrick Marber, who also wrote the Screenplay for Notes on a Scandal.<br /><br />It is a tremendous showcase for the acting talent of the four main characters played by Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman. One is a writer, mostly of obituaries--though he does write one book based on a stripper he meets when she is struck by the cab he's riding in. He falls in love with her instantly, but not deep enough to resist falling for the photographer who later shoots his photo for the book jacket. Then, after a session of cybersex where he pretends to be a woman, he inadvertently engineers the meeting of a dermatologist with his photographer lover.<br /><br />Infidelity and the resulting jealousy are the themes of Closer, along with the related themes of truth and identity. For instance, Alice Ayres, the stripper portrayed by Portman, uses the name of Jane while working. The dermatologist, played by Clive Owen, knows her as Alice, and he tries to get her to call herself that, to reach that level of intimacy--though she is performing a fantasy for him.<br /><br />------------<br />Larry: There's a girl out there who calls herself Venus, what's her real name?<br />Alice: Pluto.<br />=======================<br /><br />But what is Alice's real name? Don't assume you know the answer to that question. This scene was of interest to me because I noticed that throughout the director would often use music, but coming from another room, slightly muffled. How Soon is Now? by The Smiths, a veritable anthem of loneliness, is heard here, but they are in a private room, the Paradise Suite, and though the song speaks to the dermatologist's yearning to be closer, it is muted and subdued.<br /><br />There is another scene at the opera that is played out entirely in the corridors, bar, and foyers. You never hear the opera directly, though it is Mozart's Cosi fan tutte, with Rene Fleming, no less. Another subtle comment on the theme of Closer, for the title, Cos&igrave; fan tutte, literally means "Thus do all [women]" often roughly translated as "Women are like that". Mozart and his lyricist Da Ponte took as a theme "fianc&eacute;e swapping" which dates back to the 13th century, with notable earlier versions being those of Boccaccio's Decameron and Shakespeare's play Cymbeline. Elements from the myth of Procris as found in Ovid's Metamorphoses are also present. Furthermore, it incorporates elements of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Thus, it is a fitting soundtrack for this scene in Closer where the obituary writer realizes that the photographer has just cheated on him with her now ex husband, the dermatologist. Yet, you never see the opera directly, and only hear it indirectly.<br /><br />As well as unheard music the director also makes use of unseen scenes. Sometimes you see two people meet, and then suddenly it is a year later. He leaves all the things that happen in a relationship between the times they fall in love and out of love out of it. He cuts to the chase, as it were. Though you might expect a film of this sort to be hard to follow, it is to the credit of the director that this is never the case. No matter how convoluted the intertwining relationships, you always know who is in or out of love, cheating, cheated on, or what have you. At least you know enough to follow the story, given the high level of ambiguity the characters have about their own real feelings.<br /><br />Patrick Marber, the writer, really makes the most of his material. Really fantastic dialogue, or is it the brilliant acting that makes this shine? Both, actually. There is a scene where Jude Law is flirting with Julia Roberts. It is like a championship tennis match. Law serves his best lines and Roberts slams them right back at him. Bam. Bam. Bam. Match point. When did Julia get to be such a great actress? I used to think she just fell back on her Julia Roberts smile a bit too much. All the acting is of the highest calibre, as is the writing and directing.<br /><br />Here is a little sample of the obituary writer describing how they use euphemisms in their line of work:<br /><br />---------<br />Dan: At six, we stand round the computer and look at the next day's page, make final changes, add a few euphemisms for our own amusement.<br />Alice: Such as?<br />Dan: "He was a convivial fellow" - meaning he was an alcoholic. "He valued his privacy" - gay. "He enjoyed his privacy" - raging queen.<br />Alice: What would my euphemism be?<br />Dan: She was... disarming.<br />Alice: That's not a euphemism.<br />Dan: Yes, it is.<br />==============<br /><br />DIRECTED BY MIKE NICHOLS<br /><br />Charlie Wilson's War (2007)  (with Julia Roberts as Joanne Herring)<br />Postcards from the Edge (1990)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K0DP">Carnal Knowledge</a> (1971)<br />Catch-22 (1970)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00079Z9VO">The Graduate</a> (1967)<br />Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Goodbye.<br />===================================</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Been there, done that. Who hasn't? That's why this movie is so watchable. Most of us, if we admit it, can identify with how these characters seek self gratification, hurt others, realize their mistakes, then go right ahead and make them again and again. We call it real life. Which you don't often get in movies. Highly recommended. But hasn't Jude Law played this same character now several times in movies, as well as at least once that we know about in real life with the babysitter?</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>Somehow, I liked "Closer" more than I thought it would.  I say this because people I trust were unimpressed by it.  But I was compelled to watch the Mike Nichols' film for reasons that I can only describe as masochistic - and I'm not a masochist.  The characters are recognizable and reprehensible, pretty much the gang of healthy and privileged idiots you can meet anywhere in the U.S. or U.K., where the bulk of "Closer" takes place.  The story is a human traffic accident, literally in one scene and implied in another.  Though the dialogue is stagy, the actors deliver it with proper angst, which is suitable for a film that is really just barely a play with a few visual tricks thrown in.  (A lot in "Closer" happens offscreen and is told in flashback and expository dialogue, the film's major weakness).  Jude Law, who resembles rather disturbingly John Boy Walton when donning spectacles, plays a hack writer whose chance meeting with a provocateur (Natalie Portman -- kudos to her for being unafraid to reveal her burgeoning cellulite) and later dalliance with a wishy-washy photographer (Julia Roberts) leads to his eventual downfall.  Almost-James Bond (thank goodness) Clive Owen pops in as a dermatologist who isn't quite as thick skulled as he seems.  No one is likable in "Closer," which may be part of the reason I enjoyed it; their folly seems to confirm so many of my own observations about people who are incapable of loving relationships with anyone because they don't know the first things about themselves.  Yet, fortune gives them a steady stream of paramours to damage.  Go figure.  Under Nichols' steady hand, including some verbal and visual cues that subtly forecast events, "Closer" wends its way to a conclusion that is inevitable and would be tragic if the characters were even remotely heroic.  As it stands, they're just like most of the people you meet.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Closer is the perfect romantic drama. I was very hesitant in seeing this film, but I am glad I did. Juila Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman make a great and complete cast together. A lot of dirty talk but no sex scenes are shown, never shows the middle of relationships, just the beginning of when they meet and the end of their relationships. The ending was a surprise, didn't see that one coming. Closer is a beatiful and complicated film for anyone who has ever been in love with more than one person.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>First off, if you don't like movies filled with dialogue and no action stay clear of this one. Most of the film is just four characters talking to each other throughout the 1 hour and 40 minute running time. I thought this kind of film would bore me to tears, but thankfully most of the dialogue was clever and the acting really made this film shine. Jude Law and Julia Roberts were pretty good, but innocent looking Natalie Portman was great in her first mature performance. Clive Owen is what made this movie for me. He is probably best know for his recent film "King Arthur" and will be seen in "Sin City" coming out this Friday. He deserved the Oscar he was nominated for in my opinion (but I'm glad Morgan Freeman finally got one). I like the way he just takes apart Jude Law at the end, reducing him to tears and leaving in defeat. Didn't think I would like this one, but I am happy to say that it is worthy of a rental next time you are in the mood for a relationship/betrayal drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: In reality I would give this film three stars instead of four. The premise is very unreal, very over the top, and just too vivid at times. But it is powerful and has a certain style. What makes this film entertaining are the actors and Mike Nichols. The movie revolves between two couples. At first they love each other then they don't, now they do, now they don't. It jumps around a lot and that shows one major flaw of the movie. At some points the movie jumps huge amounts of time, at one point it was a year. Basically skipping all the build up in the relationship and just showing the intense parts of it. I agree that this was the best way of doing this, but I just felt not involved with the movie since all we are seeing are bullets on a timeline of events. The movie is intense at times and is revealing of a darker more perverse side of human nature, love. The movie explores just how twisted the human heart is as well as the mind. Some of the dialogue is very explicit. And what makes the movie so unique is that Mike Nichols was able to take all this harshness of humanity and turn it into a very delicate film. As you watch the movie, you get a sense that the lives of these people are so fragile even though their emotions, if unleashed, could devour a corpse. I just found it interesting how they were able to craft the film so well.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting in the movie was great and believable. Natalie Portman plays a similar role to Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine, but just a little more fragile. Julie Roberts is the elegant woman, Jude Law the desperate man, and Clive Owen the butcher. I'm a big fan of Clive Owen and I thought he delivered a very chilling performance here. Again, the acting made the movie. Oscar winning director, Mike Nichols, also gave the movie its style. If it weren't for the talent of the actors and the crew I assure you that this movie would be very mediocre.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Entertaining and fun, but not at all thought provoking. You'll be impacted by the intense acting and dialogue, but underneath it there's really nothing there. I was really never intending to see this movie, but when Sideways was sold out this was the second choice. Hopefully I'll get to see it next.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>You have Julia Roberts here as a photographer.  Enter Jude Law (who is involved with Natalie Portman's character)who as he's being photographed and conversating with her forms an intense crush on her and is determined to have her.  His girlfriend (Portman) comes in, senses something is amiss, but cannot do anything about it.  Movie skips ahead (not confusingly) and we find a lot more about each of these characters, including Julia Roberts being together with Clive Owen.  That doesn't stop her from indulging in a relationship with Jude Law the whole time.  The two of them are no match for the ruthless and I mean ruthless vengence Clive Owen takes on them all.  Some of the vengence involves him seeking out Portman and the two of them had the sort of coldness in their personalities that made it work.  Strangely, I didn't feel sorry for any of these people at the end, personally I found each of them (even Roberts) to be resigned to their choices.  Incredibly selfish , beautiful people who screw with each others minds and rationalize it to fit their purposes.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Okay, let's get something straight right away.  If you cheat on your partner, you do NOT tell.  In fact, if you are asked about who you slept with in the past, you do not tell.  Even in junior high school you learned, you do not kiss and tell.<br /><br />Cheating is the big lie.  This movie is about cheating and lying.  People cheat.  They get tempted.  They want excitement.  People are animals.  But it is worse than adding insult to injury if you cheat and tell.  Don't cheat.  But if you do, don't tell.<br /><br />This is a clever--although I wouldn't call it slick--film about how attractive people of a certain age and milieu are always hitting on and being hit upon.  It is about the shallowness of love and the urgency of sex.  It is about pretty people on the screen fulfilling fantasies.  The dialogue is hip, sharp, although sometimes too cute and superficial.<br /><br />It is stylish and ephemeral.  It has the facade of realism.  Note that none of the characters have children and none of them are trying to save the world.  They are sexual and emotional hedonists, and maybe they are saying something about our times, in the big cities of the Western world at the dawn of the new millennium. On the other hand, they are urban professionals, skillfully navigating their way through the urban jungle toward a life of fulfillment and meaning...  Well, maybe not.<br /><br />But the emotions that the characters experience are very real.  When you love someone and that someone sleeps with your rival, it is very painful.  And when you love someone and you find that that someone doesn't love you, it is very painful.  But the psychological pain that is visited upon us at such times is also ephemeral and will pass.<br /><br />If you live on a farm in the middle of Nebraska, Jude Law is not going to kiss you and tempt you into cheating on your husband even if you are as pretty as Julia Roberts.  If you really are a plain Jane without style or looks, Clive Owen is going to pass you by as you sit in the aquarium.  He'll study the fish.  So this is really about Hollywood itself (although set in London) and the usual musical beds.  This is TV's "Friends" in the raw.  This is Mike Nichols updating Carnal Knowledge, his very sixties-ish quadrangle film released in 1971 starring Jack Nicholson, Art Garfunkel, Ann-Margret and Candice Bergen.  As in Carnal Knowledge--and, by the way, in Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being (made into a film starring Juliette Binoche)--there are four attractive, sexually active people who can't keep their hands off of one another.  If you liked triangles, you randy geometricians, you'll really love quads, seems to be the thinking here.<br /><br />Well, I did kind of like this film.  What's not to like about Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen?  They are attractive and they are talented.  The script from Patrick Marber adapting his play of the same name (with some very real influence from Milan Kundera's novel: note that in both cases there is a doctor and one of the women is in the sexual professions and the other is either a photographer or a painter) is witty and, yes, sexy.  The direction by Mike Nichols (now in his seventies) is a little uneven and sometimes cryptic, especially as regards the ending and the beginning.  (Never mind.  I would like to discuss the ending, but, alas, that might spoil the film for somebody.  As for the "Boy Meets Girl, Cute" beginning...well, it was VERY familiar.)  But the film is crisply edited and there are no dead spots.  You will be entertained, even if you later feel that you got seduced yourself and feel like you just ate a whole box of sugary bon-bons.<br /><br />Irony: while Natalie Portman plays the lower-class stripper, in real life she is (or was) working toward a medical degree at Harvard.<br /><br />And yes, Alice always lies and Larry always tells the truth...well, almost.  Alice's character is very complex, but not entirely realized in the film.  We are too much distracted by the sexcapades and the other personalities to see her as clearly as we might.  Portman does a good job in a challenging role.  There is something almost pathological about Alice that Portman conveys with modulated swings in mood and expression.  Larry, the doc, is, as he tells us, the caveman, while Dan is the emotional pretty boy.  And Anna...well, Anna is smart and has a deeper appreciation than the other characters of who she is and what she wants.  And she does manage to get what she wants.<br /><br />See this for Mike Nichols whose credits include Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966), The Graduate (1967), Silkwood (1983), Postcards from the Edge (1990), and a number of other very successful films.  In Closer, he shows once again that he still knows what interests the current generation.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>Despite being a fan of serious, artsy cinema, I fail to understand why "Closer" has gotten the acclaim it has. All four leads turn in pretty mediocre performances, though this could be due to the weak script - one of those overblown ones that look fabulous on paper and jaw-droppingly awful when spoken by actors - and Julia Roberts' perplexing drag-queen like performance does nothing to elevate the quality of this cinema.<br /><br />Depsite Natalie Portmans' desperate attempts at some sort of nouveau-style attempt at dramatics (her breakdown scene when Jude Law leaves her is particularly embarrassing), the film wears thin in about a half hour. This is because you know exactly what happens, and you know that these four characters are going to be kicked around so hard that by the end of the film you feel sympathy for none of them. And thats exactly what happened.<br /><br />"Closer" is the story of two couples whose lives intertwine. Most of this has got to do with sexual attraction - romance and love take a back seat, and this was an aspect of the film that did not appeal to me. Its as if the director really wanted to show us a dark, depressing side of relationships, but at the same time wanted to infuse the film with the air of an 'artiste', so in the end you have a very snobbish film with no substance or artistic merit whatsoever. If people behaved like people in this film do, we'd all be rather stunned, simply because none of the characters carry themselves with the remote consistency of a human being. The play is robotic even, and if that was the intended effect, even that wasn't done very well.<br /><br />I particularly have a problem with Jude Laws' character in the film because the actor has really compromised both on his acting and choice of roles on this one. Forget the tawdry net-lingo used in the movie, its difficult to imagine someone being so spineless and fearless at the same time. Even if they were, Jude Law doesn't do a very good job of convincing us. Julia Roberts looks frighteningly like a man in this movie, seeming so much older than all of her costars, including Clive Owen who is no spring chicken to begin with. Not that this is a bad thing, but it really removes her from the spirit of the film. Natalie Portman is far more effective, but the horrendous dialogue they give her ruins any chance she has.<br /><br />The DVD of "Closer" is a welcome addition because I believe every film student should see this movie. Its quirky and will be talked about, but to me thats for all the wrong reasons. Unlike real modern classics like 'The Machinist' this movie wants to be a cutting edge dark film so desperately, that it shows. And when that happens, it can't do much else than fall to pieces. This is very poor film-making, and I wish the acclaimed director would go back to making films the way he used to instead of using overpaid Hollywood stars in meaningless films about relationships based on lust and deceit.<br /><br />An ineffective film. Two stars.<br /><br />kabitat@gmail.com</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>One of the previous reviewers of Mike Nichols' CLOSER called it "one of the most raw and honest portrayals of 21st century relationships." Sorry if this offends you, ma'am, but if you find Patrick Marber's hopelessly sour depiction of 21st century relationships truthful---if you agree with his implicit argument that people in our modern times have lost the ability to truly love each other and be honest with each other in relationships, no matter how hard they may try to make a show of affection and honesty---then I can only imagine what hurt you've gone through in your romantic life to lead you to make a similar conclusion.<br /><br />CLOSER is the sad chronicle of four lives ruined by cheating, lying, and manipulation. Anna the photographer (Julia Roberts) breaks the heart of Larry the dermatologist (Clive Owen) by sleeping with Dan the writer (Jude Law), who himself breaks the heart of Alice the stripper (Natalie Portman). The movie basically follows these four characters as they all hurt each other, some willingly, some unwillingly. There are very few scenes that elicit any sense of hope for these people; they remain self-absorbed and plain selfish from beginning to end.<br /><br />So, these are not very likable characters. Not a problem, necessarily; I've seen plenty of movies and TV shows in the past that have had unappealing characters, but have been so well written and insightfully performed that I nevertheless feel compelled to observe these characters during the course of the film or episode. (An example: the hit TV show "Everybody Loves Raymond" can sometimes make you wince more than laugh---especially when someone get Patricia Heaton's Debra Barone angry!---but I still maintain an admiration for its occasional priceless insights into family life, even in the midst of crazy family dysfunction.) Likewise, I might have accepted the bald manipulations of these four nasty specimens more readily if the movie actually highlighted some startling truths about modern relationships. The cynical side of me is perfectly willing to accept the filmmakers' notion that people these days have become a little more selfish in love. But the way Marber presents his thesis here, there is no connection to anything resembling real life---especially in his dialogue, which can be impressive when it doesn't simply sound all-too-written---to ground his misanthropic ideas in some kind of realistic footing. The result is a movie that seems less like an expose of harsh truths, more like a grotesque fantasy about glamorous people mindlessly inflicting terrible emotional pain on each other.<br /><br />I can't really fault the performances, though---at least Natalie Portman's and Clive Owen's. It was an inspired decision to cast the innocent-looking Portman as the stripper who gets hurt by Dan and wisens up considerably afterwards; Portman relays an occasionally touching vulnerability (although, admittedly, that is the only note Portman really emphasizes in her performance here), and Nichols smartly mines it for irony in the film's closing scenes. Clive Owen also burrows into his role with all the intensity and emotional honesty he can find from a role that requires him to be hurt and angry in one scene, and then coldly vengeful the next, almost on a dime. As for Jude Law and Julia Roberts...well, Law plays his character like such a sensitive fellow that you sometimes can't believe that this timid-seeming man could brutally hurt Alice the way he does. And while Roberts effectively dials down the movie-star wattage here, she does seem somewhat ill at ease in parts of this movie. When she hurls sexual obscenities at Larry in one scene, Roberts' delivery makes those words sting with all the power of a dead bee.<br /><br />But perhaps one shouldn't blame Law or Roberts if they have trouble giving consistent performances in this movie. Their roles are in the service of a shallow vision of modern relationships that seems so divorced from any sense of reality that any actor might have trouble trying to find any kind of emotional truth in this kind of role. I expected CLOSER to be edgy and compelling; it is both, but it is also witless and frankly pointless, in my opinion. Forget the hype; you can easily skip this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Clever and insightful, "Closer" is a romance for adults. It is serious fare. There is nothing cute or cloying about it. If you are searching for happy endings, search elsewhere.<br /><br />When I say that this is a romance for adults, I mean that you have to be at least 25-years old to appreciate this story of ill-fated, star-crossed and double-crossed lovers. It's far too complicated for the teenage crowd.<br /><br />In London Dan [Jude Law] meets Alice [Natalie Portman] literally by accident. A year or so later, Dan meets Anna [Julia Roberts]. He is attracted to her, but when the relationship doesn't work out, he spitefully arranges a meeting between her and Larry [Clive Owen]. Larry and Anna click. The story then gets complicated.<br /><br />The four stars give awesome performances. Except for two walk on roles, they are the only actors in the movie. Natalie Portman makes excellent use of a role that should propel her career enormously.<br /><br />Highly recommended for adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>CLOSER is a film about the strange interplay between four people who richly deserve each other, as well as the disaster that they all bring to each other's lives.<br /><br />The story begins simply enough, with Dan (Jude Law) meeting "Alice" (Natalie Portman) on the street. Alice is striking in the crowd: her hair is spiked and fuchsia, and their eyes lock. While waiting at the street corner, Alice is hit by a taxi receiving minor injuries, and Dan, who we already know has an immediate attraction to her, takes her to the hospital where she receives two stitches on her leg. This begins their relationship. Dan gives Alice a very brief tour of London (he is late for work, after all), and the next thing you know it Dan is being photographed by Anna (Julia Roberts) for the author's photo on a book he has published, a book whose heroine is modeled after Alice. During the photo shoot, Dan tells Julia to "come here", and after a brief moment she moves forward, and he moves forward to her and they kiss. They both acknowledge involvement with others (indeed, Alice is meeting him there after her shift), and Anna appears to pull away. When Alice arrives, she goes to the bathroom and Dan tells Anna that he has to see her. Unfortunately, Alice heard him while he was in the bathroom, something she communicates to Anna while Anna is photographing her (she had never been professionally photographed, she says, but I believe it was really a ruse to let Anna know what she heard). Anna takes a moving and poignant photograph of tears rolling down Alice's cheeks. She says that she isn't a thief, and comments on how interesting Alice's life is. Alice makes a dismissive comment (I can't remember exactly what it was), but we learn that there isn't only one person being deceptive here - it's quite obvious that Alice has secrets of her own.<br /><br />In a bizarre and rather sexually explicit internet exchange, Dan (impersonating Anna), encourages another man, a dermatologist (Clive Owen as Larry), to meet him (her) at the aquarium. Dan sends him to the aquarium because Anna says that she often goes there. Larry goes, sees Anna (who could miss the description: big mouth, killer ****), and converses with her. It takes only a moment for Dan's deception to be made known.<br /><br />Like a play (which this is taken from), there are large jumps in time. This second jump takes us to a point where Larry and Anna are now in a relationship. This is a bit of a surprise, because Larry doesn't come across as a decent person. Indeed, in a conversation he has with Alice (while Dan and Anna are talking privately), he says, "sometimes the frog gets the princess". He may have been referring to his exterior looks, but I read it to be a metaphor for his interior ugliness, as I viewed his character more than any to be in a state of nearly constant moral decay.<br /><br />In the film, people change lovers like underwear, and Anna leaves Larry for Dan, Alice begins stripping after Dan leaves her (although in perhaps a pointed comment she tells Larry that nobody left her), and then they switch back again. "Closer" may have a deeper meaning than the one that seems obvious, but this movie seems to me more aptly titled "How to Screw Up Your Life by Cheating and Lying".<br /><br />What's of tremendous interest is that each man, after learning that their respective partner (whichever one it was at the time), is intent on knowing the exact particulars of the indiscretion. As Larry acknowledges, he wants to know because he is a caveman. That is certainly a word I would have picked if he hadn't.<br /><br />All four characters began with little innocence, and end with less. We know the least about Anna, but we can judge her by her actions - which are deplorable. Her obvious lack of happiness in the end also speaks volumes. Larry is the most obviously decrepit character, as he brazenly displays his lack of concern and care for others when, mainly, he is seeking some form of revenge. Alice is the character that seems to be the most innocent, but in the end we find out that we really know absolutely nothing about her whatsoever. And Dan - Dan perhaps wants to be as morally reprehensible as Larry, but he lacks the ability to do so. Yes, he is a cheat, a liar, and a thief (in love), but there is an innocence about him. Anna told Larry that he would cry for his mother in his sleep, and this, perhaps, explains much. It also gives us the most information we get regarding Anna and her true feelings for Dan. You don't share secrets like that unless you are making fun of the person.<br /><br />These are four deeply flawed people, but they are four people that it's not difficult to imagine meeting in everyday life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"And so it is<br />Just like you said it would be<br />Life goes easy on me<br />Most of the time<br />And so it is<br />The shorter story<br />No love, no glory<br />No hero in her sky<br /><br />I can't take my eyes off of you<br />I can't take my eyes off you<br />I can't take my eyes off of you<br />I can't take my eyes off you<br />I can't take my eyes off you<br />I can't take my eyes..."  song and lyrics by Damien Rice. It plays through-out the movie, and the voice and melody bring a surreal quality to a movie that is so stark and real that it leaves you breathless at times.<br /><br />Directed by Mike Nichols, "Closer" the movie, tells in bits and pieces the lives of four people during four years. We see flashbacks that interpose with present day and leave us a little surprised at how easily we adapt. Alice (Natalie Portman) and<br />Dan (Jude Law) become lovers following a chance meeting on a street in London. She is a stripper/waitress, and he is writer/obituary writer. They move on from day to day until Dan meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer of strangers. He becomes obsessed with her and wants to have an affair.  Anna rebuffs him, and he pays her back with a funny internet porn site meeting. Anna meets Larry (Clive Owen) a dermatologist at The Aquarium, and they begin a love affair. At some point these two couples become intertwined while Anna and Dan fall in love,  This movie belies  passion, heartbreak, anger, sadness, vengeance, pleading, deception, and most importantly, brutal honesty. It's only when you're more than halfway through the movie that you realize this is a movie that wraps all of your worst nightmares into one story. Larry loves Anna, Anna loves Dan, Alice loves Dan, and Alice once loved Larry.  How does this all come around to make any sense? The betrayals of each of the four are so strong that you wonder how any can recover. The anger and loss so extreme that how can love ever enter their lives again?<br /><br />Julia Roberts is a marvel in this move, so serene, so lovely, and so stark. Jude Law plays the devil and the damned; bringing a bruised ego to the fore and such a cad! Clive Owen plays the man who is most intricate; so removed and so near, so full of deceit and anger. But it is, Natalie Portman who plays the woman most abused and most full of her self and her destiny and sure of whom she is and who will not settle for less. This is a movie to be remembered.<br /><br />If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking.<br /><br />If you believe in love at first sight... Take a closer look<br /><br />Those who love at first sight are traitors at every glance.

Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, but this film just goes way over the top, opting for cheap fireworks instead of more examined fullness.  Way too many melodramatic reversals, too many histrionic fits and staged confrontations between the characters, until finally it just becomes repetitive and dull.<br /><br />The language is raw yes, but if you mind hey that's how most people talk under stress so grow up and get used to it.<br /><br />Julia Roberts does have probably the most "real" role of her career as opposed to her usual Barbie doll roles (excepting "Erin Brockovich"), but Jude Law and Natalie Portman are doing their usual familiar bits here, nothing remarkable.  Clive Owen egregiously overacts in the Al Pacino style but he's still fun to watch, like Pacino.<br /><br />Oh well, this still beats the pulp on TV at least.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>Natalie Portman hasn't had an appropriate leading man since Jean Reno in The Professional.  This movie made me especially miss their pairing.  She seems too much for the people in this film, beyond their capacity to comprehend.  I think everyone is lying in this movie and no, Alice does not love Crocodile.  She just doesn't look like she belongs with any of these people and London looks empty and uncomfortable.  The best thing about this movie is the line that she delivers early in the movie that she doesn't "eat children either." and the second best thing about this movie is the sofas.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Deception has always been an interesting theme, but hardly as well presented as in "Closer", and in spades. Other reviewers were put off by it, but in the hands of Master Mike Nichols, this is only another classic in the history of the subject (Shakespeare, Oedipus Rex, Lysistrata, etc.). This kind of deceit involves a bunch of pretty people, which may not include you nor I; still, similar things have probably happened to us that we can relate to.Naysaying reviewers might be in denial, but, fact is, the brilliant cast and author (and director) have presented a brutal and honest slice of ugliness that is difficult to ignore. We can only hope to learn, listen and grow from this. Jude Law, Clive Owen & Natalie Portman were applauded for their roles. I've always been a fan of Julia Roberts, and I thought she was their equal. All are appalling people, and there's no love to be lost for any of them. The change in time-frame was confusing, but added to the angst.  A thoughtful, thinking-persons film.The references to Mozart & Rossini throughout are appropriate.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Wow, what an exhausting movie about some really f**ked up people.  Just when you started to root for a character they would do something so base and digusting you would just sit there in shock.  The dialoge is great, thanks to this being an acclaimed stage production, the performances are good, Clive Owen the stand out, he was exceptional.  Im really not sure id recommend this movie, it's so depressing, and what it says about these four losers is not pretty, but on the other hand the performances are good, the dialoge well written and i liked the fact is is shot on location in London...really up to you, but be prepared to be very frustated, these four are idiots of the highest order and deserve each other, I really hate to think that anyone could be as horrible as any of these four.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Mike Nichols is enjoying something of a comeback. First, there was the critically-lauded Angels in America mini-series that aired on HBO and now the equally successful Closer. Together, they prove that there is an audience for smart dramas by and for adults. Nichols has a keen sense for absorbing character studies that explore, in unflinching honesty, the complex relationships between men and women. Closer shows the destructive results of infidelity.<br /><br />The characters in Closer are messed up and damaged people. They make choices that hurt others and don't think of the consequences. The dialogue is intelligent and insightful about the way people can so easily hurt each other emotionally and make the wrong choices. Mike Nichols brings a strong visual eye to the film as he successfully gives the play that it is based on a cinematic look while retaining the dialogue that has its own unique rhythm and cadence. This is due in large part to having the play's author, Patrick Marber, adapt his own work for the big screen. The result is a tough, honest look at the intertwining lives of four people.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only extra is a music video for Damien Rice's moving song, "The Blower's Daughter."</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>What happens when you don't know who or what you love? When you get bored with routine and a little adventure is in need? When the lies are so real that you start to live them and forget what your life was? Those are some of the questions proposed by Mike Nichols "Closer", a drama movie featuring four talented and beautiful actors - four "hollywood sweethearts".<br /><br />Dan (Jude Law) met Alice (Natalie Portman) in the street. She suffers an accident, and they get together. Dan becomes a famous writer, and he has to get a photo for the back cover of his book. Anna (Julia Roberts) is a photographer. Anna and Dan meet, and they fall in love, even though Anna starts dating Larry, a lonely and rich doctor.<br /><br />There's more to "Closer" than that. Much more. Plot-twists and love-twists. Lots of them. The movie is based on a play by british author Patrick Marber, so there's little room for settings and locations, and much room for character development, and, most of all, dialogue. There are several fantastic lines in the movie, and some memorable scenes. It's interesting to see how the four characters relate to each other, because they are very much like us, common people, and what they are going through could happen - or have already happened -  to almost everyone.<br /><br />Clive Owen and especially Natalie Portman provide amazing acting. The direction is average, but the movie as a whole is very good, although somewhat depressing. The viewers become painfully aware of their own weakness when confronted to the ugly aspects of life. But that's life.<br /><br />Grade 8.7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>Well this is a film you will either like or hate. But even if you hate it, you will appreciate the complexity of the dialogue and outstanding script as well as the razor sharp directing from Mike Nichols. You will probably appreciate the outstanding acting, especially from Natalie Portman. The film is about the complexity of relationships. Relationships and love in all its variations is extremely complex and therefore when folks don't know what they want and don't tell the truth, it is bound to become a big mess and this film shows just how messy it can get. The film shows how self deception leads to deception of others. It shows how every effort to avoid pain in relationships just leads to more vulnerability to pain. It also demonstrates that in general we are much better at talking about sexual intimacy than emotional intimacy. The character of Alice, played by Natalie Portman, was certainly my favorite and I found her to be the least emotionally damaged of all the characters. Her scene with Clive Owen in the strip bar was unforgettable. She is the least calculating and emotionally constricted of the 4 main characters. Jude Law plays Dan, a fellow who doesn't know what he wants and doesn't like what he gets and has an arrogance and distance that he seems to think will protect him from emotional hurt. Because he is so into himself, ensuring that he gets what he wants without much regard to others, he is not a likeable character and in the end I felt no sympathy for him. Julia Roberts plays Anna, a cool character if there ever was one. She is withdrawn and a bit listless. She hides behind her camera and is not enthusiastic about life. Her best scene is the wonderful scene where she meets Dr. Larry in the aquarium and he thinks she is the wild sex hungry uninhibited chick he has communicated with on-line. Here she shows humor and insight, which would have served her well in trying to manage her marriage to Larry. Clive Owen, as Dr. Larry, gets five of the best scenes in the film. The film seemed to translate well from the stage to the screen. Comparisons to "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe" don't really hold for in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe" alcoholism and years of intimacy and keeping each other's secrets erupts. However in Closer, the anger and aggression comes not from too much intimacy but from too little intimacy, so that only sex and anger penetrate the carefully constructed veneers of three of the 4 main characters. The scene closest in intensity to the Taylor and Burton fight fests in "Who's Afraid" is the scene where Larry and Anna fully confront each other due to Larry's absolute insistence on hearing the worst and saying the worst. Clive Owen's performance is excellent and I empathized with him more than the other characters. Structurally the film seems to be about Anna and Dan with Alice and Larry on the edge, but the performances of Portman and Owen are so strong that the tables are turned and Roberts and Law are given a run for their money in the acting department. The dialogue is fast and sharp, so you may wish to watch it twice, if you can bear to watch human train wrecks.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>The Closer is a witty unconventional drama of betrayal and romance.  Why do people cheat and risk losing their true love?  It also delves into how much one can really know their closest companion and whether they are always strangers.<br /><br />The film is directed by Mike Nichols and is a story of four people, initially strangers. He does a fabulous job of illuminating how much one can really know about the person they love.  A complicated set of relationships showing fidelity and cheating are examined.<br /><br />The characters are Dan (Jude Law), Alice (Natalie Portman), Larry (Clive Owen), and Anna (Julia Roberts).  Dan writes obituaries, Alice is a stripper, Anna is a photographer and Larry is a dermatologist.<br /><br />The movie jumps from first meetings to humorous and sometimes raw honesty in their entangled lives.  The script is adult, edgy, and humorous.  The actors do the script justice and the story holds throughout.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Closer tells the story of self-centered characters and their selfish motivations (and this is why it is interesting). Some reviews and viewers insist that this kind of story produces no sympathetic or likeable characters. I disagree.<br /><br />The selfish, flawed nature of each character makes each one more believable and human (which the slightly stilted dialogue-adapted from an original stage play-could easily have masked had less skillful actors played in these roles) and ultimately moves the story along. Perhaps the lack of sympathy viewers and reviewers profess is because some of the more hypocritical and brutal aspects of the characters hit too close to home. As the poet Gavin Ewart wrote in "Short Time": "when two illusions meet, let there not be a third/of the gentle hypocrite reader prone to think/that he is wiser than these self-deceivers. / Such dreams are common. Readers have them too."<br /><br />Indeed at the core of this film a divide exists between who the individuals really are and the perception of who they should be (ideally). After seeing the film, which didn't immediately overwhelm me, I found myself thinking about the motivations driving each character. (This is part of the strength of the film: it is thought-provoking and leaves one wondering after the fact.) Without spoiling any endings, one must wonder why Julia Roberts' character Anna makes the choice she does. One must also wonder, especially by the end, if any of these characters knew one another at all or if they were so self-involved that they used the others in their lives to fill voids absentmindedly, disregarding all the consequences. Did anyone in this story truly know the individuals s/he chose to have in her/his life?<br /><br />The timeline in the film jumps around, as the film's four characters jump into and out of each other's lives. The film begins with Damien Rice's song "The Blower's Daughter" (auspicious beginnings, if I may say so) and almost immediately two of the four characters (Jude Law's "Dan" and Natalie Portman's "Alice") meet. As the story skips ahead, Dan and Alice live together, and Dan meets and ardently pursues Julia Roberts's "Anna". (He is, at least initially, rebuffed.) Enter (through rather comedic circumstances) "Larry" (the most human and real character of the film played effectively by Clive Owen). Anna and Larry get married, and at this point, relationships start to unravel, revealing both the selfishness and the deep vulnerabilities in each character. Trust, if indeed there ever was trust between any of these characters, breaks down. It is never clear, though, that the people involved have any real clue what they want. Mostly it is the same old story: they want what they can't have but don't want it when they have it.<br /><br />Not being a fan of Julia Roberts or Jude Law, I was prepared to dislike their roles. However, Law was perfect as wishy-washy, hypocritical Dan, and Roberts was razor sharp in both her sarcasm and in her more emotional scenes (particularly with the talented Clive Owen, who is always eminently watchable). Natalie Portman's performance, if not her character, is probably the most arresting here because her Alice is at once strong and self-sufficient but at the same time has the appearance of someone needy and vulnerable. She announces to Dan at the beginning of the film that her relationships end because she falls out of love, and she is always the one to leave. In the end, when Dan treats Alice as a kind of consolation prize and comes back to her more out of desperation than real respect or feeling, the viewer wonders not only what Dan really knew about Alice (he perceived and assumed rather than really knowing/finding out) but also what lies below the surface with anyone in life. Just as in real life, individuals often seek out others to stroke their egos and to feel "needed", and this story weaves multiple variations of this kind of emotional manipulation into one story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>When I saw this film in theaters I was completely blown away with it.  Before I even went to see it, I was impressed with the perfect casting of four actors whom I really enjoy watching on film:  Julia Roberts (as Anna), Natalie Portman (as Alice), Jude Law (as Dan), and Clive Owen (as Larry).  This one is really dialogue heavy in a way that pulls you in and never lets go.  Among the four actors, I think Natalie Portman pretty much owns this picture and her recent Golden Globe was well deserved (I hope she repeats on Sunday by nabbing the Best Supporting Actress Oscar).  The scenes of her in a private room of a strip club, bending her body in imaginative and seductive ways while still carrying on an intense and sexually charged conversation with Larry is an amazing scene for me.  To watch this film and "Garden State", you will be convinced that Natalie Portman is the actress of her generation and will only grow from here.<br /><br />Clive Owen is also great in this film and his character of Larry is the most conniving of the four.  The movie works to a brilliant resolution, in which is wicked knowledge of Anna's psychology is used to set up a rival for his former flame's affections (Dan).  Payback is a b...., as they say and well deserved in the case of pathetic Dan, who toys with people's emotions, pretending to be who he's not, especially in the Internet chatroom.<br /><br />While some people might not find any of the characters sympathetic or like the idea that people in relationships lie to one another, but I find a lot of what happens in this film to be true to life, in my own observations of people.  To live a completely honest life means one is going to be stepped on, taken advantaged of, and discarded when no longer convenient.  This film should serve as a wake up call to anyone that it sometimes takes cunning to win at the game of love.  The pathetic aspect of love is that no one wants to get hurt, yet too many don't see the hurt they cause in others.  This film is a brilliant case example, with top notch performances across the board.<br /><br />I'm shocked that one reviewer below called this film gay without the courage to state so at the end.  That's one interpretation, though I suppose it reveals more about the reviewer than anything else.  I certainly didn't get that impression from the film.<br /><br />See this film and hopefully it will inspire you to be honest in your dealings with other people...especially the ones you love the most.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>I liked this film very much.<br /><br />The screenplay (adapted by the author of the original stageplay) is very well written. The story revolves around four people (you know who) who meet pretty much by chance (how modern...) and keep falling in and out of love with each other. Sounds simple? It is not. They cheat, they hurt, they lie, they cry... all between four people.<br /><br />But to me, the most interesting thing about this screenplay is the way the passing of the time is shown. It is hard to explain... we follow small moments of each couple's life and... suddenly there are jumps forward where big chunks of story left unseen suddenly became past. Clever, simple and intelligent. Frankly I haven't seen a script like this in years.<br /><br />Now the actors... oh, the actors... you can't get any better. Roberts, Law, Portman and Owen are simply top. Enough said?<br /><br />Some people (in other reviews) seemed to feel bothered by the cruel/explicit language in this film (may I remind you this is rated R). According to them, people do not talk like this. Maybe not. But people tend to forget that this film is written like a game and a puzzle. Many times, the screenplay engages in word playing (something that comes from the original source of this material: the stage). In a way, the film kept some of the word puzzles (which is not how people talk). Strange: nobody complains when Shakespeare does that... (laughs)<br /><br />On the other side, the screenplay clearly exaggerates some explicitness because in this operation lies many of the feelings we would not see had they done otherwise. The explicitness here may not be real... but the feelings are. And those dialogues shine because they go higher than reality.<br /><br />So maybe 50% of the dialogues may be too explicit or may be different from the way people talk... so what? in this film I think it is clearly justified... because other more subtler things than reality are at play. In fact, there is a lot of reality here that is put aside for (let's call it) poetic reasons... so the story can get to a certain point... so this character can end up this way... (think about the role coincidence plays here... think about all the things that would and could never happen in real life...) You really have to understand in order to enjoy.<br /><br />You don't really get this movie if you don't understand why the writer did what he did. And to me, the whole text is beautiful.<br /><br />A gem.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>When I saw "Closer" in the theatre last December I was getting flashbacks to another Mike Nichols film about relationships gone bad from three decades ago, "Carnal Knowledge".  As provocative and engrossing as "Carnal Knowledge" was it was probably one of the more unsettling viewing experiences I ever had.  I felt as if I was eavesdropping on the worst type of behavior people who are allegedly in love could do to one another.  The central characters in "Closer" behave badly as well yet somehow it is a more palatable viewing experience than "Carnal Knowledge".  You cannot conveniently villify any of the principle characters in "Closer".  These are individuals who are caught up in complex emotions and situations that are just overwhelming.  Credit director Nichols and scriptwriter Patrick Marber, whose stage play this film was adapted from, for not providing us with easy answers.  The ensemble cast here is uniformly excellent.  Julia Roberts as Anna probably has done her best work ever here.  Jude Law as Dan gives complexity to a character that could easily be  dismissed as a cad.  Clive Owen's star continues to rise with his account of Larry, the working-class dermatologist.  Natalie Portman is effervescent as Alice, the mysterious stripper.  If you are looking for a provocative film that leaves a little food for thought "Closer" is it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"Closer" is a handbook about how not to act in a relationship. It is about deception in all its various permutations: lying, cheating, pretending to love someone, pretending not to love someone.<br />"Closer" is about anything other then actually being close. In fact "Closer" is about staying as far away emotionally from people as you can: playing games with each other, taunting each other with frank descriptions of intimate encounters and instigating brutal arguments in which the need to hurt and cut as deeply as possible is paramount.<br />The four involved are: Alice (Natalie Portman), Dan (Jude Law), Anna (Julia Roberts) and Larry (Clive Owen)<br />Adapted from Patrick Marber's play of the same name, "Closer" several times retains the artificiality of a stage play. Movies are naturalistic, the Stage is artificial and at times the screenplay and Mike Nichols direction leads the actors down the wrong path artistically: for example Julia Roberts, the warmest of screen actresses actually comes off arch and stilted saying some of her lines.<br />But about midway through, things even out and Marber and Nichols get down to telling their story in movie terms. It's interesting to note that many scenes here remind me of Nichols's first film, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" in their eagerness to go for the throat.<br />One outstanding scene between Anna and Larry has them going at each other like wounded, feral animals. I can't think of another recent film scene that packs such an emotional wallop. One that makes you wince because, by this point you know the characters well, they use words to slice each other up like surgeons performing heart surgery.<br />Law and Roberts play difficult characters to like much less love, which is probably what appealed to both of these actors on paper. But Anna and Dan are both emotional wrecks stuck out in a sea of diffidence and indecision and everyone around them is equally coflicted and emotionally closed. But, beautiful failures though they made be, Anna and Dan are nonetheless at the epicenter of this foursome. At times, Law and Roberts are effective and at others not so much.<br />Clive Owen is the real revelation here as Larry: a Dermatologist addicted to Computer Chat Rooms, from more earthy, humble beginnings than Anna and Dan...but very proud of his accomplishments. Owen plays him rough but sincere and when he tells Anna that he doesn't lie...you believe him.<br />Natalie Portman comes off best I think as 24-year-old Alice, who meets Dan in a classic "cute meet" manner: she is hit by a car and he helps her to the hospital. Portman, who has played Anne Frank on the stage and has less movie time than any of the other principals, plays Alice as if it is the last role she will ever play: she's direct, she's touching, she's sexy.<br />There is definitely something chilling and icy about the world that Nichols and Marber create in "Closer." Tread lightly here, keep your feelings to yourself and don't get involved, you just might survive a visit intact.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Closer" is a heavyweight breathtaking drama that rivets the viewer's attention.  The characters are not entirely likable, although each is eminently watchable.  Director Mike Nichols won the Oscar for Best Director for "The Graduate" in 1967 and has been nominated 3 other times for "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (1966), "Silkwood" (1983), & "Working Girl" (1988).  Along with films like "Primary Colors" and the TV mini-series "Angels in America," he has an unparalleled ear for dialogue.  No, it's not particularly pleasant.  No, these are not the people your pastor hopes you will be.  But each of these characters represent needs and desires that are shared by most people and are as confused by them as are many.  Patrick Marber's screenplay adaptation of his stage drama is heart-wrenchingly truthful.<br /><br />Of the four strong performances here, the most revelatory for me was Julia Roberts' portrayal of American photographer Anna living in London.  She is selfish but has a conscience.  She takes what she wants, but tries not to admit to it.  In the scene with Larry where she breaks up her marriage, it is some of the best screen time of her career.  When Larry grills her on the details of her sexual relationship with Dan, her zinger about the taste of his semen, "It's like yours only sweeter" is like a bullet shot from a gun.  It recalls the Elizabeth Taylor line in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," "You can take it; you married me for it."  It is utterly fearless and brilliant.  What a raw amazing performance!<br /><br />As Dan, Jude Law turns is an edgy self-effacing performance that adds to his reputation as one of the great young actors.  His scenes with Natalie Portman are enhanced by their similar pairing in "Cold Mountain."  On camera, Law is magnetic.  As Dan, the writer of the newspaper obituary column, he turns the ordinary into the extraordinary.<br /><br />Clive Owen is amazing as the strong less-than-sensitive type.  His internet sex dialogues with Jude Law's Dan posing as Anna on the computer are as intense as they are manipulated.  When he sits in the aquarium with Anna and with tremendous embarrassment learns the truth, he admits, "He certainly can write!"  In the scene with Julia Roberts he bellows "I'm a caveman."  It seems to typify the heart of "Closer," investigating these very primal sexual urges we have and how they interweave with the emotional attachments we call "love."  Owen was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role and won the Golden Globe Award.<br /><br />As Alice, Natalie Portman turns in an amazing performance.  Her character seems somewhat beyond reach, but she works the territory masterfully, exploring each need and nuance as if it were a beautiful discovery.  Portman was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar and also won the Golden Globe Award.<br /><br />Damien Rice's song "The Blower's Daughter" is an interesting DVD extra with that riveting chorus, "Can't take my eyes off of you."  It's the perfect love song for this film, part pure love and part compulsive addiction.  Mike Nichols has worked with an excellent cast and polished this dialogue to perfection.  The rhythms build and twist and the lovers attract, repel, trust and betray.  It does not so much build to an inevitable conclusion so much as it feels like we've followed the characters through a very intense period of life.  This is a film that will be watched and discussed for decades.  Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>While I was watching this movie, I was constantly reminded of We Don't Live Here Anymore(Mark Ruffallo, Laura Dern, Naomi Watts, and Peter Kruse) that came out earlier this year. It's also a movie about 2 couples dealing with infidelity. I must say I enjoyed We Don't Live Anymore only because Laura Dern delivered another "career best" performance. Closer is better story, direction is fine, and the all star cast is superb, especially the never been better Natalie Portman playing a striper. She's gone beyond her other good works including Anywhere But Here and Where The Heart Is.<br />Alice(Portman) met Dan(Jude Law) on the street of London when she got hit by a car, and they instantly became an "item". Dan has a thing for Anna(Julia Roberts), a photograper who likes to shoot strangers at the London Aquarium. She rejects Dan, because he's already with Alice. He uses her name and e-chat with a cyber sex freak/doctor named Larry(Clive Owen), and set up a date with him at the aquarium. Anna happens to be there when the horny doctor showed up. It was actually Anna's birthday, and depite the fact that she knew it was Dan who set the date up, she instantly clicked with Larry, and they also became an "item".<br />Time goes by, and passion fades, one member of the couples falls out of love. Anna secretly screw around with Dan after getting married with Larry. Dan decided to dump Alice, because she's not good enough or not woman enough to stimulate him. Alice was devastated and took off. Anna eventually  had to tell Larry her secret, because she couldn't stay with him anymore. Larry agreed to get divorced if she would let him "indulge" her body one more time.<br />Larry accidently ran into Alice in the strip joint and he paid her lots of money to have her strip for him and wanted to take her home and love her...<br />Upon knowing that Anna had slept with Larry again, Dan was furious and wanted to dump her, despite the fact that she love him more than Larry. Anyways, who will stay with whom at the end, I will not spoil it for you.<br />The overexposed Jude Law's character is the least likeable in this film, and somehow his performance is not as convincing like the way Portman(Alice) thinks of his love for her. Maybe it's the immaturity and insecurity of his role that makes me feel that way.<br />Clive Owen is pretty good, even though he has less screen time. He's more likeable compared to Law, because he's character is more realistic and honest.<br />This is probably Julia Robert's most serious role since Erin Brockovich. Unfortunately, her character lacked the heart and depth that was in Portman's role.<br />Natalie Portman gives the best performance in this movie and it's very likely going for an Oscar in the best supporting actress cateogory. She's very vulnerable and convincing, and the most likeable character in this movie. She gave her all and ultimately stole the movie from Julia Roberts.</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>"Closer" is a film about four people and the role that truth (or different kinds of truth) plays in their relationships as they try to get closer to themselves and to each other. The mixed reaction from viewers is because while "Closer" is a nicely packaged film and a fast-paced intelligent screenplay; the four main characters are "extremes" or at least extreme examples of the behaviors at the allegorical core of the film. These "expressionistically" drawn characters offend and disappoint the viewer segment expecting realistic and sympathetic portrayals (insert "characters with whom they can identify" here).<br /><br />But they are extreme because they are intended to illustrate (in obvious ways) certain subtle elements of our romantic relationships. The two male characters, Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen), are products of and participants in the most fundamental Darwinian courtship process. Despite making a pretense of having evolved from the competitive courtship of male primates, they are still driven more by the need to win and secure a trophy than by a quest to love. Likewise Anna, the older female (Julia Roberts), is attracted by the male demonstrations of dominance, both the physical bluster of strength and the mental head games intended to manipulate her emotions. Accordingly her behavior encourages these demonstrations by the males.<br /><br />Contrasted with these three is the younger female (Natalie Portman) who seeks a man who can transcend primitive drives, loving her and allowing her to love him.<br /><br />Into this mix writer Patrick Marber inserts the truth factor in an ironic way. Portman's character places little value on words, adopting a false name at the beginning of the film. That she is superficially living a lie is ironic because she is the only one of the four who does not lie about their true feelings or engage in self-deception. Her transparency and detached self-awareness is symbolized by her job as a stripper.<br /><br />The other three torture themselves and each other with superficial truths while engaging in compulsive deception about their actions and actual feelings, to each other and to themselves. Their duplicity is symbolized by their occupations. Dan is an obit writer, skilled in the use of euphemisms to disguise the unflattering characteristics of the deceased. Anna is a photographer, skilled in freezing a single moment in time uncharacteristic of the actual subject she is representing. Larry is a dermatologist focused on the superficial surface that one publicly presents.<br /><br />The key exchange occurs early in the film as Alice and Dan discuss how essential euphemisms are in his job:<br /><br />Alice: What would my euphemism be? Dan: She was... disarming. Alice: That's not a euphemism. Dan: Yes, it is.<br /><br />Alice's up-front and open behavior causes him to let down his guard and feel a higher level of emotion, but his need to make new conquests and to test his attractiveness soon reasserts itself. She is willing to forgive this until finally convinced that he cannot transcend something so much a part of his basic nature.  With this realization she falls out of love.<br /><br />"Closer" is much like "XX/XY" in its exploration of the mysteries of male discontent although it is philosophically deeper and much better written. Mark Ruffalo plays Coles (the Dan character in that film), but Law's portrayal is more convincing because he does not have to alternate between rebel and wimp, something that Ruffalo could not quite pull off.<br /><br />All four performances are solid although Roberts is given very little with which to work. Portman is especially good. The problem with "Closer" is that its symbolic message is not getting through to most viewers (at least it would appear so from the many clueless reviews and comments) who try to relate to it on a literal level. But if you like abstract tales deceptively showcased in a realistic package you should really enjoy this fine film.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>Truly the unique movie that has thoroughly divided audiences, Closer is either hated or loved. I tend towards the latter although I didn't love it. I can, however, appreciate the many qualities the movie has.<br />Let me start by taking on the many critics who claim, with stunning arrogance, that the movie is unrealistic, or that these things never happen, or that these people are so vile that the movie isn't worth the time to watch. You couldn't be farther from the truth. First of all, the events these characters go through certainly do happen, even if comprehending such stark brutality makes you dangerously self-conscious and uncomfortable. It's one thing to dislike a movie because you found it distasteful; it's another to try to cover all of human experience with the narrow blanket made up of your own limited life and stifled imagination. Secondly, the utterly repellent nature of their actions doesn't make the movie unworthy of the time one spends watching it, even if there are terribly painful moments to endure.<br />The four characters that make up this intense drama are cold blooded, unforgiving, self-destructive, selfish, and unable to distinguish between love and her twisted counter-ego, obsession. Clive Owen is the best part of this movie, from the moment we meet him through his confrontation with Jude Law, he is a boiling, sarcastic, and ruthless mess of a man. Matter of fact, no one in this movie is very likable, even the manipulative Alice, who from her name on down to her perfectly fitting occupation, rarely plays people honestly. She tries to play herself as this wounded victim, but she has more on the ball than she's given credit for. Witness the scene at the photography studio. Roberts and Law have the far less sympathetic roles to play; and Roberts plays hers emotionally detached and self-loathingly. Law is the romantic fool who doesn't know what he wants because he is emotionally immature.<br />Closer is a movie that I would not recommend to the easily offended, the people who are uncomfortable with frank sexual discussion, or those who don't enjoy character studies with no real plot. For those of you, I'm sure there's something on Fox News Channel you'd enjoy much more than this movie. Just don't take a wrong turn and uncover Bill O'Reilly's Jenna Jameson collection.<br />I would definitely recommend it for struggling couples, those contemplating divorce, or singles who never seem to be able to make relationships work. There are plenty of lessons these tortured characters can teach and I'm guessing that you'll see some of yourself in these four and their repeated mistakes. If you want to know the hell of a relationship's demise, or see how not knowing yourself handicaps your ability to successfully love and be loved in return, put on Closer, hold your breath, and open your eyes wide.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>I missed the first hour of this movie and still enjoyed it. I was pleasently surprised at how well this movie was. The acting was wonderful and I can't believe I enjoyed a film with Jude Law in it. I don't like him, also I do not care for Julia Roberts but I got in to the movie immediately. I love Clive Owen and I despise his character. I despise everyone in this film yet I loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This superb movie has notable edges, a solid script, a talented director, a splendid cast (the four main characters were superb). You should never forget that after that memorable and anthological film: who `s afraid of Virginia Woolf? In 1966, Mike Nichols simply reencountered with himself. He is one the most brilliant and propulsive directors of the last Century, thanks to him Jack Nicholson's career achieved a special peak.<br /><br />Four defined characters will meet in London. A frustrated male photographer(Julia Roberts), a dare devil writer(Jude Law) who pretends to reach the sudden notoriety through his emotive biographical memories with a girl with serious affective problems and limited self stem who aspires a major status in this society, and finally a bore dermatologist (Clive Owen)who works out as the opposite mirror like image of Law (notice how they exchange high tension dialogues while they are chatting).<br /><br />These are the defined pieces; and since that dramatic premise there will be an anthological game of wounded wills, emotional double crosses, emotive blackmails, oppression and reinsertion of new patterns of behavior before these serious affective lacks.<br /><br />Try to pay special attention respect a very brief but emblematic lines in the motel, when Natalie Portman says: "Where is the love?" And she concatenates four verbs in tandem: See me , feel me , touch me , hear me. Does not this sequence sound familiar to you? Well let me refresh the dramatic nucleus of Tommy: the famous Rock Opera. I guess this was a fabulous touch of genius by the screen writer, as well as the prologue and epilogue: can't take my eyes over you, another emblematic homage to that famous song of the late sixties.<br /><br />One of the most original pictures in that year and a marvelous tour de force, that rejoins us with those golden years where the chamber works of overwhelming theatrical stages became successful films (A streetcar named desire, A long day journey through the night) are by themselves the best evidence.<br /><br />"Love is the eternal toy that the women pretend to give and the men assume they receive." (Nietzsche)</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Wow! I finally got around to seeing this movie, and it was not at all what I expected. I can't believe how raw and gritty this film is...it's not the kind of movie you expect to see Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman in (or Natalie Portman's naked ass, for that matter). "Closer" is the story of four desperate and selfish people who commit various acts of adultery and betrayal. Dan, an obituary writer and struggling novelist (Jude Law) meets and falls in love with photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) while he is involved in a relationship with the free-spirited Alice (Natalie Portman). Dan inadvertently introduces Anna to Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist she ends up marrying even though she is carrying on an affair with Dan on the side.<br /><br />"Closer" is a very dark and depressing movie that basically takes every nightmarish relationship story you've ever heard and combines it into one tragic tale. It's a very intense movie that puts sex right at the forefront of conversation, sparing no details. (If you're the kind of person who is unfamiliar with graphic talk about sex, DO NOT see this movie!) Despite its brutal subject matter, this film is exceptionally well done. The four principle actors deliver spectacular performances. (The scene where Anna reveals her secret to Larry is unbelievable...Roberts and Owen are spectacular. Owen and Law also have a great scene set in Larry's office that is heartbreaking and yet almost comical at times. And every scene with Portman is amazing...this is definitely her best role to date.)<br /><br />This is a very emotional, tragic, beautiful film. It's not the kind of movie you'll want to watch again and again because it's so incredibly depressing, but it's a very unique and brilliant film...definitely worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>in a relationship.  For most people, that's too much to take onscreen!  For me, it means that small moments of the film keep reappearing in my consciousness, unsettling me from time to time.  That return to the moment or moments caused me to give this sweeping character study by famed and beloved director Mike Nichols, 4 stars.<br /><br />"Closer" is a curious film, excellent in its execution, and yet, for those who go to films to be entertained, "Closer" will be a dismal failure. Look at it as a character study, a train wreck of every bad relationship you've ever had.  It is not at all entertaining; in fact, it is brutal and artificial in its conception, in its deception.  You are deceived into thinking it will eventually become a love story, but instead it is a story of emotional wounding.<br /><br />Four characters become entwined in relationships based on sex, which they perceive to be love.  The meeting of Dan (Jude Law), angular and sinewy, an obituary writer with a chilly outlook on life (and a lack of integrity that is so much on the surface, you wonder what it is the women see in him) and the luminous, voluptuous, Alice (Natalie Portman) is quite by accident in a London street.  She's running from a life in New York that wasn't turning out the way she planned, and it feels as though she will meet and take up with someone, anyone, on the street.  Dan is a good choice for her emptiness.  We see him next in Anna's (Julia Roberts) photography studio - now a semi-successful author who is posing for a book cover, and who has partnered with Alice for a couple of years, he is immediately arrested by Anna's behavior and looks and wants her desperately.  Alice arrives and Anna is taken with her looks and sexuality, photographing her in a beautiful shot that survives and lives to be a centerpiece in a future show of Anna's work.  Meeting Alice cements in Anna's mind that, as much as she is drawn to Dan, she does not want to be with him.<br /><br />As Anna rebuffs Dan, his smarmy response is to set her up for a meeting (unknown to her) with a wanton doctor that he meets online in a sex chat room.  The doctor, Larry (Clive Owens) is sexual in a primal, raw and needy way.  His encounter with Anna turns from the embarrassing to the sublime when he is able to cut through her reserve and anger with his amazing looks and rough charm.  Your initial reaction to Larry is that Anna is lucky to meet him.  His honesty, decency, and, despite his amazing looks and profession, his lack of polish are disarming.  The four have their first (and only) mutual encounter at Anna's photography show, and it is during this show that the filmgoer begins to become perplexed by the relationships.  Alice and Larry have an encounter that simmers in its desperation, Dan is undone at the outcome of his prank and it becomes apparent that Dan has never ceased pursuing Anna.  More surprises and misdeeds wait after Anna and Larry have been married, in an attempt at decency, only to have her withdraw in a baffling move, in favor of Dan.  The complex feelings of abandonment and anger; the raw emotion that opens when one half of a couple admits to cheating, is repeated in the encounters between Larry and Anna and Dan and Alice.<br /><br />Stunningly, the four are not finished with each other as the divorce proceeds and Larry encounters both Alice, who has returned to her career as a stripper, and then Anna in a scene that will leave you wondering what in the world could Anna's motivation be, and just what will ever make her happy.  There is no decency, no loyalty in the behavior of any of the characters, except for Alice, who retains her amazement and loyalty to her coupling with Dan, until she realizes just how self-absorbed he is and just how much of a game it all is to him, and finally, finally, breaks free; the only one of the three, you believe, that will ever be free of the deceit.<br /><br />It is easy to dislike and distrust Law, and eventually to cheer for his comeuppance.  Although I did not think his performance as strong as that of the others, the very nature of how much you DO dislike him, despite both ladies' love for him, is telling in how much he inhabited his character.  Roberts is credible as Anna, although her screen persona is far too warm to play the cold and confused photographer, who plays out her inner turmoil in her black and white portraits, which are stark, indeed.<br /><br />She is accurate in displaying her moods on her face, accomplished in her dialogue and there is no doubt about why both men would want her, but somehow, she is unable to pull the whole thing off.  Or perhaps she and Law just pale by comparison to the truly excellent performances given by Owen and Portman.<br /><br />Owen, who has been truly decent and sexy as Larry, is a revelation when he is spurned; his behavior varies widely from sorrow, longing and desperation to anger and coldly calculated emotional brutality.  This role, like much of what  Owen has played in the past (a fierce and rugged "King Arthur" in Fuqua's film of the same name, an intense and passionate turn as a doctor in Angela Jolie's "Beyond Borders," in a revelatory role in "Bent" as a Nazi prisoner who is also a prisoner of his own homosexuality, and, best of all, his enigmatic and cold cynic "Croupier" role) is a tribute to his ability to immerse himself in the character, and then draw the audience in with him.  It is high time that the powers that be in Hollywood discovered him not only for his amazing screen presence and beauty, but his skill as an actor.  After "Closer", hopefully they will recognize leading man material and he will find a film that will propel him into the upper echelons of today's leading men, where he belongs.  He's had a long career of mostly "B" grade films, where his performance is the saving grace of the entire movie.<br /><br />As good as Owen is, he's eclipsed by the breathtaking turn of Natalie Portman as the character who disguises herself as "Alice".  She's tantalizingly sexual and a cipher between the wanton and the vulnerable in meeting Dan, meeting Larry, and in the strip club.  In private scenes with Dan, as part of a couple, she's engaging and almost childish in her love for him.  I've long thought of Portman as the young woman of the beautiful face, and thought she was amazing in "Garden State", but here she truly steps out of the "goody good" roles she's been taking in the past, and gives us a taste of what Natalie Portman, on the brink of adulthood, can be.  She alternately portrays innocence and the knowingness of a woman who knows she inspires lust at first glance.  Her scenes as a stripper are a revelation of beauty and body, and she's "large and in charge" of the encounter with Larry; that's when you know that, despite the hurt, despite her willingness to run from port to port in a storm, she's ultimately a survivor.  Portman was surprisingly cast, and Nichols' instincts and ability to direct such an amazing performance leave her, too, on the brink of a career explosion, if she chooses roles correctly.<br /><br />Unlike many of the critics, I did feel the chemistry between the characters; complete and utter longing and abandonment, not love.  By film's end, you are convinced that all of them are soulless.  I did not, however, feel or engage in the worth of any one character; was not rooting for them, was not drawn in by them, at least until the closing scene in New York, in which a very different Portman takes a walk as "Alice", now liberated from the need to hide or costume her appearance.  In this final walk, I was touched by how happy I was that she'd escaped the madness, and how much I wanted her to be happy.<br /><br />Nichols was fortunate to escape with an "R" rating for Closer as presented.  Should he have been given an "NC-17" he would have been forced to edit some of Owens's language and some of the scenes, notably from the strip club.  Although this film is not for children or teenagers, it is filmed in an honest and frank fashion, much of what Nichols is known for.  The frank sexuality is necessary to understand and to frame the characters' motivation.  The DVD version of this film, at least the only one that has been released at this time, uses Superbit technology, so the filming is beautifully portrayed, but none of the extras that would normally come with a DVD are present (and perhaps this was due to the rush to release it before the Academy Awards).  The film is shown in English and French, but there are no outtakes, no interviews with the players to understand how they got motivated into their characters (and this would have been fascinating, especially in the case of Portman), no Nichols interview, nothing to redeem the price of the DVD.<br /><br />One more amazing thing about the film, however, is the theme song "The Blower's Daughter" (the video is contained on the DVD) by Irish troubadour Damien Rice.  It is powerful and haunting, perhaps the best movie theme of the past several years.<br /><br />And thus, my recommendation is to rent, not buy, and only if you are looking for insight into filmmaking, or transformation of a play to a film, not if you would like to be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>It's always troubling to watch the games people play.  As much as you want to declare that these people just have problems and move on there is more than a healthy dose of reality.  For me Clive Owens and Natalie Portman stole the show and truely earned their Oscar nominations.  I expected more out of Roberts and pretty much felt Law was the same character we met in I heart Hucklebees and that Captain Tomorrow thingy.  The script was disturbingly brilliant and even manages to pull off a final surprise at the end.  Recommended but not to the faint at heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>As a previous reviewer said, "Closer is basically the ickiest, grossest, most dysfunctional parts of all your past relationships strung together into one movie."  Dysfunctional is the key word here, no one trusts each other, and temptations abound.  What a mess!  Clive Owens and Jude Law are good at playing manipulative jerks and showing us how they attempt to lie themselves out of various sticky situations.  The women in the film, appear to be more of the innocent victims, caught in this web of determinism.  For a look at Julia Roberts in a little bit different of a role, a more serious role, this may be worth it. I'm afraid guys will be gawking at Ms. Portman not for her brilliance, but her body in this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>First off, I want to say that this is definitely not a sappy romance.  This is about cheating, deception..a powerful story put onto film.  The acting in this movie was incredible.  I felt along with each one of the characters, one of the best performances on here has to be Clive Owen's, Natalie Portman has made an improvement since Garden State (which I didn't care for) I think this deserves that Golden Globe and those Academy Award nominations.  It's a solid film.  Worth a rental for sure, but I would just go buy it right away.  It's worth it.  I would rate this more like four and a half stars, but they won't allow that on here.  The only reason why is because there wasn't anything in the DVD extras, only a music video and previews.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Closer" is a brilliantly smart human drama that is powerful at the very end.

This is Mike Nichols' best film since "Primary Colors" (1998). It's beautiful, sad, and, at times, trustful. One of last year's best!</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>I wanted to see this in theatre from the moment I saw the trailer. The very idea of my favorite actress and my favorite up-and-comer was an irresistible combination. However, this usually means that I am setting myself up for failure or disappointment (expecting too much); so I waited anxiously for _Closer's_ release. I have to say first that I was terrified by the reviews and reports of people leaving the theater early and demanding their money back. However, now I that I have seen the movie, I can clearly say that those people either did not pay attention to the movie's subject before deciding to see it, or they left their brains at home that day. The film was excellent. Portman and Owen were brilliant and heartbreaking almost to the point that I would say they were robbed of the Oscars (Portman was, I have not seen MDB yet). Roberts and Law were very good as well, although their parts were not as likeable (on purpose, they were the "bad guys") or intricate as the other two. This is another classic example of how a good supporting cast can make a film, and one of the first films I have seen where it seems that the supporting characters were more important than the leading ones. Anyway, the storyline is simple: tragedy in love, but the ending does provide some absolution, for the likeable characters at least. But it is the acting that will be remembered, the heartbreak in Portman's face, and Julia's sad eyes always begging for an answer or a way out. Owen's forcible way of dealing with things, with simmers of hurt shinning through. If you look through the bad language and zooming narrative, this film will be a gift.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Half way through watching Mike Nichol's new film, Closer, I wondered why the straights were getting so hysterical about sexual infidelity; after all, what's the big deal about? Couldn't they have all worked out some sort of arrangement that kept all parties happy? Surely the four of them would have been a lot happier if they'd just accept that none of them were particularly happy with monogamy and moved on from there.  But of course, if this were the case, we probably wouldn't have a movie, and the four actors - who do a fine job - also wouldn't have had the opportunity to stretch their acting chops.  Closer portrays characters that are so embittered, and that have become so mired in sexual politics that their hurt is intense, and their life pain interminable.  Ultimately, the strength of the film lies not so much in the story - which at times borders on the farcical - but in the four excellent performances of the four leads - Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Julia Roberts.<br /><br />With the objective eye of a camera, the film focuses on the chance meeting of four disparate people as they meet by chance and swiftly proceed to launch into a series of unstable relationships, where the atmosphere becomes steadily toxic. Alice (a ravishing Natalie Portman) is a transplanted American and a stripper, who at the opening of the movie, is ambling along a crowded sidewalk. Walking toward her is Dan (Jude Law), a newspaper obituary writer with literary aspirations. Their eyes lock across an intersection, into which Alice steps. But she accidentally looks in the wrong direction and a taxicab knocks her down. Dan saves her and they soon become physically involved. The story then jumps to Dan's friendship with Anna (Julia Roberts), a rather cynical photographer. Anna is attracted to Dan but she has a chance meeting with Larry (a dynamic, sex obsessed Clive Owen) that leads to a deep emotional involvement.  But Anna loves Dan, and Dan loves Anna - Dan is also ambivalent about his relationship with Alice. The four who have collided by accident, are continually subverted by one another, and by their own feelings.<br /><br />The movie leaps across the months, and even years to bring the chronological study of their lives to the viewer, and often it is only a single line of dialogue which gives any indication of how much time has passed. Individual scenes are indeed thrilling in their unfettered, bracing, and constant venom. There's a wonderfully tense scene where Larry, full of pent-up hurt and sexual frustration, discovers Alice at his local strip club, and proceeds to verbally seduce her, and another scene involving a nasty spat when Larry finds out that Anna has been unfaithful - the scene is full of vitriolic and verbal raunchiness. This verbal intercourse is vigorous, compulsive, sometimes painful and occasionally funny.<br /><br />The actors are all terrific but the standout is Clive Owen's magnificent Neanderthal physicality, combined with his unadulteratingly and unrelenting hidden seediness. Natalie Portman shines, as a sexy, abused victim, who uses her feminine attributes to her advantage. Filmed against the grey, rain socked urban London winter; the movie is gorgeous to look at - the bleak weather being a metaphor for the isolation of the characters souls. The human animal is nothing but a craven, sex-obsessed, selfish creature, which unadulteratingly seeks to satisfy his own sexual, emotional, and spiritual desires, without regard for anyone else. There's no doubt that Closer is smart, adult, and sophisticated, but it lacks a lasting reverberation, and most viewers will probably be left wondering what the fuss was all about in the first place.

First, Mike Nichols continues to give us one fine movie after another-- from his first THE GRADUATE to his most recent ANGELS IN AMERICA. This film is no exception and is wonderfully filmed-- there are lots of closeups of the characters that we expect from Nichols and certainly appropriate here since the movie essentially is about four individuals who do an awful lot of talking-- when they aren't changing partners and bedrooms. The acting is superb: Julia Roberts as Anna, Jude Law as Dan, Nathalie Portman as Alice and Clive Owen as Larry give tremendous performances. These are beautiful people who are selfish and nasty to everyone they should care about most, i.e., their spouses and/or lovers.<br /><br />A friend of mine used to say that he didn't care for either fiction or movies if he couldn't like any of the characters. Using that criterion, this movie falls on its face. On the other hand, if you want to see people acting very badly and completely self-centered, then you'll find this movie to your liking.<br /><br />Alice says it all in a scene near the end of the movie when she finally kicks Dan out of her life, saying something to the effect that he didn't have to be cruel to her by being unfaithful and sleeping with Anna, that all of us should realize that there's a line we shouldn't cross in order to prevent hurting someone we love. With the possible exception of Anna, these people will do whatever it takes to get what they think they want and have no interest in staying within boundries.<br /><br />A dark, well acted, well directed movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Meet Dan (Law).  Dan is an aspiring auther who happens to bump into Alice (Portman) due to an accident.  Dan is smitten almost immediatly with this exsentric young lady (Portmans charactor reminds me a little of Winsletts charactor in ESoaSM).  Enter Anna (Roberts), a photographer who takes pictures of Dan for his novel...as you may have guessed (as did I) the time has passed years maybe and Dan and Alice are now an item and Dan has published his book.  Well, heres the problem.  Dan falls for Anna but she won't have him, you know, she won't bring herself to wreck what he has going on with Alice, but Dan is insistant.  In an attempt to exact his revenge on Anna, Dan goes to a sex-chat room and finds Larry (Owen), a sex hungrey Doctor with a few fetishes up his sleeve.  Well, Dad is under the ID of Anna and he describes himself to Larry and asks to meet him.  How Dan knew where Anna would be is beyond me, but by chance he was right and Larry meets Anna, and Larry likes Anna, and surprisingly Anna likes Larry and soon the two are engaged.  Now it's time for the fun to begin.  See now we have the affair that stirs up between Dan and Anna, the illicit afair that should have never happened.  The affair that tears apart a marriage and Dan's healthy (if you could call it that) relationship with a stripper (did I mention Alice was a stripper?  don't get your hopes up boys, no boobs).  Anyways, I have this to say...it's not the act of cheating on your partner that makes this whole movie so, how do I put this, demoralizing, because everybody knows that a lot of people cheat...it's the lack of compassion these people have for the ones they are hurting.  The way they talk to each other shows nothing but disgust for their supposed mate...the one they vowed to love forever.  As a married man I can honestly say that I could never talk to my wife the way these people communicate, but then again, I've never been in this sort of situation and I guess if my wife slept with some other man and told be she liked the taste of his seman better than mine I'd probably have a word or two to say to her as well, but other than that, lets be real here...These people seem to have no respect for themselves, but then again it's as if they really don't even know who they are...To tell you the truth I honestly thought this movie would be different, but thats not to say I didn't like it...I gave it four stars and thats mainly because it was so different than anything I've seen and it took a situation and made you look at it in a way I've never looked at it before...it really made you think...Believe me, there are no role models here, and despite how things end up it's really less than a happy ending...especially for Dan, but what the heck...I mean, he deserved it...Right?</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law, and Clive Owen star in this seductive and sometimes trashy thriller about lies, deceit, and hurting the one you love.  Roberts stars as Anna, a portrait photographer who takes pictures of strangers.  Portman stars as Alice, a stripper/waitress who has just arrived in London after a failed relationship.  Law stars as Dan, an obituary writer who has dreams of becoming a successful novelist, and Owen stars as Larry, a dermatologist who is addicted to internet chat rooms.<br /><br />Dan meets Alice after she's hit by a taxi.  He takes her to the hospital and, after a while, a relationship forms, and Dan has begun work on his novel.  However, Dan also becomes involved with Anna (unknown to Alice).<br /><br />Larry is drawn in by Dan, who is posing as a woman on one of the chat rooms that Larry frequents.  Dan explains that his name is Anna and she wants to meet him.  Larry is given directions to Anna's photography gallery, where, after a brief amount of explaining, Larry and Anna form a relationship of their own and wind up getting married.<br /><br />Eventually, all four become intertwined with each other in a deceitful web of lies and mistrust.<br /><br />The characters do an excellent job of portraying the kind of relationship one hopes they never have; one based on lies and mistruths.  If you can stand the overabundance of very foul language, then you should enjoy this film.  The acting, especially by Natalie Portman, is very good, and Portman's portrayal of Alice is the highlight of the movie.  You'll also learn what you shouldn't do in a relationship: lie and cheat on the one you care about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>What does this movie have? Great actors who perform their roles to the best of their ability. What does it lack? A compelling script. Therefore, the overall result is not good at all, because no matter how hard Portman, Roberts, Law and Owen try, there is nothing they can do with the dull and overly depressing script they have to work with.<br /><br />The story starts when Dan (Law) meets an extroverted New Yorker in London. Alice (Portman) used to work as a stripper in the Big Apple and ran away looking for a new start. A relationship starts building, but when Anna (Roberts), a professional photographer, crosses their path, things start to get complicated. And when Larry (Owen), a dermatologist, finds Anna as the result of a prank played on him, the four characters get entangled in a web of relationships that gets boring fast and drags the movie into a limbo, in which it remains until the end.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the only aspect of this movie I consider to be praiseworthy is the acting, but for someone that is looking to be entertained for a couple of hours that is not enough. I think Jude Law deserves to be recognized, especially after he was made the target of aggressive jokes at the Oscars, and in this case he shows once more his gifts for acting. It is a shame the script is so bad!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>We just watched this movie last night, and it caught us off guard. Without any preconceived notions, I was totally ready for the proverbial chick flick. Boy, was I wrong! "Closer" is the latest work by Mike Nichols, the Director of "The Graduate" and "Angels in America" among other great works. Past the first half of the movie, one name kept coming to my mind: David Cronenberg. Granted that the movie is not repulsive in a physical sense, emotionally speaking, it pushes you hard and far to the point of turning sensuality repulsive and making love look like one crazy game.<br /><br />Natalie Portman once more delivers, just like in "Garden State". Jude Law plays one sick game-playing guy. Clive Owen kills me with his lines, his brutal "honesty" and his "open" mind. Julia Roberts typically delivers an average performance, but when pushed by his co-stars' lines, she also explodes with magnificence. Overall not meant to cheer you up on a gloomy day, but nevertheless a well acted movie with a fairly convoluted and twisted plot.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen are all brilliant actors and Mike Nichols almost always directs films that last forever in their emotional depth.  (Check out his resume).  Patrick Marber wrote the original stage play and it almost makes me want to seek it out in its truest form, as this film brought out nothing in me other than cynicism and dismay.  In fact, the main emotional themes seem to be neurotic passion, heartbreak, sadness, anger, evil vengeance, pathetic pleading, deception, and honesty to the point of brutality.  Some may find this an interesting exploration of emotions mixed with complex personalities in confusing circumstances.  Some call this entertainment, but I think all involved could have done much better.  This is a very personal film and one that can only be interpreted by the viewer.  I found it very, very bleak.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though the movie sometimes suffers from too-quick jumps in time and the fact that the main characters are universally despicable, it is still worth watching due to the high caliber of the acting and writing.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>When you are involved with somebody, have you ever fantasised yourself being with other people?  Are you satisfied when you love somebody and that somebody love you back?  Do you yearn to have the feeling of love even when you know that both of you are living a pack of lies?  When the love is gone, do you let that other person go?  Isn't it that when you love somebody, you set them free?  Isn't love selfish, though?  When you can't have them or won't have them, do you intentionally wish to inflict hurt and emotionally scar to others?  Love is an intangible and subjective being.  It's not there and yet, it's there.  "Closer" is an autopsy (deliberately clinical in this instance) of love, loved, in and out of love.  Jude Law portrays a character, Dan that is a splitting image of his true self.  Can readers recall of him having a fling with his nanny when he was already engaged to Sienna Miller, and who he had a relationship with when he was not technically divorced from his first wife?  Talking about art imitates real life?  Then, there's Natalie Portman in her breaking or coming of age role as a stripper.  She does reveal a lot of flesh in this instance and I simply couldn't get over the fact that Princess Amidala was doing lap dance for Clive Owen!  Julia Roberts plays a photographer who captures portraits of sad and lonely people.  Perhaps, she sees her own self in their reflections and in this movie, she would bounce from one relationship to one another and back again because she doesn't wish to be hurt emotionally no more.  Clive's character as a dermatologist is the most lucid character here, brutally frank and honest or a straight shooter.  From outset, he might look like a brute but as the movie dwelves deeper, we start to understand that what you see is what you get from him.  To simplify the description here, ladies here in the form of Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman are those that have built fortress around themselves so that their emotions become unscathed from any relationships that didn't work out their ways, Jude Law is a conniving and selfish lover who interprets love as he pleases and guys that rationalise their doings as the right things to do when they leave a lot of casualties along the way and lastly, Clive is those men that are caught in the crossfire, someone who is realistic about relationship and someone that differentiates between love and lust and someone who is there to ensure the relationship he commits himself into works.  A very intelligent and well-made movie from a veteran Director.  Highly recommended.  Not much extra in DVD other than subtitle and the MTV of the theme song.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Closer," if nothing else, is a refreshing change for major movie releases in that it truly defies established formulas.  If your best friend said that there was a new movie about love and romance and it stars Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Jude Law (plus the rakishly handsome Clive Owen), you'd probably leap to the conclusion that a studio had tried to make "Love Actually II" or some other sappy romantic comedy.<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth.  In a movie that revolves intensely around the four leads as two couples who, shall we say, "interact," it's hard to find a likable chap or gal.  Selfishness and betrayal rule the day, along with graphic language about sex.  I'm not talking overly clinical language, I'm talking about the language of people who use sex as a means to establish dominance and superiority, not intimacy or even enjoyment.  Guilt and shame are at least as prevalent as love and affection, and truth may be the rarest commodity of all.<br /><br />Be warned -- this is not a feel-good movie in any way.  That's not to say that it's a "bad movie," of course.  My three-star rating stems from the fact that the movie spans a few years, yet the transitions between leaps forward and flashes back are confusing, and the characters generally talk like movie characters and not real people (listening to Jude Law explain his job as a writer of obituaries rings false, and I'm not sure a woman like Natalie Portman's character "Alice" has ever walked the earth).<br /><br />Still, if you're looking for a dark examination of the war between the sexes (and we are talking about war), and you've worn out your copy of "In the Company of Men," or you find "The War of the Roses" too cheery, this may be just the movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I read a review that referred to "Closer" as "Neil Labute lite." I don't think this comparison is fair at all. Labute's ("In The Company of Men", "Your Friends and Neighbors") films are populated by sadists, sociopaths, and disconnected doormats. The characteres in "Closer", although far from admirable, are, for the most part, fairly ordinary and easy to relate to. Which, in my opinion, makes their behavior all the more captivating and unsettling.<br /><br />The film begins when obituary writer Dan (Jude Law) meets and falls for stripper Alice (Natalie Portman). What starts out as a tender romance gets complicated when Dan gets his picture taken for his novel (ironally based on Alice's life) and feels an instant attraction to photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). Although attracted, Anna resists his advances at first, and ends up involved with dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen), who Dan inadvertantly introduces Anna to. However, after a while, Anna gives into her feelings for Dan, and the result is that the four characters end up in a subtle yet dirty power struggle to preserve their relationships and pride.<br /><br />Filled with scathing, sharp dialogue, and intense, difficult emotional exchanges, "Closer" explores the mix of tenderness, attraction, jealousy, power, competition and need that make up modern romantic and sexual relationships. Mike Nichols' direction is seamless, letting his four talented (and beautiful) leads flesh out their characters wonderfully. Natalie Portman is particularly excellent (her strip-club powerplay scene with Clive Owen is my favorite scene in the film) avoiding all the cliches and creating a character who is both innocent and jaded, manipulative and naive. "Closer" may be my favorite film of the year. Bravo.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>CLOSER has entered that rarefied atmosphere of those films being considered that finest of 2004.  From the extraordinary writing by Patrick Marber (based on his own play by the same name) to the impeccable direction by Mike Nichols tot he fine ensemble acting by Jude Law, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts, this film is a brilliant multifaceted jewel.<br /><br />CLOSER (as is so often the case in the English language) as a word can have two meanings: 'closer' as in moving toward, and 'Closer' as in the final word in a conversation or deed. For this reviewer I see the latter as the true meaning of the title of this intriguing story of passion, drama, love, and abandonment among two couples - no, four disparate and desperate people.  Serendipity plays a major role in the way these people meet, react with passion, respond, mate, break up, rejoin, and search for the meaning of love in a time when the blur between sex and love has polarized our understanding of relationships.<br /><br />Each of the four actors in this turbulent tale gives outstanding  performances and it would be difficult to assign the 'best actor' among them.  But more important than their individual achievements is the utter commitment to ensemble acting that Nichols demands and gets. The cinematography is mesmerizing and the music scoring not only introduces a fine signature song that opens and closes the film, but also the movie uses Mozart's "Cosi van tutte" as the ongoing background music.  Those familiar with the parallel story of the opera with the film will appreciate the subtleties even more, but the radiant singing by Renee Fleming and Anne Sophie von Otter suffuses this film with a special glow.  Highly recommended on every level.<br /><br />Grady Harp</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>Based on the original play by Patrick Marber, Mike Nichols delivers an interesting adaptation which only flaw seems to be that play like feeling in some parts of the movie.  `Closer' tells the story of four people whose lives get connected to one another's in the most dysfunctional ways.<br /><br />I had never seen a movie about relationships that portrayed so realistically all the ups and downs. The movie opens with Dan and Alice meeting and falling in love in a quite traditional and romantic way, with the beautiful `Blower's daughter' in the background. Going from there we get to see a story of betrayal and a well earned lack of trust in the relationships of these four characters. I won't give away the plot like many other reviewers already did, but these characters are lovable even when they have no respect for anything, even when they break the hearts of the ones that love them.<br /><br />The approach to relationships in this story is crude and erotic, there are situations in which the dialogues will just blow you away, and these moments are mostly because of the well chosen cast and a very good direction. Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen and even Julia Roberts deliver some  moments that are sometimes hard to digest and/or believe, the discussions and the openness of the things they say one another are great contributions to the story.<br /><br />Like said before, the only apparent flaw this movie has is the use of the timeframes, one moment you are watching a regular sequence and in the next cut a year has passed already, with no explanation at all, you will have to guess based on the situations and the subtle changes perceived (forget about titles saying `One year later', there's nothing of that here) This situation can make it difficult to some people to watch and understand completely the film. Other than that, the direction, photography and performance of the cast are breathtaking.<br /><br />The movie has no extras at all (I do not consider previews for other films as extras, hope you agree) besides Damien Rice's music video for `The Blower's daughter', which will be enough for fans of the film. The sound comes in a decent Dolby Digital 5.1 audio and is presented in tis original widescreen format.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>My friends all told me this was a very depressing film about people that go out of their way to harm the ones they love. Given that the cast was starry and the script was intelligent, how could everyone be so wrong about this comedy hidden behind an incredibly handsome script?<br /><br />This is, indeed, a comedy. The ridiculous situations these people put themselves in had me laughing out loud over and over again. Julia Roberts was so funny as a vitimized victim -- the victim of her own foolishness -- that it was humorous.<br /><br />Jude Law, who starts out the one with the best handle on everything, that gets both women he wants, then ends up being the one most humiliated by a guy named Larry (Clive Owen) (being named Larry, I know what kind of roles are handed out to people named that) that it is, in the end, the pinnacle of comic irony.<br /><br />I think it would be easier to accept this film on face value if the four people involved were regular people. Since instead they are a writer, artist/photographer, stripper and doctor, I think you have to accept that these are not really people; they are actors playing out thinly veiled Hollywood cliches doing things handed to them from a script.<br /><br />The relationship to real life is negligible, at best, since their actions are the equivalent of my 20-year-old college girlfriend who regularly had more than one boyfriend. They are not the actions of mature 35-year-olds, which describe three of the participants.<br /><br />As comedy with irony interwoven, I think this film is successful in its display of human nature. But as a movie about dysfunctional relationships it is less successful that many smaller films and closer to being ordinary. Thankfully, at least one person saw the humor in this arrangement.<br /><br />This film most reminded me of Mike Nichols' now 40-year-old masterpiece, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf", another blockbuster about a pair of dysfunctional couples. Only that movie was played straight. This one, like "The Graduate", was played for laughs about the human condition.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>"Closer" is a dramatic film, written and based on the play of the same name by Patrick Marber. I kept getting recommended it on amazon.com, so I decided to see it on DVD. I didn't know what to think of it before I saw it, and I still don't know what to think of it.<br /><br />Set in London, we see Dan (Jude Law), a wannabe novelist whose life soon becomes tangled up in Alice's (Natalie Portman), a waitress and former stripper. Dan falls in love with her, but also with Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer he uses for his author cover photo. But Dan doesn't stop there, he brings Larry (Clive Owen) into things when he bumps into him in an adult chat room pretending to be Anna, who he sets up with her. Lies are told, everyone falls in love with everyone else, more lies are told, everyone cheats on everyone else and time passes. That's pretty much it.<br /><br />Even before I knew "Closer" had once been a play, I could tell that it had been meant for theatre. The dialogue has that stilted, scripted vibe, and you can tell that not much has changed in the adaption scriptwise. Still, the characters are very strong, and the way they interact with each other is probably my favorite part of the film. It's well casted, but then again, if Jude Law's in it I usually like it anyway.<br /><br />The character interaction, though really strong and interesting, is about the only thing I liked about this film. All the smut, the sex, the lying, the cheating, the swearing, the strip clubs and the upper middle class banter I didn't find very entertaining at all. Also, the characters are so flawed that they're almost beyond sympathy. Sure, thinking about it I can feel sorry for Alice, because she's younger than all the rest and probably didn't know any better, but the rest...<br /><br />Whenever I see a film or play like this, rather serious exploring man's faults to a fault, I kind of wonder what the point is. Liars and unfaithful partners exist, yes, but when they and there motives are so meticulously explored liked this, it almost, almost seems like a celebration of these faults rather than a warning or something similar. When Jude Law's character pretends to be a woman in the adult chat room, for example, its played as if it was meant to be funny.<br /><br />There's a scene in the film where two of the main characters, Alice and Larry, are discussing art. They begin discussing the photography exhibition, and neither of them like it very much. Every person whose picture has been taken looks sad, jaded or depressed, but has been made to look beautiful. Alice says, they are made to look beautiful through art, but they are still sad and depressing. Who are these people, she says, who would pay to go see them? In some ways, I feel the same about this film. Great, great character interaction, but that's about it, the rest is a bit depressing for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Loved this movie. I loved it cynisism and down right nasty look at love and relationships. Perhaps this is because I am a bitter [nasty] but everything in it rang true to me. It is the story of 4 people who meet become involved and then tear it all up and cheat and then go thru all the mechinations of covering up, breaking up, being supposedly happy till they find something or someone else and then go thru the whole cycle again. I am not a big Julia Roberts fan but she was good in this. Clive Owen was just excellent as the brutish but likable macho guy. The internet chat/cyber sex scene was hilarious as was the Roberts/Owen break up that just was biting and hardcore down in the dirt dialogue. The whole movie is full of great hardass dialogue that I just thought was hilarious.<br /><br />Also, Natalie Portman as a stripper and in a thong.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Not since Little Black Book has there been a movie where I dont like any character. Closer is a strong movie, will harsh, sexual words, and great performances from everyone.

This movie argues that it's ever so much better to lie.  A step further:  pursuit of honesty will destroy the fragile balance created by love.<br /><br />And yet "true love" cannot exist in a framework of deception.<br /><br />The scenarios in this movie are such that the only possible payoff for honesty is destruction.  If we care about people, we'll lie to them to make them feel better and never ask for complete honesty, because it's too cruel.<br /><br />Mike Nichols has loved these thematics for a long time - take a look at "Carnal Knowledge," among other films of his, for some clues.  He must have loved it when he first read this play.<br /><br />If, when we fall in love, we fall in love with our own reflection, we fall in love with a lie.  Like the poem, "I love you not for who you are, but for who I am when I am with you."  Romance.<br /><br />It's hard to watch this movie, indeed.  That would be endurable, though, if there was something to learn.  So, I guess by its absence, the learning is this:<br /><br />Love someone, and don't ask questions.  Give of yourself freely and expect nothing back.  If they feel a compelling need to confess something, listen with an attitude of complete, unconditional forgiveness.  And, for God's sake, forgive.<br /><br />If you forget these things, watch this movie again and repeat as necessary.</p></br><a href="../users/A39VJRIW7HC5C0.html">A39VJRIW7HC5C0</a><br/><p>After watching this film I was in a state of ambivalence the likes of which I had not seen in a long time.  Closer featured four actors at the top of their game, wonderful dialogue, a fairly downbeat ending (I rather like downbeat endings- they're so much more powerful than light and happy ones), some very amusing scenes, and a very novel approach to a relationship movie.  However, I did not like the film's structure, feeling that by flashing forward over so many months a lot was left off the table.  While I recognize that this tactic could be seen by some as adding to the narrative instead of detracting from it, I felt it was far more of a hindrance than a help.  Nonetheless, it was not the jumpy trajectory that really got to me, it was the fact that each one of the four main characters was a truly miserable person.  Although the characters start out as relative innocents, in a few scenes all of them have become in turn vapid, power-crazed, masochistic, obsessive, foul, cheating, and low.  At the end all four are despicable and not worthy of the audience's time.  Now this could still be a compelling picture and to some degree it is, but the movie is not really about their plummet to deplorability (indeed some of the characters begin that trip in the second sequence).  Instead of judging its characters the movie merely observes their interactions, and herein lies my principle complaint.  Was Closer boring?  No, not at all.  Was it involving, well-acted and well-directed?  Yes, absolutely.  Was it an enjoyable film? No, it was not, hence my two and a half star (out of four) rating.  If Amazon allowed me to give 3.5's this would have earned one, but I cannot award give Closer 4 stars in all good conscience.  **1/2</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>Once again, Mike Nichols shows us just how clever he is. I don't agree that this is his best film in years - let's not forget Primary Colors, Birdcage, and the heavenly brilliant Angels in America (ignore Wolf and What Planet Are You From), but it certainly is a return to his roots, and definitely his most serious and straightforward film in many years, probably since Carnal Knowledge. It shares, in fact, many of the themes and qualities of Carnal Knowledge (as well as other early classics like the Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf) - Like that film, its scale is very small in place and very large in time, following a small group of characters over long time gaps; likewise, we only catch glimpses of their lives, and get most of the information on important events from the characters themselves. Like Carnal Knowledge, Closer focuses on inter-relations between the four main characters, betrayal, mistrust and insincerity. Closer is bleaker, though. It's probably the bleakest thing Nichols had done. It's a downer that doesn't seem extremely special and original as you watch it, but it sticks with you. After all, that's an important mark of a good film.<br /><br />As for the acting, now: despite my patriotic support of Natalie Portman (her being originally from Israel) and my undying love for her ever since I saw her as a child in Leon, she didn't really impress me in Closer. She tries to be sexy and mysterious, but she's still just a sweet girl, and she doesn't truly convince. Julia Roberts had always gotten on my nerves, and Closer is no exception. The male actors are the ones who really outdo themselves here; Jude Law and Clive Owen are both fantastic, obnoxious and pathetic at the same time as only a real man can be. You despise them and you pity them and you understand them. You are them. These are two great young actors who have a bright future ahead of them.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Mike Nichols never did write his own texts. All of his films were written by other people, and like Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and Angels in America, Closer is also an adapted play. Yet he has a fascinating way of making the texts his own. The dialogues in Closer are well-written, no doubt; but just like in his previous films, it's his brilliant dialogue directing with which Nichols leaves his distinct mark and which makes it convincing, amusing and unnerving all at once. Nichols may not have a vision like Kubrick, Coppola or Scorsese, but he does what he does the best anyone could.<br /><br />Closer is not an essential, and it's not one of the best films of the year. It's well worth a watch though, especially if you're a Mike Nichols fan or if you enjoy human relations melodramas. Not great, but very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>Closer is amazing!  I was hooked from the start of the movie until the end.  I loved the distrust and the plot that "what you have you don't want but as soon as you don't have it you want it"; as I think we are all victims of that life.  Granted most are not this distrustful.  But, if it was not happening around us do you think we would have talk shows and all these divorces if this movie was not close to reality.<br /><br />You see Alice/Jane (Portman)  walking in a crowd of people and Dan (Law) walking towards her Alice crosses the street and ends up getting hit by a car.  Dan takes her to the hospital and they fall in love.  Law must leave his girlfriend for Alice because she asks if he has a girlfriend and he says yes.  So then we flash forward and Dan is getting his picture taken by Anna (Roberts) and he is interested in her...They kiss and  this is the start of a romance between the two of them.  Alice sees that Dan has a "look" in his eyes when he comes to meet her downstairs of the apartment he was getting his picture taken in.  She then goes upstairs with her and listens in on the conversation that Dan and Anna have.  Anna tells him no she will not see him.  So Dan goes on websites that promote sex and uses Anna's name and tells people to meet her at the Aquarium.  Larry (Owen) shows up because of this and they end up falling in love and calling Dan "Cupid".  Anna has a picture of Alice at her show so they go and Dan begs Anna to be with him.  We flash again and you find that Larry and Anna are married and come to find out Larry cheats on Anna and Anna is cheating on him WITH DAN and that Dan was leaving Alice to get with Anna and she leaving Larry to be with Dan.  After Dan and Anna are together she goes back to Larry to get him to sign the divorce papers she gets him to only by sleeping with him.  Starting a new spiral now Dan is upset that Anna would cheat on him.  And Dan goes back to Larry who goes to Alice and starts another spiral.  You will have to watch the end to find out who ends up with who and who ends up alone.<br /><br />Over-all all the  waiting I had to do for this movie was worth it!  I also love the Daminen Rice song!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Based on the stage play by Patrick Marber, Mike Nichols' "Closer" is a generally uncompromising look at that great big messy thing we call love.  The movie views romance as a kind of high stakes parlor game in which men and women jockey for positions of power, use sex and deception as weapons to annihilate their opponents or get what they want, and wind up settling for safety over passion when it's time to get on with their lives.  "Closer" also acknowledges the sad truth that, when it comes to love, we tend to want what we do not have, then lose interest once the desired object is attained.<br /><br />Marber has written a complex screenplay centered around four major characters.  Dan is an unsuccessful novelist who meets and falls in love with Alice, a young American living in London.  Julia Roberts plays a professional photographer named Anna, another American transplant, who has her first encounter with Dan when he comes to her studio to have some portraits taken of him.  A mutual attraction develops between the two of them despite Dan's purported love for Alice.  The fourth main character is a doctor named Larry who meets Anna and falls in love with her even though Anna's real obsession seems to be Dan.<br /><br />For the next couple of years, the relationships between these four characters undergo tremendous transformations, forming and re-forming, grouping and re-grouping, until even the individuals involved no longer know what they feel or who they want.  All they know is that happiness always seems to be vaguely out of reach because the person each of them is involved with has either moved on to someone else or has lost interest in the relationship.  The film often condenses time by leapfrogging over months and years between major scenes without a great deal of transition, forcing us to pay rapt attention at all points throughout the movie.<br /><br />Since "Closer" is derived from a stage play, it's not always successful at hiding its theatrical roots.  Sometimes that's a good thing as when the movie achieves a sealed-off, claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the personal drama.  Like a lot of stage writing, the dialogue is often literate, sharp and insightful, but, towards the end, it occasionally feels a bit too clever and artificial for its own good.  Once the characters start articulating the "great truths" of their lives, they lose authenticity and become mouthpieces for the author.  And after about an hour of watching them sabotage their own happiness and listening to them whine about their lives, your patience and empathy may begin to run a bit thin, undercutting some of the positive feelings you've developed towards the movie in the first half.<br /><br />In terms of the acting, three of the four leads - Law, Roberts and Natalie Portman - all deliver strong, subtle performances, but Clive Owen hits too many false notes, especially when he is called upon to emote to any great extent.  Still, the others draw us into their insulated little world of drama and woe just enough to make us interested in what's taking place in their lives and damn thankful we aren't a part of it.<br /><br />If for nothing else, "Closer" deserves plaudits for a clever, dead-on, hilarious and brilliantly sustained comic sequence involving internet cyber sex.  That alone is worth the price of a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Closer is one of those films you have to prepare yourself for. Anyone who's seen a play that's been adapted to film will know that there's not a heckuva lot of action (this one being Patrick Marber's excellent Broadway play). But you can get some excellent dialogue and great character studies.<br /><br />Meet four screwed-up but beautiful people: Alice (Natalie Portman), an American stripper just arrived in London who gets bumped by a car; Dan (Jude Law), an obituary columnist for a local newspaper; Anna (Julia Roberts), a professional photographer who's recently divorced; and Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist with serious sexual issues.<br /><br />When Dan sees Alice hit by the car, he rushes to her aid and helps her to the hospital, where she's treated and released. But a strange relationship develops as the two banter back and forth with some snappy dialogue and incisive glances. Dan also knows Anna, the photographer, and is "in love" with her and tries to get her into a relationship. But when she refuses (initially) Dan and Alice move in together. But he's not through with Anna. Dan pretends to be her during an on-line chat session with Larry, the dermatologist, and asks to meet him at the London Aquarium, where Dan knows Anna visits and shoots film often. Thus, Larry makes an a$$ of himself when he first meets Anna, but they soon are entwined in a relationship, too.<br /><br />About a year later, because of Dan's persistence, Anna relents and forms a relationship with him, even though she's now married to Larry. And Larry is a bit taken with Alice (the stripper), too. Sound convoluted? It is, but it's also terribly insightful into the lives of human beings.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />As I stated at the beginning of this review, the movie-watcher needs to be prepared for a film like this before sitting down with it. It's not fast-paced or action driven. It's ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. The awful and wonderful things we do to each other isn't candy-coated, and the language is brusque and often pornographic.<br /><br />There are also some nice little secrets about the characters that seep into the film and add a titillating surprise for those who watch CLOSER than most (for instance, check out "Alice's" passport toward the end of the film as she re-enters the United States).<br /><br />Be warned, though, this film isn't for everyone. Children and preteens should NOT watch it. Those who don't care for the vulgarities of sex-talk should also avoid it. But if you enjoy intense characters doing profound things to each other, you'll undoubtedly delight in this little flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>A relationship commences the instant two individuals meet.  Eye contact leads to conversation which builds a connection between the people involved in the mutual communication.  This moment of communication is occasionally emotionally loaded where the involved begin to explore each other's compatibilities.  If there is a mutual harmony the conversation usually progresses.  However, communication is not the only thing needed for a romantic relationship, as the possibility of physical closeness where an opportunity of sharing thoughts, feelings, and secrets brings about a bond of trust.  Trust is what unites people, as they let the other closer into themselves with the intention of mutual expectation of protection and nurturing love.  Some have much difficulty building this trust as it can take years after a painful memory when their trust once was broken.  Closer brings the audience the moment where trust begins and ends in a visual dissection of human emotions where pain, suffering, love, trust, and much more are explored.<br /><br />Closer offers a Bergmanesque experience which dives deep into the psyche of the four main characters of the story.  Through the four characters the audience is allowed into a secret and personal world, a world most can identify through self scrutiny.  In a sense, Closer comes closer to the audience, as the mirror of our thoughts and feelings creeps slowly closer until we can feel the cold reflective surface pressing against our noses.  Yet, it is also distinctively unique as the situation, location, and the words that are said are strange and unfamiliar to the audience, as the viewers bring their own notions, experiences, values, and morals to the viewing of the film.  Nonetheless, the director Mike Nichols, with the help of the four talented actors in the film, brings the audience a long painful lesson of how people are getting closer to one another.<br /><br />The story opens in London with Dan (Jude Law) taking his morning stroll to work, as he does everyday, when he stumbles across a refreshing sight in the American girl Alice (Natalie Portman).  Alice is accidentally hit by a car which brings them closer for the moment, as their closeness to one another continues through Dan's nurturing care for Alice's injury.  Initially they study each other visually, through words, and touch, as they begin to build an emotional bond through humor and personal thoughts.  This is the beginning of a romantic relationship that brings them close, but it does not eliminate a tiny space between them as Dan never truly gives himself to Alice.  It appears as if Dan is looking for something else, yet he is not really sure what it is he is looking for, but he seems to be looking for something better.  Yet, Dan remains within the relationship, maybe out of convenience and because he does not want to hurt Alice.  The mental absence of Dan creates an emotional distance between them, which Alice feels strongly as she senses a looming pain being sent her way at any moment through Dan leaving her.<br /><br />Through a couple of years of living together Dan has reached more success as a writer, maybe with the emotional support of Alice, and he is to take a picture for his upcoming book.  Taking the picture is a stunning American, Anna (Julia Roberts), who tells Dan that she liked his book, as he notices portraits around in the photo studio that catch his eye.  This begins an infatuation between Anna and Dan.  It seems as if Dan seeks someone equally successful that can provide additional emotional support to elevate his career.  In a sense, Dan seems to be an emotional opportunist that craves affection, yet he is incapable of fully providing for others who need it as much.<br /><br />On the internet, in a chat room, Dan pretends to be Anna where he meets Larry (Clive Owen), a medical doctor, as they preoccupy themselves with cybersex.  Eventually, this chatting leads to them planning a rendezvous at the city aquarium, as Dan has learned that Anna likes to find people there to take their portrait.  Larry who is all excited about the planned meeting finds himself in a somewhat awkward situation, as he realizes that he has been set up.  Nonetheless, Anna and Larry seem to find each other, as they begin to date through Dan's little prank which turns him into cupid.<br /><br />The film continues to explore more of the four characters personal psychology, and what drives them to do what they are doing.  Nichols cleverly depicts how they get closer through terrific visuals and a well-written script, which balances the brilliant performances of the small cast.  The visuals bring out their unique personalities through delicately balanced contrasts, warm and cold lighting, and mise-en-scene that offers both closeness and distance.  These visual elements enhance the emotionally painful moments where the cast must bring out the best of themselves in order to make it feel authentic, which they do to perfection.  This makes the lines sound vibrant and alive while hurtful and loving words are exchanged in the privacy of the characters.  At last, the film offers a poignantly brilliant cinematic experience that tears the soul and rips the heart while they all are trying to find a way to get closer to one another.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>It may look like it on the cover, but not!!!, I watched this & could not help but wonder if Natalie Portman & Julia Roberts were smoking crack when they signed on for this, this film is about four people(Jude Law & Clive Owen, being the other two) who get together with one another, & break up with one another, none of them are very likable, in fact, all four are downright distasteful, the dialogue is outrageous, I thought for minute I might have been watching a porn movie, Owen & Roberts, who are very talented utter some extreme dialogue, that you can't actually believe they are saying it, only in a porn film do you here this kind of talk, not that it offended me, but surprised me is more like it, Portman even gets raunchy toward the end, you can't help but wonder if all four should get together at once & get it over with,  I found it very hard to watch, but did see it till the end, & yet the ending is confusing, If you want to see Portman, Roberts, Owen, & Law in somthing different & distasteful, this is your movie!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>On the back of the Closer DVD jacket, there's a quote from Time saying "at last, a love story for adults."  Obviously, Time watched the wrong movie because if there is one thing this movie is definitely not about, it's love.  These four characters are among the most amoral, dysfunctional human beings (and I use the term lightly) I've ever encountered.  The sad thing is that there are probably some people out there who act just like them.  This is a truly uncomfortable film to watch; it's crude, lewd, and dripping with misery from start to finish.  And the director, not satisfied at merely making you ashamed to be a human being, throws in a bonus in the form of something I found completely inexplicable at the very end.<br /><br />I don't know why Jude Law keeps playing pitiful losers, but he's certainly quite good at it.  The character of Dan comes right from the very bottom of the barrel.  He's a would-be novelist who seemingly falls crazy in love with Alice (Natalie Portman) after his very presence makes her walk out in front of a moving car.  Ah, this is Fate doing its thing, you think - until he puts the moves on Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer he has just met.  Anna rebuffs his advances - sort of, and Dan gets back at her by playing a moronic (not to mention filthy) joke, which, strangely enough, brings a perverted dermatologist named Larry (Clive Owen) into her life.  Dan still lusts after Anna, even after she's married Owen, and eventually Anna and Dan fall in mutual lust and break up both couples.  This is not to say that Alice and Owen are innocent, as they engage in all kinds of perversions of their own.  To its credit, the movie doesn't exactly let everyone live happily ever after - which is good because none of these characters deserves one moment of happiness.<br /><br />The film is somewhat strange in that major shifts in the relationships take place off-screen; we're going along one path, and then all of a sudden we're told that we've actually been going the other direction for months and months.  The interrelationships of these four people shift more often than the plates around the San Andreas Fault - with most of the action taking place beneath the surface.  The results are emotional earthquakes that leave everything dirty and unsettled, with no solid ground upon which to build anew.  The emotional wreckage of these people's lives is not a pretty sight by any stretch of the imagination.  The acting in the film is top-notch, but the story makes Closer quite a miserable, disturbing thing to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>While some films really get stronger and stronger with each viewing, I can't say that that is the case with `Closer'.  When I first saw the film I was totally ravaged by it and swore it a near-perfect masterpiece.  It just really spoke to me, with its blunt and harsh depictions of the realities of relationships.  The performances just wowed me in every sense of the word because I felt that bitterness and that anger and that passion.<br /><br />Then I saw it again...and again.<br /><br />As time goes by and this film turns over again and again in my head I begin to see flaws I didn't notice on the outset.  Especially when you compare this with the similarly themed yet drastically different `We Don't Live Here Anymore' (which was released the same year), `Closer' begins to feel stagnant.<br /><br />I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />The films premise is rather simple.  Dan is a flirtatious and charming man dating Alice, a stripper who is trying to feel a part of herself that has been missing for a long time.  Dan is attempting to become a novelist.  He meets and instantly falls for Anna, a photographer, but she isn't interested in a relationship that isn't exclusive.  So, in an attempt to seek revenge, Dan ends up sending Larry (a dermatologist) after Anna, only to have his plan backfire when the two end up hitting it off.<br /><br />Oh the twisted web we weave.<br /><br />`Closer' is never tame, and it never holds back from completely wiping our faces in the dirt that has become of their relationships ("he tastes like you, only sweeter" is still my favorite line from any movie in the past decade), but I think that in all its brave audacity one finds its biggest flaw.  `Closer' feels rather one-note.  There is no real variation of emotional complexity.  This is just a very evil film.  The performances, while seemingly powerful on the outset, lack any real longevity for me because they simply don't carry with them the range of emotion needed to make that long lasting impression.  All four actors put in some amazing work, but it's the characters that don't feel complete and so their performances don't have that well-rounded quality to them.  They are all very good at being angry and destructive.<br /><br />But, there is always Natalie Portman.  Say what you will about her lack of talent (the girl really has put in some `stinky' work during her career) but between this and `Cold Mountain', she proved that she has a lot of potential.  Maybe it was being given the only character that seemingly comes full-circle, but when all is said and done, it is Alice that I remember most of all.  While Clive Owen and Julia Roberts (Roberts is also remarkable astute in her performance and really elevates her characters lack of a real arc) may have the most volatile and explosive and memorable scenes in the film, it is Alice as a character (and thus Portman as an actress) that we will remember most, because her presence is so haunting.<br /><br />I still get shivers whenever I hear `Blowers Daughter'.<br /><br />In the end I still feel that `Closer' is a very good film, it just lacks that extra layer in order to achieve brilliance.  It comes on very strong, and so you initial reaction can be very deceiving (this is brash, this is brave, this is crushing; it must be marvelous!), but over time its lack of real emotional depth leaves it feeling rather shallow.  I highly recommend `We Don't Live Here Anymore' over this film, but as you can see, a B grade (which is what I am giving this film) is still very worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It is unlikely I have seen a more misogynistic film since Neil LaBute's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767806786">In the Company of Men</a>, but director Mike Nichols uses his uncanny ability to delve deep into the human condition to come up with a challenging, superbly acted and at times surprisingly empathetic film about four self-absorbed, unsympathetic people. I'm not sure what other director could have been better qualified to translate Patrick Marber's stinging, cynical play set in an urban chic London. As he has proven from his 1966 debut, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I2JDEY">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a> through 1971's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K0DP">Carnal Knowledge</a> to 2003's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001I2BUI">Angels in America</a>, Nichols knows how to humanize the brutality and emotional pain that people can inflict on each other. This master filmmaker's skill is what prevents this 2004 drama from shriveling up into a wearing exercise in manipulation and deceit.<br /><br />Writing the screenplay from his own play, Marber provides dialogue that is alternately sharp, observant and harshly erotic. At times, his acerbic work reminds me of Frederic Raphael's superb 1960's screenplays for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CNY4S">Darling</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04MO">Two for the Road</a>. The story that brings the four characters into a sexual intersection of t?te-&agrave;-t?tes and one-upmanship does get rather convoluted. The film covers about four years in elapsed time but takes liberties with scene transitions, focusing on the beginnings and endings of relationships and consequently complicating the chronology and timing of events, sometimes unnecessarily. Suffice it to say that each character figures out his or her capacity for hurting someone else and then goes about feeling empowered, guilty or some combination of both. It is telling that there are hints and often threats of physical abuse in the dialogue, but nothing is executed until a final, defining slap, filmed in slow motion, of course.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly strong, though I believe the "beautiful people" aspect of the casting does distance the actors from the audience, perhaps intentionally. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but she surprises as Anna, the photographer who becomes the focal point of a shark-infested triangle. Looking rather sallow and absurdly thin, Roberts doesn't come across as all that attractive here, but her sullen demeanor seems to free her from the contrivances Hollywood has offered her for the previous fifteen years. It seems inevitable that she is now playing the older woman archetype now, and she accepts her fate with a seasoned truthfulness that propels the rest of the characters. That she gives the weakest performance among this quartet is a tribute to the high caliber of the talent involved. At first, Jude Law plays Dan, the ethically challenged writer who fails as a novelist, as a hopeless romantic, but what he gradually uncovers is a tormented soul weakening under the burden of his deceptions. It's a brave performance especially since his character is the one most willing to hurt the others deeply for his own selfish motives.<br /><br />As Larry, the equally manipulative and sexually insecure dermatologist, Clive Owen sinks his teeth into a role that makes the most of his swarthy onscreen persona. His emotional nakedness and bull-in-a-china-shop approach to his problems make a brutishly affecting counterpoint to Law's rather effete character. In her adult breakthrough, Natalie Portman is alternately vulnerable and bruising as Alice, the stripper who falls hard for Dan and won't give Larry the intimacy he needs when he is rejected by Anna. She tantalizes with her flighty sexuality and then grounds her character deeply when she is subject to an excruciating break-up from Dan. Her character's evolution, however sketchily it is presented, is the only one that achieves a poignancy that nearly transcends the story's cynicism. I have to admit the unrelenting tone does induce a numbing effect that makes you wonder why you should care about the fate of any of the characters. But leave it to Nichols to make you want to know what happens to each of them. The only significant extra in the 2005 DVD is a music video of Damien Rice's haunting "The Blower's Daughter", which is used effectively as a musical bridge for their comings and goings. Highly recommended though don't expect to feel life-affirmed afterward.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Upon first viewing of this film, I wasn't a huge believer.  I thought that Clive Owen deserved every accolade that was handed to him.  His performance was breathtaking and so full of life that his character was the one to watch for when each scene began.  He epitomized the level of good guy and bad guy all into one.  So, I was happy with his performance.  I was excited to see him playing well with others, but was this a great film?  At first, as I said before, I didn't think so, but then I thought about it.  This is one of those films that requires you to take a breath and think about the effects long after the final credits have finished rolling.  It takes your current relationship and places it right before your eyes.  This film will speak to anyone that has been in a relationship or is currently in one.  After watching it, you will think about your relationship and the horror will settle in.  This film will speak to you, it did me, and it really put into perspective the world of dating and relationships in this modern culture.  Nichols has crafted a masterpiece, and while it may not be appreciated as much now, it will remain in our society for a very long time.<br /><br />I have spoken briefly about the acting, but I would like to say that without a decent crew, this film could not have been as emotional as it was.  Julia Roberts turns in a performance that is very unlike her and will disappoint those who are die-hard fans, Natalie Portman proves that she is more than just Star Wars material, and Clive Owen ... Oh, Mr. Owen ... there could be nobody greater.  He controls this film and really takes his career into a new level.  I am not ashamed to say this, but I am a huge Clive Owen fan.  He does not disappoint in this film.  Then there is the snivelly Jude Law.  I must say, his performance in this film was the least impressive.  He somehow finds himself falling into very similar roles in each film that he picks up.  If you have seen Alfie, then you have seen a bit of him in Closer and vise versa.  He just isn't as great as he was when he first burst onto the cinematic scene.  Perhaps it is because he is wearing thin and cannot create fresh characters ... I dunno ... but whatever it is, he did not provide anything worth-wile to this film.<br /><br />So, with the acting strongly in place (sans Law), Nichols tips off the iceberg with some unprecedented cinematography that allows strong storytelling to take place.  One of the biggest elements to this film that captured my attention was Nichols ability to allow time to pass with the greatest of ease.  I thought at first that this film was going to happen within the course of a couple of days, but he builds a sense of a strong relationship by allowing it to pass over the course of several years.  You really get this feeling that these characters are together for a certain period of time and that development is occurring.  I never felt as if something suddenly happened, over the course of four years these acts of the heart take a form of their own through the watchful eye of Nichols.  It impressed me.  Also, Nichols' use of bold white coloring not only expressed the light of relationships, but also brought out the brilliance of each scene.  You became focused on certain elements, the purity of the heart, and so forth.  It was cinematic history in the making.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that this film was nothing of what I expected.  Natalie Portman's final scenes were riveting and really brought the rest of this film together.  Scenes in this film happened for a reason instead of just a chance to impress the audiences.  It was a delight to finally see a movie that came directly from the heart as well as shot to your heart.  It will invoke fear and make you appreciate the relationship that you have.  I have never experienced a film quite like this before and cannot wait to see what the brilliant mind of Mr. Mike Nichols will bring next to comment about our society and culture.  He does have his hand on the pulse of our lives, and Closer proves it.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  I have always been impressed with the work of Mike Nichols' work ever since I first experienced The Graduate and this film was no different.  He has this amazing ability of building tension and love together in the same bundle.  I remember feeling similar emotions during Closer as I did while watching The Graduate.  It is this ability to pull at your heartstrings while still maintaining that sense of realism.  I could connect to some portion of this film, and I loved it.  I strongly recommend this film, but do not take your gut reaction as the first response.  Think about this film, think about yourselves, and then make your decision.  It is what I did and somehow this film still remains in my mind weeks after viewing it.  I am impressed.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>CLOSER suffers from the staginess and inertia that plagues many film adaptations of stage plays, and the script sometimes reminded me a great deal of a very good imitation of Harold Pinter that just failed to be as good, but nonetheless this is a fascinating film to watch because of a bunch of outstanding performances by the four principle actors.  Although this is being primarily promoted as a Julia Roberts film that also stars the ubiquitous Jude Law, she is actually the least important of the main roles and is largely eclipsed by Natalie Portman.  Indeed, with Julia now at age 37 and about to enter a critical stage in her career as an actress, Natalie Portman could well be poised to be one of the actresses that take her place.  She is young, very beautiful (and with the body to perform a long scene very nearly nude), and enormously intelligent.  I don't think she has reached her potential yet, but her ceiling is very, very high.  So far her career has been slowed by her dedication to completing her education at Harvard, but I think that we are going to see her career as an actress take off now.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if she were to receive an Oscar nomination for this film.  I would be quite surprised if she doesn't win a Best Actress award at some point in the future.  Julia is quite good but her role isn't written to express as much personality as is Portman's, or for the two male leads for that matter.  I have always enjoyed Jude Law as an actor, but I wonder if Jude fatigue isn't beginning to set in.  I cannot remember such a large deluge by a single leading actor in such a short time, and moreover he has one more film coming out this holiday season.  Nonetheless, he was excellent, as always, as the rather unpleasant Daniel. Clive Owen is one of the more fascinating actors to arise in recent years, but I found him less effective in this film than in some others.  He has magnificently expressive eyes, but does better in roles in which he expresses himself more subtly than in this film.  He wasn't over the top, but he did come very close to being too expressive.  All in all, however, this film contained many utterly marvelous performances.<br /><br />The script was both a strength and the major weakness of the film.  Although the screenplay ultimately fails to make an especially coherent point about the nature of relationships and the kind of deceptions that populate them (along with rather mundane references to how we are all strangers to one another), Patrick Marber's screenplay (which he adapted from his play) does manage to create four strong characters who are notable for the strange dance of betrayal that they all play among themselves.  They are all much colder and nastier than real human beings are likely to be, but not less fascinating for all that.  The film ultimately fails to make much sense out of the entire role that deception plays in Alice's pretense to being someone that she really wasn't, all the way to adopting a fake name during the entirety of her relationship with Dan.  All in all, this is a film that you will enjoy for the performances, but which will delight less the more that you think about it later.<br /><br />I would make a strong recommendation for an older film that manages to address the same topic in more powerful fashion and with even better acting, the 1983 film version of Harold Pinter's BETRAYAL, starring Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Irons, and Patricia Hodge.  I personally would rather watch Pinter than someone writing in the style of Pinter.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>This film lacks just about everything except great actors. It is worth seeing, maybe once at best.<br /><br />Anna (Julia Roberts) is a married photographer who meets her husband, Larry (Clive Owen) through a twist of fate porno site set up. She crosses paths with a writer, Dan (Jude Law) when she photographs him for his book cover but Dan is somehow involved with a young stripper/waitress (Natalie Portman). Inevitably when lies are told lives are fowled up and these characters really make a mess of things.<br /><br />With a great director like Mike Nichols at the helm of this movie one would think it would all work. However I felt it lacked depth of any kind. The characters are cruel and passionless despite being obsessed with sex 24 hours a day. Clive Owen is downright creepy in his role as a doctor who frequents porn sites for a thrill.....is he such a crappy doctor that he has that much time to kill? Julia Robert's character is more like his possession than a wife and her role seems to have no purpose whatsoever. It is never explained why a seemingly beautiful and successful woman would agree to marry a freak who believes he met her in a porno site chat room....any self-respecting woman would question that even if he were a doctor with a Mercedes! So there is definitely something deeper in there but it is never made clear and soon becomes absolutely frustrating. Jude Law's role is jealous and obsessive and would have made sense had he treated Portman's character with a bit more respect. And finally Portman is a bit over her naive head here pretending to be raw and racy while projecting far too much fear, she is a great actor but this role took something away from her.<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly where this film really fails, the writing, the directing or the subject matter. I think it would have worked had more attention been paid to the reasoning behind the flawed characters and their decision making processes. They should have stayed closer to a good psychiatrist couch rather than their bedrooms if you ask me. This movie is so far from close it isn't even near!</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>Towards the end of the film I was expecting someone, (anyone)! to go completely mad and commit a violent act in blind rage.  There was so much penned up rage throughout the entire film I thought that at least one of the neurotic characters would find themselves commiting a felony assault or at least end up on the slab.  "Closer" built itself up to be a "thriller" type movie but ended up trying to pass itself off as an edgy, thought provocing chick flick.  I was hoping one of them would, well you know, end up on the slab because in reality they all deserved it.  All four of them were creepy pretentious losers and were just askin' for it.  The film did have me goin' for a while but when it ended, I felt like I was the one being cheated on.  Not to say getting revenge and violence is the answer, but it's a movie and that's what I wanted to see.  Out of the four of them you really didn't know who, at certain points was going to suffer royaly for....(gasp).........adultery!!!!  Who hasn't had their heart broken? How dramatic.  It would have been more dramatic if at least one of them got thrown off a balcony at least.  They should have capitalized on the mystery aspect and surprised everyone.  Out of the four I really think they shoud have killed off Clive Owen's character, he was so annoying.  There were so many angles to this film that could have been exploited, but they chose to be moralistic and give it a happy feel good ending.  It's like the final thought on Jerry Springer, no one cares!!! GO-TO-OPRAH-GO-TO-OPRAH.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>I watched this late at night after a long day and have to say its stark-but-muted drama, with attractive actors beautifully photographed in cool clothes while reciting arch dialogue was a good match for my mood. I didn't have to like any of the characters, I didn't have to be envious of anybody, I just had to kick back and watch them screw each other over.<br /><br />Although I had originally kind of snorted at Portman's Oscar nomination I see now that it makes sense. She's not a revelation but she's much better than I expected and she's the human ingredient the movie needs. Clive Owen, too, is great. He looks like he could snap walnuts between his toes.<br /><br />A perfect double-feature with last year's equally depressing, equally attractive, equally hard-to-stop-watching "We Don't Live Here Anymore." Watch both with somebody you're trying to break up with an they'll be gone before the sun circles around in the sky.<br /><br />As much as I liked the movie, I have to say that with all of the characters swapping partners they're a bunch that desperately need an aggressive shower (preferably cold) and possibly a couple of screenings for STD's. "Meet some other people," I wanted to say to them. "You're Jude/Julia/Natalie/Clive. You don't have to make each other so miserable; there's a whole world of other possibilities out there."</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Yet another movie about confused city folk who criss-cross each other in precarious relationships and botch them with a selfish pursuit of gratification, guilt, envy.<br /><br />I suppose this could have been an interesting take on craven Modern Relationships had it not been done a hundred times before, with more polish. "Sex and the City" or "Sidewalks of New York" had the good sense to play out such emotional faux-pas with a streak of humor. "In The Company of Men" showed characters with cruelty but reflected the brutal nature of the corporate world they inhabited. "We Dont Live Here Anymore" laid out marital quandaries in painstaking detail.<br /><br />Closer simply lacks such a trope. Its characters resemble stray leaves caught in the windstorm of an urban existence. We never see them happy, we seldom see them being genuinely romantic (beyond first overtures, where most of the film's endurability is located), or even in a state of peaceful equilibrium. When their libido ruins bonds we find it tough to root for them, all we see is dysfunction.<br /><br />It's the acting that rises over the rubble of a poor script and makes this film watchable. Jude Law's character is slime personified, and he does well to embody it. Natalie Portman plays a stripper (who mysteriously has her tops on even in a stripping sequence) and for a 24-year old she packs in a lot of punch. Julia Roberts is somewhat bland in portraying a character whose motivations rarely make any sense.<br /><br />But the real winner is Clive Owen, who finally shows some of the potential I've been suspecting for a while, especially after his imposing cameo in King Arthur. He plays the rough, voyeuristic doctor, the only person in the film capable of cutting to the heart of the blather around him. Grungy, no B.S. Easily his best work to date.<br /><br />Recommended rental for sure, but such a star-studded lineup should really have amounted to a more compelling film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>Mike Nichols' "Closer" is a loquacious and verbally explicit look at love, sex, deceit, honesty, the wandering eye and romantic competitiveness.  Mike Nichols' "Closer" is also one of the most utterly pompous and frustrating films I have ever seen in spite of some truly powerful acting by its all-star cast.  Instead of bringing me into the lives of these four people and allowing me to emphasize with them and understand their pain, I found myself utterly repulsed and perplexed by the actions of these characters.  I kept looking for some deeper meaning or some actual point, but in the end, I was left with nothing.<br /><br />In this film, Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen are selfish, manipulative, needy people who prey on each other like sharks at a feeding frenzy of the emotions.  They lie and cheat... and then they go lie and cheat again.  It's a never-ending cycle of betrayal, sex, and dishonesty.  For the first half-hour or so, I felt engaged in the romantic drama of these characters.  At the end of this hour and forty minute mess, I was so incredibly sick of these people and angered by their absolutely horrendous actions.  There was no moral, no lesson, and no message.  Unless you count the idea that men and women are incapable of forging a lasting and genuine happiness as a message.  And for most of us, that is simply untrue.<br /><br />What sort of pompous pessimism is this?  Just because the writer, Patrick Marber, may have had bad experiences with love, he felt the need to write a whole play about it?  And then adapt it to a screenplay?  Implying that, somehow, the rest of us wish to watch cruel, deceptive people mess around with each other's emotions?!</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>watched this film&It was all over the place. alot of words being pushed around&the film couldn't make up it's mind if it wanted to be funny or serious in places. it was a waste of film&time.the film was fairly predictable as well to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that critics invariably describe as "brutally honest," which is determined to peel back the mask of Hollywood's romantic lies and show that deep down, people are cruel, love is a sham, and the world is a cold, hard place. Oh, yeah: And the only honest women in this world are strippers and whores. Don't forget that one.<br /><br />Julia Roberts gives us one of her best performance in this film. She is cold, confused, depressed - a lost woman. A woman who wants children. A woman who wants love, but doesn't even know love herself and doesn't realize it when she has it (this goes true for all the characters). Clive Owen is a scene stealer, with the showiest role. Jude Law has shown shades of this character before. Natalie Portman is sexy, mysterious, and vulnerable.<br /><br />This movie has its flaws but Mike Nichols somehow makes it watch able, even intriguing, for the most part, exploring the unpredictable and unconstant nature of lust, attraction and desire and how relationships can waver in intensity and lose their moorings over time.<br /><br />Not a movie for fans of happy endings and have everything spelled out for them. In this film love is the dirtiest word.<br />Being that this movie again is brutal, emotionally draining,and humorous at times it is a polarizing film. I would recommend this DVD for mature adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>Mix match and swing into this confusion of relationship choices. "Closer (2005)" does nothing to answer any relationship questions, buy looks at dysfunctional people trying to and wasting other dysfunctional people's time.<br /><br />  "Closer (2005)" follows the relationship between four individuals: Natalie Portman (Alice), Jude Law (Dan), Julia Roberts (Anna) and Clive Owen (Larry).<br /><br />  Deceit is the main premise for this film.  Mike Nichols (Director) takes this all-star cast and turns them into faux characters. The film is time choppy and leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks. Once or twice works in a film, but not the whole film. It was like playing a crossword puzzle without rationale.<br /><br />  Half way through the film I asked myself, why am I still watching?  One reason; the well-known actors!  This film puts the Hollywood good girls Julia and Natalie into exasperated "dirty" talk that is uncomfortable to listen to.  At times it made me cringe. But acting puts them into "must see" situations.<br /><br />  Some people call it cutting-edge film making, artsy to others, but entertaining?

But it is quite a watchable movie, if only for the brilliant star power of its four main and only characters: Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Julie Roberts and Clive Owen. Owen, being the least well-known of the four, nevertheless manages to deliver the strongest performance, or has the best lines, in Mike Nichols' adaptation of Patrick Marber's play. But my favorite is Natalie Portman as Alice. She is beautiful and  sensational in this film, representing  - if I may speculate - Innocent Love. Her character is there to show how we can tragically screw up Innocent or True Love. And who hasn't? The other three characters in the story are busy hurting each other and essentially form a love triangle with Anna (Roberts) as the confused, sought-after prize. While Alice is the most innocent of the four she delivers the hardest and most honest blow at the end. She is really the only character to admire of the lot. I have been a devoted fan of Natalie Portman ever since BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and she doesn't disappont in  CLOSER. Basically a downer film, CLOSER nevertheless has some fine performances and the script is sound. The problem is that one is left questioning why four near-middle-aged, attractive, successful people willingly engage in such screwed-up, hurtful, juvenile relationships. One wonders if such a script got made into a movie due to Hollywood Myopia. That would explain in general why box office receipts have been falling off: Hollywood produces way too many movies like CLOSER which seemed targeted for a certain group of intellectual elite who think it chic to get depressed while being entertained; yet these kind of movies are artistically representative of the lives of only a fraction of ticket-buyers and are likely based on the writer's dysfunctional friends and relatives. Most of us in America, thank you, are basically happy types and don't want to be confronted with depressing subject matter when we go to the movies for a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>Twenty years from now, the only reason 'Closer' will be remembered is because it represents Natalie Portman's first 'adult' role.  The Golden Globes got it right: she and Clive Owen dominate the proceedings here, lording over supposed leading lights Julia Roberts and Jude Law.  With Owen, it's even more impressive when you consider that he played Law's character in the original London play.<br /><br />Under Mike Nichols' direction, 'Closer' is about as close a thing to a play on screen as you're ever going to see.  Only six characters are credited, and in fact characters five (taxi driver) and six (secretary) have one line apiece.<br /><br />I do have to credit Nichols for a wonderfully imagined beginning - the scene of Law and Portman eyeing each other on the street for the first time (in super slo-mo) with Damien Rice's "Blower's Daughter" essentially narrating the scene is an unsurpassed cinematic moment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>Three or four big-name actors (I only recognized 3) could not save this pointless movie.<br /><br />All the characters were lying, cheating, shallow people. They played with each other's emotions for fun, went on power trips, and generally acted like asses. (Sort of like "Hurlyburly" in that respect - lots of angry, pointless talk by similarly unlikable characters played by big-name actors.)<br /><br />The acting was OK, but the script gave the actors nothing to work with. Julia Roberts was not convincing as a photographer, and Natalie Portman's stripper character never actually strips though I knew that before seeing it.<br /><br />I found myself checking the clock at about the one-hour mark...not a good sign. I give it 2 stars only because it was well-made and someone involved must have thought they had a decent movie in it somewhere. I failed to find it, though.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Word to Julia Roberts - Lose the lips, darling, you look like an aquarium slug trying to escape. Jude Law, dude, you got to work out more, you'll be the first actor to come to mind for a new version of "Gumby". Jude Law has the sexual attention of both Roberts and cute as a vixen on fire with a whip, Natalie Portman, and the geeky nerd chooses the older, stiff as a board Roberts. Dysfunctional? Maybe. Stupid? Absolutely. Clive Owen marries Roberts and after a marital indiscretion, retreats to watch Portman do a slinky striptease pole dance. I should have such troubles. Anyway, love is hate and hate is love, or something like that. Julia Roberts barks out a mouthfull of obscenities, ripping open a sexual current not unlike an audio Hustler magazine teaser sound bite. Grrrroooowwll! Natalie Portman has a great lower back. Fish swim in The London Aquarium. Clive Owen, dude, if you can sing, if this acting thing don't work out, you could be the next Tom Jones. Natalie Portman, smart move. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!  She looks around at the other actors and says, "Hey, you guys ain't thirtysomethings! You're all fortysomethings and Julia is ... I'm gonna beat it and find a younger crowd to swing with."

No,I don't think she's a great actress but there's something about her screen presence and otherwise that makes me want to commit into watching all movies involving her.My favourite scene in Star Wars III was one involving her in a lowkey mood.Getting back to my review,<br /><br />Closer is a movie I expected a lot from.With an awkward star cast comprising of Jude Law,Julia Roberts,NP and Mr.Ugly Arthur I wondered where all this could end.The movie starts in an usual bemusing way that leads me into beleiving it's a dreamy film. There are certain chain of events and the director of the movie relies on the viewer's prudence to make a story of it's own.What I liked about the movie was the photographing session lasting 5-10 mins between Roberts and Law.The UK Chat session was pretty interesting too.Mind you,that's about it.<br /><br />Maybe it was the starcast and how they were played together or maybe it was the weak script.Or maybe it was both.I admire films for their spark of entertainment. Closer bored me with it's bitterness it never gets out of.<br /><br />PS - I am not in a relationship as of now. I found the plot and some of the extensions extremely boring.

"Closer" is the latest addition to this select group of utter cinematic failures. It's based on a Broadway play written by Patrick Marber, who also wrote the screenplay. And the writing is atrocious. This is a "relationship movie". It's about two couples: Alice and Dan, Anna and Larry. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a young American in London. She and Dan (Jude Law) meet when Alice looks the wrong way when crossing a street and is hit by a car. After he has been with Alice for a year, Dan meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a portrait photographer who is also American. Anna rejects him. So Dan poses as Anna on an internet sex chat site and sets Anna up with Larry (Clive Owen), a sleazebag doctor, without her knowing it. But Anna and Larry hit it off and become a couple. A year later, Dan is still with Alice but preoccupied with Anna. So change your partners, dosey-doe. But that's not the end of it. Unfortunately.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed about "Closer" is that it's contrived to the point of being corny. The second thing I noticed is that I didn't know anyone's name. The characters have protracted conversations with strangers without introducing themselves. We get the first name 10 minutes into the film. By this point, it's a relief. I presume "Closer" is supposed to be about how and why people love one another, but it is a hypothetical exploration of that subject. Real people don't act or speak like these characters, and there is no indication of why the characters care for one another. In fact, they really don't seem to. The idea that any of the characters are in love is preposterous.<br /><br />The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. It feels like a play. A bad play. Characters constantly make nonsensical proclamations, like "I couldn't lie to you....because I love you." Every conversation is ponderous. The writing is so bad that sometimes one character has to articulate what another is feeling. Larry is a thoroughly obnoxious person who lives for conquest. Dan is a romantic. Both men are uncommonly self-absorbed. Anna is guilt-ridden. Alice is supposed to be an enigma, but she's just childlike. Anna and Larry both seem emotionally ill, so I have to agree with Larry that they belong together. All four of them have a pathological desire to know everything about their partners, which they spend most of their time pursuing. At one point Dan says, "Please tell me the truth....because I'm addicted to it." Yup. Their lives would be a lot easier if these people discovered the concept of discretion.<br /><br />I can't say "Closer" is all bad. It really depends upon your sense of humor. The dialogue is unintentionally funny from the start. If you last long enough, there is one interminable conversation between Larry and Alice in a strip club that is absolutely hilarious. You'll laugh out loud when Dan breaks down in tears. That's notable for being the nadir of Jude Law's career. Truthfully, Clive Owen's performance is good, but his character is nonsense. The other three performances are flat. They could scarcely be otherwise. So I don't recommend the film. But if you approach "Closer" with wry humor and lots of popcorn, you might find something in it.<br /><br />The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005 release): There is a music video for "The Blower's Daughter", performed by Damien Rice, which is the song that plays over the closing credits.  Subtitles are available for the film in English and French. Dubbing is available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>There's one main reason to see this movie and that is the performance of Natalie Portman, who somehow brings a naivite and genuineness to a movie which focuses on the various infidelities of two couples.<br /><br />  This movie has its flaws but Mike Nichols somehow makes it watchable, even intriguing, for the most part, exploring the unmpredictable and unconstant nature of lust, attraction and desire and how relationships can waver in intensity and lose their moorings over time. Even if you aren't completely satisfied after viewing this film, you'll find yourself thinking about monogamy, infidelity and the difficulties of modern-day relationships.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AVV9LV9UXT6F.html">A2AVV9LV9UXT6F</a><br/><p>I've noticed a lot of these "dramas" that everyone raves over as being such a great answer to soulless, Hollywood, action and special effects movies are really just dull, pretentious, artsy fartsy nonsense.  The thing that reveals this movie to be another example of this is the fact that the characters in it just don't behave in a remotely believable fashion.  Julia Roberts' character hooks up first with a man who she learns went to an aquarium to meet her after having cybersex with someone he thought was her the night before (what kind of women are attracted to desperate perverts?).  She then dumps him for a stalker whose followed her around for a year.  Then she dumps the stalker and gets back with Mr. Cybersex after he grovels for her.  What man ever won a woman by grovelling?  What woman ever did anything but hold a man in contempt after he grovelled?  I may not be the world's foremost expert on women, but I do know that women are just plain not attracted to men they don't respect.  And what person respects a grovelling beggar?  Begging and grovelling KILLS attraction.  This character's behavior is so contrary to reality it just kills suspension of belief stone dead.<br /><br />Clive Owen's character grovels and begs for this woman after he learns that she was seeing someone else when he married her, and is now throwing him over for this man.  In other words, the evident fact that she never really loved him, and has been deceiving him over an extended period doesn't seem to upset him all that much.<br /><br />Jude Law's character Grovels in turn for both Julia Roberts' and Natalie Portmans' character, though more realistically he ultimately loses them both.<br /><br />And Natalie Portman can apparently forgive Jude Law for cheating on her, lying to her, and dumping her for another woman, crawling back only after he's lost the other woman.  That's not too much for her.  But apparently she can't forgive him for asking her if she had sex with Clive Owen's character.<br /><br />Excuse me?<br /><br />Do real people act like this?  Not in the world I've lived in all my life they don't.  So how is it good drama to portray people so unbelievably?  I'm sorry, I just can't see what critics find so enchanting about films like this.  The only thing this movie has going for it are first rate actors, and that's not enough to save it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>There is a difference to me between making a film with relationships connecting in different ways because it's logical and that's where it would most likely go, while others look like it was written just simply to see it happen. Closer is one of those films that halfway through you just ask "why am I watching this anyway?"<br /><br />Dan and Alice catch each other's eyes walking on the street in London. But Alice's unknowing of England's traffic direction gets her hit by a taxi. And so a relationship blooms. Months later(or years it's never mentioned), he decides to write a book about Alice's escapades(she's a former stripper). While being photographed for the book jacket, he lusts after the photographer Anna but she rejects him. In a weird way to take revenge he impersonates her in an online sex room(probably the funniest but awkwardest scenes I've seen) and wants to meet. Imagine the shock that the real Anna actually shows up and they get married.<br /><br />And basically the film is a big series of turnabouts. When the characters are with the one they love, they long for the one they really love. And so basically each man has sex with each woman and it's basically like a big orgy with none of the other characters participating. You just wonder "can't you 4 just move in together and sleep with whoever?"<br /><br />To me the 2 better performances are Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. He comes across as a kind of cold-hearted man but just really direct and forward and emotional but in a more menacing way. She plays her character as someone who justs wants things to work out but things just get in the way. In the Professional(or Leon in some cases) she played a young almost Lolita type while here it's almost full blown but there's still this aura of innocence with Natalie that makes her character a bit tragic.<br /><br />Jude Law almost looks like he's sleepwalking through the film and Julia Roberts looks quite miscast. Her character calls for her to be a bit detached about all the wrongdoings that she does, an almost who cares attitude but she doesn't come across that well.<br /><br />If you're in a "that b****/***hole broke my heart" mood, this film's perfect but taken generally, it's kind of unneccesary, if only to watch Natalie in a stripper role(no guys, she does not show anything, sorry).</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Mike Nichols film on the modern egocentric notion of love as manifested by utterly selfish and unappealing characters.  A boring hum-drum movie that has nothing to present about sincere relationships other than its pretentious message.<br /><br />The story follows the lives of four characters who by chance meet and converge into a love square (a love triangle having only 3 people.) Set in London, Dan (Jude Law) is a writer who meets an American stripper named Alice (Natalie Portman) and falls in lust with her only to later meet Anna (Julia Roberts) who is a photographer who is with Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist.  The movie follows the ups and downs of each couple's relationship and their cross over to the other over the course of several years.  The audience has to sit and bear how the characters rationalize their dishonesty and vanity as necessary evils to finding true love.  I think it has been proven time and again that strong relationships between couples are based on sincerity, loyalty, and sacrifice as opposed to deceit, manipulation, and lust.  In any case, how could the men in the film have any expectation of such virtues from a stripper which is nothing more than a prostitute in denial?  Trying to present such shallow and selfish people in a positive light is nothing short of tasteless and stupid.<br /><br />This is an absolutely boring film in which its only revelation is its pretentiousness as to the true qualities that make a relationship last between two people.  The overplayed 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' theme song was as absurd as it was annoying.  Each of the characters are pathetic and despicable examples of shallowness, selfishness, and dishonesty that defy the very notion of people capable of a loving relationship.  Such people are too much in love with themselves to love anyone else.  In short, this film is tasteless, meaningless, and a complete waste of time to watch: soap opera characters have more tact and scruples than the snobbish garbage portrayed in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>With a film so foul mouthed, where every other word is something you'd hear on most triple-x sites, and with Natalie Portman scripted as a stripper, it's quite a surprise how boring and ineffective this film was.<br /><br />The film involves four people: a failed author turned obituary writer, a photographer, a successful dermotologist and an ex-stripper. They all end up in relationships with one another, and there's countless times where they would cheat on each other, leave one for another, get back with the old person, and break up again and use sex to hurt eachother. What was the point here? Maybe it was that these characters had confused love for sex? I'm not for sure, but it made for an extremely boring, uneventful and repetitive hour and 40 minutes.<br /><br />For me, when the story really started to dissipate anything interesting, was towards the beginning when the writer (Jude Law) has cyber sex with the doctor (Clive Owen), pretending he's the photographer named Anna (Julia Roberts) for whom he is in love. And by getting back at Anna for not wanting to be with him, he sets up a date with the perverted doctor and tells him to meet "her" somewhere, a place he know Anna often visits. The most ridiculous part was when the doctor approaches Anna thinking he's meeting her for a sex date (knowing what she looks like from the description the writer gave him online) and she has no idea what he is talking about. She then tells him that he is the victim of a practical joke set up by a man. But then she ends up marrying him. So let me get this straight.....Anna marries a man that she met on a date that was set up by two men (the doctor unknowingly) having cyber sex. How stupid and unbelieveable does it get?<br /><br />Other than being a boring waste of time, the movie had some okay acting from all the actors and between all the sex talk, there was some good and catchy dialogue between the characters. Other than that I really see no reason to give this film more than two stars</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>On stage, it looks great with interesting dialogues and characters deftly manipulated; on screen, it looks so implausible and very offensive.  That's 'Closer,' film about the four characters you don't care, who keep doing horrible things to each other in the name of love.<br /><br />There's not much of a story.  This is about four characters -- played by Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.  Jude encouners Natalie on the street of London, and they fall in love with each other, but Jude finds himself attracted to Julia during a photo session with her.  In the meanwhile, Clive also gets acquainted with Julia, and married her, but later finds she is in love with Jude, who in turn ... should I continue?<br /><br />[AWFULLY STAGY] The film is based on a stage production, and it shows.  The film repeatedly shows the beginning or the end part of the relation(s) between the characters, and when one of the  characters leaves another, their dialogues suggest what happenned to him/her before that scene.  It is not surprising that Mike Nichols, who is also known as accomplished stage director, found this material interesting.  But I for one found otherwise.<br /><br />For, on the big screen, the contrived situations as to their meeting and parting are simply impossible.  See how Clive Owen's doctor come to meet Julia Roberts.  Clive's doc is seen chatting with Jude Law over the internet.  Clive (quite ignorantly) believes Jude is a female, and makes a promise with 'her' to meet.  Ironically, Jude's prank ends up with Clive's seeing with Julia (yet a stranger to Clive, remember that), for whom poor Jude has already fell.  On stage, it works.  On screen, it's just laughable.<br /><br />Of course, you can defend the whole things saying this kind of  contrivance is necessary, and should be forgotten during the film which explores the nature of love.  Right, but the idea of love in 'Closer' means sleeping with someone else, and confessing the secret in the most off-putting way, often using many dirty and graphic words spoken by Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman, real guilty pleasure.<br /><br />OK, people act like that, I admit, and I know.  But as I remember, we are not so much intent on manipulating the relations and hurting the ones we love as those characters, whose pathetic behaviors just made me sick.  And though Natalie Portman and Clive Owen won the Golden Globe Awards, I find nothing special in their acting, and think miscast Portman is too young for the role of a striptease dancer.<br /><br />The characters are at best the puppets poorly handled by the stagy script, and the acting does not help.  'Closer' which explores the nasty side of love in the clumsiest way, is very smug, superficial, and shallow, exaggerating the obvious 'truths,' and leaving nothing behind.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>Boy was I disappointed by this purportedly "deep" film.  It is about relationships between silly self-important yuppies, with few real responsibilities except to their careers and their fantasies about themselves.  None of them care particularly for the ones they are involved with, but instead are consumed by their own ideals of love.  So instead of working on their relationships, they seek perfection.  This has been done before, and better by others.  The only thing that saves this film from total mediocrity is the actors, who really are good.  It's just that the script offered little and the direction virtually nothing.<br /><br />Nichols is mainstream, but wants to have the cache of an Indie filmmaker.  Alas, he can't have it both ways and so relies on stars to sell the film with their sex appeal.  Idiotic, stilted dialogue passes for depth, and abrupt time shifts - where relationship shuffling must be explained - destroy the realism.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>This movie is hard to follow.  No question about that.  Most movies that are adapted from Broadway plays don't fair well on screen unless they're made from the classic playwrights (Tennessee Williams, David Mamet, Eugene O'Neill, etc.).  Many of the negative reviews here on Amazon.com expecting more action are justified.  However, I found the movie to be better than expected.  Mike Nichols is one of Hollywood's finest directors.  And with four of the best actors around, he does very will with the challenging subject matter.  Natalie Portman has become the "Harrison Ford" of the Star Wars genre by breaking out into a great Oscar nominated role.  British TV star Clive Owen also breaks free of his shell with his excellent performance.  Juila Roberts & Jude Law round out this excellent cast.  If you can stay with it for the performances, you'll be amused.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Let me begin by saying that "Closer" is the kind of film that you've gotta see for yourself to decide if you like it. Half the time I see reviews by people who loved the film, and half the time I see reviews by people who absolutely despised it. I, myself, loved it.<br /><br />"Closer" is the story of four individuals: obituary writer and struggling author Dan (Jude Law), waitress and ex-stripper Alice (Natalie Portman), popular photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) and dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen). Dan and Alice meet in London after Alice is hit by a car. A few months later, Dan is being photographed for his novel by Anna, and the two fall in love - but only Dan will admit it. Trying to get back at Anna, he pretends to be her on an Internet sex chat and tells Larry to meet her at an aquarium for sex. By chance, the real Anna is at the aquarium; she meets Larry and the two fall in love.<br /><br />Eventually, Alice leaves Dan and Anna leaves Larry. By the end of the film, each man has had sex with each woman and vice versa; they seem to love whomever they're with, but in reality they only love their original partner.<br /><br />I'd heard good things about this film before watching it, but after watching it the first time I was disappointed. While it was no doubt a fine film, there was more sexual dialog than I could have ever imagined! Now I can tolerate sexuality in a movie just as much as the next guy, but when the film becomes unrealistically sexual than I become fed up with it. And "Closer" seemed to be just that. But now, having watched the movie numerous more times, I realize that the film is abnormally sexual, but not necessarily overly sexual. Would it have been better without so much sexuality? Yes. But the rest of the film makes up for it. Oh yes, does it ever.<br /><br />Patrick Marber's script is adapted from Marber's popular, award-winning play. The script is witty, intelligent and original. There are some great lines, which come from characters who seem very real.<br /><br />The acting is one of the film's high points. Jude Law is terrific as Dan, who tries to be mean but just can't pull it off. He makes the character a target for sympathy from the audience. Natalie Portman is, as always, very good, as Alice. Julia Roberts, while good, doesn't give the best performance of her career; it feels like she's not putting in a huge amount of effort. Clive Owen is outstanding as always; Owen's performance has made Larry my favorite character in the film. He really brings out the bad side of Larry, but he's likable at the same time. There's a certain air of mysticism around Larry, like you never know what he's going to do next. Interestingly, Owen played Law's part in the original stage play.<br /><br />Mike Nichols proves that his directorial talent hasn't faded one bit since he made the 1967 classic "The Graduate" - in fact, Nichols seems better than ever. He gives the film a cold, hard feeling, but at times he seems to loosen up - much like the characters themselves. He really captures the darkness of Patrick Marber's script.<br /><br />The few songs on the soundtrack are excellent, but the one that really stands out is "The Blower's Daughter" by Damien Rice. It's used for the film's theme, and there isn't another song in the world that is so perfect for this movie as "Blower's Daughter". The song is absolutely beautiful; the sad, determined strength found in the lyrics matches the film well.<br /><br />"Closer" is closer to perfection than any romantic-drama has ever come. If you're looking for a soft romance like "Sleepless in Seattle" or "Notting Hill", then this is probably not the movie for you. This is a mature, dark, grim look at romance, and I love it. "Closer" has become one of my favorite films. If you feel like watching the film and deciding for yourself how you feel, and you keep an open mind, then I applaud you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2URG8OHNEDS.html">A1R2URG8OHNEDS</a><br/><p>"Closer" is the story of four people, two men and two women, who are some of the saddest you'll ever see. It's based on a stage play, and it's obvious because this movie works like a play, giving conversation after conversation rotating between these characters. It always grabs your attention, and it always gives you something to think about. I recently wrote about "The Machinist," which is a character study of Trevor Reznick. "Closer" has four great characters to study, and they all deserve each other. It is about the ability of being happy, telling the truth, and to love, because I don't think any of these characters are able to do any of those. Jude Law is in this movie, to add to the other five that he's in, but his preformance is not the highlight. There are four great preformances, equally from Jude, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen, who probably was the most nasty out of all of them. You will be shocked by some of the phrases and words you hear in the film, but it's exactly the things that we say in real life. It's just more personal because you don't realize it when you say it. The movies don't normally give you such a breath of reality, but this does. It's directed by Mike Nicols, and I've only seen one of his movies, "The Birdcage." This is a totally different kind of movie, but it does mix elements of dram and humor, even though it's not as slapstick as "The Birdcage."<br /><br />The movie begins with Dan and Alice walking towards each other, flirting with their eyes, when she's isn't paying attention and gets hit by a car. Dan volenteers to take her to the hospital and tend  for her bloody knee and side of her face, and they get to conversation. They walk to his office, and then we cut to years later. Dan wrote a book about Alice, and is getting his picture taken for the book jacket. The photographer is Anna, and soon the two begin to kiss, when Dan tells her that Alice is going to pick him up, while still kissing her. He tells her that he's in love with her, and has to see her again, but she tells him that he will forget about her. He decides to have fun, and goes to an adult internet chat room, where he poses as a women as he talks to Larry. While Dan is just having fun, Larry is actually taking care of his sexual desires, and when Dan says "I want to meet you," he tells him to meet "her" at the aquarium. Dan isn't really going to go, he's just busting Larry's chops. Larry meets Anna at the aquarium, thinking that she was the one on the internet, and eventually the two start their relationship. Pretty soon, Dan's affair with Anna leads Alice to become a stripper, where her and Larry meet and have their fun, as Dan, Alice, Larry, and Anna all form a web of deciet, hurt, and overall, what they believe to be love.<br /><br />Towards the end of "Closer," Dan makes a comment saying that with the truth we'd all be animals. The irony here is that none of the characters ever tell the truth to the ones they say they love. It begins to make you wonder if any of them have the power to love, because everytime they get closer to commitment, they "fall in love" with somebody else. These people can all be happy if they wanted to be, but they don't. They just want to be happy during the moment they are in, and nothing more. It's very powerful, and very sad. There is some dark humor, a joke here or there, and everything works in the movie. It's getting to be that I go see a movie and expect Jude Law to be there. I've seen five of his six movies, and I think there has to be an Oscar nomination in one of them for him. I'm aiming towards this, but he was also the main focus in "Alfie," which was an "ok" movie with a breathtaking preformance. Julia Roberts is getting better and better, and I thought she was "getting better" with "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," but she wasd great in "Closer." Her preformance in this is very different from "Ocean's Twelve," but she was just having a good time while making that. Clive Owen had to be the highlight here, because he was the most nasty in the film. You spend the movie trying to figure out which characters you like and which you don't, when you  realize that you can't like any of them, because all they do is lie and cheat. "Closer" is a stark picture of reality, and while it takes a while for it to sink in that we are like these people, in the end, it's something that you think about for a long time. I think the people that don't like it, don't want to admit that truth to themselves. People are not always nice and caring and loving and willing to commit, and this movie proves it. This is one of the best movies of the year.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated R for sequences of graphic sexual dialogue, nudity/sexuality and language.<br /><br />The rating seems harsh, but the movie itself wasn't as bad it it makes it out to be. Pretty much no graphic images here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is a movie that centers on 4 characters.  Jude Law meets Portman when she is struck by a car in a London Street.  Law accompanies her to the hospital and an immediate attraction leads to them going out with each other and living together. Portman tells Law that she was a stripper in the States but moved to London after a bad relationship.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Law becomes fascinated with Julia Roberts character, who is a lot older than Portman and a photographer.  When Portman arrives at Robert's studio to meet Law she can easily discern that Law is in love with Roberts.  In a poignent scene, Portman starts crying and Roberts photographs her.  That photograph will later be the centerpiece of Robert's exhibition.<br /><br />Law goes to an Internet chatroom and meets Clive Owens on-line.  Law pretends to be Robert's character and Owens thinks he has met a real sexually charged woman on line.  The two agree to meet at the aquarium the next day.  When Owens goes to the aquarium Julia Roberts just happens to be there.  Owens is sure that she is the one he chatted with and starts up a conversation with her that eventually lead to the two getting married.<br /><br />At Robert's public exhibition of her photos Law approaches her and the two start a secret love affair for about a year.  The movie continues to get stranger as Owens comes home from a business trip to confess to Roberts that he had an infidelity with a prostitute but Roberts is there to tell him she is breaking up with him to be with Law.<br /><br />The movie continues to get more strange and the rest of the film turns out to involve Owens getting psychological revenge on Law.  This is a movie that once you start you cannot leave until the end, even though some parts are hard to understand (the director seems to have time shifts that are not readily apparent until about 5 minutes into some scenes) and you expect Law and Owen to get violent with each other, which never happens.<br /><br />Both Roberts and Portman are extremely gorgeous in this movie; Portman makes a very convincing stripper while Roberts gives that 40ish great looking woman appearance.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>I found this movie very boring and hard to keep up with.

Simply put though...this movie is horrible and pointless. The characters are awful selfish people only the most shallow human being could find sympthetic, they are nasty and wretched human beings, not the average person in a predicament, but rather botton feeder Jerry Springer trash in nicer clothes. There is no great enlightenment to be found here, I found myself rooting for horrible things to happen to all the characters and after awhile didn't really care what happened to them at all. Ignore all the hoopla about the higher deeper meanings of this film, hell, rubbish like Showgirls was more enlightening than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>Clive Owen is disgusting in this movie.

I rented it because of Julia Roberts. I expected better from her.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It is unlikely I have seen a more misogynistic film since Neil LaBute's "In the Company of Men", but director Mike Nichols uses his uncanny ability to delve deep into the human condition to come up with a challenging, superbly acted and at times surprisingly empathetic film about four self-absorbed, unsympathetic people. I'm not sure what other director could have been better qualified to translate Patrick Marber's stinging, cynical play set in an urban chic London. As he has proven from his 1966 debut, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" through 1971's "Carnal Knowledge" to "Angels in America" last year, Nichols knows how to humanize the brutality and emotional pain that people can inflict on each other. This master's skill is what prevents "Closer" from shriveling up into a wearing exercise in manipulation and deceit.<br /><br />Writing the screenplay from his own play, Marber provides dialogue that is alternately sharp, observant and harshly erotic. At times, his acerbic work reminds me of Frederic Raphael's superb 1960's screenplays for "Darling" and "Two for the Road". The story that brings the four characters into a sexual intersection of tete-a-tetes and one-upmanship does get rather convoluted. The film covers about four years in elapsed time but takes liberties with scene transitions, focusing on the beginnings and endings of relationships and consequently complicating the chronology and timing of events, sometimes unnecessarily. Suffice it to say that each character figures out his or her capacity for hurting someone else and then goes about feeling empowered, guilty or some combination of both. It is telling that there are hints and often threats of physical abuse in the dialogue, but nothing is executed until a final, defining slap, filmed in slow motion, of course.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly strong, though I believe the "beautiful people" aspect of the casting does distance the actors from the audience, perhaps intentionally. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but she surprises as Anna, the photographer who becomes the focal point of a shark-infested triangle. Looking rather sallow and absurdly thin, Roberts doesn't come across as all that attractive here, but her sullen demeanor seems to free her from the contrivances Hollywood has offered her for the past fifteen years.  It seems inevitable that she is now playing the older woman archetype now, and she accepts her fate with a seasoned truthfulness that propels the rest of the characters. That she gives the weakest performance among this quartet is a tribute to the high caliber of the talent involved. At first, the overexposed Jude Law plays Dan, the ethically challenged writer who fails as a novelist, as a hopeless romantic, but what he gradually uncovers is a tormented soul weakening under the burden of his deceptions. It's a brave performance especially since his character is the one most willing to hurt the others deeply for his own selfish motives.<br /><br />Playing Larry, the equally manipulative and sexually insecure dermatologist, Clive Owen finally sinks his teeth into a role that makes the most of his swarthy onscreen persona. His emotional nakedness and bull-in-a-china-shop approach to his problems make a brutishly affecting counterpoint to Law's rather effete character. And in what amounts to a revelation, Natalie Portman is alternately vulnerable and bruising as Alice, the stripper who falls hard for Dan and won't give Larry the intimacy he needs when he is rejected by Anna. Eschewing any trace of the child actor she was, Portman tantalizes with her flighty sexuality and then grounds her character deeply when she is subject to an excruciating break-up from Dan. Her character's evolution, however sketchily it is presented, is the only one that achieves a poignancy that nearly transcends the story's cynicism. I have to admit the unrelenting tone does induce a numbing effect that makes you wonder why you should care about the fate of any of the characters. But leave it to Nichols to make you want to know what happens to each of them. Damien Rice's "The Blower's Daughter" is used effectively as a musical bridge for their comings and goings. Highly recommended though don't expect to feel life-affirmed afterward.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Closer is an intimate look at two very complicated and very troubled relationships. A reviewer for TIME Magazine has called Closer "A love story for adults," but this is a far cry from any love story you are likely to see. If this is love, take back my reservation.<br /><br />Patrick Marber adapted his own play about two couples who try, unsuccessfully, to secretly swap partners. The film gets up close and personal with these four people with scenes that are so real and packed with so much emotion, you want to look away because they seem so private, yet you can't take your eyes off the screen.<br /><br />The cast is mesmerizing, each perfect in their roles. Julia Roberts is quite impressive as Anna, in one of her best performances. She is always easier to take when her trademark acting ticks are stripped away and she does a good job conveying a woman wracked with guilt who is nonetheless compelled to cause hurt. Jude Law is quite good as Dan, an obituary writer struggling to become a novelist, and Clive Owen is terrific in an Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning role as Larry, a dermatologist who meets Anna because of a cruel joke by Dan. Natalie Portman, especially, delivers a nuanced and unforgettable performance in her Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning performance. She was most stunning of all in her first 'adult' role. I look forward to seeing more of her once the horrendous first three Star Wars films come to an end in May.<br /><br />What makes Closer so interesting, aside from the across-the-board blistering performances and crackling dialogue, is that you might empathize with a character in one scene, and then hate their guts in the next. Everyone is a victim, and everyone is an abuser, although not always in the most obvious ways. Closer is very adult, and very clever; a classy, striking piece of work.<br /><br />Veteran director Mike Nichols' juggles the various time frames with consummate artistry and his subtle dramatic skill evokes memories of his first film, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (1966) - but there's no Elizabeth Taylor or Richard Burton here, although all four actors deliver unusually strong performances. You might feel the need for a cold shower after watching this film, but it'll be worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>This is a movie that's hard to "like," but it certainly got my attention. Mike Nichols puts these four superb actors in a closed world, and explores the permutations of lust (and perhaps love), trust (and betrayal), forgiveness (and suspicion). Nichols sets up the characters and then tears them down--the predator Dan becomes the begging needy man as Alice (Natalie Portman) finally catches on to him; the cool, sophisticated, in-control Anna (Julia Roberts) becomes a woman who could have it all but doesn't want to be happy; and the rough-around-the-edges Clive Owen reveals himself as perhaps the most manipulative of all. There are parts of the film that don't quite ring true--how would you feel if you were picked up at a museum by a guy who does you-know-what in chat rooms? Anna doesn't seem to mind. But some things were all too true, such as the guys' reactions to infidelity, their insane focus on the gory details of the sex act without for a minute asking--What does this mean? We don't see anyone actually in bed, but that doesn't matter in this intensely sexual, at times raunchy film. As you see from the reviews, this movie excites strong reactions, and for that alone it's worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>ABOUT THE SUPERBIT EDITION: SOUNDS/LOOKS GREAT BUT-NO SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: IN 'CLOSER' LOVE IS A ROUGH ROAD!<br /><br />This film is a bit hard to take and watch, but at the same time draws the viewer in and won't let go. The film begins with the four protagonists; Julia Roberts as Anna the recently divorced photographer, Jude Law as Dan the obit-writer/ wanna-be-novelist, Natalie Portman as Alice, the nice girl that is a stripper, and Clive Owen as Doctor Larry, the skin doctor in more ways than one, clearly identified. Just what possessed these people to act so very needy and clingy, both before and after, bouts of cruel, devious, and fickle emotional tirades, is beyond me. However, that is at the heart of this fine work of filmmaking and the reason to see it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: BE FOREWARNED THIS IS A VERY SAD STORY<br /><br />If the four characters were flawed, the men seemed more obviously so than the women. I'm not sure if that is the way it really was, or just the way I perceived it. Nevertheless, it seemed to me as though two essentially nice girls with issues, and in need of nurturing became absorbed by two rather self-centered cads with a penchant for treating women, like less than dirt. It was not until the end that the real flaws in the women's characters' became obvious, especially in Alice, who had played a misunderstood fallen angel for most of the film. Nevertheless, both Julia Roberts as Anna and Natalie Portman as Alice were excellent in their roles. Jude Law was a contemptible cad, albiet - well acted, but Clive Owen was nothing short of a self-proclaimed 'cave-man' with a stated double standard for himself. Maybe that means Clive Owen should be honored for his performance, but it frankly just turned me off - period, and made the film harder to believe.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Closer has a great ability to keep your interest until the very end or should I say the great performances from the great cast make it that way. See it's supposed to be a mixed and twisted love story of how four people meet in the weirdest ways but in the end it just tells the tale of an enormous puzzle of lust, conflict, heartbreak, and most of all lust. For me this movie was a comedy, just wait until you hear the dirty words that come out of their mouths and the crazy computer scene. The problem is that no matter how hard they tried the only person that truly made you feel she was in love was Natalie Portman. It's not the acting it's just the way these characters were written and it didn't work here. Worst of all Closer is badly jumbled by going from one period of time to another in a matter of seconds and it really didn't need to be in that style. Then they mess up by making the film seem like a dirty movie by emphasizing everything nasty you could think up and more and not on the story itself. In the end the characters don't really get closer but further apart and your left with a movie that is only worth watching for its moments of comedy and only worth watching for the good acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>Closer is a movie about relationships.  The title refers to getting close to someone.  This film takes place over a period time.  It is not apparent from a first watch but you will notice this on a second look.  The screenplay was adapted from Patrick Marber's hit West End Play (I saw it in Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum.)<br /><br />Dan Wolf (Jude Law) is a wannabe writer who is currently writing obits.  One day he is walking down the street when American Alice Ayers (Natalie Portman) crosses the street and is hit by a taxi.  Dan rushes Anna to the hospital and this starts their relationship.<br /><br />Passage of time, Dan and Alice are now married.  Dan has written a book based on Alice.  He is sent to have his cover picture taken by Anna Cameron (Julia Roberts).  He has an instant connection with her but she resists because he is married.<br /><br />Passage of time, Dan is surfing in a chat room and pretends to be a woman.  He is chatting up Dr. Larry Bagley (Clive Owen) who is bored at work.  In the end, Larry asks to meet up.  Off the top of his head, Dan agrees to meet Larry at the Aquarium and tells him his name is Anna.<br /><br />Next day at the Aquarium, Larry finds Anna (she mentioned to Dan that the Aquarium is her favorite place to go and meditate.)  But of course, she has no idea what is going on.  That is until Larry tells her about the chat room.  Anna puts two and two together.  But she likes Larry, so no harm.<br /><br />Passage of time, Anna is having her first showing of her photographs at a gallery.  She has married Larry.  Dan and Alice show up.  While Dan is chatting up Anna, Larry is with Alice.<br /><br />Passage of time, Larry has returned from a medical convention to find Anna out of sorts.  It turns out that Dan and Anna have been having an affair ever since the showing.  Simultaneously, Alice finds out about the affair and leaves Dan.<br /><br />Passage of time, Larry has given into his baser desires and is now frequenting strip clubs and finds Anna performing.  He becomes fixated with her and tries to get her to go home with him but she is still in love with Dan. (This is Natalie's best scene.)<br /><br />Passage of time, Dan and Anna are on the outs and Dan confronts Larry.  Larry baits Dan and he leaves in a rage.  In the end, Anna returns to Larry but Dan is not so lucky.<br /><br />The final scene has Dan back at a park by the hospital where he took Anna and finds out one of her secrets.<br /><br />Mike Nichols is the one of the great directors who has not had a hit in years.  This definitely broke his dry spell.  This film had a definite edge but with a lesser director it would be tawdry, with Nichols it was perfection.<br /><br />Clive Owen received a long overdue Oscar nomination and should have won (but it was great to see Morgan Freeman finally get his recognition.)  Julia Roberts showed why she is the number one actress working.  Anna is an extremely complex character and she handled every scene with extreme talent.  This was Jude Law's year for roles (he had four films that year) but Dan is not a likeable character so he was greatly overlooked.  Natalie Portman also received an Oscar nomination for her deft work as the quintessential "other woman".<br /><br />This is not a film for the prudish or faint of heart.  This is an all out attack on your senses and a lovely attack.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: Music Video - The Blower's Daughter - Haunting in the film but does not stand up as a solo song.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Sip a nicely chilled glass of a really good chardonnay as you watch this: with its beautiful locations, gorgeous looking people, and cutting edge fashions, this simply isn't a movie to watch with a crumpled bag of Doritos.  The look and feel of the film aren't the only things that are sharp, either; the dialogue can give a ginsu knife a run for its money.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed this very adult drama, though at times the exchanges do feel a little bit obviously "written", and overall the characters are extremely self-indulgent.  Also, for those who care about such things, not everything works out well for everyone in the end, though it does for some.  To the movie's credit, though, even if a character deserves his or her bad fate, you still feel kind of bad for that character, thanks to the actors doing a good job creating well-rounded characters out of the generally sorry specimens they're handed.<br /><br />  Finally, the DVD offers a sharp yet warm image that really makes those scenes in the opera house bar and at the chic gallery exhibition (yes, it's that kind of movie, remember?) really shine.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>From the trailers and the presence of Julia Roberts in the cast, I went into CLOSER expecting a light romantic comedy. (My preconceptions haven't been so shattered since I saw Bambi's mother get shot by hunters at the Saturday kiddie matinee!)<br /><br />CLOSER opens as Alice (Natalie Portman), a New York stripper on a visit to London, is grazed by a car after she's looked left instead of right stepping off the curb. She's taken to the hospital by a stranger, Dan (Jude Law), a writer wannabe with whom she starts a live-in relationship. Then, Dan sits for a formal portrait by photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), on whom he unsuccessfully hits. Subsequently, Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist, meets Anna, whom he marries, then divorces after discovering that she's had recent sex with the once-spurned Dan. On the rebound and needing physical comfort, Larry seeks out Alice, now shucking clothes at a London strip club after having left Dan, and whom he'd previously met at one of Anna's photo exhibits. But Dan still pines for Alice and is emotionally devastated that she may have had sex with Larry. Is this messy, or what? (The timeline is murky; apparently all this happens over a couple of years.)<br /><br />CLOSER is a film, painful to watch, of sexual manipulation, possession, and obsession in which the four principal characters inflict emotional cruelties on each other. It's not holiday fare for an afternoon out at the movies with your aged Mum. The language is sexually graphic and, in one sequence of scenes in the London strip joint, visually raunchy. CLOSER is, however, one of the best films of 2004. Julia Roberts is perhaps the biggest surprise as she shows that she can radically transcend - even beyond ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) - her usual cute roles; I was mightily impressed.<br /><br />It would be hard to pick this film's lead and supporting parts. All four (Portman, Law, Roberts, Owen) have about equal screen time (though I wasn't keeping track with a stopwatch). Any, or all, of them could garner an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />I had begun to doze about a quarter of the way into the film, but then woke up almost with a start as I realized that CLOSER is an exceptional adult film, without visually explicit sex or violence, that brutally shows grown-ups in dysfunctional relationships behaving at their very worst. Truly, as is indicated by a line in KINSEY:<br /><br />"Sex is a dangerous game. If you're not careful, it can cut you wide open."</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"Closer" begins quite traditionally: two strangers fall in love. Dan (Jude Law), an aspiring novelist, cannot help but feeling immensely attracted to Alice (Natalie Portman), a young American waitress and stripper who is in London escaping from a failed relationship. But nothing last forever, and after some time he meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer, and feels attracted to her. The film's subtitle says it all: "If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking".<br /><br />Nothing happens right away, but from then onwards, things go downhill for Alice and Dan. Yes, they don't break up, but Dan is already mentally involved in another relationship, even if he is too coward to leave Alice, and although he knows that Anna won't go out with him. Dan is so obsessed with Anna that he even impersonates her in a sex-chat, unintentionally paving the way for the meeting of Anna with her future husband, Larry (Clive Owen).<br /><br />Eventually Dan, Alice, Anna and Larry take part in a twisted dance of deceit, guilt and anger. Betrayal, lack of trust, and relationships gone sour are the themes of "Closer". This isn't  a movie about love, but rather one about attraction, lust and lies.<br /><br />What is the truth?. What is love?. Can we just decide not to be in love?. As you see this movie, you will ask yourself those questions and quite a few more. The characters are not specially lovable, but they are somehow fascinating, in the way snakes sometimes are. All the same, their acting is really superb. Natalie Portman, in particular, was outstanding as Alice. Innocent yet seductive, vulnerable and worldweary, Portman delivers some of the more striking lines in the film, for instance when Alice says to Larry that "lying is the most fun a girl can have while keeping her clothes on".<br /><br />Mike Nichols did a wonderful job directing a movie out of Patrick Marber's play. However, you should be warned that he uses explicit language in order to shock the spectator, and achieves his aim quite well. Also, at times the emotions displayed by the characters are so strong that you will be too close for comfort.<br /><br />This is a film about the kind of relationship you hope you will never have, one based on lies. It is also a movie where truth isn't specially important: it is merely a excuse so characters will have (and do) what they want. If you don't mind the subject and the language, you will enjoy this movie, because it has good actors, and it provides you the opportunity of knowing exactly what NOT to do in a relationship.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>Four of the most physically attractive and artistically talented actors of the Big Screen come together under the direction of the brilliant Mike Nichols to perform in "Closer," an adaptation of Patrick Marber's brutal play, and the result is 104 minutes of utter depression and angst. I thoroughly appreciate the performances of Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owens and Natalie Portman. Their acting skills are not in question here, and frankly, they're all a pleasure to watch. Eye-candy aside, however, I just viewed the movie and feel like someone hit me over the head with a sledgehammer - not a state I appreciate, nor one I would pay to return to. "Closer" is a film about four loathsome people - actually only three are detestable, one is just terribly self-destructive, which is why she hangs out with the others. Although not devoid of merit, this is a cold and wounding piece that left me raw. I am not warning you away. But please do consider my comments before you commit to watch this film. Think aftermath.<br /><br />Dan, (Law), and Alice, (Portman), give each other the eye as they walk toward each other on a London street. She is luscious and so is he. When she steps off the curb and is hit by a cab, Dan is by her side in a second. Lying in the street, Alice regains consciousness, looks up at him and says, "Hello stranger." As he accompanies her to the Emergency Room we discover that he is a journalist - a novelist wannabe - who writes obituaries by day. She is a former stripper from New York City, on a trip across the big Pond. The chemistry between the two is palpable and they hook right up.<br /><br />A year or so later Dan is being photographed for his newly published novel's back cover. The book is about the life of his live-in love, Alice. Anna, (Roberts), is the talented photographer, who specializes in making portraits of strangers. As she snaps away and poses Dan, he makes a play for her. They talk, flirt, kiss passionately - and then Anna discovers he is taken. She makes it clear to Dan that she is recently divorced and not about to mess up any one else's life. He is in a relationship with Alice. He is not available. Period! Alice comes to meet Dan at the studio. She senses something's up very quickly. Then Anna takes Alice's photograph, while tears run down the poor girl's face.<br /><br />Dan becomes obsessed with Anna and stalks her, unbeknownst to Alice. Shortly after the scene at the photography studio, we are introduced to Larry, (Owen), a dermatologist. He is fooling around in a sex chat room on the Internet, having torrid cyber sex with a person he believes to be a woman named Anna. It is really Dan. The outcome of this online tete-a-tete is a set-up for Larry to meet the real Anna at the aquarium. Dan's prank, revenge for the brush-off he received, results in a romance between Larry and Anna. Then the real fooling around begins.<br /><br />Four former strangers, all remotely connected, have become two couples. Each person seems to love his/her mate, yet are compelled to destroy their love, and each other's relationships. Betrayal is a characteristic three of the four share. Dan lusts after Anna, and believes himself "in love" with her, because Anna doesn't "need him." Dan also loves Alice, who loves him madly, but she is too needy. Larry is crazy about Anna. He says it is love, yet people who love each other certainly don't act as manipulative and nasty as Larry does. But then, with Anna, manipulation may the only game in town. Anna is chronically depressed and doesn't think she deserves to be happy. She wants Dan, but he is not available, so she commits to Larry. Then she becomes unhappy and decides that deception may not be so terrible after all. And Larry, who is not to be underestimated, is ruthlessly capable of anything in order to get what he wants. Three characters are narcissistic, cruel, totally obsessed with pain and wrecking emotional havoc. The fourth, Alice, simply seems to hate herself. Is there a plot here? No!! As a character study, what's there to study? There is nothing complex about these people, nor their interactions. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being sublimely happy and 1 being suicidally depressed, these four never manage a 5.<br /><br />Natalie Portman does a superb job, bringing an appealing freshness and vulnerability to the edgy, jaded Alice. Clive Owen's character is the most complex, and his range of emotions really gets a work-out here. He is charming as Anna's suitor, enraged as the betrayed lover, and relentless as the gamesman out for revenge. Jude Law, the cad, comes on strong until his legs are knocked out from under him. Then he is appropriately devastated. Not pretty, but talented. And Julia Roberts, whom I love, is quiet, depressed and odious in her betrayals. The dialogue is very good at times, with snappy, caustic one-liners. My rating is more about personal preference than the movie's overall worth. While this may be an interesting cinematic experience for many, it gave me a headache.<br /><br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Directed by Mike Nicholls<br />Starring Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, Jude Law and Julia Roberts<br />104 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: LPCM 5.1 (48kHz, 16-bit)<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Italian: LPCM 5.1 (48kHz, 16-bit)<br />Italian: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Korean, Thai<br /><br />I used to confuse this film with Control (a Joy Division biopic), because Closer is also the name of Joy Division's last studio album.<br /><br />Mike Nichols (The Graduate) was in his 70s when he directed Closer and times have changed a lot since the days of The Graduate (1967). Both are excellent films though, despite the change.<br /><br />What elevates Closer from the pack is the writing. Patrick Marber wrote the play and also adapted the screenplay. If you have ever seen a TV series starring Steve Coogan, Marber probably wrote it. He has a talent for writing comedy and it's the type of comedy I like. That said, Closer is not a comedy; it's a drama with plenty of humor in it.<br /><br />Good actors can't really succeed without good writing, but this has both. All four do good work here. It has the feel of a Woody Allen film in some ways and also reminds me of Glengarry Glen Ross as both were adapted from plays. The dialogue comes at you at a fast pace and the actors play off one another well. Some conversations are a joy to experience.<br /><br />Both men sleep with both women (not at the same time) and the story deals with the relationships in an amusing way. The main point of the film is to show how much people lie to one another. Even when they think they are speaking absolute truth, it often turns out to be a lie. Are they saying these things to convince themselves of their good intentions? Are lies preferable to truth in some instances?<br /><br />The 104 minutes seem to pass very quickly. I was caught up in the story and the lives of these four people. It's more a romantic drama than a romantic comedy, despite the witty lines that appear throughout the story.<br /><br />I'm not sure which character I liked the most. They all have redeeming qualities. It's just a fun thing to experience and the writing is smart. I think the actors enjoyed delivering this wonderful dialogue. Owen and Portman received Oscar nominations for their performances.<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>I must confess, I've never quite understood all the hoopla surrounding Julia Roberts. She is, to me, at best only slightly above average looking. I've never been particularly floored by her acting, either, since she seems to always be playing the same character: Julia Roberts. In this movie, it is beyond my comprehension that anyone would leave Natalie Portman for her. What is her overwhelming appeal supposed to be here, exactly?<br /><br />With that said, I was initially unsure if I even liked this movie. However, as it went on I found myself pulled into the tangled web of lies and deceit surrounding the lives of these people. Then there's Natalie in a highly erotic scene as a private dancer for Clive Owen... This scene is so steamy you'll need to run a dehumidifier while watching it!<br /><br />Love, lust, lies, loss... Life. If there wasn't something here that felt basically true, both about relationships and what they reveal about ourselves, the movie would have failed. But there is something -- indeed, much.</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>To be honest, my favorite part was the beautiful video 'The Blower's Daughter' by Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan, in the Special Features...<br /><br />Closer is a movie that just doesn't live up to the premise or the potential generated by such an outstanding cast. While it plays with contrasting the Apollonian versus Dionysian energies of the two male characters, and the interplay of the scattered energies that the colliding relationships create, it somehow falls short of working, for me.<br /><br />Yes, it's about the futility of obsession, as was Lolita, and the underlying purity of Natalie Portman's character hints at a tip of the literary hat to Goethe's Faust, but Closer never settles into a believable flow.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, Jude Law's Dan actually has the chance to be happy with both women at different times, but blows it by obsessing over details and control issues. So does the Sleazy Doc, but in a different way.<br /><br />Life is not about 'cheat but don't tell', it's about 'don't cheat', as Portman's Alice/Jane rightly suggested - that there is always a pivotal moment when you can stop yourself from falling in love inappropriately or creating an inappropriate  sexual liaison.<br /><br />Just be glad you are not inside their heads.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>This is a complex tale about love double-crosses between two couples.  There isn't a heck of a lot of development of the relationships, and people do have sex willy-nilly, but it is fascinating to watch the power struggle between members of each twosome.  Those who have the power early in the film lose it by the climax, and emotional havoc is brought on again and again.  The film portrays how easy it is for a person to be attracted to more than one other person, each for different reasons.<br /><br />The film can be a little difficult to watch, as great lengths of time pass between scenes with no warning.  Everything comes together by the end.  Natalie Portman's performance (also her stripping scene) are absolutely not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>This movie dares to shock with its explicit language and demanding performances. Jude Law (Road To Perdition, Cold Mountain) plays Dan, a writer for the obits who crosses paths one day with a lovely redheaded woman named Alice, played by Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith, Garden State). The 2 soon fall for each other and become a couple. Later, Law falls for a photographer woman named Anna, played by Julia Roberts (Confessions Of A Dangerous Minds, Oceans 12) Law writes a book called The Aquarium which sinks. Law plays a joke on Doctor Larry, played by Clive Owen (King Arthur, Second Sight) in which Law and Owen talk to each other in dirty talk in a London Sex Chat Room. Owen meets Roberts at the Aquarium in which Law told him to go to and finds out he was a part of a sick joke. Later, Owen and Roberts get married...Law is still in love with Roberts....Law leaves Portman.....Roberts wants to divorce Owen...Owen falls in love with Portman but he still is in love with Roberts...and you get my point. Nasty...Nasty dialouge in this movie and some nudity but just plain raunchy talk. Law is always good, Roberts is magnificent, Portman plays a role she hasnt done before and she is very, very fantastic...she plays a stripper and Owen delivers in a new role for him as well..he plays a a-hole with gusto...Owen can play anything and still be as good as he is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>My three favorite films from 2004, "Sideways", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", and "Before Sunset" have a lot in common; they all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances.<br /><br />There are more similarities in three my favorite films - they all have characters I liked, I care about; often, weak and certainly not perfect; sometimes, confused and immature but sympathetic, and real.<br /><br />This is not the case with "Closer". My problem is that none of its four main characters was at least slightly interesting, appealing, likable or just realistic. And it is not the biggest problem that they were not likable - I can live with that and still love and enjoy the film. Examples - Nichols's own fascinating debut, "Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf". George and Martha (Liz Taylor and Richard Burton) were a couple from hell but like a theme song in "Closer" goes, "I could not take my eyes off them". I still remember Taylor saying in the end of the film, "George and Martha: Sad, sad, sad" and it was sad. I'd learned something about the characters that were deep and complex, troubled and disturbed. They were persons, the human beings, not the caricatures. Another example, Ingmar Bergman's "Scenes from the marriage":<br /><br />"Bergman and his leading actors Liv Ullmann and Arland Josephson give one of the most truthful, honest, heartbreaking and credible portraits of a couple, one of the most intense character studies ever done on film. For five hours, we share twenty years from the lives of Johan and Marianne as well as their love, hate, misunderstandings, insecurities, anger, jealousy, denial, sadness, pain, despair, and loss. We witness the moments of incredible tenderness and unexpected and shocking violence, both physical and mental. There are no depth that they have not descended in the search of themselves and the meaning of their relationship."<br /><br />As far as a film about the selfish, self-obsessed, unsympathetic characters goes, "Faithless", directed by Liv Ullmann and written by Ingmar Bergman could be the most similar in its theme to "Closer" and they both have almost identical twist plot toward the end. The difference is huge, though. "Faithless" has a high and unbearable tragedy that characters brought upon themselves, "Closer" is smug, full of itself and tries to hide its emptiness behind often disgusting and unnecessary dirty language. Did I learn something about four beautiful people in "Closer"? Sure. Dan's sperm tastes like Larry's but sweeter; Alice's c*** tastes like heaven, and Anna does not kiss strange men and does not understand why sex is so important. I don't want to get closer to learn all this; instead, I'd like to respond like Helen Sinclair, "No, no, don't speak. Don't speak. Please don't speak. Please don't speak. No. No. No. Go. Go... Don't speak."<br /><br />Enormously talented and famous (and rightly so) Mike Nichols made an elegantly looking, well acted (Natalie Portman and Clive Owen are very good) and quite amusing film which is a screen adaptation of a popular play of the same title. Popular or not, the play was not a great work of writing and its problems are very obvious after adaptation to the big screen.<br /><br />2.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2004 film isn't for everybody.  It's slick and clever and requires full attention to appreciate.  When I first started watching, I wasn't prepared for this and nearly turned it off because it was a little  hard to follow.<br /><br />All that changed however, and, by the time I had been watching for fifteen minutes, I was completely engrossed.  I did a double take, sat back and relaxed and enjoyed the unfolding of this complicated story directed by Mike Nichols, based on a play by Patrick Marber.  The acting was exceptional too.  And even though the actors were easily recognizable film stars, they each portrayed their characters so well, that I soon only saw them as the people they were portraying.<br /><br />The story is set in London, where, in an early scene Natalie Portman and Jude Law fall in love.  She's a young American with dyed purple hair; he's a Brit who writes obituaries for a newspaper.  Later, he writes a book and has his photo taken by Anna, a professional photographer, played by Julia Roberts.  He's wildly attracted to her but she rejects him.  He's angry and decides to play a practical joke.  This involves the internet and a chatroom in which he writes explicit romantic notes to Clive Owens and pretends to be Anna.  This causes Anna and Clive Owens to meet and they soon become lovers.<br /><br />This just the beginning through, and the rest of the story plays out in increasingly complex and interesting ways.  These four people deceive each other, lie, tell piercingly brutal truths and suffer complex emotional pain.  There are constant surprises and turns and twists.  Each character took turns at being the one I hated.  And then things change and I was forced to re-think the scene I just saw as the film becomes faster paced as it moves along.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this film and give it one of my highest recommendations.  However, it is only for those with a sophisticated appreciation of human complexity.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>Closer is a unique movie in that it's not a typical Hollywood movie filled with Hollywood actors.  Part of the thrill, I think, people will get from the film is seeing "Superstars" acting dirty.  And you can certainly watch this film and get that thrill.  But, that's just the surface of this intense movie.<br /><br />I do think the DVD is giving people a false message with the review line from Times, "At last, a love story for adults."  Unless an adult love story involves backstabbing and eventual destruction of relationships, this isn't true.  However, I don't think that an "adult" relationship necessarily involves the harsh, harsh situations that occur in this movie.  A mature look at relationships, yes.<br /><br />In fact, what I liked most about this movie is the different perspective of love.  Most romantic movies revolve around a person trying to get with another person.  This movie transcends this idea by showing a period of time in the lives of four people.  Not only that, but it shows that love can sometimes be destructive as is evident in the way the movie unfurls.  It's sometimes hard to watch because you get frustrated with how the people act, but I give that as praise because the characters are doing what's in their character.<br /><br />Another interesting thing is that people will flit in and out of the four person story but we really don't pay attention to them.  I can't truly remember any characters besides the four main ones.  And what this does to the story is show that, to these four people, no one else matters.  They are so wrapped up in their game of love/war that nothing else matters, life passes them by.  It's kind of a morality tale in that aspect because it not only shows the destructive ways in which they act but also that they are so caught up in their own lives that they don't notice anyone else.  Very effective.<br /><br />The acting is terrific.  I'm not a fan of Julia Robert's choice in roles usually and was surprised to see her character in this because it's such a change of pace with her usual Runaway Bride/Best Friend's Wedding/Pretty Woman characters.  The dialogue is very explicit and frank in dealing with sex and might offend those not expecting it.  It's not a movie to take little kids to, that's for sure.<br /><br />There's not too much "physical" action in the movie.  Because it's based on a play, the action is represented in the dialogue.  What's interesting and sometimes darkly humorous is the verbal warfare that occurs between the characters.  Every scene is a war of wits as each character has an agenda and they use words to get to it.  These situations can become darkly humorous and witty as we see two characters sparring with words.  But this might be a turn off for some because, while there is a threat of violence that lingers between the lines, not too much physical action happens in the movie.<br /><br />There is a song that flits over the opening and closing of the movie and it really is effective in conveying a sadness to the movie.  The song, which I spent a long time trying to find, is "The Blower's Daughter" by Damien Rice if anyone is interested.  It's on the cd "O" which you can find here.<br /><br />As far as the DVD goes, there's basically nothing besides the movie.  However, the DVD is a superbit edition which has been mastered in high definition with excellent sound which is probably why there isn't many extras since the superbit takes up much more room on a DVD.  But if you have a TV and receiver to run it you will be in for a real treat.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough.  If you are interested in seeing an atypical Hollywood movie about the thing called love and aren't put off by a word heavy movie, then this is an excellent place to look.  It will frustrate you, entertain you, and make you think.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Mike Nichols<br /><br />"Closer" is a film about beginnings and endings.  We are given a look into how relationships begin, and how they end.  Very little of what happens in between is ever seen on screen.  Because of this, there are time gaps in the story of up to a year, but after the first gap and you figure out just what the structure is, it is barely noticeable.  "Closer" begins (appropriately enough) with the meeting of Alice (Natalie Portman) and Dan (Jude Law).  Alice is walking down a London sidewalk.  Dan is following her, observing.  It isn't clear if he is stalking her, or just admiring her beauty.  When Alice looks the wrong way when crossing the road, she is American, she is struck by a car.  Dan is right there to get her help and this begins a flirtation and their relationship.<br /><br />Dan meets Alice.  Dan meets Anna.  Anna meets Larry.  Dan leaves Alice.  Anna leaves Larry.  Larry meets Alice.  To call "Closer" a romantic triangle would be to do the film a disservice, not to mention that there are four people involved in this "triangle".  The romantic pairings up and hooking up is the method these characters use to try to fulfill something that is lacking in their lives.  But the real point here is the conversation that comes about because of it.  The conversation that happens at the beginning and the ending of a relationship is the most interesting, and the most intense because the emotions are heightened and more focused, both with joy and with pain.  The dialogue is sharp, incredibly intelligent (I've never come across conversation like this before in my life), it feels realistic, flirtatious, and very sexual.  In particular, the dialogue at the endings of relationships is quite graphic.<br /><br />"Closer" is all about character and humanity, and not so much about giving a traditional plot.  The four main actors here do a fantastic job in "Closer" and collectively give the performance of the year.  Natalie Portman is likely going to pick up a Best Supporting Actress Nomination (if not win) for her portrayal of Alice, the all grown up but still somewhat childish waif of a stripper.  Clive Owen, however, steals the show (as does Portman) with every scene he is in.  He is passionate, intense, and perfect.  As is, I would suggest, this movie.  It is not an upbeat movie, but it has such a warmth to it even as the characters are all treating each other really badly.  This is a very impressive movie and one which I sincerely hope gets a Best Picture nomination come Oscar time.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br></body></html>

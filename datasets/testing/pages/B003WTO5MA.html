But, I don't think there inappropriate."<br /><br />- The Lutz family tries to figure out whats for dinner in their haunted house on Ocean Avenue, while an interviewer prys the truth out of the real George Lutz on what he thinks of the remake to "The Amityville Horror"<br /><br />Bad remake to the sub-par 1979 original. The true horror here is the film being touted as based on a true story, & the truth being all but left out of the film (once again, MGM didn't consult with George Lutz & when Lutz tried to communicate with the studio he got slapped with a, still pending, lawsuit). With MGM hitting rock bottom financially (Sony Entertainment bought MGM out this past week) & the studios last big hit (the last Bond movie, Die Another Day) was over 2+ years ago its no wonder that MGM gave the go ahead to Michael Bay (of all people) to do a remake of one of its older films. The results, like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just plain suck.<br /><br />In November of 1973, in Amityville, New York, the Defeo family was massacred by the families oldest son, Ronnie Jr. (its still the most heinous act ever committed in the village's history).<br /><br />One year later, George & Kathy Lutz, with Kathy's three kids & the family dog, Harry, move into 112 Ocean Avenue after buying it for a steal at roughly eighty thousand dollars. 28 days later the family flee their house in terror saying that the house is so very haunted and vowing never to return leaving their personal belongings behind.<br /><br />The above statements are true & are well documented (DeFeo is serving six life sentences for his crimes against his family). What isn't true is the events that take place throughout the remake of this film. The real problem is, if a film states that its based on a true story, then the film should definitely stick to the true source material that inspires it.<br /><br />Here is the truth according to George Lutz:<br /><br />- There were cold spots throughout the house, including the basement, kitchen, & sewing room. He did always feel a chill and was sick but never was he obsessed with chopping firewood, or carrying an axe around the house. According to George, he never chopped wood at all! He also didn't kill the family dog (thats just brutal).<br /><br />- The Jody entity wasn't a girl, or related to the DeFeo's, but was a pig-like demon that made "friends" with George's stepdaughter. In the A&E History's Mysteries episode on the house, George states that he saw two cloven-hoof like footprints next to his stepdaughters footprints outside in the snow throughout the backyard. At night, George & Kathy would spot a pair of glowing animal-like eyes peering in through the windows of the house, no matter what floor of the house they were on. One evening, George breaks down in anger & throws a chair at the eyes smashing the window it was peering into, with the entity letting out a high pitched piglike squeal & snorting off into the night. This part of the story still gives me the creeps.<br /><br />- Father Piccoro did bless the house. While blessing a small room on the second floor, Piccaro did feel something slap the back of his head, telling him in a whisper to get out of the house. He told the Lutz family as long as no one was to room up there, the room would be fine. Kathy says that the room was going to be turned into a sewing room.<br /><br />- On one of the worst nights, George awoke to find his wife slowly levitating out of bed, while on the floor above he could hear his stepkids scream and cry in terror as their beds were slammed up & down on the floor. Harry, the family dog, was pacing in fear and throwing up. George was helpless being mysteriously pinned to the bed, unable to help his family.<br /><br />There is a lot more. Kathy finding the red room in the basement, windows that would open on their own - no matter how hard you nail them shut, etc. Check out www.amityvillehorror.com, the website that George Lutz operates and discover what really happened during those 28 days with the Lutz family. Truth is creepier thatn fiction.<br /><br />As for the house, it still stands on Ocean Avenue (different number though, I think its 108). The colonial windows are long gone (the "eyes" of the house). The real horror is the house is now painted yellow. ewww.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>When George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) and his wife Kathy (Melissa George) move into a dilapidated, but cheap Dutch colonial in the peaceful community of Amityville, Long Island New York they are looking for a place to raise a family and settle down. But their house has a dark, disturbing history. When they ask the realtor about the history of the house and why it is so cheap she tells them that on 11/13/74, Ronald DiFeo, Jr. shot dead his parents and four younger siblings...just a year before.<br />A year later, the Lutzses, after 28 days of living in the house, escape, never to return...not even to pick up their possessions.<br />I approached this newest version of "The Amityville Horror" with skepticism in that so much innovation has occurred in the world of horror/thriller/mystery movies since the original version of 1979 (which I recently viewed again and found to be amatuerish at best and silly at worst), that I didn't expect much of this rehashing of an already told and re-told story. But director Andrew Douglas and writer Scott Kosar have set up the story and realized the film with such care and irrevocably palpable doom and despair, that all thoughts of those earlier versions soon vanish.<br />This Amityville is truly scary...horrific even and Ryan Reynolds, heretofore known as a light comic actor (remember him in the TV series 2 Guys and a Pizza...or some such nonsense), turns in an extraordinary performance as a man who slowly but surely succumbs to the evil and terror of the ghosts and demons of the house he has moved his family into.<br />"The Amityville Horror" is as frightening as you would had hoped "Ring2" to be and director Andrew Douglas deserves credit for bringing not just life, but revitalizing an old subject with goose bump inducing, stomach clenching events that are sure to keep you awake at night...in the time honored tradition of "The Exorcist."<br />Approach "The Amityville Horror" with care...you are likely to get a real glimpse of hell and profound damnation that you had not bargained for.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>The camera totally loves Ryan Reynolds from beginning to end, it follows him around one way or another, whether up close facial shots, eye shots, torso shots, and especially shirtless shots. It doesnt matter how stressed out he is, or becomes, the camera wants hunk in this spooky shadow of a well worn story of a family taken residence in a possessed and haunted house. From the reading of other reviewers the first movie still has bad karma. Ha, ha. Well, I liked the first movie not because of its execution (sorry) in style, but by some really memorable scenes that just creeped up on you that this movie doesnt have. Like the ill begotten nun who came to visit, or the psychic woman who immediately felt an outside presence of evil from within. These are the moments good movies make because they are lasting impressions of horror in any true good horror movie. Even the trivial encounter with a dragon statue and loss of money made the first one memorable which, by the way, this movie doesnt have.<br />What it does have is a well stressed family, and Ryan losing his grip with reality. The visuals and incorporated spooks are the results of more formulated horror movies of recent years. So in the midst of Hellraiser, Saw, and the like, this movie should please. If not, than munch your popcorn to Ryan's wonderful bod and puppy dog lost eyes in this haunted visual nightmare.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>The movie is a remake of the Original Which I prefer, I always prefer the Original, Remakes always are bad, this movie is not horrible, it is scary, but Great it is not, And Ryan Reynolds?

Reynolds is quite affecting as the tormented protagonist in this beefed-up 'reimagining' of Jay Anson's bestselling book, though the slow accumulation of details doesn't build to a satisfying whole. Miles better than the 1979 version, however. Oh, and Reynolds gets this reviewer's vote as Hunk of the Year - his shirtless scenes are a highlight of the entire picture. Drool, slobber!!...</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Michael Bay, who produced the remakes of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Fog", redid this amazing version of 1979's "Amityville Horror". The film recounts the haunting true story of how a family purchases a dream home, unknowing that a man killed his own entire family there. Once this new family moves in a series of unexplained events start happening with the father experiencing psychotic behavior to his loved ones. Hunk Ryan Reynolds (who has the best-looking abs of any actor I have seen) and Melissa George star as the leads.<br /> The film would go on to be the #1 movie in its opening weekend encompassing over 23 million dollars at the boxoffice. So far the movie has made over 100 million! Needless to say "The Amityville Horror" has become a certifed hit, although many critics have panned the film.<br /> The DVD features deleted scenes, Ryan Reynolds and producers commentary, featurettes on the making of the film, and more. The movie is in anamorphic widescreen, is 89 minutes long, and english, french, and spanish subtitles are included.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>I'm going to use the first few lines from my review of the original. In 1974, Ronald DeFeo brutally massacred his entire family via shotgun blasts while they were sleeping in their beds. One year later, the Lutz family moves into the same house. With 3 kids, it was too sweet a deal to pass up and was exactly what George and Kathy were looking for. And then just after a few days of moving in, strange things begin to occur. Most notably with George and also with their only daughter Amy. While George is beginning to go insane, Amy has made a new ghostly friend.<br /><br />I think the remake did an ok job in the story, but way overboard with the typical scares. While the original had a sort of drawn out story, it had the subtle scares. The remake though has a bit of better story at first, but uses the typical Hollywood scares that most of us are used to by now. The best thing I liked about the movie was them showing George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) going crazy. It was more in depth and Ryan played the part really well. It was actually funny in a dark way listening to Ryan talk crap to the family sometimes, because to him it seemed like he was ok, while they were the ones being idiots or badly behaving. I really think Ryan gets a lot less credit than he deserves as an actor. Sure he gets put into comedy roles such as Van Wilder and Waiting, but I think he can act. When he told one of the boys to hold the wood while he chopped and then grabbed his face and got all evil looking, I looked at my buddy and said "Dude, that would be really scary to see as a 12 year old if not now". I also like how the story leaves out a lot of the priest parts that I didn't like from the original. I also thought the children's scenes were a lot better than the original and made me feel for them a bit more.<br /><br />What I didn't like though was the typical jump scares that felt unnecessary, but somehow I understand why they are there. If they weren't there, I could see people getting bored with the movie. Not everyone, but a lot. There were a few good ones though like when we see Jody sitting with Amy during one scene and the mom doesn't see her. But man they used way too much of her to try and scare us. Sure, little dead kids are scary, but come on. I liked how it was left to our imagination (sort of) in the original if she was there or not. The remake gives us no doubt. At least they didn't use some bad effects as her eyes outside a window this time...heh. And the ending was horrible... the way they wrapped it up was just bad. I almost thought I was watching 13 Ghosts in the end while George Lutz was walking past cages. Then he sees the main killer ghost... ridiculous.<br /><br />In the end, I'd give it a rent. I liked it just enough to buy it, mainly because of the character development of George Lutz and also some of the scenes. It can be a good movie for some though, and probably a fun date movie if you like horror.<br /><br />P.S. - They ruined the `Get Out' scene (my favorite scene) in this one in my opinion. It was so fake compared to the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>From the opening scenes we're assured this is going to be a horrific remake, brutal in delivery and high on the scare factor.  With almost every horror film being remade these days it would only make sense that someone would eventually tackle `The Amityville Horror' and much to my amazement this is a valiant effort.  The choppy filming adds to the air of claustrophobia and panic and keeps you paranoid over what's to happen next.  Another A+ was the cast, Reynolds blowing me away with his complex performance.  He was able to go from caring and concerned to the ultimate evil within blinks of an eye and none of it seemed forced.  He was truly terrifying.<br /><br />The film is of course based on true events.  My family actually knows a family that once lived in that house, of course years after these events, and they too experienced problems, nothing like what happened to the Lutz family, but problems none the less.  George (Ryan Reynolds) and his new bride Kathy (Melissa George) have bought and moved into the house once own by the DiFeo's just about a year after their eldest son Ronald murdered his entire family in their sleep laying claim that voices within the house told him to kill.  It's because of this very event that the Lutz's can afford the home, for no one else will take it.<br /><br />Upon moving in with their three children (all from Kathy's previous marriage) things start to turn ugly, almost immediately.  George is seeing things, their youngest daughter Chelsea (Chloe Moretz) is talking to a young girl named Jodie and Kathy is seeing a dark and disturbing change in her husband.  George is also starting to scare the kids, especially the eldest son Billy (Jesse James, the little brat from `Butterfly Effect').  As the days count down to day 28 (Ronald killed his family on the 28th day after he moved into the basement, which is where George has been working) things start to drastically get worse and the Lutz family is becoming more and more fearful of what the outcome may be.<br /><br />As everyone knows, the Lutz family flees the house on that 28th night, never to return, not even for their belongings, and upon hearing that one may think this can't be all that scary for we already know that no one dies...but it's not the prospect of death that makes this film so terrifying, it's watching what happened to the minds of those involved, watching George change right before your eyes into a monster, watching him stalk his family and try to butcher them is downright horrifying, and although it may end on a somewhat relaxed note (in that they all get away) it's not in the slightest bit a happy note, for what they went through in that house is enough to scar even the strongest of individuals.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>So many reviews of re-makes rip the film apart because it was not the original. The new Amityville Horrow is not the original, but it is a darn good film in its own right.<br /><br />I found the film sexy, scary, well-acted, and very entertaining. Ryan Reynolds as George Lutz, and Melissa George as Kathy Lutz, put in very believable performances. Their surrounding cast of children add to the film's immersion and intangibles as well.<br /><br />I know I have seen the first Amityville Horror, and to be honest I don't recall much other than a lot of flies (I am nearly 40, and was 12 when it came out), but I can't imagine how it could be much better than the remake. Don't get me wrong, I am sure it is a great film, but this version is pretty darn good for a horror film.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it because of the critics who say "It isn't the original", you're missing out.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 59<br /><br />31 (out of 50).

So I was looking forward to seeing the remake of "The Amityville Horror."  It's a pretty simple formula: haunted house with secret(s), unsuspecting family, things start getting weird, etc.  The original 1979 version had a certain cheesy charm, but not enough to bar a remake.  Well, I was wrong.  The new "Amityville," is a really bad movie that makes the older version seem better than it actually was.  And it can't even stick with the original (no floating pig eyes outside the second story window!), but goes poaching on "The Shining," "Poltergeist," and other post 1979 horror efforts.  What a mess.  The movie does establish that actor Ryan Reynolds (George Lutz in the film) has got an impressive six pack - which is, I suppose, something when you can't act.  Seriously, there's very little character development, and as a result there is little real horror generated.  It's hard to care about these people.  The kids are good. - especially actor Jesse James, playing conflicted 12 year old Billy Lutz.  But their parents, as played by George and Reynolds, hardly rise above walking talking manikins.  Maybe Romero could use them for his next "Dead" movie. The net result has me wanting the 1979 version with a hammy Rod Steiger, a moody James Brolin and a screaming Margot Kidder, and lots of flies.  Oh, and a creepy house with "eyes" that stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>What's old is new again. That seems to be what studios are thinking in Hollywood. Old TV shows are being made into movies, and old movies are getting updates. Most of the time, they don't turn out well, and are unnecessary. But this film is a little bit different than the other horror film remakes of late. The original film is not really held in high regards or is much of a classic, really. It's not "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Psycho", or "Dawn Of The Dead". The original film was a film that was in need of a remake. It was open for a change and a bit of a face lift. This is the first time a horror movie remake was done that needed to be done. And it proves quite effective. Based on a true story(well, half of a true story anyway), the new film seems to take some liberty with the original material and changes some things around. All for the better if you ask me. Super buff Ryan Reynolds and lovely Melissa George star as George and Kathy Lutz, a Long Island couple who move into a big new house on the waterfront. It doesn't take long for weird things to happen, the little girl to befriend a dead girl, and for George to start snapping and acting like a crazed lunatic. Why?. A year earlier, Ron DeFeo killed his entire family with a shotgun. He claimed that he heard voices and they told him to do it. Apparently, those same voices are now invading George's psyche. The movie is a lot quicker and more brutal than the original, but I would of preferred the movie stuck to the original's longer running time. Horror movies today are so short that everything happens so fast and is over before you know it. The end credits begin 81 minutes into the movie, while the original was hitting the 2 hour mark. The casting was great. Reynolds, who was still in "Blade" condition, played the role well. He got the James Brolin beard going, and he played crazy very well. Was very believeable when he would go from good to bad. Melissa does an adequate job as the put upon wife. Phillip Baker Hall has the Rod Steiger role here as the priest who comes to the house. It's a small role, but Hall does what he can with it. The kids are well cast. They are not typical cute kids who walked out of a Gap ad. They look real. The look of the film is exceptional as well. The direction and cinematography is sharp, vibrant, and alive. It is very nicely done. Plus, the year is 1975, and the film really does a good job of capturing the look and feel of it, and has everyone wearing appropriate clothing. The opening minutes of Ron DeFeo's shotgun outburst towards his family was strikingly done. It's quite easy to say that this movie was better than the original and first two sequels combined. But what about the actual story?. We all know the murders are real, but anything else?. Personally, I see the "hearing voices" thing as something DeFeo made up seeking a shorter sentence, and something that the new owners heard and carried further. I don't believe in the Lutz' ghost story, but a great ghost story it does make. So, there are a lot of great set pieces here. The mood and vibe is felt, and the music is good without it being too over the top. I think the film would of benefitted a bit more if it were a bit longer, and not have everything come together so incredibly fast. Plus, who wouldn't want a babysitter like that?. There are chills and thrills here and there, and some startling visuals. Things go crazy and the acting is pretty darn good to back it all up. In this day and age, things are becoming too safe and PG-13 rated. That's okay if a movie calls for it, but some don't and are watered down for more butts in theater seats. I'm glad to say that this is an R rated horror film. That alone is worth praising.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>From director turned producer Michael Bay, who produced New Line Cinema's 2003 remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, comes this floundering remake of 1979's Amityville Horror.  Wasting no time in getting to the shocks and disregarding any logic whatsoever, the film shows George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George), along with Kathy's three children from her recently deceased ex-husband, move into an infamous house where grisly murders occured not even a year before.  After that, the viewer is slammed with quick edits, distorted faces, demonic voices, and disorienting camera angles, with no pity given to Ryan Reynolds' character at all as he wastes no time going insane and hunting down his family.  While many won't agree, this remake is actually better than the original, but then again the original wasn't that good to begin with.  Based on the supposed true story, the Amityville Horror is worth a look for horror buffs, and with all the PG-13 rated horror movies to be released as of late it's nice to see a new horror film with some blood and gore, but don't expect anything special out of it at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>At 3:15 a.m. on November 13th, 1974, in a lavish home in the suburb of Amityville, New York, 23 yr. old Ronald Defeo, Jr. brutally murdered his father, mother, and younger siblings as they slept, claiming as his motive that mysterious "voices" instructed him in his actions. The following year, newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz moved into that same house with Kathy's three children from a previous marriage. To the Lutzes, the bargain-priced home was a dream come true, despite the tragedy they knew had taken place there before. They were eager to start a life together in their new home on Ocean Avenue, but their dreams would soon be shattered by an evil that seemed to possess the very heart of the house itself. The events of their 28 day stay have come to be known as "the Amityville Horror."<br /><br />While the real Lutz family may justly dispute the film's "Based on a true story" header and slanderously false depiction of George himself, thanks to the Hollywood exaggerations and inventions woven into their story for this and the original 1979 film, they stand by their original allegations of their nightmarish experiences in the house at 112 Ocean Avenue. In other words, popular claims that the family `fessed up to a colossal hoax are completely untrue. This fact, thankfully, leaves the legendary mystery of the Amityville house intact. And, while we no doubt feel compassion for those who suffered and died in that possibly evil home, the knowledge of some basis in truth is what really makes the Amityville story so fascinating.<br /><br />The original film, while it was no doubt sensationalized, was probably a closer account of the Lutzes' own story than the new version starring Ryan Reynolds as an unbelievably ripped (did people take personal fitness to THAT level in the 70s?) George Lutz, and the beautiful (but forgets to dye her eyebrows to match her hair) Melissa George as his wife, Kathy. In this 2005 retelling of America's most famous haunting, a variety of story changes result in what still adds up to be an enjoyably chilling experience, even for fans of the original movie. The folks at MGM have cooked up a remake with some real scares here, possibly among the best I've ever seen. The theme of the Lutzes' struggle to hold together throughout the events remains intact (if a bit overly brutalized), though the strong focus on the family and the house makes for such a small cast and so few locales that an almost low budget feeling seems to loom. The original film still feels like the better one, most likely because of memorable elements like the highly superior "Get out!" scene, the much more disturbing pig incarnation of "Jodie," and the repeated use of that spine-tingling theme music. I can't even recall if the classic theme was used in this remake. It also had a stronger atmosphere, and much more believability, in part, I'm sure, because it was so much more real. The actors did not look like models in the 70s, and this is one reason horror films of that time are so frightening compared to the eye-candy flicks of today. Everything nowadays is perhaps a bit too crisp and perfect, including the actors and actresses. Great to look at, but not easy to relate to. On the other hand, the performances were excellent, and the horrific imagery used in this remake is truly blood-curdling. They really hit the nail on the head with the scares in this flick, even if they botched the "Get out!" voice that was so frightening in the classic. The new film also provides an eerie new back story, something sorely lacking from the original film. There's also a great revision of the babysitter sequence, featuring either the worst babysitter in history, or the best, depending on who you are in the household.<br /><br />"The Amityville Horror" remake maintains itself throughout, and is more than worthy of viewing and eventually owning. Not as good as the first as an overall movie, but visually more frightening than anything I can remember seeing offhand. Should please the typical horror movie fan. Also highly recommended for fans of demonic haunted house tales, the direct to DVD feature "Dead Birds."</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"The Amityville Horror" is a tawdry, low-rent version of "The Shining" from its lead, Ryan Reynolds, to its obsession with Jolly Rancher blood, ghosts, torture chambers and relentless, blaring "horror" music over genuine suspense. It's 100 minutes of discomfort and unintentional laughs.<br /><br />The "true" background of this story was fodder enough for two films 25 year ago: In 1975, Bob and Kathy Lutz (Reynolds and Melissa George) moved into the Long Island mini-mansion where, a year before, Robbie "Butch" DiFeo murdered his family. The Lutzes knew the history just before they bought the house; 28 days later, they fled it, left all their possessions and co-wrote a book about their experiences.<br /><br />There's been enough debate over whether Lutzes were telling the truth or concocting a hoax for money. Nevertheless, what the family "claimed" happened was far more subtle and interesting than this movie, which opens wide the horror encyclopedia, plucks a few entries and smears them on the screen whether they make sense or not.<br /><br />Consider: When the buxom, foul-mouthed babysitter - never had one of those in a scary flick - has to be hauled away in a straitjacket on the fourth or fifth day, why is the family curiously isolated afterward? No media, no paranormalists, no cops. Or how about when the Lutzes' 10-year-old daughter is lured out to the ledge of roof by a ghost? Do you stick in the house no matter how insistent the father? Is the local priest really useful at that point? "The Amityville Horror" is straddled between being restrained and a Rob Zombie picture, which is to say it's shameless, trading on its tie-in to a "true story" while it peddles demonic nonsense.<br /><br />Reynolds tackles Bob Lutz with relish, transforming into a frothing wild man. The performance is cartoonish - he's ridiculously buff, practically harlequin - and geared toward the Jack Nicholson wig-out in "The Shining. But Reynolds, a comic actor attempting to cross the drama bridge, is rabid, seething. Melissa George is just another panicky, freckled-face blonde, and the three kids are not memorable enough to mention the actors who played them. George C. Scott is dead now, so Philip Baker Hall plays the senile, befuddled priest. Someone will inevitably say on the DVD commentary what an honor it was to have Philip Baker Hall on set for a whole day.<br /><br />"The Amityville Horror" gets more absurd when we learn the source of the evil, involving Indian burial grounds, some old male witch,  torture chambers and torrents of bloods raining down on Reynolds. It's disgusting, not frightening. But a lot of horror movies confuse the two.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I came into this film with low expectations and walked away enjoying this movie very much. Ryan Reynolds really impressed me with his acting ability and I really did buy into and got into the storyline. The ending seemed kind of weak, but made sense. There was a build up, and a fizzle ending, but it still didn't hurt the overall film. So, I don't know if you will enjoy the movie if you expect a lot, but if you come in with low expectations-you can only go up from there. A real enjoyable movie that worth watching at least once, but I don't know if I'd want to see it more than that.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>I wouldn't call this remake exactly a horror flick, it was more of an interpretation of the real life story the original Amityville Horror was based on with a few scary scenes added to pay homage to the original film.<br /><br />This movie is really about the secret tension that exists in most families and how at times it can get taken to far. A man moves into a house with his new wife and her children from previous sex and they all seem to get along until a demonic presence in the house possesses him and encourages him to kill them all. The same spirit that alledgedly possessed a man some years earlier and caused him to kill his siblings and parents in the same house this new family now lives in. In real life, the jury didn't buy that story, but who knows? In real estate that say that location is everything, so if any of you are thinking about buying a place, don't buy a house built on the gateway to Hell. It's a bad investment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>The Amityville Horror is a ridiculous remake; one of the worst horror films ever made. I never had expectations going into this mess, but the filmmakers had the chance to make a suspenseful and atmospheric horror film. Instead they opted for fast shots, cheap scares, and loads of blood. That's the problem with modern horror films. They aren't scary or atmospheric, they just try to shock the audience with violent images that never work. What really ticks me off about this film is that, even after the fact that the legend of the Amityville house was proved to be a fabrication between the Lutzes and DeFao's lawyer, this is still being advertized as a true story. In the words of George Lutz, the only truth in this film was  "that we moved into a house where murders took place. It's true that we knew about the murders before we bought the house and moved in. It's true that the people that moved in where named George and Kathy Lutz. And that we were married recently. That when we moved in, we were five months married. It's true that the house we moved into had a boathouse. And that we had a boat. It's true that we had a dog named Harry. And it's true that we had Kathy's three children. And that we had a telephone. That's it."<br /><br />The film portrays Lutz as a homicidal maniac trying to kill his family, which is not true. Nothing in this film is, so don't believe the 'true story' crap. Instead of Lutz suing MGM, they are now suing him for going against the film. If that's not reason enough to boycott this, I don't know what is,<br /><br />I am shocked at all the good reviews, this was horrible from beginning to end. Despite the fact that it takes place in the 70s, it does not have that feel. There is a reason this film was not screened for the critics. Skip this and watch the far superior 79' version instead. Despite the fact that hardly any of the events in that film were true, at least it has atmosphere, suspense, and scares; everything this film lacks.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is a scary-house movie.  It's one of those films about a house being haunted.  The film is very loosely based upon a real-story about the Lutz family and the DeFeo family.  The DeFeos were the original owners of the Amityville house and 28 days after moving in the father of the family went insane and killed his entire family.  Years later the Lutz family purchases the house and moves in.  Soon afterwards some really bizarre things start to happen: they start seeing ghosts, the wallpaper peels really funny, and the father, George (Ryan Reynolds) starts acting really strange.  As the 28th day of their move in draws near the coincidences between what happens with the Lutzs and the DeFeos becomes too much to ignore.<br /><br />THE AMITVILLE HORROR has some good acting from the entire cast.  The story builds up nicely and does a fairly decent job of characterization.  However, I really didn't like the movie that much.  It really isn't all that frightening and the things that are supposed to be frightening come off looking like expensive special effects gags.  There's also the whole bit about the house supposedly being built on an old Indian burial ground (I know the original came out before, but POLTERGEIST handles that much better) and the basement having been used as a sacrificial temple by a colonial-aged witch named J. Katchum--that made no sense at all to me in the movie.  I realize that this is either a remake or re-imagining of the original film, so the filmmakers were trying to walk the line between staying true to the spirit of the original, but make it fresh.  That would have been alright, but THE AMITYVILLE HORROR wasn't a movie worth remaking in the first place.<br /><br />When's all said and done the thing this version of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR will probably be best remembered for is that it was the last film that MGM released as an independent company (it was bought out by Sony and other studios during the promotion of the movie).  What a sad way for a great studio of the past to die out.  That is a true horror.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>This is a great rehashing of the original.  Ryan Reynolds goes for a change of pace from his typical comedy role to deliever a great performance in this thriller/horror remake.<br /><br />The Lutzs move into a fixer-up of a house in mid-1970s Amityville, NY.  Just a year prior to their move in a grizzly murder occured in the same house.  Now all kinds of freaky things are happening.  But is it the ghost of the prior residents or does this go back hundreds of years when an evil priest was torturing the natives?<br /><br />Whatever it was, it drove the Lutz family away from Amityville, never to return, not even for theise possessions.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>With all the bad reviews, I wasn't too hopeful for it, so maybe my low expectations made the movie a little better for me, but I thought it was better than average. (Average being something like "the grudge"). The movie played out more like the remake of "the Shining" than Amityville. They guy kept dragging around an axe like Nicholson. Unlike others, I like the idea that people are revamping these old classic horror films (I'm waiting for someone to redo the original Hellraiser, It's alive, the original exorcist, clockwork orange, or maybe even bloodsucking Freaks!!!) Anyway, I thought it was better than I anticipated, but I must mention the audio. Just like all other newer horror movie (the ring, the grudge, and boogeyman) this movie relies heavily on deafening volumes for its scare tactics. When will these directors and producers realize that this is more annoying than anything else. It doesn't scare anyone (other than your teenyboppers) excluding the annoying noises, your left with a decent horror movie. It had some decent gore in it as well. I should also mention, I do not understand why anyone would go to this movie expecting it to be "real" or a documentary based off the real killing that happened in Rhode island. It's a horror movie folks, take it for what it is. BUT if you must have them, here is the REAL FATCS:<br /><br />The house was built on an Indian burial site in Rhode Island, it is still there to this day. Many strange things have happened at the house. Defeo was a real person who murdered his family. He was sent to jail for life and he claimed he didn't remember any of it. The family that moved into the house after the Defeo's (the Lutz) claimed to have seen chairs move, things being thrown, and hooded spirits. They also claimed to have been levitated while sleeping, and seen red eyes in the house. There has been no further reports of Paranormal activity to this day. Some skeptics say the Ghost story was fabricated by the owners to increase the sale value of the house, and to promote tourist. The house also looks nothing like it does in the movie (of course it has been modified by the owners)</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The family that now owns the house in Amityville at what was once 112 Ocean Avenue (but now has a different number) has changed the infamous quarter-moon windows in the attic to regular shaped windows to ward off tourists.  For that matter, I understand the house in Tom Rivers, New Jersey that was used in the original movie version of "The Amityville Horror" changed those windows as well.  I find this interesting because without those "eye" windows I do not think this would have ended up being the most famous haunted house in America.  Of course, the half-moon windows on the house were pretty small and in both Hollywood versions they end up being a lot bigger, but then you know what happens when movies get made.<br /><br />They still tell us that "The Amityville Horror" is "Based on a True Story," but we now know enough about the writing and selling of Jay Anson's book to know that if the label belongs on this film then it belongs on movies like "Troy" because, hey, Homer wrote non-fiction too.  But in the wake of "The Blair Witch Project" there is nothing wrong with a good hoax.  Besides, this 2005 version of "The Amityville Horror" is the best movie ever made with that title, which includes the 1979 version with James Brolin and Margot Kidder, and all of its wretched sequels.  But that does not mean that first time feature director Andrew Douglas (who made the documentary "Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus") is a truly satisfying horror film and the "history" of the house really does not give this movie a free pass on the willing suspension of disbelief.  I watched this with all the lights out after midnight and had no problems sleeping, which is not the response the producers of this remake intended to be sure.<br /><br />The story is that in 1974 Ronald Defeo (Brendan Donaldson) took a rifle and killed everybody else in his family claiming that voices in the house told him to do so.  The spookiest thing about the real murders was that all of the victims were shot in their beds from behind apparently without any of them waking up.  But the script by Scott Kosar (who also wrote the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre") starts improving on reality at this point by having Ronald kill his youngest sister, Jodie (Isabel Conner), last in the closet of her attic bedroom.  You might remember from the original movie and/or book that Jodie was the name of the pig from hell, but this time it is a little girl with a bullet hole in her forehead (hang on, because this is going to be one of those good things/bad things).  When George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George) move into the house, the youngest of her three children, Chelsea (Chlo? Grace Moretz) and Jodie become friends.  But after 28 days in the house, the Lutz family will flee for their lives.<br /><br />For me Jodie is the pivotal character because of the way she changes the whole equation.  We know going into this movie that this is a haunted house and that there are malevolent ghosts.  We thought that maybe they were the ghosts of the dead Indians buried beneath the house, but that really does not matter to what is going on in the film.  But Jodie is a much more recent ghost and it appears that she might actually be a good ghost and not a bad ghost.  After all, in what is my favorite scene in the film, Jodie pays back the evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty babysitter (Rachel Nichols) who delights in telling Billy (Jesse James) and Michael Lutz (Jimmy Bennett) about the murders.  However, this film does not know what to do with the idea that there is a new ghost in there with the old ghosts, although that is clearly behind the film's final "boo!" right before the end credits.<br /><br />Ultimately, the horror here is not the house but what it does to George Lutz, and although the special effects are greatly improved this time around, the creepiest moments belong mostly to George, especially when he has an ax in his hands.  In retrospect, everything that I liked about this film is something that Kosar came up with, and not from Anson's book, Sandor Stern's earlier screenplay, or any of the myriad stories the Lutzs have been telling over the years.  But far too often Douglas relies on the old standard of a character turning around to be surprised by another character standing right, and you can only do that so many times before it becomes annoying.  There are also some montages that will remind you of a Nine Inch Nails music video, however the cumulative effect is that this movie is going through a bag of tricks rather than telling a coherent haunted house story.  The performances and special effects are much better here, but in terms of a coherent narrative the 1979 version would actually have the advantage, and that is not a good thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Amityville Horror" is scary!

This remake is average to me, I didn't find it scary.  I think the remakes are failing nowadays, as are most horror films.  The acting was tolerable, but nothing award worthy.  I would suggest holding off until this one hits video stores as well because the ticket price is a little high for what you are getting here (I only paid 3.00, which wasn't all that bad)</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>Lots of horror movies are b or c or even d movies so I give them breaks on their badness and even give them there own star system. After all I can't compare a low budget horror flick to any A movies. This being a A movie is a example of how to remake another great horror classic and just do everything wrong.  The dog scene was added for shock value and the poor man who actually lived this story the late 'george lutz' was deeply hurt by it. He never killed his dog and that's just one of many ways the movie tries to be hip and modern and shallow. It's poorly done for a A movie , it can't even tell a straight story,  so it has no excuse for the shlockfest it is. Avoid this movie and watch the original which has great acting and class. Wether you believe the haunting actually happened; the story is a great ghost story , perhaps the 20th centuries greatest and the first movie did it justice this one is almost as bad as the 'wicker man'remake or the even worse 'black x-mas' which was a terrible A movie disaster remake of a good b movie 'black christmas'. Anyways at least I saw this on blu ray which had great color and looks far better than the standard dvd but that's all it has going for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>The orignal movie was not scary and not overly good, but was more belivable then this. Based on a true story is misleading, as you think some events cannot happen, but some events could happen. The movie does have a nice 70's feel to it, but as it being a true story-highly unlikely. It uses "remake" effects to get scares, and that makes it unbearable. Remake effects meaning showing dead bodies in the room with the characters, something that doesnt happen in the orignal. Stuff guys crave to see, and scares there girl friends. I admit Teaxas Chainsaw Massacre from this guy was a little better because you saw Leatherface more, but this movie is limp and should have stuck to the orignal.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is my kind of horror film and guess what? It is rated R for a change, the way these films are meant to be shown. Ryan Reynolds shows a very good range in acting here, pushing himself further away from that "Van Wilder" role and that is a good thing. My only complaint was that the film was a little short, running just under 90 minutes. They could have shown more family interaction in the scenes that we didn't see from Day 1 to Day 15. It just seemed a little rushed at times, but the scares were there and they did not disappoint. Ignore the critics this time around and just read the reviews here on Amazon from people like you and me (who haven't had are brains burned out from watching 10 movies a week like Roger Ebert). This is one worth checking out on the big screen and I will be buying the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>Nobody really knows what happened on 12 Ocean Ave. in Amityville, NY in 1974.  The movie starts out with one of Hollywood's greatest tags "Based on a True Story."  The fact is that Ronald DaFoe did murder his family, blaming voices from the house for his actions and the Lutz's did move into the house one year later, but after that its all a fuzz.  But regardless of whether or not the events in the story are true, one thing is for certain: it makes for one hell of a spooky tale.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier the story is about the Lutz family and their 28 days living in a haunted house.  They decide to move into their dream house in Amityville, Long Island becasue it was being sold at a killer price (no pun intended).  They learn that the previous residents were all brutally murdered, but the price and the house were too good to pass up.  After they move into the house George (Ryan Reynolds) starts to feel different.  He starts hearing voices in the house and starts to see ghosts.  Slowly the voices start to posses him.  They convince him that his family are all demons and slowly over the 28 day span, he starts to go crazy.  This eventually leads up to him attempting to kill his family.<br /><br />There were some good things in this movie.  First was Ryan Reynolds performance of George Lutz.  I was a little hesitant about accepting him in a serious role, but he managed to pull of a very powerful, emotional role.  Also he convinced me that he was really going crazy.  The other actors do a fine job as well.  I also like the re-creation of the Amityville Haunted House.  The house itself creates a really spooky atmosphere.  Lastly, I liked the fact that the movie was just plain creepy.  There are a lot of scenes that make you jump, but the atmosphere of the movie never really lets the viewer feel comfortable.<br /><br />So I would recommend seeing this movie.  Its enough to hold you off until the summer movie season starts and it is good for a few scares.  Whether you believe that the story is real or not is up to you, but you should definately watch to see whether you believe in ghost stories like this or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>I loved the original Amityville Horror , never saw the sequels , but could not have expected a total dasterdly remake of a film so good you want to watch it again and again. Don't see this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Lately, there have been a lot of PG-13 rated horror movies, most of which have drawn critical and public lambasting.  BOOGEYMAN, CURSED, THE GRUDGE, WHITE NOISE, even RING 2.  One criticism often leveled by the public is that the "whimpy" PG-13 rating is causing the filmmakers to soften the horror of the movies.  Well, this weekend saw the arrival of an R-rated horror movie, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, and it pretty much proves one thing...the R-rating ISN'T what these other movies were lacking to be good.<br /><br />AMITYVILLE is a lousy movie, pure and simple.  I'm old enough to remember the original phenomenon.  The Lutz family buys a house for a great price because the previous residents had been horrifically murdered in it.  28 days later, the Lutz's run from the house in horror because they nearly suffered the same fate.  Soon, a "non-fiction" novel of their story came out.  The Lutz's made the rounds of less picky talk shows and basically, a huge urban legend sprung up.  Their story was TRUE!!  (Of course, it was all a hoax, but who cares about that!).  Then a movie came out, and everyone was all in an uproar over the walls that bled!  Cool!!!  But the movie, with James Brolin and Margot Kidder was schlock then and it's certainly dreadful now.<br /><br />Then here comes a remake that doesn't even bring the zeitgeist of the original with it.  We take it as pure fiction right from the get-go, despite the title card stating "Based on a True Story."  Yep, it truly is a story alright.<br /><br />The thrills are predictable in the extreme.  Most of them are heralded with a burst of loud music.  Over and over.  Now, I will grant you that horror movies have been doing this for years...but this movie makes the most of the device.  It accompanies EVERYTHING that might be even remotely creepy.  LOUD NOISE=HUGE THRILL!!! Right??<br /><br />Wrong.  In one scene, the father (played by a bushy faced Ryan Reynolds...designed to make him look like the bearded James Brolin from the original) is watching some home movies.  He smiles.  Suddenly, one of the kids' faces briefly turns demonic, right on the film.  LOUD, LOUD BLAST OF SOUND!!  I just about had to laugh.  This wasn't scary at all.  The kid wasn't going to come out of the film and attack the father. It was just a weird little thing that would have been more effective with quiet music or none at all.  But no, why be subtle when a SLEDGEHAMMER OF SOUND is readily available.  Thus, the movie renders all its thrills equal.  There's really no sense of climax.  Right near the end, something horrible happens to a major character, and we actually think, "Cool, the movie is daring enough to surprise us in this way."  Nope, it was just a dream.<br /><br />Also horrific is the fact that the wonderfully talented Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights) plays the local priest as though a gun were being held to his head.  I assume he got a nice paycheck, or maybe did it on a bet or a dare, but he sure looks unhappy to be in this film.<br /><br />I give the film 2 stars, because I reserve 1 star reviews for the true dregs of the earth like FEAR DOT COM or THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.  But this movie is just clumsy, unexciting and UNTHRILLING.  As for the R rating?  Well, one "F" bomb is dropped, and there are some disturbing images when we discover what REALLY happened on the land the house was built on.  Mind you, I said disturbing.  But not scary.  So, I don't recommend the movie for kids...or anyone else, for that matter!</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>The last couple of years have been the crappiest years for horror films I have ever seen. People flocking to witness PG-13 horror films like The Ring 1 & 2, The Grudge, Darkness, White Noise ect ect. It's crap.<br /><br />But this year looks a bit more promising with movies like The Amityville Horror, House of Wax (both remakes, but hey, nobody obviously has any new GOOD ideas) and The Devil's Rejects.<br /><br />Now on to the actual movie itself. Even though I wasn't overly impressed with the original Amityville film, I respect it and it was decent for it's time. But the 2005 remake proves to be a bit better than the original, and shows that people still know how to make scary movies.<br /><br />What I liked about The Amityville Horror was that it not only scared with you sudden, frightening images and shock value, but the house itself was psychologically scary. The house itself was the scariest character in the film, because of its strong sense malevolence and its underlying presence that just is foreboding terror and horror. And I've always had a stong fear of houses that may be haunted so I was easily scared by this movie, and I'm not one that is easily scared by most movies.<br /><br />Plus I liked all the performances in the film and the film had a great pace that never slowed down.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who likes scary movies, and I especially recommend this movie to anyone who thought The Grudge was scary, because if you thought The Ring or The Grudge was scary (which it wasn't at all), this should scare you into a mumbling idiot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>re-make of the not so great original has The Lutz Family, husband George Lutz played by Ryan Reynolds (Blade: Trinity, The Alarmist) and Mrs. Lutz played by Melissa George (Tv's Alias, Sugar & Spice). They move in and find out that there was a murder that happened in that house. Soon, things start to boil up as the man of the house, George Lutz hears voices to tell him to kill his family because they are demons. "House's dont kill people, people kill people." explains George. Mrs. Lutz thinks something array as she sees her husband is transforming into a monster. Not much fun really, just like the original with some pretty boring blood splattering moments though Reynolds is very convincing in his psycho-possessed performance and some pretty good direction. Also starring Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights, Magnolia) as the priest. Michael Bay Produced and he also did Texas Chainsaw Massacre which I have no clue why he produced that and this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>I dont want to say it was better than the first, because that was 26 years ago. It's different: more gory, more frighting (using the quick pans and tense music) For a movie no adays it was up there on the scare factor. Reynolds is good, and is scary in the model of Nicholson in The Shining. A better remake in a time when they're bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>In 2002, I happened to see the original Amityville house on Long Island (which was renovated to replace the creepy looking windows). That got me interested in the story and I finally watched the original horror film, which was so bland and lacking in suspense that I don't know why previews of that movie gave me nightmares as a child.<br /><br />With today's film technology, I looked forward to seeing this new version. Signs were not good when the film's distributors refused to allow film critics to pre-screen the movie for the Friday write-ups. Roger Ebert created his "finger wave" category for the distributor's cowardice in facing the film critics.<br /><br />While this film is a big improvement on the 1979 film, it still has a lot of cheap shots and comes across as manipulative. What it lacks in horror, they make up for it by spiking the scary music and quick jumps to startle the audience. Although based on a true story (whether it happened or was an elaborate hoax continues to be debated), so many instances strained credibility...such as the daughter walking dangerously on the roof. Yeah, right.<br /><br />The scene I most like in this film, however, deals with the babysitter, as she adds much humor to the story. Because of her and having actor Ryan Reynolds walk around shirtless, showing off his well-sculpted body, its obvious that the makers of the film settled for a sexed up version for modern audiences to make up for the lack of suspense and true drama/horror. That also strains credibility, but its only a movie...one that's hard to take seriously from the get-go.<br /><br />The truly horrifying scene takes audiences into the basement to discover the house's secret past that explains the haunting. It is the most graphic part of the film and the scariest. If this film had more of that, instead of trying to be a cheap imitation of "The Sixth Sense" (which is what I thought of everytime that ghost girl popped up unexpectedly for no other reason than to startle the audience), I would give it another star. As is, its an okay film for a few laughs and an improvement upon the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This movie remake was pretty good. Even though I saw the original movie and knew what was coming, I did jump out of my seat a few times for it also put a chill up my spin.<br /><br />There were several scary scenes that were excellent; "The Amityville Horror" delivers just that, fast pacing and some pretty effective jumps by using some cheap shock effects. Since this is a remake it is forgivable that it doesn't come up with anything remotely new or original. There's the ever so familiar haunted house, Dad losing his mind, heads shaking &agrave; la Jacob's Ladder, weird shadows moving fast and making insect sounds and the more than overused spooky little girl (really, having such a kid in another horror movie is idiotic and didn't even make much sense in this particular movie). Still, all that makes for an uneasy atmosphere and there's one scene in the bathroom that's set up gloriously, toying cleverly with a classic childhood fear (going to the toilet in the middle of the night in a dark and spooky house). Another great scene is the one with the babysitter in the closet then soon encounters with the ghost.<br /><br />The director, Andrew Douglas, did a good job by showing little differences in George's attitude and demeanor once he was out of the house. Ryan Reynolds also did a good job of portraying this to the viewers. He has come a long way. Melissa George could also leave her mark in Hollywood if the right roles come along for her. I was pretty impressed by her performance almost as much as Ryan's.<br /><br />While not the best of its genre, "The Amityville Horror" has it's place amongst horror movies. It is worth seeing, as you can do much worse if you do not do your homework.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>[Note: review abridged for length requirements.]<br /><br />The Amityville Horror (Andrew Douglas, 2005)<br /><br />First, let's get this out of the way. The "true story" upon which The Amityville Horror is based is that the Lutzes bought a house they couldn't afford, and were drowning in debt. Given the house's history, they concocted the haunted-house story in order to get out from under the payments. This is something that the Lutzes came clean about ten years ago; how Douglas can get away with "based on a true story" is utterly beyond me. (Though in his defense, the extras do make it seem like he really bought the story hook, line, and sinker; obviously, the Lutzes' confession was not nearly as widely popularized as the original story.) I'm surprised no one's filed a class action lawsuit against the film's crew for representing it as true. (Even IMDB recognizes the hoax; the original film is listed bas based on Jay Anson's book, while the new one lists it as based on Jay Anson's novel.) James Frey is small potatoes, in comparison.<br /><br />That aside, comparing this to the original Stuart Rosenberg flick from 1979 is almost a painful experience. Both films are mediocre examples of filmmaking, but whereas Rosenberg's movie is fully realized in its mediocrity, Douglas has crafted a film that had almost limitless potential, and he threw most of it away piece by ugly piece.<br /><br />The one thing Douglas did right was toss out most of the conventions people were expecting from the '79 movie-- the infamous flies show up in only one scene, and pig-Jodie (the "glowing red eyes outside the window" shot the original made so famous) is nowhere to be found. While it is almost always the case that suggesting the demon is scarier than showing the demon, the version of Jodie found in this movie is far, far creepier than a pair of floating red eyes and a vague, pig-looking shadow. Also, the writers added a few touches that had the potential to make the story more interesting, such as the tentative relationship between George and the kids. The best thing they could have done would have been to dump the original script altogether and simply make a haunted-house flick that wore its allegiance to the '79 film on its sleeve. To his credit, it seems like twisted, brilliant screenwriter Scott Kosar (El Maquinista) attempted to do just that, but got hamstrung.<br /><br />For those who have been living in a cave for the past thirty years, the story, as originally told by the Lutzes: George and Kathy Lutz (here portrayed by Blade Trinity's Ryan Reynolds and Down with Love's Melissa George, respectively) bought a house in Amityville, New York, in 1975. Like all houses for which you get an incredible, deal, it's haunted. In this case, the year before, Ronald DeFeo, the son of the previous owner, had murdered the rest of his family in the house, claiming he'd heard voices telling him to do it. When George, Kathy, and family moved in, the same voices haunted them (and a priest they bring in to bless the house, whose role, according to the Catholic Diocese of Rockville Center, is "completely exaggerated" in the novel) until, twenty-eight days later, they fled, leaving all their personal possessions, never to return to the house.<br /><br />The acting is actually rather credible. Reynolds overacts a tad, as is his wont, but just a tad; no scenery-chewing here except for Philip Baker Hall (Magnolia), who plays the priest role to the hilt. George is great, and the adult actors are rounded out perfectly by a star turn from Rachel Nichols, of the underrated, short-lived TV series The Inside, as a drugged-out babysitter who tells the kids about the murders.<br /><br />The kids themselves were conventionally cast-- no taking chances on unknowns here-- and are conventional actors. Chelsea (soon to be seen in Zombies, J. S. Cardone's new flick) is your basic overdose of the cute, while Jimmy Bennett (Firewall) and Jesse James (The Butterfly Effect) go through their paces, each demonstrating the ability to cry on command.<br /><br />The problem with all this acting talent, which ranges from competent to surprisingly good, is that it's all hung on a framework that's so scrappy it can't even get the hallowed Hollywood tradition of the emotional shortcut right. The film's severely abbreviated length-- eighty-nine minutes-- could be written off as the culprit, but the deleted scenes don't show that there was any effort whatsoever to try and trace the emotions from point A to point B in the script. George goes from being kind, loving dad (which the script spent a good deal of time setting up, mind you, making the first moments of the film intensely boring) to raging jerk in the space of a heartbeat, then spends the rest of the movie rapid-cycling. This is one place the original film works much better than this one; James Brolin's gradual descent into madness plays, whereas Reynolds has a precipice instead of a descent. The funny thing is, he's still got twenty-seven days after he jumps off said precipice to hang around and be useless.<br /><br />More frustrating, the emotional scraps hang on the framework of a really good plot. Once you get about halfway into the film, the changes made to the original story start coming through, and they whip it into much better shape. There's a good deal more sense to be made out of everything, and one minor twist made to the DeFeo story ties everything together with brilliant economy. Again, construct all this on a different framework and give your actors real parts to work with, and you potentially have the best American horror flick of the past ten or fifteen years. Instead, something happened. I don't know what.<br /><br />The end result is a mediocre film that could have been great. **</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Amityville Horror (Widescreen Special Edition)~ Ryan Reynolds is a good horror movie re-make of the 1979 with James Brolin. The special effects are much better, and the acting is a bit better. One can sense that this movie has been heavily influenced by works such as The Ring and sometimes they do borrow a bit too heavily. I also feel that "Jodey" is not properly explained and I feel that part of the movie could have been longer. I also feel that it jumps way to much and that the movie could have been like an hour longer to fully explain the ongoing process instead of this fastforwarding at times. It truly feels as if the director was a bit too pressed for time. I would love to see yet another remake or series where they allow you to follow the plot a bit more closely. Even so it is a fine movie that could have been a bit better but still is watchable and gets three stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>The new remake of "The Amityville Horror" plays very much like the other recent cheap hollywood flops such as "The Boogyman" & Wes Craven's "Cursed" they all start off great & then belly flop into unbearable cheese. Alot like "The Boogyman" Amityville has plenty going for it & then it just craps out in the end. The original is better even without all the new special efx!

Director Andrew Douglas keeps things moving pretty crisply.  Ryan Reynolds all buffed up from his role in BLADE 2 is not the world's greatest actor, and there are times when the usually comic Reynolds seems way over his head in trying to demonstrate his conversion from Mr. Nice Guy to Mr. Demento.  Melissa George is little better in her role as the put upon wife who tries to get Reynolds to move her and the family out of this obviously possessed house.  The remake maintains the notorious flies attacking the priest sequence, but the GET OUT segment isn't quite as overpowering as in the original.  As in the original, one has to question the validity of this supposedly "true story", but for horror fans, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR isn't all that bad, nor is it all that great.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>I watched this movie yesterday....and I found this film to be very intense in fright factor....interesting special features, especially the actual crime scene footage/photos....very sad story...I feel that the actors did a wonderful job with the material that they were given....<br /><br />So why the three stars....Hollywood of course...having seen the original, and being a bit skeptical then about the whole story, I feel that this adaptation was sensationalized for the benefit of the filmmakers....<br /><br />Here is what I believe...the crime...yes this did happen (hence the crime scene material...including interviews with ppl that were actually there...interesting!!!<br /><br />Now the overall story....this one is a stretch...yes I believe that the house was haunted....but do I believe half of the stuff that happened to this family...no some of this is/was not believable...in fact back in the 80's it was said that the Lutz's claims (most of them) were unfounded and untrue....<br /><br />So...here is for the final verdict....good movie...decent adaptation...now it is time to put the story to rest....</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>Horror movies seem to be the toughest to pull off these days of "CG" overkill, but this movie was far better than I expected. I thought the original was still marginally better and I of course give that 5 stars out of reverence:)<br /><br />The new movie truly shines in just about every area. The casting is surprising tight, the jarring effects more than accomplish the scares intended, the chemistry is spot on, and the ending is even improved, though to be fair anything different would be an improvement over the originals "Harry" ending.<br /><br />It wasn't without some notable flaws which pulled the score down. First up? The score! This series DEMANDS the originals haunting score, and without, in my opinion, it loses its "Amityness" if just a bit. Another small problem I had was the Jody factor. They seemed to dwell on her a bit too much on the front end making this movie (for a while) seem more like the Jodyville Horror. Taking a page from Jan Brady it would read Jody, Jody, Jody! This was no doubt influenced by the Ring, but I must tell you, she was appropriately frightening so at least it paid off. Lastly, there seemed to be a large hole where the religious aspect used to be. Without Rod Steiger, I'm afraid the priest aspect was a bit of a loss and seemed almost like an afterthought.<br /><br />Still, I left the theater today counting the days until the dvd release and I pray it will be loaded with extras cuz honestly the movie seemed a bit short. If somehow we could fuse the two movies together we have the ultimate weapon because each brings something to the mix that the other doesn't have.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In 1974, in the town of Amityville, Rondald DeFeo went on a murderous rampage and killed the six other members of his family with a shotgun, shooting them as they slept.  In 1975, George (Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (George) move into the house, not knowing its history.  They see a good deal on a big house.  The Lutzs move into the house with their three kids, and a few days later, things start to go badly.<br /><br />George's easygoing ways turn menacing.  The daughter, Chelsea, makes an imaginary friend that bears the same name as the DeFeo's murdered daughter.  Windows open on their own, voices can be heard, and a priest flees an exorcism attempt.<br /><br />I had hopes for this movie, but found myself disappointed.  There is potential, but in the end, the film does not deliver more than a typical slasher-movie bad guy with axe chase scene.  The leads, Reynolds and George, are not engaging, and I never really felt for their characters.<br /><br />Then, there is the "based on real events" caption.  The Lutz's story is generally considered to be fiction these days, and perhaps a little more leeway should have been taken with the story.  Better special effects do not make a movie better, story does.  Unfortunately, "The Amityville Horror" can be added to the list of forgettable horror movies that have come out this year.  And that list is growing quickly...</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I went to see this movie on opening night, not having seen the trailer, not having seen the original movie nor having the pleasure to read the book. I had a general idea what it was about, but I hate how trailers these days leave nothing to the imagination. I noticed that with scary movies this is the way to go!<br /><br />Many of you know the premises and more history than I would probably know, so I won't repeat it.<br /><br />Other than the house being freaking creepy, demonic heart attack on a plate, it was really scary to see this loving family movie into it, where every pore of your body wanted to yell at them not to go in there.<br /><br />Sitting there in the dark theater, and wanting to close my eyes all the time, I felt like everyone's breathing stopped at certain parts. One of the creepiest parts is when the little boy goes to the bathroom. Yeah, for some reason bathroom scenes are freaking horrifying lately, and this one was the worst! I mean the best scary bathroom trip I've ever seen! &#61514;<br /><br />The characters are very real and I rooted and cared about them, so watching crazy stuff take over them and make them turn against each other was tough.<br /><br />Overall a very good scary, make you jump on your seat, bite your tongue and close at least one eye flick!<br /><br />Very enjoyable, just dont compare it to everything else ever made and have fun, watch it with an open mind. It will blow you away.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>The Amityville Horror is by far the best and scariest horror film in recent years. It's scarier than previous "haunted houses or motels movies" such as The Haunting, Identity, The People Under The Stairs, and last year's The Grudge. Since it's based on a true story, it's even more compelling and powerful. It's filled with plenty of shocking and scary visuals, and the story is real and intense that it's quite a gripping experience to watch this freak feast! A bonus treat of eye-candy is offered by Ryan Reynolds to his fans if they haven't seen him all buffed up in Blade:Trinity last year. He's drop-dead gorgeous in this movie, with a body that made a lot of female audiences go,"Ooh,Wow!" for at least four scenes. I guessed it was appropiate that he needed to built an ultra-muscular body for his role since his character is in construction work.<br /><br />The story is about the Amityville old house that is possessed by a powerful demon. It took place in Deer Lake in the '70s. The intro of the film showed one possessed member of the Deferoe family killing all of his family on the 28th day at 3:15am since they moved in. A year later, a new family moved into the same evil house. George(Ryan Reynolds) and his wife Kathy(Melisa George) disregard the realtor when they were told  about the killing that took place in the house. They took it, because it was so cheap. With all good intension, they believe that their family will make a happy home there. George is the step father to Kathy's two sons and one daughter. Their dad died and Kathy remarried to George.<br /><br />Between day one and the final manifestation of the evil force, many strange, wierd, and scary things occur in their house. Chelsea(Chloe Moretz) had the ability to see an earth-bound ghost girl from the previous family, and they became friends. She was warned that her family must abandon the house, but the parents ignored the message. Gradually, "the voices that said Katch'em and Kill'em" got into George's mind, and he started to lose it one day at a time. Now the only person who started to believe that something is really wrong with the house is Kathy, and she goes to seek the help of a local preist(Father Callaway/Philip Baker Hall)......<br /><br />The characters are very well-written here, and the development of the story from beginning to the climatic moment is at a perfect pace. Every 5 minutes there is something very scary to happen, and the performances, especially from Reynolds and Melissa George are powerful and intense. The three kids and the ghost girl are also effective in some of the scary moments. The sudden popping up of evil faces is what made many audiences scream throughout the film. Philip Baker Hall, previously displayed great performance in Magnolia has too little screen time here. His best scene was when he tried to perform a blessing vitual inside the evil house.<br /><br />This film should be a must-see for horror fans, and definitely not-to-be-missed by Ryan Reynolds fans, because he deserves extra credit for his gripping performance as well as showing off his fabulous body!</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>... and frankly, it's one I've been screaming for.  If Hollywood is so insistent on trotting out a seemingly endless number of remakes, then remake a BAD movie.  There's no fan base to aggravate, no 'sacred ground' that couldn't be tinkered with, a workable storyline, and instant name recognition.  Not to mention that I HATED the original 'Amityville Horror'.  So right up front, this was a film that had my attention.<br /><br />So how'd it do?  Pretty well actually.  I'm not sure I'd BUY it, but there was certainly enough good to justify a rental.  The acting was good, the effects were well-done and creepy, and the sound was awesome.  Just as an aside, this movie is MUCH eerier with a 5.1 surround system.  Hearing phantom foot-steps behind you and voices coming at you from different angles really adds a dimension that just isn't there when you watch in stereo or mono sound.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit that I'm nit-picking a little bit, but I did want to mention a couple of the issues I had:<br /><br />1. The casting choices- While the acting, I felt, was really pretty good, the casting decisions had me scratching my head a little bit.  Both Ryan Renolds and Melissa George were too young or the actors playing their children were too old.  The way I figure it, Melissa George would have been about twelve when she had her first child.<br /><br />2. The film showed its cards a bit too early going right for the cheap jump-moments.  If we've all learned anything from `Jaws' it's that you don't need to show the shark right away to build up tension.<br /><br />3. One of the ONLY things I felt the original film did well was giving a genuine sense of "family" between the Lutz's.  I never really felt that in this movie.  I almost felt like I was watching five individuals going their own way.  Nobody ever seemed to "connect."  Part of the problem, I felt, was the sub-plot of George Lutz as the "New Dad". I felt like that alienated George's character too much and pulled the rug out from under the film.<br /><br />4. The character of the minister was significantly reduced from the first film.  I would have either expanded his part or just cut him completely.  I thought for sure we'd see him blessing the house before the Lutz's moved in.<br /><br />When all's said and done I'd give this a solid 3 stars out of five.  Certainly a much better outing then the original.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Let's face it: The original "Amityville Horror," released in 1979, is horribly dated. Unlike other horror movies at the time, this movie just hasn't held up very well. Not to mention, the onslaught of sequels which, while they were entertaining, were never much for scares or originality. I had always thought in the back of my mind, when movies like "Dawn Of The Dead" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" were being remade, why not "The Amityville Horror?" If any horror franchise needs to be renovated, surely it is this creaky old James Brolin flick. Now don't get me wrong; I'm an "Amityville" fan. I love all the great horror movies from way back, but there is just so much to be improved on. But I digress.<br /><br />The new "Amityville Horror" is brought to you by the Platinum Dunes production company (spearheaded by blockbuster director-turned-producer Michael Bay), who also put out 2003's most excellent "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." If you are familiar with that remake, you can pretty much imagine what they did with this one, which is why I dragged myself into the theater to see it. The scares are definitely up quite a bit from the original, and it moves at a much faster pace too. Ryan Reynolds (who you may remember from movies such as "Van Wilder" and "Blade: Trinity," but whom I would rather remember from "Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle" instead) takes his most serious role, as the nice-guy, step-father who buys the troubled house on Ocean Avenue. It's such a steal too, because at the price he is offered, he can start a new life with his new wife and three troubled kids (whose father is deceased). However, nothing is free in this world, and the dream is too good to be true. Little do they know, until it is too late, that a man murdered his entire family in cold blood just one year prior. It turns out this beautiful house just may be possessed by demons, and turns the man of the house into a cruel psychopath who tries to kill the family and their beloved dog. It's more or less the same deal as the original movie. Although not being a complete remake, it does stay true to the source material while adding new elements that make this easily the best film in the "Amityville" franchise to date. It's not really a horror movie, more of a suspense/drama. If you're expecting extreme scares, this might not do it for you. But it is a nice distraction for 90 minutes and is very well made, with newcomer director Andrew Douglas pulling all the right strings. My only gripe with this movie is the ending. True, it doesn't have to be a splatterfest, but it didn't really grab me like it should of and I feel let off the hook too easy. But regardless, I still recommend any horror fan go see it. It's not without it's flaws, but it sure beats the unimaginitve "PG-13" horrors that we have been bombarded with for the past few years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>I loathe remakes, I really do, but I must confess, this was not half bad. I would go as far as to say this was a cut above the original. Why? you ask, well the original was over 2 hours and didn't need to be, and the acting was pretty poor, this version cuts the time down to 88 minutes and the acting is much, much better. George Lutz was played well by Ryan Reynolds, one of the hotter actors in Hollywood, and deserved, he has a special charisma and charm, plus he's a pretty damn good actor. It doesn't hurt that he has an incredible body with abs any man would kill for, and in his last 2 movies (Blade 3 and this one)<br />he is constantly running around without a shirt on, much to my wife and women everywhere's delight. Melissa George does a pretty good Margot Kidder, but it's the children that really steal the show. The younger daughter is excellent, as she is the one who can see Jody, one of the girls shot in the house, and Jody is not a very nice little girl, check out the scene with the babysitter locked in the closet, awesome segment.<br /><br />The two sons are also strong, the older one has some intense scenes with Reynolds chopping wood, which is very creepy in a subdued sorta way.<br /><br />My problems with the film? not too much, but the CG during the famous "flies" scene is a little weak and the ending is a bit anti-climatic, but those are both minor flaws in an over-all fun horror movie.<br /><br />In recent years, remakes are coming out all over the place, Bewitched, Longest Yard, Bad News Bears, Charlie and the Chocolate factory, and must are a major disaster, but this one succeeds and it was nice to see. Ryan Reynolds is going to be huge, with recent release "Waiting" looking like it is going to be a minor hit and a holiday movie coming with the previews looking like it could be alot of fun(cuz you know previews are never wrong)<br /><br />So, if ya want a fun, solid horror movie and High Tension and Devil's Rejects is checked out, get this, I think you'll be impressed.<br /><br />acting.........3.5 stars, Reynolds and his abs rule the day<br />directing......4 stars, Very well done for a remake<br />special effects...3.5 stars, CG is weak, but the rest is creepy<br />horror rating....3.5 stars, A few chills, nothing serious<br />quality........4 stars, Great looking movie, house looks scary</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>The remake of "The Amityville Horror" is nothing spectacular, and doesn't live up remotely to the raw force of the original (which itself was only above average), but it has moments.  Essentially, this is what the filmmakers decided to do:remake a horror film from the 70's and add some new images to it, making sure to throw in the necessary up-and-coming celebrities.  Not entirely unpleasant, the film has a few genuinely frightening moments: "Look what Ronnie did to me", the young victim's ghost whispers as she places a stoned, ill-willed babysitter's finger into the bulletwound in her ghastly skin.  These moments are few and far between, however, and I can see no real justification for the making of this film.  Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George are unremarkable and hurried in their "transformation" from (sort of) a happy, very much in love couple to two individuals falling apart as the result of a diseased house.  The children in the film who are killed at the beginning, and who later appear as ghosts, seem less annoying then the ones we have to watch the whole movie in the flesh and blood.  Philip Baker Hall's performance as Father Callaway is disappointing and shallow, not holding a candle to Steiger's role in the original.  After it stops being scary (that doesn't take long) and the same hackneyed "demon" devices are rewound in various ways throughout the film, it can't help but occur to one that Hollywood directors are running fresh out of ideas for horror movies.  A dull, unimaginative lot they must be: with the exception of Brad Anderson ("Session 9", "The Machinist), who I believe may be our last hope in this decaying genre.<br /><br />Plus, "Amityville" was always the weakest film in the odd Satanic Renaissance they had in 70's film.  It sat on the sideline beside "The Omen", "Rosemary's Baby", and "The Exorcist".  These three films gave us quite a fright because each one has some possibility about it, something that transcends the petty and reaches right into our gut: the biblically predicted child of Satan finally being born, the story of a possession that actually occured and has never been proven to be a fraud, and Polanski's genius combined with Ira Levin's power as a novelist: "Amityville" had none of these factors backing it up.  A suspension of disbelief is fine, but a willingness to participate in a hoax is another thing entirely: George and Kathy Lutz were con artists who moved into the house knowing precisely what had happened there with the intention of making lots of money by claiming it was haunted.  They themselves even ended up recanting parts of it.<br /><br />For anyone who doesn't know, the whole matter was debunked by the Catholic Diocese of Rockville and William Weber, the lawyer for Ronald Defeo himself.  People have lived in that house since:tables do not fly around, dishes don't crash, and nothing but the standard foulness sits in the toilet.  The young man who shot his family to death was a generic psychopath who had been using drugs near the time of the slayings, lied pathologically, and enjoyed what he did thoroughly by his own admission.  The Defeo family was alcoholic and dysfunctional.  On the stand he claimed demonic possession and a host of other invented ailments:insanity, personality disorders, a dissociative condition, none of which he actually had.  The real "horror" of this whole thing is Ronnie himself.  That is the true story.<br /><br />I would, though, recommend "Amityville Horror II:The Possession".  It is an overlooked gem.<br /><br />So much for the magic, eh?</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Oh good, I really wanted a serious exploration into the paranormal and the descent of man into madness.  Surely this film, "based on a true story," would be just the ticket.  Just kidding, we all knew this was going to be silly hokum from the get-go.  I didn't believe this "true story" as a book, I didn't believe it as a film almost 30 years ago, and I haven't lost any brain cells since then.<br /><br />So the best I can say about the remake of "The Amityville Horror" is that it's less than 90 minutes.  OK, maybe that's harsh--I didn't hate this movie as some people did.  It just barely registered at all.  I suppose there is some suspense in the final moments, that's more than some movies.  But since none of the characters are developed very well, it's hard to work up much interest.  I suppose it's nice to see Ryan Reynolds in something other than an idiotic comedy.  Of course, that would be more interesting if he actually had the talent or presence to do anything more serious.<br /><br />Here is the insurmountable problem.  The movie plays much like "The Shining," and yes, I'm being generous with the comparison.  But in "The Shining," the family couldn't leave when things started spiraling out of control.  They were trapped and isolated, they had to play it out.  In "The Amityville Horror," that is not the case.  The house is so inherently evil--everyone knows it.  The real estate agent sees spirits, the priest is chased away, the little girl almost gets killed, a baby-sitter is driven insane--and yet it never occurs to someone that maybe they should leave.  My favorite moment comes at the end (possible spoiler) as the family looks back at the house from the boat.  The husband has seemingly snapped out of his homicidal rage and is free from the house's influence!!!  Yea!!!  But I couldn't help thinking--Man, maybe they should have gone out to eat more often, shopping, whatever--if that's all it took to break free.  "Honey, I'm going to pick up some groceries.  I'm starting to feel like I want to murder the kids.  See you in a few."

It was also a bit nostalgic, as it may be the first remake of a film that I saw in theaters in its original release.<br /><br />The Amityville Horror is a famous bit of American pop-culture.  It is supposedly based on a true story.  The truth: Butch DeFeo murdered his entire family in their house in Amityville.  The next residents - the Lutzes - fled the house after 28 days, claiming that it was haunted.  But - according to Snopes.com, which has a great article - it was all a hoax.  It doesn't matter - it was made into a bestselling book and a successful haunted house movie.<br /><br />The most interesting thing is the way the two Amityville movies epitomize the different styles of moviemaking.  The original film was not a great movie - it is a bit creaky and clich&eacute;-ridden.  However, it is certainly not an awful film - Stephen King discusses it at length in his wonderful non-fiction book, Dance Macabre.  It did have good performances from James Brolin, Margot Kidder, and Rod Steiger.  It had creepy theme-music and - most memorably - that house with windows for eyes.<br /><br />Back then, the emphasis was on character-development and story.  Now, the emphasis is on making a slick-looking picture.  We don't waste that much time on back-story and character-development anymore - we go for economy.  The movie doesn't take much time getting the family into the house and having weird things happen.  The family is the standard good-but-dysfunctional brood but all semblance of normality goes out the window as George Lutz descends into madness.  The most unbelievable bit of pandering to modern audiences occurs when they hire a babysitter who looks more like a prostitute.<br /><br />Still, I like all the actors - especially Ryan Reynolds as George.  He is mostly a comedic actor who finds himself in action/horror pictures lately.  It is hard to believe him as a suburban contractor since he has the body of a male model and spends most of the movie with his shirt off.  However, I suspect people don't come to this movie for verisimilitude.  I wanted to be entertained and feel nostalgic and I came away satisfied in those respects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>One of the latest in a series of remakes of horror movies that didn't need to be remade but managed to hit the bullseye anyway, the new "Amityville Horror" does what a remake must do to be a success: it stays true to the concept and the esscence of the original; but it differentiates itself enough to stand on its own - playing up angles that got less attention the first time around while spending less time on what already got the lion's share of the thrust the first time around, adding in some new elements, maybe taking a left where the original took a right, that kind of thing.  If a remake is too out there it gets to the point where it shouldn't have been a remake at all, it should have been its own original entry, and may actually end up hamstrung by trying to make what seemingly wanted to be an entirely new movie a remake of something else in the first place.  On the other hand, if it's just a shot-for-shot and word-for-word clone, I see very little point in it.<br /><br />  2005's "Amityvile Horror" is a faster-paced (although not nearly so breakneck a pace as early reports seemed to indicate), somewhat gorier version of the tale in which you actually see more of the horrors than in the classic 1979 original.  Excellent choice for a way to go; the much slower, 'crawling dread' type of feel that relied on hints, imagination and very occasional but highly effective jolts was done brilliantly the first time around, and going for a diiferent vibe on the same story was far preferable, in my mind, to mirroring the original too closely.  That's why the recent crop of horror remakes is turning out so well - we're getting a new, very distinct variation on a story instead of the exact same tone over again but with different performers.  And the characterization and the coherency of the movie remain in great form with the new, more action-oriented, visually direct feel.<br /><br />  Highly believable, universally great performances, an added air of sexiness and occasional well-placed humor, neither of which clash with the movie's overall dark and intense feel, and realistic special effects, plus a major new original element in the movie's latter stages, make this a major winner.  I hope it's followed up by a sequel or two; the original movies went in a totally different direction from Part II onwards than the original books and the events that reportedly occurred in the Amityville house.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie of an innocent and likable family unexpectedly finding themselves in the midst of a hideous force of malevolence.  As highly recommended as the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Just the name of this film constitutes a long sigh - 'How many times are they going to make this hokey story into yet another film?' And yet the current team of director Andrew Douglas, screenwriter Scott Kosar (based on Jay Anson's novel) and a cast of fresh faces to the genre carry off this much told tale with vigor and a good dollop of tension.<br /><br />For starters the film opens with the re-enactment of the 'actual crime'.  Apparently in 1974 Ronald DeFeo (here Brendan Donaldson) murdered his parents and siblings in a terrific old house in Amityville, NY. One year later the Lutz family discovers their dream house and buys it outright, opening their next 28 days to visions of ghosts, terror, demons, hallucinations and pathological changes among themselves until they finally flee the haunted house.<br /><br />From the start we know that contractor George Lutz - Ryan Reynolds - (the new husband of Kathy) - Melissa George - has problems establishing himself as the 'stepfather' to reluctant children Billy (Jesse James), Michael (Jimmy Bennett) and Chelsea (Chlo? Grace Moretz).  Once the family is ensconced in the house Chelsea begins to play with the ghost of Jodie DeFeo (Isabel Conner) and George's personality changes as a result of the  house's curse.  It all comes down to terror in the requisite thunder, lightning and rain of all horror films until the family hits crisis state and leaves the house behind.<br /><br />The ghost effects are well done and the cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister and the musical score by  Steve Jablonsky  create a dark, ominous atmosphere.  But the real reason to watch this little thriller is the work of Ryan Reynolds as George, released from his usual silly potty mouth roles in teenie films  to show that he indeed can act, and keep his own brand of edgy humor intact - and that is no slight feat. Fortunately he is given the opportunity to display his extraordinarily hunky physique throughout the film, reason enough to see the movie!  Melissa George is likewise excellent as the tortured mother and is a perfect foil for Reynolds.  Not a great film, but certainly one that exceeds expectations set by previous forays into this overused story.

The original was a Good movie for being a older movie but this updated version brings us alot more. The house used in this movie is awesome. The movie begins with us seeing what really happened many years ago in the Defeo home. We see William Defeo shot to death every member of his family while they lay in their beds. What makes this movie even more great, is that actual footage from the real event is used in this film.... from police footage to the actual family members laying dead in a pool of blood in their beds. This movie, like the first shows the Lutz family move into the Defeo home because they get such a good buy on the home. Little do they know what lies ahead. This movie is excellently casted with great special effects. It is truly a edge of your seat movie. A thrilling and suspenseful remake. We see a once happy family start to fall apart as the home takes it's toll on George as he begins turning on his family. Mrs. Lutz realizes that when George is away from the home, he feels and looks much better than when he is in the home. She does research on the home and finds out that many years ago, a man named Katchum used the basement of the home as a torture chamber. After seeing this, she realizes that they must leave the home before the home destroys the entire family. Great from beginning to end. There are no dull or disappointing moments in this film. Truly one to own!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>I had high hopes for this remake.  The original 1979 film was a decent film but hardly a classic and certainly didn't do justice to the book which is one of the most terrifying books I had ever read.  But instead of improving upon the original, director Andrew Douglas, in his first major directing credit, goes instead for cheap scares and overused horror cliches and changes the story so much as to become completely unrecognizable from Jay Anson's book.<br /><br />You know the story...Ronald DeFeo kills his entire family in 1974 by shooting them with a shotgun as they slept.  He claims voices told him to do it.  A year later, George and Kathy Lutz move into the home with their 3 kids and dog Harry.  The colonial is way under priced and the deal of a lifetime and the Lutz's jump at the chance to get it.  Almost immediately the sinister house begins to affect the family.  Daughter Chelsea begins seeing and talking to an imaginary friend named Jodie who is the spirit of little murdered Jodie Defeo.  Here is overused horror cliche' #1...the creepy little girl ghost.  Seems every horror film these days has to have a creepy little girl ghost in it.  Of course in the book and original film Jodie was a pig whose shining red eyes George would see in Chelea's window.<br /><br />George is also affected by the home first with an unnatural chill.  He begins to spend much of his time in the basement feeding wood into the furnace.  Again, this is a change when it was the fireplace in the living room that George spent his time around.  A home in the mid-1970's doesn't have a forced air furnace?  George also begins seeing strange things which brings us to overused horror cliche #2.  You know whenever someone bends over a sink and then back up straight that there is going to be a terrifying image in the mirror.  Douglas gets huge mileage out of this cliche having twisted demonic faces appaear to george in mirrors, in the water of his boathouse, even on screen as he watches a home movie.<br /><br />George is becoming more and more hostile to his wife and step-children and increasingly violent due to the house's influence.<br /><br />The original film did a far better job of showing George's gradual decline into madness but this is streamlined here in order to show more fancy digital effects.<br /><br />Oh...and someone please explain why the ghost of Jodie has a single bullet hole through her forehead if she was killed by a shotgun???  While the book and original film had all of the family experiencing very tangible effects such as blood dripping from the walls, carpet being rolled up, black goo pouring from toilets and sinks, Douglas seeks to go for a more psychological angle to the horror and it just doesn't work as well.  Douglas and script writer Scott Kosar come up with some half-brained plot about a 17th century reverend who tortured and murdered indians on the site where the home is located which is completely unnecessary and over the top.<br /><br />I like Ryan Reynolds but it's hard buying him in this role after his long string of sophmoric comedies.  Both he and Mellisa George who played Kathy Lutz were a bit too young...or at least young looking, for their roles in this film.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful opportunity was missed to improve upon a so-so original film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>A disterbing decent horror film to satisfy any horror fan. I went to see the movie at the theaters having really no interest in the movie and I found it pretty good. The movie is really disterbing at times and really sick at times but that's what it's supose to be. The movie has scary moments and gory moments to make you jump out of your seat. The acting is ok I found it to be the downfall in this movie. They tried to make Ryan Reynolds charactor to mocho and showing his body off was stupid. Overall a pretty good horror film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>I've now seen both film version of the Amityville Horror and though the 1979 film had some charm, and also went in twelve different directions at once, the 2005 remake was more a horror film.<br /><br />There were many differences and similarities between the films.  Both were the same regarding the Lutz family and their buying a house that had a murder in it.  But the 1979 film had several scenes with the priest, a nun, the priest going crazy and catatonic, George's friends at work thinking he's crazy and so on.<br /><br />All these were cut out!  The 2005 film simplified things with the goings-on at the horror house, centering around the little girl and her invisible friend Jody.  There was more fear in this film:  a little girl balancing on a rooftop about to commit suicide, a dog being butchered, and George growing more and more insane with each passing day.  Ryan Reynolds was great as the slowly brewing psychotic who "hears voices" and wants to shoot up the family.<br /><br />I do miss the whole priest storyline from the 1979 film.  They had a token priest getting covered with flies and then he goes away and tells George's wife to move out.  Yawn!  There is the "get out" phrase being called to the priest, which was kinda cool.<br /><br />No homely babysitter who gets locked in the closet by a ghost.  Nope, we have a hot babysitter who takes every opportunity to show off her smooth abs as she tells the kids ghost stories and murder - at least until she gets locked in the closet (which has no locks) and goes insane!<br /><br />I'm not big on horror films but this one is pretty good.  Enough blood and gore to gross you out and several scenes of mayhem and fear to satisfy the casual horror film fan.<br /><br />DVD:  I enjoyed the special features, too many to list.  Several interviews with the actual people at Amityville, a spooky psychic, the police detectives of the time and so on.  A making of feature with the director, producer and make-up artist, and a chat with the cast.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Though I miss the charm of the 1979 film, the 2005 film is the better one.  Rental!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The family that now owns the house in Amityville at what was once 112 Ocean Avenue (but now has a different number) have changed the infamous quarter-moon windows in the attic to regular shaped windows to ward off tourists. For that matter, I understand the house in Tom Rivers, New Jersey that was used in the original movie version of "The Amityville Horror" changed those windows as well. I find this interesting because without those "eye" windows I do not think this would have ended up being the most famous haunted house in America. Of course, the half-moon windows on the house were pretty small and in both Hollywood versions they end up being a lot bigger, but then you know what happens when movies get made.<br /><br />They still tell us that "The Amityville Horror" is "Based on a True Story," but we now know enough about the writing and selling of Jay Anson's book to know that if the label belongs on this film then it belongs on movies like "Troy" because, hey, Homer wrote non-fiction too. But in the wake of "The Blair Witch Project" there is nothing wrong with a good hoax. Besides, this 2005 version of "The Amityville Horror" is the best movie ever made with that title, which includes the 1979 version with James Brolin and Margot Kidder, and all of its wretched sequels. But that does not mean that first time feature director Andrew Douglas (who made the documentary "Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus") is a truly satisfying horror film and the "history" of the house really does not give this movie a free pass on the willing suspension of disbelief. I watched this with all the lights out after midnight and had no problems sleeping, which is not the response the producers of this remake intended to be sure.<br /><br />The story is that in 1974 Ronald Defeo (Brendan Donaldson) took a rifle and killed everybody else in his family claiming that voices in the house told him to do so. The spookiest thing about the real murders was that all of the victims were shot in their beds from behind apparently without any of them waking up. But the script by Scott Kosar (who also wrote the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre") starts improving on reality at this point by having Ronald kill his youngest sister, Jodie (Isabel Conner), last in the closet of her attic bedroom. You might remember from the original movie and/or book that Jodie was the name of the pig from hell, but this time it is a little girl with a bullet hole in her forehead (hang on, because this is going to be one of those good things/bad things). When George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George) move into the house, the youngest of her three children, Chelsea (Chlo' Grace Moretz) and Jodie become friends. But after 28 days in the house, the Lutz family will flee for their lives.<br /><br />For me Jodie is the pivotal character because of the way she changes the whole equation. We know going into this movie that this is a haunted house and that there are malevolent ghosts. We thought that maybe they were the ghosts of the dead Indians buried beneath the house, but that really does not matter to what is going on in the film. But Jodie is a much more recent ghost and it appears that she might actually be a good ghost and not a bad ghost. After all, in what is my favorite scene in the film, Jodie pays back the evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty babysitter (Rachel Nichols) who delights in telling Billy (Jesse James) and Michael Lutz (Jimmy Bennett) about the murders. However, this film does not know what to do with the idea that there is a new ghost in there with the old ghosts, although that is clearly behind the film's final "boo!" right before the end credits.<br /><br />Ultimately, the horror here is not the house but what it does to George Lutz, and although the special effects are greatly improved this time around, the creepiest moments belong mostly to George, especially when he has an ax in his hands. In retrospect, everything that I liked about this film is something that Kosar came up with, and not from Anson's book, Sandor Stern's earlier screenplay, or any of the myriad stories the Lutzs have been telling over the years. But far too often Douglas relies on the old standard of a character turning around to be surprised by another character standing right, and you can only do that so many times before it becomes annoying. There are also some montages that will remind you of a Nine Inch Nails music video, however the cumulative effect is that this movie is going through a bag of tricks rather than telling a coherent haunted house story. The performances and special effects are much better here, but in terms of a coherent narrative the 1979 version would actually have the advantage, and that is not a good thing.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>What you see in `The Amityville Horror' is not suspense; it is a chain of shocks. One good thing about the remake of the hit film `The Amityville Horror' (which spawned countless sequels, one being 3D with then unknown Meg Ryan) is that it is never boring. While you are well aware that the film lacks originality, something always happens every five minutes, accompanied with loud soundtrack and occasional scares. Another is that the film (90 minutes) is much shorter than the 1979 original by more than 20 minutes. Surely the hectic pace of the story is what you can expect from the co-producer Michael Bay.<br /><br />[HOUSES DON'T KILL PEOPLE] This eternally popular `haunted house' theme needs no explanation. The Lutz Family buys an old house which is suspiciously cheap. And it turns out that another family is killed by one demented brother only one year ago. And in a month George and Kathy Lutz realize that they made a big mistake.<br /><br />What a big mistake. They didn't give much thought about purchasing a house in which horrible murders were committed. But George (Ryan Reynolds) goes, `Houses don't kill people; people kill people.' These words sound very familiar, but never mind. The point is, Kathy (Melissa George) soon finds out that her lovely daughter Chelsea starts to act strangely, talking to an imaginary friend. Add to that, Chelsea's baby-sitter is mentally shocked and is sent to hospital after unwisely staying where she shouldn't (as these people always do).<br /><br />These set-pieces keep coming to us like avalanche of horrors. At first it is pretty scary, but as the film goes on, probably most of the audiences would be able to anticipate the timing of the next shock. I don't say the film is scare-less, but these scares gradually get easier and cheaper. The brief explanations about the site of the house belong to the gory scenes of `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Philip Baker Hall (as a cameo) plays a priest, but his experience in the house is already known to those who have seen the original. The difference is that the remake does it with much bigger and louder effects.<br /><br />`The Amityville Horror' is not awful as some critics imply. The performances of the actors, especially those of the child actors are very good, and because of the slick pace of the film it gets seldom dull and boring. But at the same time, you must be thinking to yourself about the following two questions: `Why did they buy the house?" and "Why don't they run away from the house?" You are right, but stop thinking about them and only then you find it moderately entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>People who loved the first films (yes, this is a remake) will probably hate this one. People who loved the book on which the films were based will probably hate this film.<br /><br />...And that's because this is a film for the younger audience who just wants to have some scarry-fun and who couldn't care less about the previous works made on the subject.<br /><br />This film makes many changes to the original story and makes it more spectacular. It has many spooks and horrible ghosts and all those things that work so well.<br /><br />And I am glad to say this film is very fun to watch. It does have some great scarry moments.<br /><br />The only complaint I make is the total absence of development of the George Lutz character. At the beginning, he is a great guy... but the second he enters Amityville he transforms into a demonic dark-sided figure. The screenplay is so eager to get things going that it forgets to develop the character properly.<br /><br />But this problem comes from an incompatibility: the original character in the book (as far as I can remember) does not get possessed by the evil spirit. In fact, he is just a victim of the house like the rest of the family. But the screenwriters here felt they needed to get him possessed (so he would be a materialization of the house's antagonism). and here comes the problem: how could they develop this new thing if the family only spent 28 days in the house?<br /><br />They do not. The guy transforms so quickly we do loose some empathy with the character.<br /><br />But the film has so much atmosphere and scarry moments that I do forgave its flaws. I recomend this film if you never saw the original version (which I looove).<br /><br />This film is way above the average.<br /><br />Get some poporn, some friends, turn off the lights and enjoy!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Amityville Horror is like your usual haunted house movie. A happy couple moves into a new house. Despite strange happenings going on in the house, they stay there anyway. Well mostly since Reynolds' starts going nuts and won't admit anything is going on in the house. Sure you could knock this movie but compared to other more recent horror movies, it's not that bad.<br /><br />  It's certainly better than most movies that don't get released for critics. It's even better than most horror movies that do get released for critics. Funny man Ryan Reynolds is actually scary here and shows that he can do more than just bad raunchy comedies. Alias Season 3 star Melissa George isn't bad either as Reynolds' wife. The movie can have it's silly moments but it's scary enough to hold your attention. It offers tons of freaky images as well. It's a little too short and doesn't develop the characters that well but it's still scarier than Boogieman, Darkness and the Ring 2. So is worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I actually did enjoy the film. It is evident that this film is a first film for the director, and it is MASSIVELY evident that the producer interfered.<br />The story is extremely well known, at least the published version. I would urge anyone interested in the actual story to read Hans Holzer's material on the house; also, compare this with the work done by Diane Warren and husband. This is partially available on the 4th disc in the first three films box set. One of the precluded tv events is a very spookey interview done in Australia on the DON LANE  show in the seventies... this is VERY  scarey  TV.<br />Anyways, the deleted scenes are basically the very scarey parts of the film thrown out by the studio. The Documentary of the background events is extremely  interesting, and the making of featurette is quite interesting , but not as good as the background feature. The commentary is next to useless, BECAUSE this commentary dovetails with the so called multi angle  on set peeks special ... on their own, they would be great, but they are accessible only through a replay of the film.<br />The DVD is a good package, the film is a good watch, but the film suffers from the "too many cooks" syndrome ... it was a neat watch, and with the DVD it is a good elemental set ... now if only someone who is a real horror  spooky house fan could edit the material together.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>The Amityville Horror seems like a strange choice for a remake. The original movie was never really that great anyway, which begs the question of why this version needed to be made in the first place. The good news, however, is that it sticks very closely to the characters and story of the popular 1979 horror film, even recreating, with varying degrees of success, the 70's period look.<br /><br />The only major difference is that it's a half-hour shorter, which means the movie packs a punch much more quickly and is much more deftly paced. The movie also has a bearded Ryan Reynolds, who bares his spectacularly chiseled body at every chance he can get. And his body is indeed spectacular even though his chest is a bit too fussily buff at least for 1975 when the movie is set.<br /><br />George Lutz (Reynolds) is newly married to Kathy (Melissa George), who has three youngsters by her late first husband. That Kathy would have a 12-year-old son is a bit of a stretch, but this does create a new source of tension as the young and slightly overweight Billy (Jesse James) bitterly resents the new man in his mom's life.<br /><br />Everyone in the family is still getting to know one another as they move into the haunted house. Only the adults are aware of the house's grotesque legacy, with their fussy real estate agent, blithely sanguine about the strange goings on.  The Lutz's anxiety to escape the confines of a crowded apartment causes George to shrug that "there are no bad houses -- only bad people," even as the estate agent tells them that a mass murder occurred in the house a year ago.<br /><br />To the movie's credit, absolutely no time is wasted on the set-up with the spooky goings on rolling out almost immediately.  Blood pours out of the light fixtures, arms come out of walls, the kids having ghostly visitations, and George turns into a red-eyed madman chasing the rest of the family around with a maniacal grin and an ax.<br /><br />The bloodied ghosts of dead people turn up frequently, and are glimpsed in mirrors, empty rooms, and in nightmares, especially by George, who seems to become more and more besotted with the house. And the youngest child, Chelsea (Chloe Grace Moretz), claims to see the youngest murder victim, Jodie (Isabel Conner), though no one realizes that Jodie is trying to lure Chelsea to her death.<br /><br />The priest (Philip Baker Hall), who is unable or unwilling to exorcise the house's demons - he admits that the house frightens him - is thankfully marginalized here, he's replaced by a baby-sitter (Rachel Nichols); she's a sex kitten, who teases Billy and taunts the ghost of Chelsea. Locked in a clothes cupboard, she ends up freaked out and carted off in an ambulance.<br /><br />George's mental and physical deterioration remains the same: He gets sick, is constantly cold and obsessively chops wood to feed the wood-burning furnace. This film is willing to make the husband a much more unsympathetic character, and Reynolds does what he can with the rather pedestrian material, even sporting the beard that is obviously trying to make him look older than he really is.<br /><br />Fortunately, Australian actress George, as beautiful as she is talented, steps into the breach as family protector and turns the wife into the film's real protagonist. But the main problem with the Amityville Horror is that it's just not that scary - most of the creepiness comes across as rather silly and absurd, and there's a real sense that we've seen it all before. Nothing gets in the way of the rote staging, the ham-handed obviousness, and the feeling that you've been to this house, and yawned at these ghosts, once too often.

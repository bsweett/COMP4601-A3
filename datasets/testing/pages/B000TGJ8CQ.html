Flash forwards become flashbacks become flash forwards, thanks to the specifications provided by the authors for the ability to see the future. Particularly clever is the gimmick that one can see the future but that the very act of seeing and acting upon what one sees can change that future. Would that Edward G. Robinson, now long ago, would have had that kind of foresight, since what  he saw occurred inevitably, despite his best efforts to avoid it (John Triton 'The Mental Wizard' in Night Has a Thousand Eyes).  Cage underplays wonderfully well, the beautiful girl he loves acts like a beautiful girl with whom he would fall in love, and the FBI team chief (as you know, they are all women now) is suitably tough and impersonal most of the time. There is sufficient action to punctuate and motivate the film but the real star remains human. All-in-all, a fast paced and enjoyable 90+minutes with no deeper significance that what you see on screen. (Note, I do mild violence in describing  Robinson's finemovie in the interests of protecting the pleasure of future viewers)</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Yet another bad movie from Nicholas Cage. And Julianne Moore sucked too. Only redeeming part of the movie was Jessica Biel, who is a babe and did a pretty good job playing the requisite damsel-in-distress.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I'm surprised I like this film, but that keeps happening with me and Nicholas Cage.  The movies I think I'll hate, I love and the ones I think I'll love, I hate.  Weird.  Anyway, my best friend encouraged me to watch this movie and I'm glad that I did.  I thought the little quirk of being to see into the future for just two minutes intriguing.  I found Chris/Frank odd and charming.  Biel was actually pretty good as a love interest in this film and I even like the big twist at the end.  Win.  Win.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>Next is a average sci fi movie with a decent budget and good performances from top actors.  This movie didn't make it to alot of cities big screens in other words it wasn't a hit flick and it had a very limited release evidently.  It is out on blu ray and the picture is fine but then almost anything looks great on blu ray.  It's worth renting in blu ray if your local store has a copy or if netflix has one for rent but I would wait till the price drops to buy a copy of this one because you can get some real movie classics on blu ray for this price.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>Cris Johnson (Nicholas Cage) is a Las Vegas magician, stage name Frank Cadillac, with a talent a little more esoteric than sleight-of-hand: he can see 2 minutes into the future. His own future. The exception is Liz (Jessica Biel). When he's around her, he can see much further.<br /><br />He's been keeping a low profile, but comes to the attention of the FBI anyway. When he prevents a casino robbery, it gives Agent Ferris (Julianne Moore) the leverage to force him to work for them. See, there's this group of terrorists with a nuclear bomb....<br /><br />I loved the premonition plot, and was impressed by how well the concept was portrayed on-screen, as basically imagining the consequences to each small choice and then choosing the course of action with the best outcome. The best scene depicting that is in the diner when Cris actually meets Liz, the woman he's been seeing in visions.<br /><br />The action plot I wasn't quite so enthralled with. I didn't quite understand why they needed Cris's talents, and I didn't understand the terrorists' objective, and what the heck the FBI was doing to Cris with the eye clamps is a complete mystery.<br /><br />The climax, however, using the precognition in an action scene, was very cool, and I enjoyed it as much as the somewhat similar scene in Morgan Hawke's novella "Fortune's Star" in the anthology <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596321288">Hard Candy</a>.<br /><br />I know Nicholas Cage gets on some people's nerves, and this is not the movie to change their minds. I like him. It's Julianne Moore who gets on my nerves. She seems too bland to me to be convincing as a tough FBI agent. Eh. It's personal preferences, either way. If you like both of them, you'll probably love the movie. And Jessica Biel, well, she was just there. Eye candy, I presume. I'm not the target audience there.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>I must admit, I love time travel movies, but in the end, most fall short in the subject they're dealing with. They just can't get into their head that if you change one little thing, everything changes. "Next" avoids this problem altogether, by shrinking the margin of travel to two-minutes, for the most part. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself.<br /><br />Story: Nicolas Cage's character apparently can see into the future, which is both a blessing and a curse. He can see a bank robbery and a murder before it happens, and prevent it, saving innocent lives. But since the police can't see the future, they take offence at this mysterious magician seemingly punching people for no apparent reason. But he can also avoid them with this ability, which is how he chooses to live his life. But wait... then the darn government agents have to interfere, asking his to stop a nuclear bomb from going off. However, since his ability seemingly can only go two-minutes, he isn't much help. Until he meets a woman that seemingly amplifies his powers to great lengths.<br /><br />Concept: Pretty darn interesting, and original. His powers also evolve over time, making them and character, and for that matter, the movie rather unpredictable. And while the concept is handled rather well, the movie makes it very confusing for viewers that totally aren't mentally into the movie. But think of his powers this way, he basically can go "Groundhog Day" for two-minutes. Rather original, I think.<br /><br />Good Guys: Nicolas Cage is again amazing in the role, and is really perfect for the role, giving the character added depth and emotion. The character therefore is likable, and you feel for him, even though his background information is left completely out of the picture unlike most 'superpower' movies. Jessica Biel does surprisingly well, sure she doesn't blow you out of the water, and the character is pretty cut and paste, she still does fine with it. And even though Peter Falk is listed as one of the main actors, he has all but a few lines, and is more of a cameo.<br /><br />Bad Guys: Julianne Moore shows off her mean side in this film, and while she was never a bundle of joy, she isn't exactly a caring government agent in this film. Exact opposite, while she's doing her job, the character plays good cop sometimes, her only use for Chris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is too stop the bad guys, which isn't bad, they just bring up some torture questions in the movie, which I personally could have done without. Definitely not the best of roles for Moore.<br /><br />Her partner however could be even worse, not because he's mean or anything, but thank god he only says a few lines, because he's just a downright pathetic and horrible actor to the nth degree. You cringe everytime you hear him speak. Soap-Opera bad doesn't describe it, it's Sci-Fi channel bad. Pathetic, and a real oversight on the director, and Producer Cage. The terrorist on the other hand are pretty bland, and cardboard. But with the main terrorist's name being "Mr. Smith," did you expect anything else?<br /><br />Effects and Action: There's a bunch of "oh snap!" moments in terms of action in this film. Particularly the jumping over the tracks, and totally awesome hill sequence. That was just amazing, until the part at the bottom, where I noticed a couple of effects that looked about ten years old. But other than that, they rarely fail to disappoint. While they aren't exactly blockbuster, they're pretty good considering the rather low budget.<br /><br />The End: Here's the thing, up until this point, I've thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was ready and willing for another half an hour, and it looked as if it was heading in that direction, because that's what happened in every other movie like this. They go through the scenario the first time, screw up, try it again, get it right, happy ending. However, with this movie, you're forced to make up the ending on your own. 'But wait, I'm seeing somebody else's story, so I don't have to make up my own.' Well, if you're that type of person, and most of us are, you won't like the ending at all. But apparently, they didn't have the production budget for it, so they cut the movie about 30 minutes short. Sure you'll feel cheated, sure you'll be angry.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a rather enjoyable popcorn flick, and a great movie to see on TNT or something. It has a great concept, an interesting story, and good characters. However, all these element have their glaring flaws that mar a otherwise great movie. It's still a good movie, just not great. Also, you have to really pay attention to this movie, because you'll get confused very easily if you don't. Chris's power evolves, and sometimes you don't know what is the future, and what is the present, so sometimes you'll be shocked. But if you do pay attention, the movie is actually improved because of those otherwise confusing elements. And I actually would love a sequel to this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>What would you do if you could see into your immediate future?<br /><br />This is a concept movie that actually works very well on a number of levels. Admittedly, the ending can be feel like a cop out to many viewers, but it actually is very much in keeping with the general theme of the movie. Accept it for what it is and it's really not that bad an ending.<br /><br />Cage is, as always, very laid back in his portrayal, but that works very well for him. His magician persona works best when he gives no tell of what he is planning or what he has seen in the future.<br /><br />To put this in proper context, this movie is inspired by a short story by Philip K Dick, who wrote the stories that spawned "Total Recall", "Blade Runner", "A Scanner Darkly", "Paycheck" and "Minority Report".</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Next" is an action film built on an intriguing sci-fi concept. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Cris Johnson, a Las Vegas "magician" who can see the future. Actually, he can see only two minutes into the future, but his uncanny ability would be still useful for some people, like an FBI agent played by Julianne Moore, chasing a group of terrorists who have smuggled a nuclear bomb into America.<br /><br />Yes, the film's story is implausible, full of plot holes and sometimes the "two-minutes-into-the-future" idea seems totally forgotten, but once action gets started, the film is entertaining. I really enjoyed watching Cage's hero evading dangers, running (or walking) away from guards hiding behind objects in a casino, or dodging numerous objects flying and falling (including a bullet) in the cliffside scene. One humorous scene has him trying to talk to his love interest, a beautiful teacher named Liz (played by Jessica Biel) that reminds us of "Groundhog Day."<br /><br />Unfortunately, Cris' romance turns out one of the weakest parts of the film. The heroine is too generic to make the love story interesting and though Nicolas Cage's character remains likeable and watchable, most characters in "Next" are colorless or given too short time to shine like Peter Falk's. We are not allowed to know even the motives or backgrounds of the terrorists. Special effects are not very impressive and some of them look hurriedly done.<br /><br />While watching the film, I was wondering: "Why didn't they use Julianne Moore's no-nonsense FBI agent as Cage's possible love interest, who is definitely a more interesting character than Biel's. You know this is not a masterpiece, but you will also find this film could have been much better, more thrilling with minor changes. Perhaps that is why some people (including me) didn't like the ending, which looks a bit abrupt.<br /><br />I'm not saying "Next" is a terrible film (especially after seeing "The Wicker Man," which it is.) But the film still needs more actions, more chemistry between Cage and Biel, and most of all, like "Ghost Rider," more original ways to make use of the hero's unique abilities.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I've gamed with my share of psychic characters in various modern-day role-playing games, but for some reason male precogs has never gotten the same attention from Hollywood.  The clairvoyant types are always women or kids who talk to ghosts, with the exception of Stir of Echoes...which was about a guy who talked to ghosts. It was high time we had an action-packed, testosterone-injected update of the typical precog movie.<br /><br />Our hero, Chris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is wandering around Vegas performing magic tricks.  Something is keeping him there: normally, Johnson can only see a few minutes into the future.  But when he encounters (or will encounter) Liz Cooper (the delectable Jessica Biel) at a diner, he discovers he can see his future with her, and only with her.  At heart, Next is a star-crossed romance.<br /><br />What's entertaining about this somewhat flimsy premise is that Johnson can make it work.  Nobody as hot as Cooper would normally be interested in shlubby Johnson, but he keeps trying alternate approaches, visualizing an endless array of possibilities, until he hits on the tactic that will work.<br /><br />As you can imagine, precognition is a lot like time travel, and it's difficult to visually pull off.  Next does an excellent job of showing what Johnson sees and the innovative ways he uses his gift; at one point, we see him splitting into multiple selves (representing all the possibilities of a particular course of action).  In combat, this is really fun to watch - since Johnson can see when someone will throw a punch, he can easily dodge the blow.  He can even dodge bullets.<br /><br />Into this tidy romance steps Callie Ferris (the usually gorgeous Julianne Moore, who looks terrible in this movie), a federal agent bent on using Johnson's powers to stop a nuclear bomb from going off.  The plot spins from there. The terrorists, who are tracking Ferris, figure that Johnson must be important because the government wants so desperately to speak with him, so they try to kill Johnson.  In other words, the movie is something of a closed loop - the whole reason Johnson gets involved is because people THINK he might be important, and thus he becomes important.<br /><br />Next has its flaws, however.  For one, Cage acts like he's in a daze.  His character is bland, confused, and a little addled - not in a cool, I-have-mental-powers sort of way, but an old-man-who-forgot-his-meds sort of way.  It's not very appealing, and strains the credibility of any attraction that Biel's character would have to him.<br /><br />Speaking of Biel, she's simply too attractive for the role.  At the time of the film, Biel was 25, Cage was 43.  They seem wildly mismatched in age, personality, and temperament. Biel does a good job acting bewildered and enchanted, but she's essentially making goo-goo eyes at a walking, talking zombie.<br /><br />The other problem is that Next simply doesn't have enough of a budget to pull off all the really cool special effects in the film.  The worst is when Johnson drives a stolen car in front of a train; the train, the car, and the crash look like they were made on a Commodore 64.  It takes away from an otherwise riveting scene.<br /><br />The bad guys are non-descript Eurotrash.  Their motivation is vague, although they seem to be so powerful that the bad guys even shadow the feds without being noticed.  No wonder the only person who can defeat them is a psychic!<br /><br />When Johsnon and Ferris team up, things really get going.  There's nothing like watching a precog and a sniper work in tandem.  Or a precog wending his way through a maze trapped with bombs.  Or a precog...well, you get the picture.  It's fun stuff.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, Next plays fast and loose with the timeline.  At any point in time, we're never sure if we're seeing the future or if Johnson is actually experiencing the future.  Depending on your perspective, this is either an interesting twist on the action genre or really annoying.  The ending pivots on the phrase, "I made a mistake..."<br /><br />Was it a mistake?  I don't think so.  This little movie works with what it has.  Sometimes it might overreach, but for the most part it's an exciting science fiction action thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>Can you say Philip K. Dick.  They based this movie on a story by Philp K. Dick.  This was a great movie.  I'm not a huge Nicholas Cage fan but, he was good in this movie.  There were a few cheesy parts but, overall, it was a lot of fun to watch.  The special effects were good and you start getting hooked in right away.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I liked most of this movie, especially the special effects, but the ending is too abrupt and the story is never resolved.  I like movies where the author tells you the ending.  It bothers me when I have to figure it out.<br /><br />Cage is ok in his role but not quite as good as he was in National Treasure.  His relationship with Jennifer Beals character seemed forced and not real.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is excellent as a Secret Service agent tying to enlist Cage's ability to see into the future so that she can prevent an atomic bomb from destroying Los Angeles.<br /><br />It could have been a lot better.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Clever little action romance that executes fairly well on the little twist of the idea that Cage can see 2 minutes in the future.  There are a few holes in the story and questions about how his gift actually works,<br />but the beauty is it that they keep the action excellently paced which<br />makes it an enjoyable experience.  It's a bit cheesy in parts, but has enough clever twists that keep you engaged and trying to figure out what else may be in store.  Another solid performance by Cage.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>Very interesting film. It was missing a few components though. Some scenes were a stretch, but the viseral and thought impact made up for most of its shortcomings. Nicolas Cage is not one of my favorites but he was spot on as the "magician" who can actually see 2 minutes into the future. Great storyline. Seeing the future can be more complex then most people would think and the movie is careful to point that out. That adds realism. I was disappointed with Jessica Biel. Sure shes got a hot body but something was missing from her acting. I think its more that she was the wrong person for the role, too prissy. Pleny of twists and turns. Much time and thought was put into the making of this and it shows. This is the kind of sci-fi that develops appreciation from true lovers of the genre. Its good to see Peter Falk in a film again, especially this kind of film. Pure entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Philip K. Dick has been the resource of stories for some very exciting films (Minority Report, Total Recall, Blade Runner), but in NEXT, his short story 'The Golden Man' as adapted by Gary Goldman and directed by Lee Tamahori, the concept of precognition as a human feature in altering  the future falls into a video game format that becomes more action film and less human interest tale.<br /><br />Cris Johnson AKA Frank Cadillac (Nicholas Cage) is a sloe eyed Las Vegas grungy magician who has found a way to hide the fact that he has the gift to see two minutes into his future, a gift that rewards him at the gambling tables but draws attention from the FBI after a thwarted attempt on Cris' part to stop a robbery is captured on video tape. The FBI, especially Agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore), knows that a nuclear device has entered the USA by terrorists headed by 'Mr. Smith' (Thomas Kretschmann), and that if the device cannot be traced, a nuclear bomb threatens the lives of millions of citizens.  Agent Callie observes Cris' talent and engages him to aid in the discovery of the site of the device. But Chris' powers lead him to a beautiful young woman Liz (Jessica Biel) with whom his powers to see into the future can be extended for more than the requisite 2 minutes. After a series of 'attempts' at introduction, Cris and Liz bond, allowing Cris' expanded powers to be of more help to the persistent Agent Callie.  From that point on the film dissolves into yet another combustible crashing action flick with endless CG special effects, all but erasing the character development.  And the ending is as one might expect - not very Philip K. Dick in style.<br /><br />Cage and Biel do well, Moore seems bored with her character, and Kretschman yet again embodies the evil of terrorism and beyond. There are some rather extraneous scenes on an Indian reservation that add little except the beauty of the Grand Canyon to the story, and there are some truly funny scenes of themes and variations on the chances we take in approaching a potential love source.  But in the end all gets rather lost in the explosions ad infinitum that mark the film as a routine action flick.  Grady Harp, September 07</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>The Two Minute Warning might have been a better title for this film, as Next is the name of last years Michael Crichton novel, and "The Golden Man" the name of the story that the film was based on would be confusing. Philip K. Dick the late great Short Story writer, has been adapted many times in the last few years, trying to recapture the brilliance of "Blade Runner" (the adaptation of "do androids dream of electric sheep) which was in fact better than the story.<br /><br />Next almost (but not quite) triumphs, the writing is pretty good, but unfortunately the actors are never quite able to make it completely convincing or believable. After watching the DVD, I watched the interviews with the cast and saw that all they cast had to say was how great it was to work with Nick Cage. Cage, who really did the best job in the film, but listening to him talk... He clearly didn't understand the concepts involved in the film, and with all the other actors taking the lead from him, the shortcomings were understandable.<br /><br />Still, this is a pretty good DVD, (with some original concepts, picking up on the girl, and the fighting were especially interestingly done) when compared to what is out there, so if you like movies with an element of ESP, you should enjoy this just fine. I'd just advise you to skip the commentary</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>This type story has been visited many times, but this is a nice variation on the theme. I didn't feel I was watching a remake of anything. Cage plays a magician with a Vegas act that gets noticed by a government agent played by Moore. She wants him to find a bomb terrorists have planted. Now it sounds predictable and it is to some degree. However; I was never bored or felt the story was out of line. Overall a reasonably entertaining SciFi movie. I recommend renting before buying. I think it is replayable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>With a title like "Next" hopefully the studio is prepared for the inevitable ridicule likely to afflict their movie, unless it transcends its trite name with spectacular substance and quality. It doesn't. However, Nicolas Cage's most recent actioner does contain an ample amount of thrills and an intricate storyline that is surprisingly unpredictable for a movie whose main character (and therefore the audience) can see two minutes into the future. But if you learn anything from this movie, it's that it doesn't really matter what happens Next.<br /><br />Based on the short story The Golden Man by Philip K. Dick, Next follows the precarious life of Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage), a man both gifted and tormented by his unique ability to see a few minutes into his future. To stay off the radar of those wishing to exploit his powers, Johnson poses as a magician in Las Vegas and supplements his income with risk-free gambling. Desperate to avoid a nuclear terrorist attack on Los Angeles, FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) begins a search for the magician in order to use his intuitive prowess to discover the precise target location. Initially unwilling to help, Cris is eventually apprehended by Callie and agrees to cooperate to save the girl he loves from a horrifying fate. But even with his superhuman intuition and the aid of the FBI, will Cris be able to reach her in time? Does it even matter?<br /><br />A quick narration by Cage informs the viewer of Cris Johnson's powerful premonitions and sets strict parameters concerning his abilities. He can only see the events pertaining to his own life and then only for two minutes in advance. Then probably less than that amount of time later, they break these rules and every possible exception is made, posing the question of why guidelines were introduced at all. Even with such a premise, Next manages to keep the audience guessing - a feat more impressive than it sounds, and if you can see the ending coming then this movie was probably based off of you. But unexpected unpredictability aside, many sequences will probably remind you of effects and situations from such predecessors as Minority Report, The Matrix, and D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, and that same startling conclusion ultimately negates everything the movie worked so hard to build and cements the concept that it doesn't really matter how the movie ends, so long as it is wholly unsatisfying.<br /><br />Of the condensed cast, Cage is easily the most interesting character, but not because of his visionistic aptitude, but rather his sarcastic humor and cocky bravado. With the ability to see the future, no matter how brief, Cris is a force to be reckoned with, and many of the most entertaining sequences are such due to the displays of those powers, be it in combat or in wooing Jessica Biel. Moore is adequate as the domineering FBI agent, though her talents seem wasted after her performance in Children of Men. Biel lends her attractiveness and little else as Cage's mysteriously fated girlfriend and proves Cage moves fast with the charm - but to be fair he does only have 96 minutes to get the girl and save the world. As for the antagonists, a more stereotypically lackluster and standard group of villains one would be hard pressed to find, although the random mix of languages they speak, including French, is anything but typical from Hollywood terrorists.<br /><br />With a plot so outlandishly realized that you can't help but wonder what will happen next, Lee Tamahori's sci-fi thriller seems destined for something greater, but stumbles with a conclusion equal parts inventive, unanticipated, and unfulfilling. Bouts of clever dialogue and fun action only go so far, and while the film stretches these elements to their limits, several bland characters and an unfortunately ridiculous execution of interesting concepts produces a movie that feels more like the last thing you saw and less like the Next.<br /><br />- Joel Massie, MoviePulse.net</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Cris Johnson (Cage) can see two minutes into his future.  It helps him avoid things he wants to avoid, and excel in things he wants to excel in.  His gift also lets him look more than two minutes ahead into the life of Liz (Biel), a woman he has never met.  While he is searching her out, FBI agent Callie Ferris (Moore) is tracking him.  She knows what he can do, and needs his help to stop a nuclear bomb from destroying Los Angeles.<br /><br />"Next" could have been so much better.  In fact, for the most part, it is better.  The twist in the last ten minutes of the film and the abrupt ending thereafter works to undermine all the good stuff that has gone on before.  In fact, without those last ten minutes, this probably would have been a 3 ? star review.  People generally like or hate Nicholas Cage, with little grey area.  I fall into the former category, and appreciate his off the wall take on most characters he plays.  He is good as Cris, a man haunted by what could happen.  Jessica Biel is adequate as the love interest, and Julianne Moore gives her usual good performance.  The problem with the movie is its attempt to be clever at the end.  While not cheating, it establishes the character of Liz as a mere plot device and robs the audience of a satisfying colclusion.  I recommend waiting for DVD to see "Next".</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>No matter how well this plot might have been (and I must admit, it was strangely intoxicating), there is one undeniable truth that resonates from this film like the white, thick puss from a zit, and that is the fact that a guy who looks like Nicholas Cage, receding hairline and 44 years worth of aging and ape-like facial difficulties to deal with, and a gal like Miss Biel, 26 years old and quite possibly the most beautiful actress under the age of 30, would never, never, never hook up within their first six lifetimes of living together, let alone their first day together as this film tries to sell us on (I know, this is the longest run-on sentence in Amazon history). Only in Hollywood, people, only in Hollywood.<br /><br />Think about it. The film spins Cage's character's advances in a funny way, but to propose that he would have a one in a billion chance with a woman so stunning was enough for me to discount anything else the film tried to peddle. I could see them becoming friends, I could see them becoming good friends, but getting their groove on within the first half-day of meeting? PaaLEASE! No way does that happen in reality. Never.<br /><br />Gary Goldman, the man responsible for writing the main portions of the screenplay, is the guilty party here. He just had to take a very well-made film and throw the most unbelievable romantic plot development since Elisabeth Shue's character going for Cage in Leaving Las Vegas (I know, I'm not very nice to Cage).<br /><br />That being said, that DVD box is in and of itself worth buying. My gosh, whoever marketed that shot of Jessica in that shirt should get marketing executive of the year or something.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A (Paramount) / Region A, B, C<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />Running time: 1:36:10<br />Movie size: 30,727,809,024 bytes<br />Disc size: 39,483,346,411 bytes<br />Total bit rate: 42.60 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 31.93 Mbps<br />LPCM 5.1 48 khz/24-bit/6.9 Mbps English<br />DD AC3 5.1 640Kbps English / Spanish / French<br /><br />Special Features - All presented in HD.<br /><br />#Making the Best Next Thing (18:14)<br />#The Next "Grand Idea"(6:51)<br />#Visualizing the Next Move (7:46)<br />#Two Minutes in the Future with Jessica Biel (2:27)<br />#Theatrical trailer<br /><br />The U.S / U.K versions suffers from Jaggies aka Aliasing.

Are they going to make sequels or what?!<br />*Not sure if it's accurate to the original story (then again, every adaptation of PKD tends to be different for some odd reason...).<br /><br />I didn't expect much, but this film turned out to be very slick.  The action and effects are smashing, and jive really well with the central idea.  The whole movie is engaging, but not hyper or overdone.  The only bad weakness is the end (don't you just hate those endings when the main character wakes up and it turned out to be a dream? Ugh).  However, if they intend on making sequels, this would be a promising start.  I would gladly reccomend this to action or sci-fi fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>If you could see the future, would you be rich or a government slave?<br />Are we really more connected to some people than others?<br />Is there really a "greater good" that needs to be served<br />in the name of goodness?<br />The good thing about this movie is it gives you nothing about<br />"predestination" or loops in time.<br />The acting is very good, the script writing and setting are also fine.<br />They did maybe more than justice to Philip K.

My local newspaper reviewer said the plot was convoluted - what rubbish!  This is one of the easiest films that one could watch.  Yes, the film could have been much darker and more complex.  Philip Dick the writer had a propensity for that - but of course, what we get is not a sci-fi film noir but a Nicholas Cage film.  I am a big Nicholas Cage fan, but I have to say that he no longer (if he did) has that dark edge.  He's almost cartoony - and his hair needs serious help.  Still, a good cast, a simple story - make this easy to follow.  Rent or buy it for entertainment.  Nicholas Cage's performances would be much better if someone could do a Sean Connery on him and fix his hair.  Seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>The story premise is simple enough, a small-time magician is born with a gift to see into the future albeit two minutes of it to change his life. By accident, his gift is spotted by the Government Agency, which intends to use that as an avenue to track down the whereabouts of the nuclear bombs planted in LA before it's too late.  Furthermore, the terrorists also hunts for him because they want Nicholas' character to be shot before their whereabout is revealed.  As the saying goes, I would be buggered if I do & I would be buggered if I don't.  Thus, Nicholas needs to be a step ahead of them until he comes across Jessica's character that he's enamoured to.  Then, everything become personal.  There are odd light hearted moments such as Nicholas considering his chances of breaking ice with Jesicca's character.  This is an okay movie rather than great because even after the movie concludes, it's actually suggesting more permutations of the future.  The special effects is so-so where we could see what's real and what's not.  Commendable watching for watching's sake.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Philip K. Dick adaptations are a tricky science.  Now and then, you'll get genre classics like Blade Runner, A Scanner Darkly, and to a lesser extent Total Recall.  Other times, you'll get Paycheck.  Next falls somewhere in between, with Nicolas Cage starring as Cris Johnson: a two-bit Vegas magician who can see two minutes into the future.  Using this ability to get by via gambling, Cris soon learns that a government agent (Julianne Moore) is after him to use him to track down terrorists and a stolen weapon, but all Cris has on his mind is a mysterious woman (Jessica Biel) whom he keeps seeing visions of.  Next does get off to a great start with some inventive storytelling that actually manages to echo Dick's "The Golden Man" story of which the film is based, but it sadly veers into a pretty predictable, glossy action yarn that doesn't suit the talents of the otherwise solid director Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day).  The villains (featuring the talented Thomas Kretschmann) get no depth at all, nor do many of the other characters besides Cris, and the film's ending will just leave you infuriated.  Still, Cage is actually pretty good, and Biel is surprisingly good as well, but neither can manage to save this flick.  All in all, Next is a disappointment in terms of being a fan of Philip K. Dick tales, and as a stand-alone sci-fi/actioner, just doesn't offer enough to keep you interested.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Several of sci-fi author Philip K. Dick's wonderful stories have been translated to cinema over the years, the most notable ones of which are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N918">Total Recall (Special Limited Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UD0ESA">Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL78">Minority Report (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. I even liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBNDY">Paycheck (Special Collector's Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767810880">Screamers</a>. But Philip K. Dick's received shabby treatment from the film industry as well, what with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMK6LW">A Scanner Darkly</a> and with this one, NEXT, which is loosely based on Dick's short story "The Golden Man."<br /><br />Some plot SPOILERS follow.<br /><br />The premise of both MINORITY REPORT and PAYCHECK hinges in part on a character's knowledge of future events. Same with NEXT. All his life Cris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) has been able to see, with precise clarity, 2 minutes into his own future. All his life he's learned to keep a low profile, and even now he, as the Amazing Frank Cadillac, ekes out a living performing in a shabby little magic act in Vegas, wherein he could disguise his talent as a magic trick. Now and then, because his show doesn't pay a lot, he ventures in a small way towards the gaming tables. Cris is real careful. But, it turns out, he hasn't been careful enough.<br /><br />No-nonsense FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) senses that Cris is more than he seems and asks him to help her locate a nuclear bomb set to detonate in Los Angeles. Cris, however, wants no part of it. He's instead fixated on a beautiful girl he's yet to meet, a girl he glimpses in a bout of precognition. But the FBI aren't the only ones spying on Cris. The terrorists, having noted the FBI's interest in the magician, have been keeping tabs on him, as well. And, in Liz, the girl in the vision, the terrorists and the FBI have finally unearthed Cris's weakness.<br /><br />What drew me to the film was the cool sci-fi set-up. And, unlike most films or books, NEXT endows its lead character not with nebulous visions but with well-detailed peeks into his 2 minute window. The most enjoyable and exciting moments in the film deal with Cris utilizing his gift to deftly evade capture in a casino. This sequence, in terms of its pinpoint timing and execution, is very reminiscent of the hide & seek scenes in MINORITY REPORT and in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWYJ86">The Bourne Ultimatum (Widescreen Edition)</a>. After that, the diner scene, where Cris finally meets Liz, is the best and the most humorous. Okay, so these are the good things.<br /><br />Where does the film fall apart? Let's start with the villains, who seem to be mainly Europeans, but are mostly ill-defined and seem to appear in the movie simply because token villains are needed. The last half hour of so of the film deals with Cris taking on the baddies, and I can honestly say that these blaring, full-blown action scenes turn out to be the most dull and uninteresting of the lot. I simply didn't care. Another flaw is that there are too many moments throughout the film where the pace seems to just trudge along. What else? How about the introduction of Peter Falk's supporting character early on and then never seeing him again?<br /><br />And then there's the love story, which to me isn't pulled off convincingly. You have the lovely and grounded Liz, as played very nicely by Jessica Biel, and I guess I don't have it in me to believe that a practical girl like her could instantly hook up with someone like Cris, who, at first glance, seems a dubious and creepy character. When she gets guilt-tripped into offering him a ride, I was thinking: "How very not clever of her." Admittedly, a large part of it is that I just wasn't feeling any chemistry between them.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I was ready to forgive and forget all these botherations because I liked the sci-fi gimmick so much. That is, until the ending came along and completed the sabotage. The abrupt ending really, really, really sucks! Although, in retrospect, I guess it's a fitting end to a movie which had been spiraling downhill, anyway. On the acting side, I wish Nic Cage would dial down the quirky a bit. Even Jeff Goldblum says he should tone it down. If he does, I feel his characters would be better off and be more sympathetic. Cage is this close to becoming a caricature of himself. I also expected better from Julianne Moore. Props to Jessica Biel, though, for putting in an honest effort.<br /><br />In the "Just in case no one's mentioned them yet" department, here's what we get for special features, which also let down the fans: the obligatory "Making Of" featurette (18 minutes); "The Next 'Grand Idea'" - a 7 minute featurette focusing on a corner of the Grand Canyon (where several scenes were shot) and its Indian reservation; "2 Minutes in the Future with Jessica Biel" - a brief and boring interview; and "Visualizing the Next Move" - an 8 minute f/x segment centering on the CG aspects of the film. Overall, a dull set of extras. Sorry.<br /><br />What cleverness there is in this film is ultimately drowned in poor choices and bad film-making. NEXT should've been better. Instead, when folks think of this movie - if they think of it at all - they'll think of the neat sci-fi gimmick, yeah, but also that this one's a derivative action picture with many lulls. In the end, Cris Johnson becomes a character I fear the viewers will forget 2 minutes after having seen the film. And that's just doing Philip K. Dick a disservice.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>Cris Johnson can see the future!  Two minutes from now.  And only if it involves him.  Unless you're talking about a hot blonde chick named Liz, in which case, all bets are off!<br /><br />Speaking of betting.  There's a very cleverly done scene in "Next," where Johnson is winning a little too well at a blackjack table.  The guys with eyes in the sky send some goons down to muscle the prognosticating Johnson into the backroom, but he spends the next ten minutes ducking, dodging, spinning, and weaving through the casino with the casual elegance of a man who knows exactly where all of his pursuers will be at all times.  It's fun to watch, but there's also no real point to it.<br /><br />Starring Nicolas Cage (one of my favorite guilty pleasures) and a taking-it-waaaay-too-seriously Julianne Moore (as the bullheaded FBI agent Callie Ferris), "Next" is nothing but a premise on a platter.  Pretty much every scene that's even remotely engaging involves Cage dodging giant logs, winning fights without throwing a punch, or thoroughly searching three factory floors without ever taking a step.  I'll admit, it's cool, but it's also the same "cool," over and over again.<br /><br />But there's a lot here that's not that cool.  Like the you-gotta-be-kidding-me love story.  Or the cheesy Russian villains.  Or Cage's hairdo.  (First <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBEO">Ghost Rider</a> and now this.  What, these films can't afford hair stylists?  The poor guy looks like he's wearing a hood without the sweatshirt.)<br /><br />But the biggest not-cool of them all, and the reason I dropped my rating down to two stars, is the flatline of a finish, a pathetic wrap-up that, quite literally, gives one the impression that they have just watched a movie that was never meant to be finished.  It's one thing to give an audience a gimmicky premise and, for emotional resonance, attach the threat of a nuclear bomb (who ISN'T afraid of those things?).  It's another thing to take all of that resonance (what little there is) and trash it for one last play on the gimmick.  It may be hard to believe, but this flick has no resolution, has no ending, and nothing is solved.<br /><br />I wondered, walking out of the theatre, why I didn't see it coming.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>The basic concept of the film, that Nicholas Cage was born with the ability to see 2 minutes into his own future...and can thus affect the outcome of the future...is kinda fun.  That he has become a cheesy Vegas lounge-entertainer / mind-reader in order to elude the notice of the government is just unusual and plausible enough to amuse.  It's funny to see Cage on a chintzy stage, performing really bad mind-reading tricks.<br /><br />But we see these things in the first five minutes of the film...and it is straight downhill from there.  It's hard to say enough bad things.<br /><br />Let's start with Cage himself.  He can be a superb screen actor...over the years I've loved him in RAISING ARIZONA, MOONSTRUCK, LEAVING LAS VEGAS and especially ADAPTATION.  He was charming in PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED.  He brought solid quirkiness to THE ROCK and even the underwhelming NATIONAL SECURITY.  But he is on a huge loosing streak right now...GHOST RIDER was pretty bad, but WICKER MAN was laughable, and now NEXT allows him to reach absolute rock bottom.  It's hard to imagine an actor looking less interested or engaged in his work.  His hang-dog demeanor and droopy eyes now just simply make him look asleep.  He also has really bad hair...it makes Tom Hanks in DAVINCI CODE look positively stylish.  It is long and black...like bad spray-paint black...the type of hair-dye that community theaters buy at Walgreens.  And his skin has a thick layer of the most unconvincing "tan" foundation I've seen in a movie since the days of STAR TREK TOS.  He looks, frankly, like a man who is dying of a wasting disease and is trying to cover it.  I mostly worried for Nicholas Cage's health watching NEXT.  He's just hard to watch.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is just wasted.  She's been making some pretty poor choices lately...I guess the good roles she had been getting for awhile have run out.  I think back a few months to CHILDREN OF MEN...a movie I LOVED...and I remember even then thinking the tough, action-minded thing was not her strong suit.  Now I'm convinced of it.  She is a tough woman, but needs to play it with an edge of fragility.  That's what has always made her interesting.  She flounders a bit in underwritten, generic roles.  Jessica Biel, who helped her case as an actress with THE ILLUSIONIST, fails to convince in her silly role as a sensitive, unassuming young woman who teaches in the Native American villages around the Grand Canyon.  There are also ZERO sparks between her and Cage...but that's more the fault of bad writing and bad Cage.<br /><br />The plot goes from a trifling amusement to just plain ridiculous.  There are one or two good ideas...such as late in the film when Cage sends himself in many directions at once to see where the bad guys are hiding.  It's a rare moment of marginal originality.  The action sequences are few and far between.  The special effects are also fairly lame.  If you saw the previews for the movie and saw the huge explosion...that's it!  It made the film look almost like a disaster movie, with some expectation that the little snippet of film we saw was just a clip from more ambitious scenes of destruction.  Nope...you saw it ALL.<br /><br />Anyway, I've spent too much time on such a forgettable movie.  Do not see NEXT.  Simple as that.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>The casting in this film didn't work too well. With the exception of the National Treasure movies, I've never been overly impressed with Nicholas Cage as the leading man in a movie.  He's a strong supporting actor.  Plus Cage seems to be a little old for such an action-driven part with a young love interest. And I hate the hair style and its attempt to make him look younger.  And I just don't like Jessica Biel.  Not sure why.  And Julianne Moore tries to be the tough FBI agent and just comes off as a you know what.  And it didn't help that they left important questions unanswered (particularly the one revolving around Biel's character).  So why did I give it 3 stars?  Well, it does have some very good moments that made it worth watching.<br /><br />The story is actually quite interesting.  A man with the ability to see a few minutes into his own future?  What could a person do with that power?  The film uses it to provide a lot of humor, for one.  Chris uses it in the casino, then uses it to dodge security in said casino.  One bit that was very good was how he not only sees into the future, he can see more than one possible future depending on his own actions.  When he finally meets Jessica Biel, he changes his "approach" several times to see what will get her to like him!  Cage is charming and it comes across here.  While I think he was too old for the part, and the love-interest of Biel, he did well with it because a person would have to have years of experience to use that power as well as he does in this film.  The special effects were well done.  Nothing awesome, just suited to the movie's tone and story.  The story also had some surprises thrown in to keep the audience guessing. When was Chris using the power, and when wasn't he?  The nuclear bomb scare that has Moore hunting him was silly.  I just couldn't see how his two minutes of sight could help there (and neither could he).  The producers never managed to overcome that, though they did try.  It would have been better to just have them after him because of the power itself.  The ending.  Well, the ending will leave you thinking about the entire film.  Some will hate it, and some will love it.  And though I don't like to admit it (as I fall in the first camp) it was nearly perfect for such a movie.<br /><br />Overall, give this flick a chance and rent it.  I was entertained, and that's the most important criteria that needs to be met.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>I adore Philip K Dick stories, and am always thrilled when any of them are turned into movies, even if it's a bad one. At least it will get people to read his books (which are *great*) and hopefully it'll encourage more stories to be made into movies. Next falls into the category of an interesting story completely twisted in the movie version. Even more interestingly, if you read the Wikipedia entry on this movie, you'll see that the script went through some drastic changes. It was initially much like the book - and then it was convoluted to turn into what you ended up watching.<br /><br />In the original story, the main character was a mutant without any thought, emotions or "humanity". He just ate, slept, had sex, and could see into the future to escape harm. The main thrust of the story was that "real humans" were afraid if this mutant went around creating baby mutants that this race would end up wiping out humanity, because they would have the evolutionary edge. The worry was that thinking, feeling "superior" normal humans would be lost while this "animalistic" mutant would take over solely because of his ability to see in the future and avoid harm.<br /><br />All of that thinking-vs-animal conflict is completely lost in this movie version. Really, the ONLY thing that's the same is the see-into-the-future aspect. Nicholas Cage uses his talents just to make money in a Vegas act and in gambling. The government knows a nuclear bomb is being brought in and they want to have him see into the future to help them stop it. Nicholas falls in love with a woman (Julianne Moore) who has been in his thoughts. You get a variety of situations where Nicholas uses his future-looking to help him woo Julianne, to avoid trouble and so on.<br /><br />I kept thinking how this was pretty much Groundhog Day and if this had come out first it would have been cool - but it was done SO much better in Groundhog Day that it seemed stale here. Also, where Groundhog Day had believable characters who developed and grew, here the characters were both unbelievable and bizarre. Just why would Julianne go with Nicholas the psycho anywhere? Why are the terrorists doing what they're doing? Why did Julianne react the way she did in the diner (the final time) to Nicholas' repeated attempts to talk with her? It was like they had some ideas but ran into a deadline to begin shooting and just went with the half-finished script rather than actually finishing the storyline up.<br /><br />There were other random homages in there too. One scene with the government agents "using" Nicholas to watch TV was pretty much straight out of A Clockwork Orange. Maybe someone in the film crew loved that movie and wanted to re-create the scene? It made little sense story wise. Why not have him listen to the radio which wouldn't require eyeball-prying devices? And plus, he's only there for maybe 2 minutes before he says "I don't want to do this" and the big bad agents go "Oh ok well never mind then."<br /><br />Philip K Dick is famous for his twist endings, but this ending was AWFUL. It made no sense at all for someone who can see into the future and know which path to take. Heck, many things make no sense. Why would he unleash a random situation like "car cascading down a mountain" when he had many other paths which were much more logical? I imagine they wouldn't have made for as spectacular stunts, but that's never a good reason plot-wise. They could have at least tried to make the plot make sense.<br /><br />It's worth renting this once to see it, just because it is a Philip K Dick story at heart, but this isn't a keeper. It really makes me think that this could have been an awesome movie, if they fleshed out some of the storylines involved. Maybe if Julianne was also a future-seeker which is why she made the comment she did in the diner. Maybe if she was involved with the terrorists which is how they knew to look for him. There were a lot of possibilities in there - but they were all missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>While I've never read the Philip Dick story this movie is based on, I'll have to say this story has some strong points on its own. Nicolas Cage is great as "Frank Cadillac" or Chris, as he prefers to be called. He can see two minutes into his own future, and this opens some interesting possibilities. It's funny to see him run through several different pick up scenarios before finally finding one that will work with Jessica Biel. This ability also saves his life several times.<br /><br />The storyline moves along at a good pace. While there are some boring scenes, there are enough "Wow!" moments to keep you hooked until the end.<br /><br />Ah, the end...there's our problem. In an attempt to pull out a great plot twist, we end up with a very cheated feeling. It's almost as if we don't get to see how it all ultimately works out. This could have been fixed with about 5 minutes more screen time, but we don't get it. I'm pretty sure the DVD will probably have an alternate ending in there somewhere because I can't believe this is how they originally envisioned it.<br /><br />As a whole, this was a good movie and I really enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect, and seemed to stumble under the weight of its plot a couple of times (who were the terrorists? where did they get the bomb? Why would a woman like Jessica Biel agree to drive a man she'd just met across the desert...especially when the guy looked like a psycho?), but it was worth the time it takes to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Next brings to the screen the story of Chris Johnson, a.k.a.

Things "liven up" when a government agent in her effort to find a group of terrorists aiming at detonating a nuclear bomb somewhere in the United States attempts to enlist Chris Johnson who seems to be rather preoccupied with other matters...<br />There are slight hints of the X-Files, Deja Vu (Denzel Washington), Frequency (Dennis Quaid, James Caviezel), Timecop (Van Damme) and The Lake House (Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock).<br />Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, Jessica Biel, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.<br />The only major setback is in relation to those "geniuses" that came up with the French-speaking Europeans as the villains and with no explanation whatsoever as to their motive!  It's not as if there aren't enough prospective terrorists out there, they're lining up for crying out loud, so why go with some of the most unlikely candidates?<br />What European would even bother to act as such in reality???<br />Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good.<br />In conclusion, Next is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  4.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Next, a movie based on the Philip K.

The interesting thing in this movie is that he can see all possible futures; this led to some interesting scenes in the movie. The plot revolves around terrorists planning to blow up LA who finad out that this guy could upset their master plan. Government agents are looking for this guy too for the same reason. Ahh, terrorism, the all purpose plot device - why blow up LA? Just because I guess - whatever..<br /><br />  Anyway, the special effects are cool, there are some good action sequences and Cage is a good choice to play the main character in the movie.

I read some bad reviews of it online, but wanted to give the movie a chance.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage plays a character that can see 2 minutes into the future, which is certainly a superhuman ability.  You can imagine many of the scenarios that might unfold through use of this ability, but the movie manages to keep it fresh and interesting.  I think the subtleties of his ability and actions are portrayed very well.  He is quite the smooth operator, and plenty cool.  There is a lot of action in this movie, and it is exciting from the start.  I also liked the fact that love enhances his ability, and liked Jessica Biel as his love interest.  If there was a flaw in this movie, it would be the ending, which left something to the imagination... a bit too much to the imagination by some people's standards.  However it doesn't ruin the movie in my opinion.  I only buy movies that I really like and want to see again many times.  This is one of those movies.

"Next"--based on Philip K. Dick's short story "The Golden Man"--is about a man who has the ability to see two minutes into his own future, which is just enough of a heads up to prevent certain things from happening. The idea is enough to attract anyone's attention, and thank goodness that it actually redeems itself by the end of the film; while nowhere near as complex or thought provoking as last summer's Philip K. Dick adaptation--"A Scanner Darkly"--it still manages to be a thoroughly entertaining story, a pre-summer popcorn flick with an engaging plot and decent performances.<br /><br />The film opens in Las Vegas, where Cris Johnson (Nicholas Cage) headlines a magic show under the alias Frank Cadillac. When not on stage, he gambles at local casinos, puffing on cigarettes while trying to manipulate his odds of hitting jackpots. He is, of course, under constant surveillance, and on this particular night, his antics go a little too far, prompting Security to intervene. The situation is made worse when he envisions a casino shooting and prevents it from happening; he makes himself look guilty, and he's forced to escape. This sequence is loaded with plausibility problems; even if you have the ability to peak into the future, it's still impossible to escape the ever-present surveillance cameras (I should know; I've been to Vegas many times). Not only can Security see his every move, they also follow him closely as he darts around the casino. Yet he escapes with ease. He also manages to steal someone's car.<br /><br />Luckily, the rest of the film succeeds in overshadowing this sequence. This is when FBI agent Callie Ferris (Julianne Moore) is introduced; she's had her eye on Johnson ever since learning of an international threat against America. A group of Russian terrorists have stolen a nuclear warhead and plan to detonate it in Los Angeles, which will result in the deaths of eight million people. Johnson's precognitive abilities are perfectly suited for preventing a disaster of this magnitude, which is why she feels justified in forcing him to cooperate. After all, it's not about him: it's about saving millions of lives.<br /><br />Johnson, as you might expect, is not anxious to be a pawn of the American government. The most obvious solution is for him to leave Vegas and hide in some remote part of the country. But he can't. This is because, for reasons he can't explain, he's been having visions of a young woman in a local diner, and he simply has to meet her and find out why. This is a troubling situation; when it comes to this mystery woman, he can see far beyond two minutes into the future. It's never adequately explained, even when he finally does meet her after months of visiting the diner, sitting at the counter and sipping away at martinis (you usually don't associate martinis with diners, but I digress). Her name is Liz (Jessica Biel), and she befriends Johnson when he disrupts a confrontation between her and her controlling ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />It isn't until the two meet that Johnson finally decides to flee Vegas; they both travel to Flagstaff, Arizona, where Liz teaches at a local Native American reservation. Unbeknownst to them both, Agent Ferris and her team are hot on their trail. The same can be said for the Russian terrorists; Johnson is a threat that must be eliminated at any cost.<br /><br />Parts of this film play like scenes from a run-of-the-mill Espionage Thriller, much like the material of a James Bond story: we have the dastardly plot to destroy a major city; we have the international bad guys; we have the lone figure who has the ability to stop them. This was actually more of a distraction than anything else, which may be bothersome to those who have read the original Philip K. Dick story; to say that this adaptation is unfaithful to its source would be an understatement. But in all honesty, a comparison is completely unnecessary. I say this because the screen story stands on it's own, and for the most part, it works. Johnson is a fascinating character--someone both blessed and cursed with a supernatural ability that could be used for humanity's benefit. But how would it benefit him? "If I help you," he says after he's caught by the FBI and restrained in front of a TV screen, "you'll keep me strapped to this chair forever." He has a point; he may be able to foil this nuclear threat, but it would mean the loss of his personal freedom.<br /><br />The final sequences of the film follow a fairly routine structure: Johnson teams up with the FBI hoping to save both the population of Los Angeles and Liz, who has since been kidnapped by the Russians. Johnson's ability is used to its fullest at this point; this is a treat for the audience, especially during a climactic sequence in an industrial complex. All this paves the way for an end sequence that I didn't see coming. I won't go so far as to call it a twist ending, but I will say that it was unique. I don't know if the same can be said for "Next" as a whole, but so what? It was entertaining just the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>Okay, by all accounts I'm supposed to hate this movie. It was critically panned and even the review on the FX movie channel I'm rewatching it on right now gives it one star. Usually I am in full agreement with the professional reviews, but not this time. This is one of the movies that is pure escape for me. I don't analyze every little detail when I watch this movie and I don't find myself being super critical the way I am with other movies. Can't really explain why, but it might have to do with the beautiful theme music, the beautiful settings of the movie, or the incredibly beautiful Jessica Biel. Man this woman takes my breath away and she especially looks lovely in this movie. Maybe I'm soft on this movie because it's about a guy creatively figuring out how to get the woman of his dreams, and I had a similar challenge meeting my current girlfriend. Unfortunately I did not have the main character's ability to see into the future to increase my odds, had to do it the old fashioned way.<br /><br />There are some interesting twists and turns, and I have to admit I did not see the end coming. I thought it was a very creative use of his ability. The acting is solid, Nicolas Cage is his normal self, and you either like him or you don't, I like him. As beautiful as Jessica Biel is I think she's a fine actress. Julianne Moore is always great in everything I see her in and the rest of the cast is fine as well. I really appreciate the fact the movie never becomes some sappy love story, it never becomes cliched.<br /><br />So if you're a super critical reviewer maybe you'll see all the plot holes, poor acting, contrived circumstances, and bad script writing, but as I said, none of that stuff entered into my mind. This is not an oscar worthy movie, but it is a super fun escape for a few hours, and honestly isn't that the point of movies in the first place, escapism?</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>This is your Swiss-cheese thriller for the summer of 2007. You know, with so many holes that they're almost par for the course, but the overall experience is one of momentary delight anyway. You savor it, then you go on your merry way. Suspend disbelief for best results.<br /><br />The whole crux of the movie is the FBI's frenetic hunt for a bunch of handsome European miscreants (sporting a bouquet of dialects) who're about to detonate a nuclear warhead in or around LA. The reason? Not sure. Perhaps to make a big bada boom. Perhaps to look real scary. We will never know, nor, I suspect, would the FBI team from the film. But that's not to stop them from acting all pensive and thriller-like. It showers much of the spotlight on light humor involving the protagonist and his love interest instead. He's a magician with a special skill that you should find out for yourself, and she's, well, magical. Some liberal scatter-shot editing follows, but it's a fun ride. The visuals of the Grand Canyon (that's what they were I presume?) are breathtaking. The ending credits roll does justice to the theme, and may get a final round of laughter.<br /><br />There is no way this film merits a serious review, but I will take the time to report one serious gripe: the hairstyles! Tom Hanks may have done an enormous disfavor to the cinematic community by sporting his little rumpled tuft in Da Vinci Code, which seems to have taken off -- Jim Carrie in 23, and now Nicholas Cage here. Time for some scissors, Hollywood! As for Julianne Moore, she's an actress in such fine form that although she's evidently in the middle of something goofy she brings to it the kind of pizazz one would expect from an actual blockbuster.<br /><br />Don't confuse the film with Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, be prepared for a pastime flick at the intellectual caliber of National Treasure, get your Coke and choco-chip icecream, and buckle up to enjoy a basically senseless ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>This title is already released on Blu-Ray in the UK so this is a review based on my viewing of this film on Blu-Ray. This will however, not be a review of picture quality or menu fluidity. This will simply be a review about the movie itself, the characters, scenery and the story are all something I will touch upon.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for "NEXT" I thought it seemed a bit too corny and a bit too full of CGI to even give us a credible storyline. However I was proven wrong when, after a recommendation from a friend I decided to get this on Blu-Ray.<br />From the first few minutes of this film I knew my first impressions of this film were clouded by partial judgment, as within the first few minutes we were subjected to a slick and stylish action thriller.<br /><br />The story is that a small time Vegas strip magician known as Cris Johnson has an extraordinary gift to be able to see 2 minutes ahead. This to Cris is a curse as he is never surprised and as a child subjected him to rigorous testing which left him bitter and lonely. After Cris sees that a man is about to rob the Casino, he tries to stop him which leads to a misunderstanding and means that Cris has to leave. After stylishly dodging each security guard he manages to escape the Casino and the clutches of the FBI who are chasing him for another reason. A group of Russian terrorists gain possession of a Nuclear device and threaten to set it off in L.A. The Russians want to kill him and the FBI want him to help them prevent this major terrorist situation, the only problem is that Cris is always two minutes ahead of schedule.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage has never really been my favourite actor, but in roles such as this he really pulls off the character brilliantly. Cris Johnson is a man that has never been surprised, he's always been able to tell what happens next and this has helped him escape some sticky situations.<br /><br />Jessica Biel plays the love interest, that admittedly has no real depth to her character or any sort of dimension that would make us care for her and their relationship.<br /><br />Julianne Moore plays the hardarse FBI agent who simply wants him to help prevent the possible deaths of 8 million people. She simply wants him to help prevent the tragedy then to send him on his way, but as she comes to know Cris and how he feels and works she becomes more emotionally involved and it eventually becomes a relationship that is more than just business.<br /><br />Overall the film is quite intelligent and quite slick, the scenes where we see Cris consider all possible scenarios before he takes the appropriate action are very well done. The character of Liz really drags down this movie as the relationship seems rushed and simply doesn't work as the character is very much one dimensional anyway. I honestly think Cage shines in this film and action movies are something that I think Cage can actually carry on his shoulders.<br /><br />This is a very good popcorn movie although it did have its flaws there's no doubt it's entertaining and can give you a good night in.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>No movie based on a P.K.Dick story can be entirely without interest. The concept of looking two minutes into the future is a good basis for an interesting plot. This movie has quite a few good scenes exploring it. Best is of course the diner scene when Cage gets to know Biel.<br />The weakness of the movie is the lack of plot for the terror scenario. It is not enough to take a bunch of different young Europeans and some Asians and let them handle something which is said to be a nuclear device. Actually this part is like a simple copy of 'Die Hard IV', but without bothering to explain the who and why.<br />So let us send the producers of this movie back to the drawing board. With a good script writer, something could be made out of this story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Clear proof that not all Philip K. Dick short stories have enough substance for a feature film. Desperately short on creativity, Next takes a clever original concept (precognitive masquerades as a low-level Vegas magician) and promptly spins it into a pulpy blob of action goop. Along the way it mixes in a roomful of to-the-letter FBI stereotypes, a painfully shoehorned love story and a weirdly under-explained cell of nuke wielding French terrorists. Even the mindless action scenes are toothless, as Nic Cage's future-weary prophet sees every bullet coming before the gun's even drawn, basically playing the part of Neo without the presence of an Agent Smith to counter his moves. Nic Cage is his usual anti-charismatic self, old and burnt-out at a glance, but the real surprise isn't how low Cage sinks - it's how far Julianne Moore is willing to follow. Both players imbue their roles with such a wooden lack of emotion that I wouldn't be surprised to learn the entire film was comprised of first takes. Dull, passionless and predictable, it's a futile waste of ninety minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>This film is very well made and its subject matter is about a man's (Nicolas Cage) ability to see about 2 minutes into the future. In real life it's a rare ability that some people have in some particular area(s).<br /><br />Cage's character, who uses his ability to perform magic tricks in a stenchy Las Vegas downtown casino, has been waiting for his true love (Jessica Biel) for years and he saw her in his mind for years. Once he meets her in a Diner, his abilities extend to see the future a couple of hours in advance, and he realizes that based on his actions he can change the immediate future to some extent.<br /><br />And that's the interesting part of the film to see various possible outcomes of the immediate future if he, Cage's character, makes this or that decision/action at the moment. This flick is executed very well, and yes, because Cage being an Elvis fan to the bone, there's some Elvis touch in there. Nicolas Cage, who years ago I wouldn't have cared to see him in any movie, has grown as an actor and again delivers a superb performance - he's really a great actor.<br /><br />Julian Moore wasn't too exciting as she plays a special FBI agent or something, but her character and performance seems flat. Also, the script had its problems with some lose ends here and there as well as some high-school quality dialogue with the lines of the supporting actors at times.<br /><br />Jessica Biel is appealing as usual and she ads color and brings life/authenticty to the film.<br /><br />The overall storyline of the nuclear bomb threat seems somewhat of an afterthought, but that's okay, because I think the main issue is that phenomenon of certain people having the ability to see briefly ahead for a few seconds or a minute and making certain decisions based on such an ability, while in this flick of course the ability is Hollywood overemphasized, but it's a movie. Why do I give this film 4 stars, because it's stylish, and the acting escpecially by Nicolas Cage is excellent, and it's interesting and a fun film to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is one of the best action movies I've seen in years. The film is a mix of the films 'Memento','Ground Hog Day' and 'Spider-Man'. The premise is interesting, there is lots of action, a decent love story and a guy with a super power!.....well sort of. Nick Cage is perfectly cast as a magician in Las Vegas with a unique ability to see into his own imediate future. Pay close attention as Cage's character will go from seeing his future to present in a matter of seconds. This reminded me of Spider-man's "spider sense" as Cage is able to do some pretty cool tricks with his incredible ability. Jessica Biel is Cage's love interest and she does a very good job...not to mention, she's really nice to look at! A very cool story that had me totally engrossed from beginning to end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Nic Cage "stars" alongside his hair - bronze medal for most ridiculous movie hair behind David Spade as Joe Dirt and...Nic Cage in Con Air - Jessica Biel and Julianne Moore in a movie that was better the first time when it was called D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, and the third time when it was called Source Code.  Essentially it's another Groundhog Day paradox movie, but in the future, where someone alters the current timeline through some sort of time travel mumbo jumbo.  That sci-fi vehicle is driven by the FBI's desperate hope to stop random European terrorists from detonating a nuke in LA.  As if anyone would notice.  Agent Ferris (Moore) leads the effort by pursuing Frank Cadillac (Cage), a cheesy Las Vegas magician who just happens to have the ability to see two minutes into the future.<br /><br />The filming has some really slick scenes, and the manner in which the filmmakers utilize Cadillac's talent is truly creative.  Nothing worse than a lack of imagination.  Right, Green Lantern?  Adding in Jessica Biel surely doesn't hurt.<br /><br />Fairly unoriginal, but aside from inconsistencies that are inherent in all sci-fi movies like this one, everything is done very well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>Nic Cage plays a very quirky guy who seems to just be floating along in life.

How do they know about him and his talents?  Also, the enemy is looking for him too?  I must have missed something because I am not sure how they know about him at all.  You see Julianne Moore as the lead FBI agent on the case, she is just great, intense, professional and inflexible in what she is doing.  Each scene keeps you wondering if you are seeing the reality or a flash forward two minutes into the future.  So, there are definate surprises throughout the movie because of this.<br /><br />Although from the same author as the Minority Report and Total Recall, there are definate elements that you have with a surprise or two, yet this is so much less so a full blown scifi thriller as it has little related to that since it not a futuristic movie.  Cage is just a guy with a gift.<br /><br />Jessica Beil is one of his visions, and with her he can see further out for some reason.  When he finally meets her there are some very funny scenes that are 'replayed' that look like great outtakes.<br /><br />The movies climax is just great, the last  1/2 hour is a definate intense thrill.  He goes from the rim of the Grand Canyon to Los Angeles as one long avoidance of disaster.  His gift keeps him safe, so he is almost like a superhero and that is what makes the movie so fun.  The end is a real cool surprise, worth the price of the DVD or at least a rental.<br /><br />I prefer to acquire the movie because there is so much in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Of course, you'll have to suspend all common sense to get through this digital effects sci-fi 'thriller,' But you'll be very entertained, even if the plot has holes like the Grand Canyon. Why do these terrorists want to nuke LA? We are not told. I guess they planned to commit suicide when the bomb goes off. Anyway, Nick Cage plays a Vegas magician with "precognition," i.e., he sees the future, but only 2 minutes ahead and only if it involves himself. Just for ha-has, they make him fall for luscious Jessica Biel, because who wants to look at balding, jowly Nick Cage for 90 minutes? He is way, way too old for Jessica, but no matter. The avalanche and the nuclear explosion look very digital, as do the many scenes of Nick melting and morphing and zigzagging backward and forward in time.

Cage is more interested in meeting the woman who he had a vision of. She is the only vision he's ever had that's more than 2 minutes into the future. He uses his weird ability to charm her and keep ahead of the FBI. The people who stole the bomb are also after Cage to kill him.<br /><br />I think someone had the idea of a guy who had a limited ability to tell the future but obviously didn't know where to go with the premise. This story doesn't work. The love story between Cage and Biel is dull and unbelievable and to top it all, no explanation is given for why he saw her so far in advance. The bomb story line is just poorly thought out. The bad guys are indistinct and uninteresting and no reason is given for why or how they stole the nuke.

Nicolas Cage is great as "Frank Cadillac" or Chris, as he prefers to be called. He can see two minutes into his own future, and this opens some interesting possibilities. It's funny to see him run through several different pick up scenarios before finally finding one that will work with Jessica Biel. This ability also saves his life several times.<br /><br />The storyline moves along at a good pace. While there are some boring scenes, there are enough "Wow!" moments to keep you hooked until the end.<br /><br />Ah, the end...there's our problem. In an attempt to pull out a great plot twist, we end up with a very cheated feeling. It's almost as if we don't get to see how it all ultimately works out. This could have been fixed with about 5 minutes more screen time, but we don't get it. I'm pretty sure the DVD will probably have an alternate ending in there somewhere because I can't believe this is how they originally envisioned it.<br /><br />As a whole, this was a good movie and I really enjoyed it. It wasn't perfect, and seemed to stumble under the weight of its plot a couple of times (who were the terrorists? where did they get the bomb? Why would a woman like Jessica Biel agree to drive a man she'd just met across the desert...especially when the guy looked like a psycho?), but it was worth the time it takes to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Next brings to the screen the story of Chris Johnson, a.k.a.

Things "liven up" when a government agent in her effort to find a group of terrorists aiming at detonating a nuclear bomb somewhere in the United States attempts to enlist Chris Johnson who seems to be rather preoccupied with other matters...<br />There are slight hints of the X-Files, Deja Vu (Denzel Washington), Frequency (Dennis Quaid, James Caviezel), Timecop (Van Damme) and The Lake House (Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock).<br />Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, Jessica Biel, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.<br />The only major setback is in relation to those "geniuses" that came up with the French-speaking Europeans as the villains and with no explanation whatsoever as to their motive!  It's not as if there aren't enough prospective terrorists out there, they're lining up for crying out loud, so why go with some of the most unlikely candidates?<br />What European would even bother to act as such in reality???<br />Nevertheless, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good.<br />In conclusion, Next is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  4.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>"Nex"t is directed by Lee Tamahori, who also directed one of my favorite films (and his first feature), Once Were Warriors, a fiercely provocative story about Maori culture.  The good news about Next is that Nicolas Cage turns in one of his better performances. No one does the disaffected outsider like Cage, the oddball guy on the fringes who couldn't care less about what's going on around him. Unfortunately, he often takes that persona to such as extreme that he appears to be sleepwalking through his role. This was particularly apparent in Ghost Rider (2007), in which Cage slouched through the whole production, seemingly bored by everything in sight, trying to pass off a bad Elvis imitation as a "character choice." As Cris Johnson, Cage brings his bored detachment up a notch, to cynical self-interest. At least he seems more involved in the proceedings this time around, and he's actually a fun character to watch.<br /><br />Julianne Moore reprises her Clarice Starling role from Hannibal (2001) here, as tough-as-nails FBI agent Callie Ferris, a no-nonsense government hound who, one suspects, would have been perfectly home at Guantanamo Bay or Abu Ghraib. Moore seems a little uncomfortable barking orders, and her performance comes across as somewhat forced and unbelievable. She lacks the fire and the intensity for a role such as this, and she makes it way too obvious that she's "acting" throughout.<br /><br />What can one say about Jessica Biel? She's eye-candy, pure and simple, with little else to do in this film besides providing a sounding board for Cage and serving as the damsel in distress. For what was required of her, she's fine in this role.<br /><br />The premise as presented, that someone could constantly see every possible outcome of every possible action and still be relatively functional, is a tough one to accept, but if you can get past that and suspend your disbelief for 96 minutes, Next can be a fun film, filled with some great action sequences.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>Cris Johnson ,a two-bit Las Vegas magician whose "nom de plume" is Frankie Cadillac, has a most unusual gift since birth: he sees two minutes into the future.It has served him handily at gambling and other things such as wrestling a gun from a would-be shooter,etc.  but Cris (Nicholas Cage) has been picked apart for this gift all his life and he wants to be left alone with it.Enter FBI operative Callie Ferris (the ever lovely Julianne Moore)who,following Cris for a while, tries to convince him to work in cahoots with her and the Bureau to reach a nuclear bomb before annihilation occurs.Cris goes on the run and encounters first, Lizzie (Jessica Biel) a really ridiculously good character who helps underprivileged children, and secondly the terrorists who want to find  Cris so that their  plans to blow up everything are not thwarted.I submit that this is an accurate yet superficial plot summary.<br /><br />Apart from the neat concept of the "two minutes ahead" theory, this film just has so many holes in it, that as in time-travelish films a certain degree of belief has to be suspended.This requires way more suspension  than that! Moore's character has figured out the "two minute" thing.We never know how. Cris' powers become way more advanced in Biel's presence.No clue-never explained.The "terrorists" want to blow things up, but we are never told  to why .Is two minutes warning really enough time in the first place to even defuse this bomb? The worst part,though, are the endless chases that Cage endures.Once or twice is fine,but it gets a little predictable and ho-hum after a while,and Cage NEVER even looks tired!<br /><br />NEXT is nothing at all special.It may engage and entertain for a while,but little more than that.

It's also fun to see Cage's latest bad toupee.<br /><br />Cris (Cage), using the stage name Frank Cadillac, performs cheap tricks in a run down Las Vegas nightclub, under a stage name, to hide his real talent. He is certain that if the government, the `enemy', anyone, discover the nature of this talent, he will lose his freedom and be forced to work for them in order to live. His talent? He can see the future. Granted, he can only see about two minutes into the future, but this is still a valuable skill. There is only one problem. The government already knows he has this power. Callie Farris (Julianne Moore), an FBI agent, has learned that a nuclear bomb missing from the Russian Federation is on its way to America and wants, needs Cris to help them determine when and where it will go off. But Cris has dreams of a beautiful young lady, Liz (Jessica Biel) in a diner and shows up every day, determined to meet her. When Cris finally does meet Liz, he conspires to get her to take him to Flagstaff, because he knows she is headed there. Naturally, Farris and her arsenal of FBI employees are hot on their heels. Oh, and the terrorists, led by Mr. Smith (Thomas Kretschmann, "King Kong") know about Cris as well and want to stop him, because they know he can foil their plans.<br /><br />"Next", directed by Lee Tamahori ("Once Were Warriors", "Die Another Day") and based on a story by Philip K. Dick (who wrote the story that would become "Bladerunner"), takes a completely implausible premise (with more than a few plot holes - how do the terrorists know about Cris?) and makes it an enjoyable piece of fluff to help while away a few hours. Actually, scratch that. An enjoyable piece of fluff to while away 100 minutes. This is one of the reasons "Next" was more enjoyable than I had any right to expect. It was relatively short for a film in this genre, most run two hours or longer, so it kept the action moving.<br /><br />Cris is introduced doing his two-bit magic act at a rundown lounge in a rundown casino in downtown Vegas. He uses a stage name, Frank Cadillac, and gets paid in cash, all in an effort to stay off the radar. To earn extra money, he uses his skill at the tables, earning just enough to make some good cash and not attract any attention. Yet, the casino security people are watching Cris. Even as Cris says he is trying to stay under the radar, he seems to know the casino is watching him. Does he have premonitions as well? He knows that as soon as his ability is revealed, his freedom will be jeopardized, so he tries to stay low key. Naturally, this doesn't work for long. Farris and her assistant are in the audience watching the show. And everyone seems to realize there is a limitation to Cris' ability.<br /><br />This is another of Cage's one-note performances. Throughout the entire film, he seems to be grimacing (in pain? shock?), his face blank and his eyes vacant. But this sort of works for Cris. He is always looking into the future, and these images seem to dull his opinion of the world. Also, he is fairly certain that if his ability is revealed, he will end up in a padded room under observation, so he has to remain fairly low-key.<br /><br />It's sad that the most interesting thing about Cage's performances, lately, is anticipating how bad his toupee will look. In "Next", he has longer hair, slightly greasy looking, which fits his character well, but still looks exceedingly fake.<br /><br />Because Cris can only see a few minutes into the future, he has fairly limited ability, yet he is able to use this ability to elude pursuers. And this leads to some interesting action scenes. As Cris engages in foot chases or a car chase, he is always able to make the right move, at the right moment, to elude his attackers. This helps to explain his almost `super human' ability to stay out of harm's way. Particularly impressive is how he ducks and weaves, much like a martial arts expert, to elude punches, bullets, falling logs, etc.<br /><br />But this same `two minute rule' leads to the biggest plot hole in the film. Moore's Farris wants Cris' help to locate the stolen nuclear weapon. When Cris finally agrees to help Farris, she plants him in a medical chair in a concrete room wearing glasses that prop his eyes open. Someone wearing a medical jacket puts some drops in his eyes and he can suddenly see further than two minutes into the future. Huh? Actually, in the beginning of the film, he has dreams of Liz (Biel) showing up at a diner at a specific time on a day, yet he doesn't know which day. Clearly, he is already seeing a few days into the future, so this becomes a sloppy plot point, a huge hole in the story. Why is he suddenly able to see further into the future than he was previously? To give the filmmakers more latitude with the story? The filmmakers created this universe; if they needed Cris to be able to see further into the future, make his skills more ambiguous in the first place. Don't simply change the rules after they are established.<br /><br />I think we were supposed to forget about the vision of Liz once Cris has established contact with her. Biel's character then simply becomes a damsel in distress.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is fine, but unexceptional as Farris. Throughout, she remains steely and determined to find the nuclear weapon, no matter what the cost. Because of this, she shows little emotion when some of her team members die in the line of duty. See, she is trying to prevent a bigger loss (millions of innocent people are at risk. Millions!), so the loss of a couple of team members is a small price to pay.<br /><br />Why is Julianne Moore taking roles in films like "Next"? This is essentially the same type of role she played in "Children of Men" (a much better film) to lesser effect here. This is the role Alec Baldwin or Danny Glover generally walk through when they are simply collecting a paycheck. Has Moore really been reduced to that? Collecting paychecks? Julianne, hold out for better roles. If you aren't careful one of the television networks will soon be announcing the premiere of your new television series.<br /><br />The one good thing about her character is she trusts Cris' vision and stops when he tells her too, orders her underlings to pay attention to the two-bit magician, and more. She takes his ability seriously and it helps save her life more than once. So often, people second guess the heroes ability repeatedly, despite evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />Jessica Biel continues her quest to perfect the `pretty damsel in distress' role, the type of role where the character becomes little more than a damsel in distress. As the girl in Cris' vision, she is his ideal of the perfect woman. But since we know Cris has seen her, and he can see in the future, he will no doubt do exactly what is required to win her love and admiration, which isn't much. It seems they are in bed together fairly soon after meeting. But of course, this helps to make her a more important pawn in the story; the villains can use her now that Cris has fallen in love with her.<br /><br />Peter Falk even pops up and totters around for a few minutes. What connection his character has to the story is unclear; he seems to be some sort of mentor to Cris' character. But after the action gets going, we never see or here from him again.<br /><br />The best thing about "Next" is the action sequences and Cris' ability to be able to weave through them without harm. Particularly impressive is a chase down a hillside involving many different items careening down the slope after our heroes and the villains, logs, trucks, boulders. They even manage to throw a huge stagecoach into the mix, sort of like throwing in the kitchen sink for good measure.<br /><br />The ending has an interesting plot twist. On the one hand, it piques my interest. On the other, it almost seems like the filmmakers ran out of money and had to simply end the film. But Tamahori does this with more skill than I am describing. If I went into too much detail, it would spoil it.<br /><br />"Next" is a better film than I was expecting, and I wasn't expecting much. That said, it is a fun bargain matinee for action junkies who won't mind or notice the plot holes. Although they are as huge as the Grand Canyon, which also makes an appearance in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Based on a story by Phillip K. Dick (probably the most frequently adapted writer of the past thirty years), "Next" starts off with what would appear to be a can't-miss, sure-fire premise.  In yet another in what is fast becoming a long string of unchallenging roles, Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson, a Vegas magician with the uncanny ability to see two minutes into his own future.  So far, he's used this talent only as a part of his stage act and as a means of beating the house at gambling when he heads to the local casinos.  But now he's being asked by the FBI to employ his unique skill in helping to thwart a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in downtown Los Angeles.  Cris, however, wants nothing whatsoever to do with saving the world (for reasons that are never made entirely convincing for the audience), so he's off and running through the greater Southwest with both the feds and the bad guys hot on his trail.  It certainly doesn't help that, just on the face of it, this is probably one of the least necessary pursuits in movie history.<br /><br />"Next" might have been an interesting movie had the writers found a way to really make the time-bending premise believable and compelling, instead of just using it as an excuse to get everybody zipping around in fast-moving cars.  In addition, under Lee Tamahori's directorial aegis and with a screenplay concocted by no fewer than three (!) paid writers, we're treated to cardboard villains with sinister accents, chintzy production values and special effects, incoherently executed gun battle scenes, plot holes one can drive a mack truck through, and a plethora of predictable man-on-the-run, action movie cliches.  Even on a plot level, this gimmicky movie rarely plays fair with its audience, having Cris perform amazing feats that have little or nothing to do with his ability to read the future.  Then, in a final act of disrespect, the filmmakers tack on one of those ridiculous we-were-just-kidding-folks endings that is enough to turn a person off movies forever.<br /><br />In addition to Cage, the movie wastes the considerable talents of Julianne Moore, in yet another of her hysterical, over-the-top law enforcer roles (when is she planning on appearing in a good movie again?), and Jessica Biel, who is at least appealing as the unsuspecting girl Cris drags along on his utterly pointless tri-state spree.<br /><br />"Next" proves that, even for Nicholas Cage - who has hitherto done pretty well for himself with movies set in Sin City ("Leaving Las Vegas," "Honeymoon in Vegas") - Lady Luck won't always be smiling.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>Second-rate Las Vegas lounge magician Chris Johnson (Cage) has a little precognitive secret: he can see events up to two minutes in the future. Some generic nonamerican (of course!) terrorists have kidnapped a nuclear device and will blow things up with it (hey, they're terrorists with a bomb, right? What else would they do?!) unless joyless FBI bigwig Agent Ferris (Moore) can force Chris to use his gift to stop les bad guys. Oh, and there's some pretty female called Liz (Biel) in there too, just for good measure.<br /><br />This is a terribly boring, poorly-made movie. There's no reason or setup for the bad guys, or their theft of the bomb, no explanation whatsoever behind Chris Johnson's prowess in physical combat and no chemistry at all from any one of the principal actors. The standards of dialogue and direction present in "Next" are so below par that, essentially, it feels like there's a good thirty minutes of plot missing - and a bad thirty minutes too many of Nicolas Cage dashing about being Nicolas Cage.<br /><br />Perhaps I missed part of this movie (even though I watched it all) or perhaps it's a sequel to something better, some other film with the missing pieces to this (boring, frustrating) puzzle? But when talented actors such as Moore, Biel and yes, even Cage, are paraded so lazily in front of the audience with little or no substance behind their characters and a very sketchy plot, not even Star Quality or these A-List names can compensate for the lack of a decent basic plot.<br /><br />Gimmicky and base, this film isn't anywhere near as entertaining as the so-so National Treasure series. Don't bother with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is an awesome movie, again Nicholas Cage made another good movie, He's an awesome actor and i love all his films.

But despite that, sometimes we moviegoers don't find all the hidden gems until later in movies.<br /><br />This ain't one of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>I am a big Nick Cage fan.  And where better to enjoy him as an actor than in a film which he plays an eccentric character with otherworldly abilities?  To be more specific, Cage is cast in the role of a Vegas stage magician with a peculiar power: a gift that allows him to see a couple minutes into the future.  Sadly, or fortunately, depending on your point of view, Cage's character is not able to limit his options to enhancing his magic act.  By stepping in as a good Samaritan, however, his abilities are brought to the attention of federal authorities, who naturally seek to use them to enhance national security--a good example of the old adage "no good deed goes unpunished."  Julianne Moore plays the determined federal agent seeking to enlist him in her cause--whether he likes it or not!  At the same time, the life of Cage's magician is further complicated by the realization that a pretty girl he spots at a diner (played appealingly by Jessica Biel) seems to serve as a focus for his powers that may enable him to see much father into the future!</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>The plot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ8CQ">Next</a> is both simple and subtle. Chris Johnson (Nicholas Cage), a Los Vegas magician, can see 2 minutes into the future. A federal agent (Julianne Moore) forces him to use his abilities to find a group of terrorists with a nuclear bomb.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ8CQ">Next</a> is based on a Philip K. Dick story. Dick's works tended to be cerebral and explore the hidden consequences of odd plot twists, such as the ability to predict the future. This movie obviously doesn't get quite as thoughtful, but it does raise some of the issues, such whether Chris Johnson would merely become a tool of the government if he helped them find the bomb. However, I thought these moral dilemmas were resolved a bit too easily by suddenly allowing him to see further into the future.<br /><br />Overall, the movie combines action with a provocative plot twist. Nicholas Cage's acting is actually not bad in this movie. I didn't like Julianne Moore's character or the way she plays her. Her agent comes across as an annoying know-it-all. She somehow seems to know more than the rest of the FBI agents combined. Other than that, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGJ8CQ">Next</a> is an entertaining sci-fi flick, if not quite as thought-provoking as the story it was based on.</p></br></body></html>
